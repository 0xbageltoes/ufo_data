Description: Approximate date. A lawyer was surprised to see a lighted
object fly over. His horse was scared and nearly toppled the carriage.
When the main light was turned off, a number of smaller lights became
visible on the underside of the dark object, which supported an
elongated canopy. It went down toward a hill to the south, 5 km from
Aquila. When the witness was on his way back one hour later he saw the
object rising. It reached the altitude of the cloud ceiling and flew to

machine, about 2O m long, could be seen in the clearing. There was a
woman with an umbrella nearby. It was raining, and the younger of the

and suggested that the policemen fly with them “to a place where it does
not rain.” The same witness went back through the same spot 40 min later
and found nothing.<br />

the mountains of Donegal, he came upon a cave with vegetation at the
entrance that had been scorched. The only occupants in the cave were the
sick and the wounded that had been unable to walk. The six able-bodied
soldiers that were looking after them said they had been awakened early
pre-dawn by a whirring noise outside of the cave and had fired their
rifles in the direction of the noise, thinking that it was an armored
car. Suddenly the object retaliated by firing jets of flame at the cave
entrance. After near suffocation, the soldiers ran out to see the flame
throwing UFO ascending into the sky. Clearly visible, it was circular in
shape and glowing and of a shiny metal.<br />

Description: (Or following year.) Two persons saw a strange “frog-man” 1
m tall with a round head, no neck, and a hump in front of the body. The
mouth was a large, straight slit, the eyes were like smaller slits. The
skin was brown-green, compared to pegamoid, hands normal. The creature
walked in a peculiar “but elegant” fashion, the head waving up and down
while the legs moved “carefully.” When pursued, the creature accelerated
very fast, with feet “fluttering.” About 100 m away it vanished
completely’.<br />

Description: THEY FOLLOW THE LEADER - Mrs. A.M. Strickler, while out
walking between 9 and 10pm, sighted in the sky over the Susquehanna
Bridge, on Route 30, a string of highly illuminated objects which, she
says she can best describe as being similar to a train of passenger
coaches, seeming to weave in and out in a highly specialized
follow-the-leader pattern. Illumination seemed to emanate from an
endless string of portholes which were arranged on a straight line or
plane and were yellowish like an incandescent bulb. The objects were
cigar-shaped, but could have been one side of a flat, saucer-shaped
form. Each “coach” was identical in size and shape except the first,
which was larger, brighter and seemed to have a proboscis-shaped
appendage in front like a figure head. The objects traveled extremely
fast, emitting no noise, jet exhaust, or flame.<br />

former Navy man who is presently a radio technician for the Santa Fe
railroad, he related that sometime in 1943 while he was stationed at San
Diego and assigned to a gun crew on a naval destroyer they were alerted
to their stations. Shortly five saucers (such as those pictured by
George Adamski) appeared over the ship and hovered. Orders were given to
fire upon them. He asserted that they could see the tracers and shells
heading directly toward the saucers. The shells either exploded or
disintegrated before reaching the objects. This attack continued for 10
minutes but nothing affected them. At the approach of naval planes the
saucers disappeared.<br />

Description: First V-2 rocket attacks begin. Two launched at Paris.
V-2’s speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to
anti-aircraft guns and fighters, as it dropped from an altitude of
100–110 km (62–68 mi) at up to three times the speed of sound at sea
level (approximately 3550 km/h). The British government, concerned about
spreading panic or giving away vital intelligence to German forces,
initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by making no
official announcement, and euphemistically blaming them on defective gas
mains. The public did not believe this explanation and therefore began
referring to the V-2s as “flying gas mains”.<br />

Description: SKY OBJECT A MYSTERY ROCKET? - A laboratory analysis of the
cylindrical object which fell in Portland yesterday from a clear sky
established presence of aluminum, titanium, magnesium, calcium, chrome,
and zircon. Dr. John E. Allen, chief geologist of the Oregon department
of geology and mineral industries, said it gives reasonable basis for
the hypothesis that it could have been used in rocket construction.
Largest portion of the object has been taken over by an Army

<p>Date: 3/25/1948<br />
Description: Aztec area NM landing and retrieval incident near Hart
Canyon. UFO detected by 3 strategically located radars in the southwest,
including a powerful experimental radar in the Four Corners region. The
Army OSI and the IPU put on Red Alert and the ADC activated the local
military units when a UFO crashed in the vicinity of Aztec, NM. When the
saucer got into range of a Special High-Powered radar at the Four
Corners Range (Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado) it began to flutter
and wobble from side-to-side and took a trajectory towards the ground.
It seems that the beam from this special radar had an ill-effect on the
control system of the saucer. The 100 ft. saucer crash-landed on
Mr. H.D.’s (initials) property. H.D. and family were sworn to secrecy.
Note: This may have been the White Sands 1948 incident mentioned by
Virgil Armstrong.<br />

24, 1948, two commercial pilots, Clarence S. Chiles and John B. Whitted,
claimed to have observed a “glowing object” pass by their plane before
it appeared to pull up into a cloud and travel out of sight. The object
closed on their DC-3 in a matter of seconds, and both men later said
they saw the object fly past the right side of their plane at high speed
before it pulled “up with a tremendous burst of flame out of its rear
and zoomed up into the clouds.” They observed the object for a total of
ten to fifteen seconds. Chiles and Whitted stated that the object
“looked like a wingless aircraft…it seemed to have two rows of windows
through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium
flare.”<br />

security flight when he picked up a radar track on an UFO, two times.
Smith then radioed Kodiak radar station and was advised that no known
traffic was in his radar area. Moored south of Kodiak was the USS
Tillamook with Master Morgan standing on watch. Suddenly, at 3 a.m., “a
very fast moving red glow appeared to be of exhaust nature, seemed to
come from the south-east, moved clockwise in a large circle in the
direction of, and around Kodiak and returned out in a generally
south-east direction. The UFO was moving so fast that it was actually
leaving a streak on Smith’s radarscreen. It was estimated to be moving
at a speed of 1800 mph. Described as “two orange lights rotating about a
common center like two jet aircraft making slow rolls in tight
formation.” The UFO then made an abrupt turn and headed directly towards
Smiths’ aircraft in a threatening gesture so Smith quickly turned off
all of his lights turn make his plane less conspicuous in the inky
colored sky. The UFO flew by him and disappeared in the south-east in a
matter of minutes.<br />

Time: 1830<br />
Description: A rancher, Wilfredo H. Arevalo, saw two objects, one of
which landed. He walked within 150 m of the aluminum-looking craft which
gave off a greenish-blue vapor and “an intense smell of burning
benzine.” A large, flat section on top was revolving above a glass cabin
in which could be seen four tall men, dressed in something like
cellophane, working at various instruments. They saw him and shone a
light in his direction while a blue light illuminated the craft; the
vapor increased and flames (alternately reddish and greenish) shot out
of the base while the object rose with a faint hum. Both craft flew away
toward Chile, leaving bluish trails.<br />

Description: Joseph Matiszewski, a mechanic, heard a whistling sound and
saw an object land in a meadow. Approaching within 50 m, he found
himself paralyzed and observed that birds had stopped singing and cows
seemed to be similarly unable to move. From the object emerged four
handsome men who had brown skin and wore black shiny suits and
translucent helmets. Eight objects also emerged from the craft and
hovered above it. Other men inside the craft and on its deck appeared to
be making repairs, then the objects flew to about 100 m altitude and
climbed rapidly out of sight. Only then did the paralysis subside.<br />

blue light in the northwest sky. It vanished to the southeast. The
witness missed a turn, had to go back toward Auburn, and had reached a
point northwest of Peru when he saw an orange glow in the sky. Coming
near, he observed the glow came from a cauldron-shaped object on the
ground, about 12 m from the road. He stopped to examine the object,
which measured about 10 m diameter and seemed to be made of cast iron.
Thirty cm from the top was a row of windows, 25 cm in diameter, from
which the orange light was coming. On the other side was a blue
flamelike glow. There was no noise, no sign of life or activity, and no
antenna or protrusion. The witness drove away.<br />

Description: A man who was fishing in the Serchio River saw a disk

The object was 20 m in diameter, with five propellers in the rear and a
dome with something like blades on top. An orange glow could be seen
through slits along the deck. A man wearing a diving helmet looked at
the witness through a window, and he received a kind of electric shock
as a “green ray” hit him. He looked up with difficulty, in time to see
the object fly away toward the east. Six days later a stranger with a
foreign accent contacted the witness and intimidated him.<br />

Description: CIA analysis report of an Athens news article of an UFO
landing in Communist Berlin, Germany: Former Mayor of Gleimershausen,
Oscar Linke and his 11 year old daughter, Gabriella, spotted a landed
Flying Saucer near the town of Hasselbach. The huge “frying pan” was
approx. 13 to 15 meters in diameter and had two rows of holes on its
periphery, about 30 centimeters in circumference. The space between the
two rows was about 0.45 meters. On top was a black conical object about
3 meters high. Two men dressed in shiny metallic clothing were standing
outside the craft. Upon hearing my daughters voice the two men retreated
into the UFO which then began to rotate. As the UFO began to spin the
conical tower slid down into the UFO and the UFO began to rise and
rotate like a top. It seemed to be supported by the conical tower that
was now underneath it. (More details were included in report, see
02/23/55, See also the movie “Earth vs. the Flying Saucers”)<br />

Description: Mr. and Mrs. George Snitowski and their little girl
suddenly found their car stalled, and an unpleasant smell (ether mixed
with sulphurous smoke) filled the air. Mr. Snitowski thought a chemical
plant might be burning in the area and walked toward a strong light
visible in the woods, in spite of the nauseous smell. Coming near it, he
felt pricklings throughout his body, had to stop, lost his balance
several times as he returned to the carwhere he found his wife
terrified, pointing to a giant creature (3 m tall), human-shaped, 10 m
away. They locked the car as “it” inspected the vehicle, glided away and
went into the woods. Soon afterward, the sphere of light was observed to
rise gradually, to swing like a pendulum, and to leave a luminous
trail.<br />

Assistant Director of Scientific Intelligence: ATIC is the only group
devoting appreciable effort to the study of UFOs. Flying Saucers pose
two elements of danger to the United States. The first involves mass
psychological considerations and the second concerns vulnerability of
the U.S. to air attack. Recommend that the DCI discuss this subject with
the Psychological Strategy Board.<br />

copper in color. At the center of the bottom surface, 20 m in diameter,
was a cylinder of 5 m diameter made of rapidly rotating parts, producing
a noise similar to that of an electric motor. On the upper surface was a
turret inside which three occupants were visible, looking directly at
the witness. They looked perfectly human, wore rubber coveralls and
transparent face masks. They spoke a few words, which were not
understood; a loud metallic noise was heard; and the top part of the
object lowered itself toward the lower plate. The sound gained
intensity, and the craft flew vertically at very high speed.<br />

flying very slowly and low. It had a lighted red band around the middle
and was coming straight toward her house with an oscillating motion. She
still thought it was an aircraft of some new design when it stopped near
her, 25 m above ground. Then it flew backward over the water and
hovered, making the same noise as a swarm of bees. The top section
supported a series of red lights and a cabin with four portholes through
which a control panel was visible. No occupant was seen. The cabin rose
above the object, rotated, then glided back. The object tilted toward
the west and rose toward the southeast, disappearing within 3 sec at an
80 degree angle of climb after the 3-min sighting. Diameter: 30 m. Two
days later a yellowish moss was observed at the site.<br />

Description: Approximate date. An illiterate boy cowherd, Maximo Munos
Olivares, 14, saw a “big balloon” on the ground behind him when a faint
whistling attracted his attention. Shaped like a water jug, it was
metallic. Through an opening came three dwarfs 60 cm tall, with yellow
faces, narrow eyes, and oriental features. They spoke in a language he
could not understand. They were dressed in blue, had a sort of flat hat
with a visor in front and a metal sheet on their arms. One of them
smacked the boy’s face, then they reentered the machine, which glowed
very brightly, made a soft whistling sound and went off “like a rocket.”
Footprints and four holes 5 cm deep forming a perfect square 36 cm in
side were found by police.<br />

D.C.: An F-86 aircraft was observed in flight over the Oak Ridge
residential area by a writer and his wife. While observing the F-86
through 6 power field glasses an UFO, black in color, moved out of a
high white cloud directly over the area where the F-86 had been
circling. The UFO began circling at a tremendous speed for at least 5
minutes. It appeared at times to be cigar shaped and at other times to
be round in shape. No sound or visible means of propulsion was observed
from the UFO. It flew away at tremendous speed for 3 miles where it was
joined by 2 other UFOs into a ‘V’ formation and sped away.<br />

<p>Date: 12/1953<br />
Description: Mrs. Orfei heard a knock at the door in the middle of the
night and obtained no answer when she asked who it was. When more
furious knocks were heard, her Alsatian dog jumped toward the door, but
suddenly retreated, trembling as if terrified and retired to a corner.
Mrs. Orfei went to an upper door and saw two “indescribable” shadows go
away from the house. A while later a big, round object took off 100 m
away with a blue-green lightning. The police found broken bushes as
evidence of an enormous weight.<br />

Description: CIA Evaluation of the UFO situation: It was pleased to note
that the number of sightings had decreased dramatically, due, it
believed, to the success of its’ implemented policies. Some sightings
still would have “possible scientific intelligence value”. The CIA
concluded that the panel’s (name?) recommendations might have been
interpreted by saucer believers as “debunking”.<br />

Description: Salisbury Plain, England: Flight Lt. C.G. Townsend- Withers
was flying an experimental Canberra aircraft at 55,000 ft. when he
picked up on the new experimental radar an UFO following his plane. The
science officer went up to the turret for a visual and spotted a
circular craft five miles behind them. They tried to outpace the UFO by
accelerating to 225 knots but it kept up with their plane.
Townsend-Withers initiated a wide sweeping turn and lost radar contact
with the UFO but came into direct visual on a collision course with the
UFO. Then the UFO flipped vertically in the air and climbed from 50 to
70 thousand feet, as quickly as you could say it. Description: Round,
thin disc with two tail fins at the rear, appearing metallic and
enormous. Leaving no vapor trail, wake or detectable sound, it vanished
within a couple of seconds up into the blue sky.<br />

began in 1954 as a joint U.S. Army and U.S. Navy proposal, called
Project Orbiter, to put a scientific satellite into orbit during the
International Geophysical Year. The proposal, using a military Redstone
missile, was rejected in 1955 by the Eisenhower administration in favor
of the Navy’s Project Vanguard, using a booster advertised as more
civilian in nature. Following the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik
1 on 4 October 1957, the initial Project Orbiter program was revived as
the Explorer program to catch up with the Soviet Union.”<br />

Description: Guy Puyfourcat, 22, who was coming back from the fields,
leading a mare by the bridle, was surprised when the animal became
restless. Rising from the side of the road, a gray object about 1.5 m in
diameter flew over them. The mare rose about 3 m in the air, and the

but it was still trembling and stumbling with fear. The object had long
since flown away at high speed. The witness himself had felt absolutely
nothing.<br />

Ujvari spoke to him in Russian, the man answered in the same language,
asked whether he was in Spain or Italy, and how far he was from Germany.
When he asked the time, Ujvari said: “2:30.” The man took his watch and
said “You lie; it’s 4:00.” Then he wanted to know how far and in what
direction Marseilles was. He made Ujvari walk on the road with him, and
they came close to a gray craft with an antenna on top. When he was
about 200 m away, he heard a soft whistling sound and saw it fly
straight up, then take an oblique trajectory.<br />

Description: Broadlands Archives Record: Sworn statement by Lord
Mountbatten and Frederick Briggs describing a Saucer that landed on Lord
Mountbattens property. It was shaped like a child’s humming top, between
10 to 30 ft. diameter. Looked like kitchen saucepan. Had cylindrical
column about the size of a man descending from the center. Had portholes
all around the middle, like a steamer boat. I noticed a man standing on
the end of the central column. He was dressed in a dark suit of
overalls, and wearing a close fitting hat or helmet. As the Saucer
powered up a bright blue light came from one of the portholes (like a
mercury-vapor lamp). A force knocked me over. The Flying Saucer
proceeded to rise and retract the central column. (See movie ”Earth
vs. the F.S.”)<br />

Description: Approximate date. Three farmers, among them Thomas
Robinson, saw a light growing in size for 2 min and flying between them
and Mt. Williams. Looking like a “light airplane on fire,” it changed
course, losing altitude and trailing flames. It touched the ground,
lighting up the whole area, rose again, and began to “feel its way along
the crooked edge of the cane field and the swamp toward our house.” It
returned to earth four times. The dogs ran out barking as it landed
within 100 m of the witnesses before taking off again.<br />

“a red light in the sky shot at him. This UFO had no wings, fins or
propulsion sounds, except for the sound of “escaping steam”. It was
about 60 to 100 ft. in diam. and cigar shaped. The UFO gave him “the
greatest shock of my life”. There was a nauseating smell like sulfur and
brimstone. He lost the sense of taste and smell and couldn’t swallow
properly. He collapsed on the ground and was unable to move for half an
hour, after which he managed to drive to his home and call for aid. Six
weeks later, a New Jersey workmen’s compensation referee decided that
Sturdevant should be paid for medical expenses incurred for the injury
done by the UFO.<br />

Description: When his motorcycle suddenly failed, the driver observed a
disk, 2O m in diameter and 5 m thick, hovering about 15 m above ground.
He hid in a ditch and saw the craft come down, making a sound similar to
air escaping from a valve. A sort of lift descended from its base almost
to the ground. In it was a man of average height, who made friendly
gestures to the witness. He was dressed in a plastic diving suit. The
witness entered the machine and saw inside several people seated before
instrument panels, lighted by an extraordinary light. He was then
escorted out, and the disk rose to the northwest. During the next hour,
six sightings were made along the same course by independent
witnesses.<br />

their wives. The craft was luminous, pulsating between red and white
(remaining red longer). When white, it was more blinding than a powerful
searchlight. It was 50 m away from the group of witnesses. Occupants
were about 1.30 m tall with a beige-gray body, an abnormally large black
head, and a waddling gait. The object flew away when a car came into

Description: International Geophysical Year (IGY). It marked the end of
a long period during the Cold War when scientific interchange between
East and West had been seriously interrupted. Sixty-seven countries
participated in IGY projects. The IGY encompassed eleven Earth sciences:
aurora and airglow, cosmic rays, geomagnetism, gravity, ionospheric
physics, longitude and latitude determinations (precision mapping),
meteorology, oceanography, seismology, and solar activity. The timing of
the IGY was particularly suited for studying some of these phenomena,
since it covered the peak of solar cycle 19. Both the Soviet Union and
the U.S. launched artificial satellites for this event; the Soviet
Union’s <em>Sputnik 1</em>, launched on October 4, 1957, was the first
successful artificial satellite.[3] Other significant achievements of
the IGY included the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts by
Explorer 1 and the defining of mid-ocean submarine ridges, an important
confirmation of plate-tectonic theory.<br />

hat-shaped, luminous craft approach from the sea and land near him. From
it came a metallic stairway. Two normal men with long, fair hair hanging
to their shoulders, a youthful appearance and wearing one-piece suits,
came down, gave no verbal answers to his questions, but invited him
“telepathically” to come aboard the craft. Inside the illuminated
compartment, he sat on a circular seat with the crew. The machine rose
for a short flight. On his return, Guimaraes found that his watch no
longer worked. (Humanoids 36; FSR 57, 6<br />

<p>Date: 10/10/1957<br />
Description: Mrs. Edward Yeager who lived in a trailer on the
Duanesburg-Church Road near Mariaville, saw a circular object go down
behind the hill. Two min later it flew up again, very bright. The next
day she was feeding animals that ran away as the same or a similar
object came within 2 m of the ground. Two dark, little men came out of
the craft and went into the woods. The object remained there two min,
then left. A search for the occupants proved futile. A bus driver was
said to have seen two craft land in a nearby field at the same
hour.<br />

Description: Naval officer Miguel Espanhol and another man, traveling to
Ceres, saw a bright object that illuminated the countryside and came
down to ground level as the truck stalled. It was oval or saucer-shaped,
over 150 m in diameter and 40 m deep, with a dome supporting a long
“aerial” with a red light on top. The bright light went off and the
witnesses saw seven childlike beings, with long hair and luminous suits,
who looked down at them for about 3 min. The craft flew south and
released a smaller disk, which flew north.<br />

Description: Third observation by A. Villas-Boas. Alone in the fields on
a clear night, he saw a big, red star which took the appearance of a
luminous, egg-shaped object and stopped 50 m above his tractor. Its
light was brighter than that of the headlights as it landed 15 m away.
The top part was spinning. It became green as it slowed down, was then
seen as a flattened dome. Three legs emerged from the machine as it
settled down. The tractor engine stalled, and the witness was seized by
unknown individuals and carried aboard the craft, where he was medically
examined, then left with a woman of short stature with whom he had
sexual intercourse. Villas-Boas reported that crew members wore tight,
white clothes with a light on the belt, heelless white shoes, big
gloves, and opaque helmets with a slit at the level of the eyes. Their
language was shrill, and he could establish no verbal communication with
them.<br />

Description: A girl suffering from cancer appeared about to die when the
house was suddenly illuminated by a strong light, as if a searchlight
had been aimed at the room. It came from an object whose top part was
reddish yellow. Two figures emerged from it and entered the house. They
were about 1.20 m tall, had long yellow-red hair, small green, slanted
eyes, and wore white gloves and glowing white clothes. Before the
astounded witnesses (the author of the report and the family of the
girl), they used a device producing a bluish-white light and another
instument, in what appeared to be radiation treatment of the patient.
After 30 min they went away, leaving her completely cured. The report
was anonymous.<br />

Description: Haskell Raper, Jr., was driving home on a rainy night when
he saw a large, lighted object on the road ahead, which he thought was a
truck. Suddenly the object flashed a beam of light directly at the car,
apparently exerting a strong pressure and slowing it to a stop 5 m away.
The object was then described as oval, 5 m long, 3 m high, army green in
color. It bore lettering beginning with the letters UN, followed by some
numbers. A sort of heat wave filled the car, and the witness ran out in
panic as the vehicle caught fire. The object rose with the sound of a
diesel engine. Raper ran to the town, less than 2 km away; and reported
the incident. The car, a 1956 Ford, was completely destroyed.<br />

<p>Date: 11/2/1957<br />
Description: Multiple landings on roadways, E-M (electro-magnetic)
effects, etc. Sheriff Weir Clem was sent out to search the roads as a
result of earlier UFO reports and saw a reddish oval crossing the road
and illuminating the pavement. Ronald Martin saw an UFO land in front of
his truck and turn from red to bluish-green at which time the truck’s
electrical system failed. It then turned reddish again and took off.
Within the next few hours an Army Jeep Patrol at White Sands, N.M.,
reported an egg-shaped UFO that descended to about 50 yards above a
bunker used during the first A-bomb explosion. This wave of sightings
continued for 2–3 weeks. After retirement in 1975, Sheriff W. Clem gave
a more graphic description of the UFO he saw: “The object was shaped
like a huge football and had bright white lights. No living human could
believe how fast it traveled. The thing was as bright as day. It lit up
the whole area.” In an interview in 1977, Sheriff Clem said, “After the
publicity of UFOs over the next few days, the number of witnesses to
them rose to about a hundred people.”<br />

Description: Between Woodward and Seiling, 12 km from the latter, an
unknown flying object allegedly took complete control of a car with
three passengers. The driver, an employee of an aircraft company, had
turned the heater, windshield wiper, and radio on. He was nearing a hill
in this wooded area when a bright light appeared ahead. It reminded the
witness of the light from a mercury lamp. As a crash seemed imminent,
the car slowed down by itself and stopped, as if the entire electrical
circuit had failed. Over the vehicle was a disk 16 m in diameter with
portholes around the periphery, emitting a current of hot air and a
high-pitched sound. It had a dome on top and bottom. It rose as the car
started by itself. The car was a 1954 Dodge Coronet without automatic
transmission. The witness spent four hours with two Kirtland AFB
officers who told him of similar observations. The case was never
reported to Blue Book.<br />

experience correlated with the observation of the luminous object. Irwin
deserted, and his subsequent whereabouts are unknown.<br />

Description: An Air Force C-118 transport plane with four passengers
suddenly radioed in ”MAYDAY, we’ve been hit!” Col. R.E. Booth told
reporters that a mid-air collision had taken place at 8:19 p.m. APRG
(Aerial Phenomena Research Group) investigators determined that from
7:00 p.m. on through the early evening several mysterious aerial
explosions had shaken the Seattle, WA, area. Several residents had
reported seeing mysterious UFOs from 20 miles north of the crash scene
to about 8 miles southeast of it. These sightings were confirmed by the
Orting Chief of Police and by Public Information Officer at Mc Chord
AFB. Several persons told APRG investigator, R. Gribble, that as the
C-118 passed over their area it was followed by 2 parachute-shaped
objects and that the C-118 was missing its tail assembly. Mr. and
Mrs. Bill Jones reported 3 or 4 parachute-shaped UFOs following the
C-118 as it passed over their home. Chief of Police, Fred Emard, told R.
Gribble that he would be glad to furnish information on the UFOs to
APRG, but changed his mind the next day after an interview with an Air
Force Colonel. “The Chief and other officials of Orting had been
silenced,” Gribble reported.<br />

<p>Date: 9/29/1959<br />
Description: Maj. R.O. Braswell, while flying an C-47 at 6500 ft. alt.,
spotted an UFO. “It was colored like a large red fire and looked like an
atomic cloud”, he stated. At about 5 degrees above my plane it appeared
massive and was at about 13000 ft. alt. The UFO appeared to be about
1000 ft. thick (top to bottom). Billie Guyton of Centerville, TX, also
observed the UFO and said that he observed a smaller UFO emerge from it.
Another ground observer, Jackie J. Cox, schoolteacher, saw a “bright
light in the sky that spread to cover the entire sky.” W.S. Webb of
Buffalo, N.Y., glanced out his bedroom window and saw a ball of fire
shooting through the sky, after which he heard a noise, as if something
was falling from the sky. The next day Braniff Airways Flight 542,
carrying 28 passengers and 6 crew members, was found shredded in a
thousand pieces. Subsequent inquiry found that there had been no fire or
explosion aboard the jet before or after the crash and that scorch marks
found on the exterior windows, fuselage and parted tail section showed
signs of having been exposed to tremendous exterior heat. Also the force
causing the plane to come down did not come from within the plane. Radar
Operator, E.H. Tindale, later told investigators that he had plotted an
UFO twice on the night Flight 542 crashed. Both plots of the UFO were in
the area where the wreckage of the airliner was found. The UFO was
stationary both times it was tracked.<br />

<p>Date: 5/1961<br />
Description: In the May issue of “Fate” magazine, Master Sgt. O.D. Hill
admits that we are still losing Air Force planes to UFOs. The first case
was an F-86 jet fighter that was sent aloft to investigate an UFO that
had been plotted on the Radar scope of an Air Base (name and dates
classified). The Radar Operator spied the UFO heading straight for the
craft. The operator radioed for the F-86 to climb at once, but it was
too late. The two blips merged as one and the UFO was tracked moving
away. Classified as “mysterious” not a single shred of the F-86 was ever
found. (ref. Kinross AFB where an F-89 with crew of two merged with an
UFO and disappeared.-Donald Keyhoe) Second Case: A radar operator was
tracking a transport plane carrying 26 persons aboard when, suddenly,
another blip appeared on the screen closing at 2500 mph on the
transport. Before the operator could warn the transport the two blips
emerged as one. The remaining blip sped straight up at tremendous speed.
A surface search in the vicinity revealed no oil slicks on the water,
although a Generals’ briefcase was found floating around.<br />

hovering 2 m above ground, a few meters from the house. One was black
with an antenna-like protrusion and a small tail; the other was black
and white. Both emitted a humming sound and a flickering fire through an
opening. The boy’s father warned him to stay away as Rivalino walked
toward the objects, praying. When he was 2 m away, the two spheres
merged into one, raising dust from the ground and spreading a yellow
mist that enveloped the man. The boy ran after his father, noting that
the cloud had “an acrid smell.” As it dissolved, everything had
vanished. Police investigation, headed by Lieutenant Lisboa, failed to
reveal any clue. Many terrified people left the area.<br />

Description: A hunter, who had lost his way in the mountains, observed
approaching lights that seemed to land. From a vantage point in a tree,
he saw a dome-shaped object at ground level, about 500 m away. Several
creatures, one of them a robotlike figure with “eyes” about 10 cm in
diameter, came near, apparently trying to dislodge the witness from his
tree. The creatures appeared to fear the light from flaming objects
thrown at them. The witness fell asleep after an exhausting series of
attempts to keep the creatures away. At dawn there was nothing to be
seen.<br />

Description: In the Everglades, 30 km east of Big Cypress, James Flynn,
45, who was hunting, saw a huge, lighted object 1 m above the swamp
surface. He watched it for 40 min, observing that it was conical, twice
as wide as it was high, and seemed built from metal sections over one
square m each. It showed four rows of square windows, 70 cm wide.
Estimated diameter: 25 m. A yellow light shone through the windows, and
the object made a sound of a transformer and wind. Flynn got within 2 m
of it and made a gesture. A beam of light from the underside of the
object struck him between the eyes and he lost consciousness for 24
hours. He had lost vision in the right eye, saw poorly with the left,
went to a doctor in Fort Myers, and spent five days in the
hospital.<br />

Description: A 37-year-old civilian had just put his car in the garage
when he saw an object about 100 m in diameter, shaped like a disk, which
flew in front of the moon in a northerly direction at about 80 km/h. It
was surrounded with orange lights that weakened as a blue source came
on, very intense for about 3 sec then all lights disappeared as the
object was about 700 m away. This was followed by a sort of “shock-wave”
effect, and tree leaves were shaken. The witness entered his house and
called the Air Force. Twenty minutes later his vision became hazy and
his eyes were painful. He gradually lost vision in both eyes, and his
entire body was “sunburned.” Medical examination compared the symptoms
to ultraviolet exposure. His vision came back gradually over a period of
several days.<br />

Time: 1820<br />
Description: Four students working on a farm noted radio interference
and a peculiar “beeping sound,” then saw an object at low altitude on
the farm of William Butcher. It was shaped like two saucers glued
together, had a shiny chromelike surface, diameter of 15 m, height of 6
m, and left a trail and smell of burned gasoline. It rose straight up
into the clouds, which were illuminated with green light. Five min later
it came down again over a woods, rose, and finally flew off to the
southwest. Effects were noted on animals: milk production decreased from
2 1/2 barrels to one; a dog barked, and other animals were
terrified.<br />

Description: Two Angleton sheriffs, McCoy and Robert Goode saw from
their car a huge object 70 m long, 15 m high, with a bright, violet
light at one end and a pale-blue light at the other. They stopped to
watch it and saw the craft fly within 30 m, casting a huge shadow when
it intercepted the moonlight. They felt a heat wave and drove away in
fear, but returned to the site a second time, only to turn around when
they found the object was still there. Goode had been bitten by an
animal before the sighting, and his left index finger swelled and bled
freely. After exposure to the light from the object, the pain was gone,
and the wound cured unnaturally. Later that evening, two men found him
at a restaurant and described the object in detail, adding he should
keep future encounters to himself.<br />

Description: A civilian man, 40, saw an object resting on the ground as
he was going to work, less than 2 km southeast of Hague. It was an
elongated craft, 2 m long, 70 cm high. When he tried to touch it, the
craft left at great speed toward the west. It had six openings, 10 cm in
diameter, and made a “turbine” noise so loud that the witness had to put
his hands over his ears. After going away for a few meters, it vanished
suddenly. Rain was falling throughout the observation, which lasted four
min.<br />

and Wilbur Neff of Portage Countywere on patrol when an UFO stopped
above them, illuminating them and the surroundings (it was just about
dawn). As the UFO moved away from them at about 300–500 ft. above the
road, it would alternately start and stop ahead of them playing cat and
mouse. At E. Palestine, OH, officer Wayne Huston joined in the pursuit.
At speeds of 100 mph in unfamiliar territory, they were soon low on gas
and had to give up the game with the UFO. Through local police dispatch
the officers alerted the Air Force, who sent out fighter planes to
investigate the UFO. As the officers saw the AF planes approaching the
UFO shot straight up and out of sight.<br />

Description: A civilian man, 32, driving to work in his 1964 Chevy
truck, had to stop and inspect the vehicle when its engine stalled. Only
then did he observe an intense light to his right, coming closer. He saw
it land on the road, and locked himself inside the cabin. The craft
settled on a tripod landing gear; it measured 25 m in diameter and was
10 m high. Something similar to an elevator came down from it, and a man
dressed in blue coveralls “with something like a glass fishbowl on his
head,” of medium height, seemed to check something and left.<br />

Description: Near Atlanta, Missouri: The City Marshall and Mail Carrier
in Elmer, Missouri, William R. Overstreet observed an UFO at early dawn
over the road ahead of him. It was about 100 ft. in diam. apparently
rotating clockwise and emitting a strong white beam of light down to the
road which seemed to magnify the size of theroad it was shining on. He
felt intense heat from the direction of the UFO and his CB radio was
dead. As heneared the light beam from the UFO his truck motor and radio
quit. As the beam moved away from his truck he was able to start the
engine again. He followed the UFO for about 4 mi. staying away from the
beam. The UFO followed the contour of the land it was flying over. After
7–8 min. the UFO veered away and went out of sight. “I had never
believed in them too much until I saw this,” he said. “Now I know that
there is something to these UFOs!”<br />

Description: Project SNOWBIRD established to test fly a captured flying
saucer. This was an alleged ongoing 1972 Top Secret project that
researched, developed and implemented alien spacecraft technology and
test flown recovered UFOs. It is possible that the UFO involved in the
CASH/LANDRUM CASE was built by the Americans as part of this project,
however another “Project Snowbird” has been found described as a “Joint
Army/Air Force peacetime military exercise in the sub-arctic region in
1955” in the 1963 Gale Research’s Code Names Dictionary. Project
SNOWBIRD is another project that was revealed in the Project AQUARIUS

<p>Date: 8/13/1975<br />
Description: Near Haderslev, Denmark: Police Officer Evald Hansen Maarup
was driving home at 10:50 p.m. when all of a sudden his car was engulfed
by a bright blue light while at the same time his car lost all power.
The temperature in his car rose to that of a warm summer day and his
radio was dead so he couldn’t call for help. The bright beam from the
UFO was conical in shape with a bottom diam. of 4–5 meters and a top
diam. at the UFO of 10 meters. Two dome-like protrusions were visible on
the underside of the UFO that was hovering at about 20 meters altitude.
He activated a special camera on the patrol car which automatically took
3 pictures of the UFO. As the UFO sped away he regained power to his
car. The developed film which was later turned over to the Danish AF
showed the light source of the UFO on it. No report or analysis has been
available from the AF to date.<br />

Description: Staff Sgt. Charles L. Moody, USAF, drove out to the
outskirts of town late one night to watch for meteors. As a disc-shaped
UFO descended toward him, he tried to start his car to get away but it
wouldn’t start. He heard a high pitched whining sound from the UFO and
saw shadowy figures in it and felt numbness, after which the UFO
departed. After driving home he found he couldn’t account for 1.5 hours.
The next day his back was inflamed and he discovered a small puncture
wound over his spine and a few days later he developed a body rash. As
months passed he regained memory of the missing 1.5 hours. He remembered
that he had been in the UFO and in telepathic communication with small
4’8” humanoids. They had whitish gray skin, large heads, large eyes,
small slit-like mouths and mask-like features. He had been in a
drug-like state on a table and they had poked a rod like device into his
back. After this they escorted him about the ship and later dropped him
off at his car.<br />

Description: The Loring AFB incidents are extremely well documented,
both in terms of personal testimonials and declassified CIA and National
Military Command Center (NMCC) documents. Retired Sgt. Stephen B.
Eichner was on duty when a strange object hovered over the Loring
ammunition dump. Eichner told how he and fellow airmen had seen a
football-shaped reddish orange object, three or four car-lengths long,
hovering over the Loring ammunition dump. He said the object suddenly
vanished, then reappeared some distance away at the end of a runway.
Numerous other visual and radar sightings were made at Loring. Air Force
planes were scrambled in a luckless attempt to track down the object.
Eichner said it made no noise and could not be mistaken for a
helicopter.<br />

Description: Tehran, Iran: Civilians reported an UFO to the AFB. The
Iranian AF scrambled an American F-4 for intercept. As the F-4 was
vectored towards the brilliant UFO, all communications and
instrumentation were suddenly lost. As the pilot broke off pursuit, all
aircraft functions returned to normal. A second F-4 that was scrambled
began closing in on the UFO at greater than Mach 1 and was closing on
the UFO at 150 nautical mph., but the UFO accelerated and stayed ahead
of the F-4 (confirmed by Radar). Multi-colored flashing lights were
visible on the UFO. The moment the F-4 pilot tried to lock an AIM-9
missile at the UFO he lost all weapons panel and communication control.
The UFO launched two smaller UFOs, one of which began to follow the F-4.
After evasive action by the F-4, the smaller UFO returned and united
with the larger UFO. The other smaller UFO seemed to have landed on the
ground so the pilot flew down to investigate it. The landed UFO appeared
to be 12feet in diameter. As the pilot descended the light from the
landed UFO went out and he lost sight of it. The DIA termed this
sighting as “an outstanding report. This case is a classic which meets
all the criteria necessary for a study of a UFO phenomenon.” And, “an
inordinate amount of maneuverability was displayed by the UFOs.”<br />

Description: Area-51 workers and widows said that throughout the 1980s
the Air Force and its contractors regularly filled 55-gallon drums with
toxic wastes, emptied them into football-field size trenches, doused
them with jet-fuel and burned them. They claimed that the U.S. Air Force
generated and mishandled hazardous substances, and that the
Environmental Protection Agency failed to take necessary action to
enforce the requirements of the resource conservation act against the
Air Force.<br />

Description: Investigator Paul Bennewitz was sending regular reports to
the APRO and contacted US Senator Harrison Schmidt and Senator Peter
Domenici, as well as other UFO investigators such as Linda Moulton Howe
and John Lear. By 1982, APRO had decided to investigate Bennewitz’s
claims. They sent William Moore, one of their directors and a former
schoolteacher turned writer and ufologist, to talk to Bennewitz. Bill
Moore later stated in a public confession that he was recruited by
someone with the code name Falcon to lead Paul Bennewitz astray by
giving him false information. He claimed that he was given his orders by
AFOSI agents (believed to be Richard Doty and Steve Atwater), and that
for four years, he was asked to feed disinformation, including the
forged “Aquarius Document” to Bennewitz. This disinformation included
“verification” of Bennewitz’s beliefs about the “grays” and the
underground base at Dulce. Bennewitz had to be hospitalized for
“exhaustion”. He later died on June 23, 2003.<br />

altitude of 900–1000 ft. Two other officers, alerted by radio, also
observed the UFO. The other two cars gave pursuit to the UFO at speeds
of between 60–65 mph but the UFO outdistanced them. A few minutes later
another UFO was noted by the commander and then the other two officers.
It was a diffuse “domed disc” which was seen to emit a beam of light
towards the ground. The UFO then disappeared behind the tree line of a
forest preserve. The police report includes a tape recording of the
radio communications during the sighting.<br />

Description: Near Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Between 9:00 to
12 midnight the Brazilian Air Defense and the Civil Air System were
swamped with Radar and pilot UFO sightings. As Ospires Silva, President
of Petrobras Oil Company were preparing to land, the control tower
informed him of UFO targets on their radar. He and his companion, Alcir
Pereira da Silva, saw bright red-orange UFOs, not at all like stars or
planes. They attempted to pursue the UFOs for 30 min. but gave up as the
UFOs seemed to be jumping from place to place. At this time three F-5E
fighter jets were scrambled from Santa Cruz AFB. Capt. Marcio Jordao was
able to approach within 12 miles of an UFO, visible to him as a bright
light changing from white to green. Lt. Kleber Caldas Marinho chased
another UFO which was a very intense light, changing from white to green
then red again. Both pilots broke off chase as they were running low on
fuel. Ground Radar picked up 10–13 more UFOs that surrounded another
plane with Capt. Armindo Souza Viriato de Marinho, K.C. Freitas piloting
it. Capt. Freitas tracked the UFOs on his radar, but only de Freitas,
A.S.V. saw them visually once as they climbed vertically past him. Brig.
Gen. Octavio Moreira Lima made these events public at a press conference
and allowed the pilots and radar operators to be questioned by the
media.<br />

Description: Japan Airlines flight #1628, a Boeing 747 freighter, was
cruising at 35000 ft. altitude and at 5:11 p.m. the pilots noticed
bright lights 30 degrees to the left and below them. The UFOs moved up
directly in front of the 747 and, said Capt. Kenju Terauchi, “most
unexpectedly, two spaceships stopped in front of our face, shooting off
lights (like numerous exhaust pipes). The inside cockpit shined brightly
and I felt warm in the face.” The UFOs appeared as two rectangular
clusters or arrays of light, one above the other. As the larger UFOs
moved away from the 747 Airlines Flight 1628 there remained two smaller
flat white UFOs. At about 5:30 p.m. Capt. Terauchi checked the pale
white light behind their craft visually. He saw a gigantic
“walnut-shaped” UFO (Saturn-shaped) following them. As an evasive action
the Capt. ordered the 747 to turn away from the giant UFO that was
following them, at which time the UFO “spaceship” disappeared.<br />

Description: CBS News: “Hundreds more UFO sightings included in latest
report”. “On Thursday, the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence released an unclassified version of its annual report on
UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).
The office tracking reports of UFOs has added nearly 400 additional
sightings to its catalog over the last year, either because of new
sightings or older sightings discovered in existing files, bringing the
total number of UFO sightings to over 500. The assessment revealed that
the office tracking UAPs has had a total of 510 sightings since 2004.
This is significantly up from the 144 sightings included in the initial
report in 2021. Department of Defense has determined that about half of
the additional sightings displayed “unremarkable characteristics.” A
U.S. official told CBS News that none of the incidents have yet been
definitively linked to China, Russia or any other country.”<br />
