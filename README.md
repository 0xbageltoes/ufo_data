## Event 79
Date: 9/7/1944  
Type: aerospace  
Description: First V-2 rocket attacks begin. Two launched at Paris. V-2’s speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns and fighters, as it dropped from an altitude of 100–110 km (62–68 mi) at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 3550 km/h). The British government, concerned about spreading panic or giving away vital intelligence to German forces, initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by making no official announcement, and euphemistically blaming them on defective gas mains. The public did not believe this explanation and therefore began referring to the V-2s as “flying gas mains”.

## Event 301
Date: 3/25/1948  
Type: crash retrieval  
Description: Aztec area NM landing and retrieval incident near Hart Canyon. UFO detected by 3 strategically located radars in the southwest, including a powerful experimental radar in the Four Corners region. The Army OSI and the IPU put on Red Alert and the ADC activated the local military units when a UFO crashed in the vicinity of Aztec, NM. When the saucer got into range of a Special High-Powered radar at the Four Corners Range (Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado) it began to flutter and wobble from side-to-side and took a trajectory towards the ground. It seems that the beam from this special radar had an ill-effect on the control system of the saucer. The 100 ft. saucer crash-landed on Mr. H.D.’s (initials) property. H.D. and family were sworn to secrecy. Note: This may have been the White Sands 1948 incident mentioned by Virgil Armstrong.

Type: ufo sighting  
Description: Salisbury Plain, England: Flight Lt. C.G. Townsend- Withers was flying an experimental Canberra aircraft at 55,000 ft. when he picked up on the new experimental radar an UFO following his plane. The science officer went up to the turret for a visual and spotted a circular craft five miles behind them. They tried to outpace the UFO by accelerating to 225 knots but it kept up with their plane. Townsend-Withers initiated a wide sweeping turn and lost radar contact with the UFO but came into direct visual on a collision course with the UFO. Then the UFO flipped vertically in the air and climbed from 50 to 70 thousand feet, as quickly as you could say it. Description: Round, thin disc with two tail fins at the rear, appearing metallic and enormous. Leaving no vapor trail, wake or detectable sound, it vanished within a couple of seconds up into the blue sky.

The proposal, using a military Redstone missile, was rejected in 1955 by the Eisenhower administration in favor of the Navy’s Project Vanguard, using a booster advertised as more civilian in nature. Following the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957, the initial Project Orbiter program was revived as the Explorer program to catch up with the Soviet Union.”

## Event 560
Date: 7/1/1957  
Type: historical event  
Description: International Geophysical Year (IGY). It marked the end of a long period during the Cold War when scientific interchange between East and West had been seriously interrupted. Sixty-seven countries participated in IGY projects. The IGY encompassed eleven Earth sciences: aurora and airglow, cosmic rays, geomagnetism, gravity, ionospheric physics, longitude and latitude determinations (precision mapping), meteorology, oceanography, seismology, and solar activity. The timing of the IGY was particularly suited for studying some of these phenomena, since it covered the peak of solar cycle 19. Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. launched artificial satellites for this event; the Soviet Union’s _Sputnik 1_, launched on October 4, 1957, was the first successful artificial satellite.[3] Other significant achievements of the IGY included the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts by Explorer 1 and the defining of mid-ocean submarine ridges, an important confirmation of plate-tectonic theory.

This wave of sightings continued for 2–3 weeks. After retirement in 1975, Sheriff W. Clem gave a more graphic description of the UFO he saw: “The object was shaped like a huge football and had bright white lights. No living human could believe how fast it traveled. The thing was as bright as day. It lit up the whole area.” In an interview in 1977, Sheriff Clem said, “After the publicity of UFOs over the next few days, the number of witnesses to them rose to about a hundred people.”

Booth told reporters that a mid-air collision had taken place at 8:19 p.m. APRG (Aerial Phenomena Research Group) investigators determined that from 7:00 p.m. on through the early evening several mysterious aerial explosions had shaken the Seattle, WA, area. Several residents had reported seeing mysterious UFOs from 20 miles north of the crash scene to about 8 miles southeast of it. These sightings were confirmed by the Orting Chief of Police and by Public Information Officer at Mc Chord AFB. Several persons told APRG investigator, R. Gribble, that as the C-118 passed over their area it was followed by 2 parachute-shaped objects and that the C-118 was missing its tail assembly. Mr. and Mrs. Bill Jones reported 3 or 4 parachute-shaped UFOs following the C-118 as it passed over their home. Chief of Police, Fred Emard, told R. Gribble that he would be glad to furnish information on the UFOs to APRG, but changed his mind the next day after an interview with an Air Force Colonel. “The Chief and other officials of Orting had been silenced,” Gribble reported.

## Event 582

Type: ufo midair collision  
Description: Maj. R.O. Braswell, while flying an C-47 at 6500 ft. alt., spotted an UFO. “It was colored like a large red fire and looked like an atomic cloud”, he stated. At about 5 degrees above my plane it appeared massive and was at about 13000 ft. alt. The UFO appeared to be about 1000 ft. thick (top to bottom). Billie Guyton of Centerville, TX, also observed the UFO and said that he observed a smaller UFO emerge from it. Another ground observer, Jackie J. Cox, schoolteacher, saw a “bright light in the sky that spread to cover the entire sky.” W.S. Webb of Buffalo, N.Y., glanced out his bedroom window and saw a ball of fire shooting through the sky, after which he heard a noise, as if something was falling from the sky. The next day Braniff Airways Flight 542, carrying 28 passengers and 6 crew members, was found shredded in a thousand pieces. Subsequent inquiry found that there had been no fire or explosion aboard the jet before or after the crash and that scorch marks found on the exterior windows, fuselage and parted tail section showed signs of having been exposed to tremendous exterior heat. Also the force causing the plane to come down did not come from within the plane. Radar Operator, E.H. Tindale, later told investigators that he had plotted an UFO twice on the night Flight 542 crashed. Both plots of the UFO were in the area where the wreckage of the airliner was found. The UFO was stationary both times it was tracked.

The first case was an F-86 jet fighter that was sent aloft to investigate an UFO that had been plotted on the Radar scope of an Air Base (name and dates classified). The Radar Operator spied the UFO heading straight for the craft. The operator radioed for the F-86 to climb at once, but it was too late. The two blips merged as one and the UFO was tracked moving away. Classified as “mysterious” not a single shred of the F-86 was ever found. (ref. Kinross AFB where an F-89 with crew of two merged with an UFO and disappeared.-Donald Keyhoe) Second Case: A radar operator was tracking a transport plane carrying 26 persons aboard when, suddenly, another blip appeared on the screen closing at 2500 mph on the transport. Before the operator could warn the transport the two blips emerged as one. The remaining blip sped straight up at tremendous speed. A surface search in the vicinity revealed no oil slicks on the water, although a Generals’ briefcase was found floating around.

They had whitish gray skin, large heads, large eyes, small slit-like mouths and mask-like features. He had been in a drug-like state on a table and they had poked a rod like device into his back. After this they escorted him about the ship and later dropped him off at his car.

## Event 674
Date: 10/27/1975  
Type: ufo sighting  
Description: The Loring AFB incidents are extremely well documented, both in terms of personal testimonials and declassified CIA and National Military Command Center (NMCC) documents. Retired Sgt. Stephen B. Eichner was on duty when a strange object hovered over the Loring ammunition dump. Eichner told how he and fellow airmen had seen a football-shaped reddish orange object, three or four car-lengths long, hovering over the Loring ammunition dump. He said the object suddenly vanished, then reappeared some distance away at the end of a runway. Numerous other visual and radar sightings were made at Loring. Air Force planes were scrambled in a luckless attempt to track down the object. Eichner said it made no noise and could not be mistaken for a helicopter.

## Event 683
Date: 9/19/1976  
Type: ufo sighting  
Description: Tehran, Iran: Civilians reported an UFO to the AFB. The Iranian AF scrambled an American F-4 for intercept. As the F-4 was vectored towards the brilliant UFO, all communications and instrumentation were suddenly lost. As the pilot broke off pursuit, all aircraft functions returned to normal. A second F-4 that was scrambled began closing in on the UFO at greater than Mach 1 and was closing on the UFO at 150 nautical mph., but the UFO accelerated and stayed ahead of the F-4 (confirmed by Radar). Multi-colored flashing lights were visible on the UFO. The moment the F-4 pilot tried to lock an AIM-9 missile at the UFO he lost all weapons panel and communication control. The UFO launched two smaller UFOs, one of which began to follow the F-4. After evasive action by the F-4, the smaller UFO returned and united with the larger UFO. The other smaller UFO seemed to have landed on the ground so the pilot flew down to investigate it. The landed UFO appeared to be 12feet in diameter. As the pilot descended the light from the landed UFO went out and he lost sight of it. The DIA termed this sighting as “an outstanding report. This case is a classic which meets all the criteria necessary for a study of a UFO phenomenon.” And, “an inordinate amount of maneuverability was displayed by the UFOs.”

As Ospires Silva, President of Petrobras Oil Company were preparing to land, the control tower informed him of UFO targets on their radar. He and his companion, Alcir Pereira da Silva, saw bright red-orange UFOs, not at all like stars or planes. They attempted to pursue the UFOs for 30 min. but gave up as the UFOs seemed to be jumping from place to place. At this time three F-5E fighter jets were scrambled from Santa Cruz AFB. Capt. Marcio Jordao was able to approach within 12 miles of an UFO, visible to him as a bright light changing from white to green. Lt. Kleber Caldas Marinho chased another UFO which was a very intense light, changing from white to green then red again. Both pilots broke off chase as they were running low on fuel. Ground Radar picked up 10–13 more UFOs that surrounded another plane with Capt. Armindo Souza Viriato de Marinho, K.C. Freitas piloting it. Capt. Freitas tracked the UFOs on his radar, but only de Freitas, A.S.V. saw them visually once as they climbed vertically past him. Brig. Gen. Octavio Moreira Lima made these events public at a press conference and allowed the pilots and radar operators to be questioned by the media.

The inside cockpit shined brightly and I felt warm in the face.” The UFOs appeared as two rectangular clusters or arrays of light, one above the other. As the larger UFOs moved away from the 747 Airlines Flight 1628 there remained two smaller flat white UFOs. At about 5:30 p.m. Capt. Terauchi checked the pale white light behind their craft visually.
