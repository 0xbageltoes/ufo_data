## Event 78
Date: 9/7/1944  
Description: First V-2 rocket attacks begin. Two launched at Paris. V-2’s speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns and fighters, as it dropped from an altitude of 100–110 km (62–68 mi) at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 3550 km/h). The British government, concerned about spreading panic or giving away vital intelligence to German forces, initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by making no official announcement, and euphemistically blaming them on defective gas mains. The public did not believe this explanation and therefore began referring to the V-2s as “flying gas mains”.

## Event 234
Date: 3/25/1948  
Description: Aztec area NM landing and retrieval incident near Hart Canyon. UFO detected by 3 strategically located radars in the southwest, including a powerful experimental radar in the Four Corners region. The Army OSI and the IPU put on Red Alert and the ADC activated the local military units when a UFO crashed in the vicinity of Aztec, NM. When the saucer got into range of a Special High-Powered radar at the Four Corners Range (Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado) it began to flutter and wobble from side-to-side and took a trajectory towards the ground. It seems that the beam from this special radar had an ill-effect on the control system of the saucer. The 100 ft. saucer crash-landed on Mr. H.D.’s (initials) property. H.D. and family were sworn to secrecy. Note: This may have been the White Sands 1948 incident mentioned by Virgil Armstrong.

The object closed on their DC-3 in a matter of seconds, and both men later said they saw the object fly past the right side of their plane at high speed before it pulled "up with a tremendous burst of flame out of its rear and zoomed up into the clouds." They observed the object for a total of ten to fifteen seconds. Chiles and Whitted stated that the object "looked like a wingless aircraft...it seemed to have two rows of windows through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium flare."

This UFO had no wings, fins or propulsion sounds, except for the sound of “escaping steam”. It was about 60 to 100 ft. in diam. and cigar shaped. The UFO gave him “the greatest shock of my life”. There was a nauseating smell like sulfur and brimstone. He lost the sense of taste and smell and couldn’t swallow properly. He collapsed on the ground and was unable to move for half an hour, after which he managed to drive to his home and call for aid. Six weeks later, a New Jersey workmen’s compensation referee decided that Sturdevant should be paid for medical expenses incurred for the injury done by the UFO.

## Event 545
Date: Late 1956  
Description: Castle AFB, California: A.A. and J.R. (names withheld) were flying F-86’s near Modesto, CA, on alert duty due to civilian UFO reports in a nearby town. Base instructed them to return because their was an UFO near the control tower. With afterburners on they closed rapidly on a luminous elliptical UFO that moved above and below cloud cover at 10 to 12 thousand feet as if to elude them. The two pilots played cat-and-mouse with the UFO until they ran low of fuel and returned to base. Local citizens that witnessed these events were told by the Air Force that the pilots had been chasing ducks or geese.

## Event 555
Date: 7/1/1957  
Description: International Geophysical Year (IGY). It marked the end of a long period during the Cold War when scientific interchange between East and West had been seriously interrupted. Sixty-seven countries participated in IGY projects. The IGY encompassed eleven Earth sciences: aurora and airglow, cosmic rays, geomagnetism, gravity, ionospheric physics, longitude and latitude determinations (precision mapping), meteorology, oceanography, seismology, and solar activity. The timing of the IGY was particularly suited for studying some of these phenomena, since it covered the peak of solar cycle 19. Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. launched artificial satellites for this event; the Soviet Union’s _Sputnik 1_, launched on October 4, 1957, was the first successful artificial satellite.[3] Other significant achievements of the IGY included the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts by Explorer 1 and the defining of mid-ocean submarine ridges, an important confirmation of plate-tectonic theory.

Ronald Martin saw an UFO land in front of his truck and turn from red to bluish-green at which time the truck’s electrical system failed. It then turned reddish again and took off. Within the next few hours an Army Jeep Patrol at White Sands, N.M., reported an egg-shaped UFO that descended to about 50 yards above a bunker used during the first A-bomb explosion. This wave of sightings continued for 2–3 weeks. After retirement in 1975, Sheriff W. Clem gave a more graphic description of the UFO he saw: “The object was shaped like a huge football and had bright white lights. No living human could believe how fast it traveled. The thing was as bright as day. It lit up the whole area.” In an interview in 1977, Sheriff Clem said, “After the publicity of UFOs over the next few days, the number of witnesses to them rose to about a hundred people.”

Booth told reporters that a mid-air collision had taken place at 8:19 p.m. APRG (Aerial Phenomena Research Group) investigators determined that from 7:00 p.m. on through the early evening several mysterious aerial explosions had shaken the Seattle, WA, area. Several residents had reported seeing mysterious UFOs from 20 miles north of the crash scene to about 8 miles southeast of it. These sightings were confirmed by the Orting Chief of Police and by Public Information Officer at Mc Chord AFB. Several persons told APRG investigator, R. Gribble, that as the C-118 passed over their area it was followed by 2 parachute-shaped objects and that the C-118 was missing its tail assembly. Mr. and Mrs. Bill Jones reported 3 or 4 parachute-shaped UFOs following the C-118 as it passed over their home. Chief of Police, Fred Emard, told R. Gribble that he would be glad to furnish information on the UFOs to APRG, but changed his mind the next day after an interview with an Air Force Colonel. “The Chief and other officials of Orting had been silenced,” Gribble reported.

Description: Maj. R.O. Braswell, while flying an C-47 at 6500 ft. alt., spotted an UFO. “It was colored like a large red fire and looked like an atomic cloud”, he stated. At about 5 degrees above my plane it appeared massive and was at about 13000 ft. alt. The UFO appeared to be about 1000 ft. thick (top to bottom). Billie Guyton of Centerville, TX, also observed the UFO and said that he observed a smaller UFO emerge from it. Another ground observer, Jackie J. Cox, schoolteacher, saw a “bright light in the sky that spread to cover the entire sky.” W.S. Webb of Buffalo, N.Y., glanced out his bedroom window and saw a ball of fire shooting through the sky, after which he heard a noise, as if something was falling from the sky. The next day Braniff Airways Flight 542, carrying 28 passengers and 6 crew members, was found shredded in a thousand pieces. Subsequent inquiry found that there had been no fire or explosion aboard the jet before or after the crash and that scorch marks found on the exterior windows, fuselage and parted tail section showed signs of having been exposed to tremendous exterior heat. Also the force causing the plane to come down did not come from within the plane. Radar Operator, E.H. Tindale, later told investigators that he had plotted an UFO twice on the night Flight 542 crashed. Both plots of the UFO were in the area where the wreckage of the airliner was found. The UFO was stationary both times it was tracked.

The first case was an F-86 jet fighter that was sent aloft to investigate an UFO that had been plotted on the Radar scope of an Air Base (name and dates classified). The Radar Operator spied the UFO heading straight for the craft. The operator radioed for the F-86 to climb at once, but it was too late. The two blips merged as one and the UFO was tracked moving away. Classified as “mysterious” not a single shred of the F-86 was ever found. (ref. Kinross AFB where an F-89 with crew of two merged with an UFO and disappeared.-Donald Keyhoe) Second Case: A radar operator was tracking a transport plane carrying 26 persons aboard when, suddenly, another blip appeared on the screen closing at 2500 mph on the transport. Before the operator could warn the transport the two blips emerged as one. The remaining blip sped straight up at tremendous speed. A surface search in the vicinity revealed no oil slicks on the water, although a Generals’ briefcase was found floating around.

It is possible that the UFO involved in the CASH/LANDRUM CASE was built by the Americans as part of this project, however another “Project Snowbird” has been found described as a “Joint Army/Air Force peacetime military exercise in the sub-arctic region in 1955” in the 1963 Gale Research’s Code Names Dictionary. Project SNOWBIRD is another project that was revealed in the Project AQUARIUS Briefing Document.

He heard a high pitched whining sound from the UFO and saw shadowy figures in it and felt numbness, after which the UFO departed. After driving home he found he couldn’t account for 1.5 hours. The next day his back was inflamed and he discovered a small puncture wound over his spine and a few days later he developed a body rash. As months passed he regained memory of the missing 1.5 hours. He remembered that he had been in the UFO and in telepathic communication with small 4'8" humanoids. They had whitish gray skin, large heads, large eyes, small slit-like mouths and mask-like features. He had been in a drug-like state on a table and they had poked a rod like device into his back. After this they escorted him about the ship and later dropped him off at his car.

## Event 686
Date: 9/19/1976  
Description: Tehran, Iran: Civilians reported an UFO to the AFB. The Iranian AF scrambled an American F-4 for intercept. As the F-4 was vectored towards the brilliant UFO, all communications and instrumentation were suddenly lost. As the pilot broke off pursuit, all aircraft functions returned to normal. A second F-4 that was scrambled began closing in on the UFO at greater than Mach 1 and was closing on the UFO at 150 nautical mph., but the UFO accelerated and stayed ahead of the F-4 (confirmed by Radar). Multi-colored flashing lights were visible on the UFO. The moment the F-4 pilot tried to lock an AIM-9 missile at the UFO he lost all weapons panel and communication control. The UFO launched two smaller UFOs, one of which began to follow the F-4. After evasive action by the F-4, the smaller UFO returned and united with the larger UFO. The other smaller UFO seemed to have landed on the ground so the pilot flew down to investigate it. The landed UFO appeared to be 12feet in diameter. As the pilot descended the light from the landed UFO went out and he lost sight of it. The DIA termed this sighting as “an outstanding report. This case is a classic which meets all the criteria necessary for a study of a UFO phenomenon.” And, “an inordinate amount of maneuverability was displayed by the UFOs.”

This disinformation included “verification” of Bennewitz’s beliefs about the “grays” and the underground base at Dulce. Bennewitz had to be hospitalized for “exhaustion”.

He and his companion, Alcir Pereira da Silva, saw bright red-orange UFOs, not at all like stars or planes. They attempted to pursue the UFOs for 30 min. but gave up as the UFOs seemed to be jumping from place to place. At this time three F-5E fighter jets were scrambled from Santa Cruz AFB. Capt. Marcio Jordao was able to approach within 12 miles of an UFO, visible to him as a bright light changing from white to green. Lt. Kleber Caldas Marinho chased another UFO which was a very intense light, changing from white to green then red again. Both pilots broke off chase as they were running low on fuel. Ground Radar picked up 10–13 more UFOs that surrounded another plane with Capt. Armindo Souza Viriato de Marinho, K.C. Freitas piloting it. Capt. Freitas tracked the UFOs on his radar, but only de Freitas, A.S.V. saw them visually once as they climbed vertically past him. Brig. Gen. Octavio Moreira Lima made these events public at a press conference and allowed the pilots and radar operators to be questioned by the media.

Description: CBS News: “Hundreds more UFO sightings included in latest report”. “On Thursday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an unclassified version of its annual report on UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The office tracking reports of UFOs has added nearly 400 additional sightings to its catalog over the last year, either because of new sightings or older sightings discovered in existing files, bringing the total number of UFO sightings to over 500. The assessment revealed that the office tracking UAPs has had a total of 510 sightings since 2004. This is significantly up from the 144 sightings included in the initial report in 2021. Department of Defense has determined that about half of the additional sightings displayed “unremarkable characteristics.” A U.S. official told CBS News that none of the incidents have yet been definitively linked to China, Russia or any other country.”
