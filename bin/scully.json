Dr. John E. Allen, chief geologist of the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, said it gives a reasonable basis for the hypothesis that it could have been used in rocket construction. The largest portion of the object has been taken over by an Army investigator for examination. The object was found when a mysterious ice shower occurred Saturday, confined to a fifteen-foot square area of Hill Military Academy.",

All three men are convinced that flying saucers are real, controlled by an intelligence rather than a pilot and capable of speeds up to 186,000 mps.
