July 26 — 5:15 p.m. Air Defense Command radar detects a UFO over Williams, California. An F-94 jet interceptor is scrambled and locks onto the object with its radar. The crew sees a yellow-orange light. As confirmed by ground and airborne radar, the UFO plays tag with the F-94, alternately accelerating away when it gets close, then slowing down until it catches up again.

July 29 — 1:30 a.m. An Air Defense Command radar outside of Osceola, Wisconsin, picks up some unidentified targets.

Four F-51s from St. Paul, Minnesota, are scrambled, but the targets are moving around so quickly that it is impossible to vector in on a single target. The F-51 pilots see many lights; one pilot at 25,000 feet sees an object blaze across the nose of his airplane. Two other pilots vainly try to climb up to a hovering light that is in the same position as the radar targets. ATIC’s Robert M. Olsson and Wendell Swanson explain the radar incident as a temperature inversion and the visual sighting as a meteor. (NICAP, “Clusters of Small Targets and One Large Target”; Loren E.

The Air Force has “failed to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion” on UFOs. Reports are being received from all parts of the US and distant parts of the world. Boyd explains that USAF has made no progress in ascertaining the nature of UFOs, but it is filing them into three classifications: reports by civilians on the ground, reports by commercial or military pilots, and reports by pilots that are confirmed by radar or ground observations. He concludes by writing that it is “not entirely impossible that the objects sighted may possibly be ships from another planet such as Mars,” but he adds that “air intelligence is fairly certain that these objects are not ships or missiles from another nation in this world.” (Loren E.

July 29 — 9:35 p.m. Marine Pfc Ralph C. Mayher, using 16 mm film exposed at 24 frames per second, obtains footage of a high-speed UFO over Miami Beach, Florida. Retaining a few frames for personal study, Mayher submits the main portion of the film to the Air Force for analysis. The film is never returned, and no analysis report is ever released. Enlargements of a few frames show a fiery looking, roughly circular object, symmetrical, with two small peaks or projection on opposite sides of the disc. The CIA examines the film in 1957 and returns it with no comment or analysis. The Mayher case features prominently in the subsequent lawsuit by Ground Saucer Watch against the CIA and is important because it is a confirmed case of direct interaction of the CIA with a witness, clearly indicating that there was CIA interest in the subject.

July 30 — Flight Sgt.

The object is about 100 feet long. Its surface is shiny “like tinfoil,” highly reflective, and “without a single crease or crinkle in it.” On August 5, Hughes is ordered to fly to RAF Faßberg for further questioning.

Visible for 5 minutes, the object alternately hovers and turns before speeding off over the horizon. The next morning, Greene tells his business partner [Russell Rouse](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Rouse&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889921837731&usg=AOvVaw2x5EmgIlUwExrk-ygSQ33i) about the sighting.

August 1 — 10:51 a.m. An Air Defense Command radar site on Campbell Hill at Bellefontaine, Ohio, tracks a target 20 miles NNW of Wright-Patterson AFB, traveling 500 mph against the wind. It vectors two F-86s piloted by Maj. James B. Smith and Lt. [Donald J. Hemmer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81269106/donald-john-hemmer&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889921838318&usg=AOvVaw0T1Nu64Wh7K1_IpPSuj7vx). They make visual contact but climb to 48,000 feet twice without reaching it. Smith gets a weak return on his radar gun sight and shoots a gun camera film of a white or silvery sphere estimated at 60,000 feet. They break off the intercept at 11:13 a.m. about 100 miles west-southwest of Dayton. The film reportedly shows a UFO in the upper right of the frames with noticeable motion to the lower left.

August 5 — 9:46–12:00 midnight. A visual sighting is made at 9:46 p.m. by an observer on the ground at Manassas, Virginia, who spots a brilliant oval flying south. About 10:50 p.m., Andrews AFB in Maryland picks up two unidentified blips moving slowly and steadily away from Washington, D.C., on a course toward Mount Vernon, Virginia. Minutes later the fluorescent screens at Andrews show two more UFOs to the east of the field moving for a short distance, stopping, and then moving again. The speed of the targets is a slow 60 mph. The height of the targets is unknown. Planes from both Andrews AFB and Bolling AFB are sent up to investigate but rainy weather forces them to turn back after they reach 15,000 feet altitude. Around 12:00 midnight yet another target appears on radar, and jets from New Castle AFB in Delaware are scrambled.

August 5 — 11:45 p.m. A complex radar-visual sighting takes place at Haneda AFB \[later Tokyo International Airport\], Japan. Control tower operators watch a disc as it passes over Tokyo Bay at about 1,500 feet. It is a dark round shape surrounded by a bright light with a curved outer edge and smaller lights around it. While being tracked on radar, a scramble alert is issued at 11:55 p.m., and an F-94 Starfire jet from nearby Johnson Air Base \[now Iruma Air Base\] in Sayama, Saitama Prefecture, goes after the object. The interceptor, piloted by 1Lt. [Wesley R.

August 7 — 9:08 a.m. Mrs. Susan Pzuhl (or Pfuhl) observes over San Antonio, Texas, four round UFOs that give off a color similar to white-hot metal. The objects appear to be approximately 18 inches in diameter and are observed one at a time at intervals of approximately 20 minutes. With the exception of one object that moves slowly, the speed must have been 3 times as fast as a propeller-driven aircraft. No sound can be heard. Their maneuvers consist of radical directional change by the first object, straight and level flight by the second object, a slight directional change by the third object, and a large circular maneuver by the fourth object. An aircraft passes under the fourth object with no apparent reaction by the plane or the object. It vanishes suddenly like an extinguished light. Duration is 70 minutes.

August 10 — 5:38 p.m. Roy E. Munson is resting in his hammock at 1231 Widergren Drive, Rockford, Illinois, when he sees a disc-shaped object moving west to east and streaking across the sky in 6 seconds. Within minutes, another appears on the same flight path. Some family members and neighbors join him to watch the objects, which keep appearing for the next 90 minutes by which time a total of 54 have gone by. Munson alerts the CAA operator at the Rockford airport, who calls O’Hare Airport in Chicago, which sends two USAF jet interceptors to the area. They appear just as the last of the discs, which seem surrounded by a haze, disappears. Of the 54 objects, 36 appear larger that the others and move faster. Fifty follow the straight west-to-east path out of sight. Three deviate from the path to the north, and one deviates to the south.

Curious, the jet pilot adjusts his course and heads directly at the object, which is stationary. In an apparent reaction, the object loses some of its brilliance and diminishes in size, apparently moving away. The pilot determines that the object had halted above Cape May, New Jersey, where it

again hovers. Without success, the pilot tries to raise the local CCI station on the radio on F channel to request a radar scan of the Cape May area. Low on fuel, the pilot cannot pursue the UFO any further, so he breaks off the chase and heads for home. The UFO follows the jet, increasing in apparent size as it draws near and overtakes it. Eventually, the UFO loses interest and flies away to the south. (Loren E.

August 15 — 4:20 a.m. Ground Observer Corps observers in Davis, California, see a rainbow-colored, round object hovering in the air. Soon they notice eight more objects of a strange appearance. At 5:30 a.m., two more UFOs are seen, one moving west while the other moves east. The Air Force scrambles a F-94 jet interceptor to search the area at altitudes of 10,000–20,000 feet. The military claims the pilot can see nothing unusual, although the GOC spotters say that the UFOs and the jet are both visible in the sky at the same time and possibly at the same altitude. At 5:00 a.m., in Napa, California, GOC post observer Diane Robinson sights a “cigar-shaped silver thing” traveling at tremendous speed at 10,000 feet toward the southwest. (Loren E.

August 15 — RAAF Flight Lt. William H. Scott, chief test pilot of the Government Aircraft Factories, is flying a de Havilland Vampire jet between 35,000 and 36,000 feet near Rockhampton, Queensland. Looking east toward the coast, he sees a large, circular light at a lower elevation. It is the color of an ordinary incandescent light bulb.

After about 60 seconds, 6–10 smaller lights break off from the main light, surrounding it for 2 minutes before disappearing. After another 2 minutes, the big light also disappears. (Swords 376)

August 19 — The CIA/OSI study group prepares an internal 6-page document of its findings. It has made a study of the Soviet press that shows “not one report or comment” about UFOs, which indicates official censorship. It perceives a danger that the Russians might try to infiltrate civilian UFO groups (such as Civilian Saucer Investigation of Los Angeles) or add UFO disinformation during a nuclear attack: “We give Russia the capability of delivering an air attack against us, yet at any given moment now, there may be a dozen official unidentified sightings plus many unofficial.” It briefs CIA Director [Walter Bedell Smith](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bedell_Smith&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889921888531&usg=AOvVaw3UI00E0SKN328jyXl5Rmtw) on August 20.

August 19 — About 10:00 p.m. Scoutmaster D\[unham\] S\[anborn\] “Sonny” DesVergers is driving with three scouts on the edge of the Everglades south of West Palm Beach, Florida, when he sees a light in a wild palmetto grove. The boys do not see it, so he drives on. Another boy admits he has seen a light in that direction too, so DesVergers returns to the spot and goes into the grove, telling the boys to stay in the car unless he is delayed. Soon all three boys see red lights flashing in the grove. This alarms them, and they go to a nearby house for help. They return to see DesVergers staggering out of the grove, incoherently saying he has been zapped into semiconsciousness by some kind of red flare coming from a hatch in a red ball of light (and burns his cap as well). An area of flattened and burned grass is found after the event. DesVergers has a reputation as a prankster and hopes to monetize his story somehow, but the scouts do corroborate his story and there are physical traces. Grass samples from the site sent to the Air Force show root damage extending 4 inches or more into the soil, suggesting overheating, possibly by microwave radiation.

He is in his 1952 Jeep station wagon on a rough gravel road about a quarter of a mile from US Highway 160 when he sees a large, disc-shaped object hovering 10 feet in the air on the right side of the road 750 feet away. The UFO looks like two bowls placed together end to end, 75 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 15 feet high in the midsection. Through a window he can see the head and shoulders of a motionless human figure. Along its outer edge are a series of propellers 6–8 inches in diameter, spaced closely together and mounted on a bracket so they revolve “in a horizontal plane” along the edge of the object.

Late summer — As a Signal Corps employee working the night shift, Vivian Walton handles decoded teletype messages inside a high-security building at the Defense Supply Center near Columbus, Ohio. She walks into the photo lab, where colleague Joe Sheehy is developing photos, one of which he says is a UFO that had landed in the “hill country” somewhere near Columbus. He says the object is 30 feet in diameter and unoccupied, with minimal damage. A few days later, an alert is sounded, allegedly because of danger of attack by UFOs. Walton claims the downed UFO has gone through the depot on the way to Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton. (James W.

September — 10:00 a.m. A radar scope near Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, picks up an unknown target approaching at 700 mph then slows down to 100 mph northeast of the airfield. Two F-86 Sabre jets are scrambled but at first cannot locate the target. The second pilot suddenly spots what seems to be a balloon but as he gets closer it looks more like a “doughnut without a hole.” He gets as close as 1,500 feet before the object accelerates. When it is again at a range of 3,000 feet, the pilot begins firing at the object, but it pulls up in a climb and disappears in seconds. Capt.

September 1 — 8:23 p.m. Air Defense Command radar at Yaak Air Force Station in Montana picks up UFOs exhibiting changes of direction as many as five times a minute. Some course changes are 90° and speeds are measured at 1,400–1,600 mph. Six blips at one time appear on the FPS-3 radar scopes and the strange targets come within 10

miles of the GCI site. So close is the indicated range the radar personnel leave their windowless operations room to check the sky. Six objects can be seen an estimated 10 miles away. When first spotted, the UFOs are in an in- trail formation, and shortly thereafter that changes to an in-line abreast grouping. Finally, the UFOs switch to a vertical stack. S/Sgt. William Kelly remembers tracking the UFOs on the radar executing vertical climbs that exceed the limit of the site’s height-finding equipment.

An unidentified witness using binoculars sees two large objects shaped like spinning tops with red, blue, and green colors, flying side by side and leaving a sparkling trail for 30 minutes.

Frick, Dale E. Warner, Warren J. Weber, and Radar Maintenance Technician Gordon R. Copeland track as many as 30 targets simultaneously at Midway Airport in Chicago, flying in various directions with an average speed of 175 mph at about 2,000 feet.

The 755th Aircraft Control and Weapons radar station in Elkhorn, Wisconsin, claims that the Midway Airport Tower supervisor has called them at 2:50 a.m., saying there are 40 targets plotted by airport radar flying from 3,000 to 6,000 feet at a speed of 120–150 mph. The targets are the size of blips from light planes or larger (the best target quality is in the 6–10-mile range) and move in no particular pattern—sometimes erratically and sometimes in straight lines up to 15 miles long. In at least one instance, the targets fly in formation with an aircraft. At 5:14 a.m., the Air Defense Command is alerted and authorizes the scramble of two jets from the 4706th Interceptor Wing at O’Hare Airport in Chicago. At 5:55 a.m., a pair of F-86 Sabre jets piloted by Capt. [William W. Maitland](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/42353620/william-ward-maitland&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889921937209&usg=AOvVaw1Hyb0fhYnIsQGwnua4F_QZ) and Lt. Beverly L. Dunhill, lift off and are vectored right through the targets as shown on radar, making passes at 800 and at 4,000 feet without making contact. The F-86s are evidently without airborne radar because they only mention visual descriptions. Maitland and Dunhill later tell the media: “We didn’t hit anything. We didn’t see anything. We went through the target showing on the scope and there was nothing there, not even a cloud.” The jets break off their aerial search at 6:19 a.m. and return to base. By 7:00 a.m. all of the mysterious targets disappear off the scopes toward the south. The Midway radar crews are convinced the targets are returns from tangible bodies, but CAA chief Bob Zeigler overrules them and blames “peculiar atmospheric conditions.” (“[Sabre Jets Fly through ‘Object,’](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/93459288/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889921937720&usg=AOvVaw0ngOMLjRV9-GGqbNyJQLKz)” Spokane (Wash.)

September 12 — Around 7:15 p.m., in Flatwoods, West Virginia, two brothers, Edward and Fred May, and their friend Tommy Hyer (ages 13, 12, and 10 respectively) witness a bright object cross the sky, coming to rest on land belonging to local farmer [G.

From there, Mrs. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley, 14, and Ronnie Shaver, 10, and West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, 17, walk to the Fisher farm. At the top of a hill, they reportedly see a large pulsating “ball of fire” about 50 feet to their right. They also detect a pungent mist that makes their eyes and noses burn. Lemon then notices two small lights over to the left of the object, underneath a nearby oak tree and directs his flashlight towards them, revealing a creature, which May reports as bounding towards them. Other sources describe it as emitting a shrill hissing noise before gliding towards them, changing direction and then heading off towards the red light. The group flees in panic. Sheriff [Robert L.

Nickell claims that the experience was distorted by the heightened state of anxiety felt by the witnesses after having observed the original meteor. However, [Frank C. Feschino](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.flatwoodsmonster.com/index-id%253D228330%2526fuseaction%253Dbrowse%2526pageid%253D22.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889921959521&usg=AOvVaw0bzNtjt_TEtXhFMhZ_VGXN) has done extensive research to support his hypothesis that the Flatwoods incident was only one small part of a major UFO display involving multiple objects (many of them reported as “meteors” or “balls of fire” or “flaming planes”) passing in westerly and other directions across the eastern and southern United States between 6:50 and 7:25 p.m. The trajectory of one of these objects (moving first northwest then northeast then south) alone takes it over Baltimore, Catonsville, Frederick, Hagerstown, Cumberland, and Garrett County, Maryland; Preston County, Morgantown, Fairmont, Wheeling, Charleston, Parkersburg, Nitro, Ward, and Chelyan, West Virginia; Selma, Columbus, Zanesville, St. Clairsville, Ohio; it is last seen moving south around Bluefield, West Virginia. Another object is seen over Washington, D.C., heading due west towards West Virginia, apparently landing in Flatwoods. A third object travels southwest over Roanoke and Pulaski, Virginia, possibly landing near Arcadia, Tennessee. Feschino thinks that these three objects had been damaged by fire directed at them by Air Force interceptors. Five other objects are observed in North Carolina in that time period, and these Feschino suspects may have been attempting to look for and assist the damaged objects. He also speculates that the disappearance of an F-94 jet fighter out of Tyndall AFB in Panama City, Florida, piloted by 2Lt [John A.

UFO interception that began three hours earlier; the last known contact with the fighter is at 5:43 p.m. over the Gulf of Mexico 70 miles northwest of Tampa, the accident takes place under unusual circumstances, and the wreckage has never been found. Feschino thinks that a UFO damaged in dogfights with many interceptors over the Gulf might have triggered the second battle over the Atlantic seaboard around 7:00 p.m. Then a second wave of multiple objects is observed 8:00–8:10 p.m. in the Washington, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, and West Virginia region that, according to Feschino, involves a search for a second downed UFO. Although Feschino jumps to many conclusions and his documentation for specific incidents and conditions is somewhat confusing, he may well have grasped more truth than the meteor-and-owl explanation of the skeptics.

September 14 — 4:30 a.m. Fred J. Brown is preparing to milk the cows at the Everglades Experiment Station \[now the Everglades Research and Education Center\] in Belle Glade, Florida, when he spots a circular object about 35 feet in diameter hovering about 100 feet above the ground. It has a row of red and amber lights spaced around the outside rim and the underside. As it descends to about 40 feet, the 13 cows bolt as the object disappears to the west. As Brown is rounding up the cows, the object appears again, moving from south to north at a speed of 30 mph, making a high-voltage buzzing noise, and emitting an odor “like acid or ammonia” that makes Brown’s eyes smart. The cows stampede once again. The object’s glow illuminates the ground as it passes, and it gains altitude and disappears again.

September 30 — 10:30 a.m. A North American Aviation Company film crew, headed by Dick Beemer, is at Edwards AFB in southern California to film some tests. They are at Rogers Dry Lake when a B-29 passes overhead.

Cameraman Carlos Garcia sees an unusual object moving near the plane. A second object appears. Soon the whole crew is looking up. Beemer says the objects are silent, leave no vapor trail, take turns maneuvering around each other, and look like “flattened spheres.” They have a color motion picture camera with them, but the UFOs are too near the sun.

After watching a metallic object land, Solem sees a man with long blond hair and dressed in a white uniform standing next to it. He tells Solem to call him “Paul 2.” He says he is from Venus and tells Solem to work with Indians in North America in preparing for a postapocalyptic social order. This will be the first of many contacts for Solem. Over the next 17 years he wanders through the western states, speaking with Indians and contactees, gathers a small group of followers, and generally avoids the limelight. (Clark III 1094)

A white, saucer-shaped object, 13 feet in diameter, comes in from the west at high speed and passes him only 325 feet away. It falls with a violent splash into the river Lågen \[Gudbrandsdalslågen?\] in Norway. When his colleagues show up, the water is still roiling.

October 17 — Early afternoon. Residents of Oloron-Sainte-Marie, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France, see a large cigar-shaped structure in the blue sky, inclined at a 45° angle. The witnesses include the family of Yves Prigent, general superintendent of the local high school. A plume of white smoke is escaping from its upper end. At some distance in front of the cylinder, about 30 round, puffy objects with a central red spot are following the same trajectory.

The smaller objects move in pairs following a broken, zig-zag path. They leave an abundant trail of a white substance (angel’s hair) behind them, which slowly falls to the ground as it disperses. For several hours, clumps of it hang on the trees, on the telephone wires, and on the roofs of houses.

T.7 trainer out of RAF Little Rissington, Gloucester, England, for a high-altitude navigation exercise at 35,000 feet.

When they get to the top, Félix claims they see numerous UFOs flying around. Félix comes back another day by himself; eventually a saucer lands and he is invited inside to meet its crew and examine the technology. Several months later, he is visited at his home in São Paulo by the saucer captain, who claims to come from one or two of the satellites of Jupiter. Félix, under the pseudonym of Dino Kraspedon, writes about his various conversations with the spaceman in Meu Contato com os discos voadores in 1957. He writes other mystical and religious tracts under the names Dunatos Menorá and Sábado Dinotos. In 1967–1968, Félix is operating a right-wing terrorism group that sets off bombs, steals arms and explosives, and robs a bank. He serves three years in prison.

November 1 — Nuclear test Ivy Mike is the first successful full-scale test of a multi-megaton thermonuclear weapon (“hydrogen bomb”) using the Teller-Ulam design the size of an airplane hangar. Unlike later thermonuclear weapons, Mike uses deuterium as its fusion fuel, maintained as a liquid by an expensive and cumbersome cryogenic system. It is detonated on Elugelab in the Marshall Islands yielding 10.4 megatons, almost 500 times the yield of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The fireball is 3 miles wide and completely destroys the atoll.

By the time they are successful in finding the signal four hours later, they are dangerously low on fuel, and before reaching the runway, both have depleted their reserves. While Hagan is able to glide to the runway and achieve a hard landing, Robinson is too far out to follow the same path and therefore attempts to land on water. Neither his plane nor his body has ever been found; his family only learned the truth in 2008 after repeated FOIA requests.

November 10 — Battelle’s Project Stork notes in its seventh status report that current UFO reports “are now in more detail and often consist of sightings of one object by more than one individual.” 500 copies of a final version of the sighting questionnaire were delivered to ATIC at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio.

They meet the Williamsons and the Baileys at Blythe, California, at 8:00 a.m., and they drive to Desert Center, California, taking Desert Center Rice Road 117 toward Coxcomb Mountain. (Clark III 1284; Zirger and Martinelli, The Incredible Life of George Hunt Williamson, Verdechiari, 2016, p. 358)

At 1:30 p.m., they see a cigar-shaped UFO that appears shortly after a US Air Force B-29 passes overhead going in the direction of Parker, Arizona. Adamski asks Lucy McGinnis, accompanied by Alfred Bailey, to drive him a bit more than half a mile away to a flatter area near the foot of Coxcomb Mountain where he can set up his telescope. The cigar-shaped UFO is allegedly following them. (Zirger and Martinelli, The Incredible Life of George Hunt Williamson, Verdechiari, 2016, pp. 54–56, 358–359)

November 20 — 1:57 p.m. [Adamski](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Adamski&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922053441&usg=AOvVaw168h6sFn5_BI2bq2ld4tMj) stays behind to set up his equipment as McGinnis and Bailey return to the rest of the group. At 2:04 p.m., another UFO, this time a “Scout ship,” appears near Adamski, who takes seven photos through his telescope. The cigar-shaped UFO is still visible through binoculars. At 2:12 pm., Adamski takes three more photos of the Scout ship with a Kodak Brownie before it disappears behind a hill. Air Force jets circle the area at least twice. (Zirger and Martinelli, The Incredible Life of George Hunt Williamson, Verdechiari, 2016, pp. 359–360)

He walks over to him and meets an entity named Orthon as his 6 companions watch from a distance. Five-and-a-half feet tall, Orthon \[could Adamski have thought of this name from Kodak Ortho film?\] is a beautiful being with long blond hair and an extremely high forehead. Through gestures, sign language, a few words, and telepathy, Adamski learns that he is from Venus and the Venusians are visiting earth out of concern for nuclear weapons. The conversation lasts about 45 minutes. Orthon declines to be photographed but asks Adamski to borrow one of his unexposed photos. After Orthon leaves in his Scout ship around 3:04 p.m., Adamski finds tracks in the desert floor. His companions rejoin him at the site. Around 3:45 p.m., [Williamson](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hunt_Williamson&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922054741&usg=AOvVaw3o4wUAL8kWZ5kk4PranuiG) takes casts with plaster of paris, which he just happens to carry with him in case he runs into a stray bone. Each track contains within it a distinct set of symbols. After several hours of assessing the situation and waiting for the plaster to dry, the group returns to Desert Center, California.

December 4 — 8:46 p.m. USAF pilot Lt. Robert O. Arnold, 3640th Pilot Training Wing, Laredo AFB \[now Laredo International Airport\], Texas, is flying a T-28 trainer at 6,000 feet when he sees a bright bluish-white glowing object below him at about 1,500–2,000 feet and rapidly climbing to his level. It shows no navigation lights. He tightens his left turn to keep the object in view, but it suddenly climbs to 9,000 feet in several seconds and drops down to his altitude again, then stops and hovers. Arnold pursues but after 2 seconds the object suddenly heads towards him on a collision course at high speed at 8:53 p.m., wavering slightly at about 300 feet. He sees the object as a blurred reddish-bluish haze smaller than his T-28. It rapidly ascends to 15,000 feet then circles left as if positioning for another pass. In fear Arnold turns off his running lights, spirals down to 1,500 feet while keeping the object in sight as it continues to head towards him in a dive, then pulls up and climbs out of sight. A lighted weather balloon is launched at 8:53 p.m. from Laredo AFB but it is not observed near any aircraft.

December 10 — 7:15 p.m. The pilot and radar observer of an F-94 patrolling from Moses Lake AFB \[now the Grant County International Airport\] spots a light over the Hanford nuclear plant near Richland, Washington, while flying at 26,000 feet. They contact the ground control station, which reports that they know of no planes in the area and that their ground radar shows nothing. They close in on the object, which is large, white, and round and features a dim reddish light coming from two windows. They lose visual contact then get a lock-on from their ARC-33 airborne radar. As they attempt to close in, the object reverses direction and dives away. They attempt several more times to approach the light and have to alter course to avoid a collision that seems imminent.

December 21 — Evening. J. E. Hawkey, civil commissioner of Fort Victoria \[now Masvingo\], Zimbabwe, is driving near Mvuma when he sees a bright red light crossing the road about 30 feet in the air, then hovering.

Smith orders the Robertson Panel to be carried out immediately. A rush-to-judgment panel will have no time to reflect on the USAF trickery involved in the IFOs-as- UFOs deception and will just react in dismissive skepticism that there is no scientific evidence for UFO reality, and hence no reason for the CIA to intrude into USAF jurisdiction over air intelligence matters such as unidentified aerial threats (UFOs). Ruppelt calls ADC to say that he will not be able to conduct the ADC UFO briefing tour as previously scheduled due to the CIA meeting now tentatively set in early January 1953 (he confirms the call by teletype December 23).

It is about 350 feet long at their 11 o’clock position, paralleling their course at the same altitude and closing slightly. After 5 minutes, the object suddenly climbs vertically 7,000 feet in 5 seconds (about 2,000 mph) to disappear in thin clouds at 13,000 feet and causing the clouds to glow as if lit by a searchlight. Bowley radios the CAA controller in Tucumcari, New Mexico. Shortly after, the object reappears under the clouds and the CAA controller is told to look for it but he can’t see it (possibly because he is told to look in the wring direction). After 2 minutes, it climbs to the west and disappears.

1953

1953 — During off-shore combat maneuvers, a squadron of carrier-based Navy AD-3 attack planes is approached by a rocket-shaped UFO that swoops down on the flight from above. The object levels off about 1,000 feet overhead, slows, and paces the aircraft. When the Squadron Commander leads his flight in pursuit of the UFO, it turns sharply so that its tail is pointed away and shoots upward out of sight in seconds. (Keyhoe, FSTS, pp. 266–267).

1953 — Midday. A member of the crew of a Shell tanker in Hong Kong harbor, China, watches, along with many others on shore and aboard the ship, a silver-white disc hovering at 6,000–7,000 feet. Within a second or so, it moves a full 45° arc to an area where there are some white clouds at about 5,000 fee. It shines through the cloud cover like the moon through a mist. (J. Allen Hynek, “A Daylight Disc in Hong Kong Harbor,” IUR 2, no. 8 (August 1977): wrap)

1953 — Evening. An Air Force pilot and a student are flying an F-84 Thunderjet on the home leg of a training flight over North Texas when the student notes an out-of-place light. At first the pilot thinks it’s Venus, but they realize it is moving. The student steers the plane toward the light, but it zooms past them at high speed. The pilot takes the stick and turns the aircraft to follow it. The light, which now looks like a metallic domed disc with windows, passes them again. The pilot accelerates to more than 500 mph and pursues it; the disc roars past them again. The chase goes on for 10–15 minutes until a final pass when the object shines a bright light into the cockpit. The pilot takes an evasive measure and flies back to base. (CUFOS case file)

January — Beams of microwaves, varying between 2.5 and 4 gigahertz, from Soviet sources aimed at the US embassy in Moscow are first detected, increasing in intensity by 1975. Detected by routine background radiation testing, the beams come from a source in a Soviet apartment building about 325 feet west of the embassy, affecting the west façade of the central building, with highest intensities between the third and eighth floors.

This would consist of “observation posts with complete visual skywatch, with radar and photographic coverage, plus all other instruments necessary or helpful in obtaining positive and reliable data on everything in the air over the area.” The suggestion is that “Many different types of aerial activity should be secretly and purposefully scheduled within the area,” meaning that the Air Force would release balloons to generate spurious UFO phenomena. The memo is a desperate effort to buy time for Battelle to finish its statistical analysis.

January 17 — 3:55 p.m. Geologist/salesman John Townsend Sackett is riding in a bus with about a dozen passengers near Guatemala City, Guatemala, when he observes a brilliant greenish-gold object, shaped like the Goodyear blimp. It is later described as being about twice the size of a DC-3. The object is traveling at about 400 mph straight and level in a northwesterly direction at about 6,500 feet. It almost stops in mid-flight then rises vertically about 1,500 feet, hovers for about 2 seconds, then immediately resumes flight at a new altitude. The object is lost to view because of intervening terrain.

It is based on the Flit bug-spray advertisement that has a woman saying, “Quick, Henry, the Flit!” About once a week, a courier from Battelle arrives at Hynek’s office with a manila envelope stuffed with teletype UFO reports for him to examine.

January 28 — 2:20 p.m. Northrop Aircraft test pilot Rex Hardy Jr. is flying over Malibu, California, when he and two other crew members see a formation of four UFOs the size of a B-36. They are circular in shape, aluminum- colored, and flying at 1,200 mph. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, p. 50)

January 28 — A Maj. Geyer at Mitchel AFB \[now closed\] near Uniondale, New York, investigates reports of a UFO seen by both civilian and military witnesses. The UFO is an oval object glowing with different colors and having a tail or projection. He quickly concludes that it is a meteor and submits a report to Blue Book. However, one of the witnesses, author Marie Armstrong Essipoff ([Ben Hecht](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922147167&usg=AOvVaw3Gk0M8ir7PHEC3dLfjdYds)’s first wife), later writes to [Keyhoe](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Keyhoe&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922147358&usg=AOvVaw22BA0Z8VvX8Oa1Kresi3_F) saying that she had told Geyer that the object wobbled and it had a turret on top. She draws a picture and Geyer says it looks like one of their flight simulators. But it’s “still a meteor,” he says. (Swords 199–200)

January 28 — 9:00 p.m. The control tower at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro \[now closed\], California, spots a large, luminous, red object and asks Maj. Harvey N. Patton to give chase. He pursues it from Newport Beach to Long Beach and has it in sight for 3–4 minutes but is unable to gain on it.

January 28 — 9:40 p.m. Maj. Hal W. Lamb, USAF senior pilot at Moody AFB in Valdosta, Georgia, apparently sees the setting planet Venus (although this is disputed) changing color and shape while flying a T-33 (or an F-86). It is also seen by Turner AFB \[now Naval Air Station Albany\] tower operators in Albany \[not Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta\], Georgia (with time errors of about 10 minutes). About the same time, two GCA radar maintenance men at Turner AFB radar track three moving targets and a stationary target.

February 11 (or 19) — 10:00 p.m. At the Naval Auxiliary Air Station \[now Northeastern Regional Airport\] in Edenton, North Carolina, Marine 1st Lt. Edward Balocco is on intercept stand-by duty when the alert whistle goes off. Minutes later he is in his F9F Panther jet heading north to Virginia Beach, Virginia, while being vectored to an unknown target by the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina. By the time he gets close to the target, it has disappeared from radar at Norfolk, Virginia. After searching the area for 15 minutes, he heads back for fuel. Flying south at 20,000 feet, he notices a light below him on the port side on or near the ocean. After turning his navigation lights back on, he notices that the light has risen to his altitude and is only 2,000 feet away. Closing in on it, he sees it is a disc with blinking red lights. At 350 feet away, his cockpit is bathed in blue-white light and everything seems motionless and silent. He looks at his gloved hand and he can see the bones in his hand like an X-ray. Suddenly there is a flash, and the UFO breaks away as sound and motion return. Balocco tries to pursue it again unsuccessfully. Captain Thomas Riggs, whose F9F Panther has also been scrambled, reports the UFO is moving south along the North Carolina coast. He is debriefed and told not to mention the incident.

He spots am object 300–500 feet wide leaving a contrail crossing his path from left to right at about 35,000–45,000 feet at about 400 mph. It is visible only by condensation vapor emitted from its manta-ray shaped flat surface. Student pilots flying two F-84s, Lt. Jack

E. Brasher and Lt. Thomas W. Hale, also see the object but do not follow in pursuit. When Thompson turns to pursue it, the object makes a slight dipping turn to the northwest and begins climbing at about 20°. It appears to be very thin and immediately begins to form a heavy condensation trail behind it for roughly 1,000 feet and splits in two. Thompson reaches 30,000 feet and closes to within roughly 5–10 miles to a point over the Colorado River north of Parker Dam on the Arizona border.

March 22 — 2:00 a.m. Sara Shaw and Jan Whitley, who share an isolated one-bedroom cabin in the forest around Tujunga Canyon north of Burbank, California, wake up when an odd light shines through the window. An eerie silence falls over the cabin and neighboring forest. They get out of bed but feel paralyzed. Then suddenly and inexplicably, it is 4:20 a.m. Shaw, who was originally kneeling on the bed, is now sitting on it with her feet on the floor. The two women flee the cabin. As they run, they pass an apparition or “vaporous something” with the “head and shoulders of a long-haired” person. When they return to the cabin two days later, they feel a sense of dread. Shaw can remember nothing more and the two women move apart. In 1975 Shaw watches a UFO documentary that evokes some memories, and she contacts ufologist [Ann Druffel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://copycateffect.blogspot.com/2020/06/ufologist-ann-druffel-dies.html?fbclid%3DIwAR3N-uW1ZAkq5p21hxc11siol67dwjxfSq2vLaTl8v0pExaBh0OeTDuLTyc&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922193855&usg=AOvVaw3yr5pz4auGV8OdKoyiHnvo).

Spring — After 12:00 noon. RAF Flight Lt. Cyril George Townsend-Withers is asked to test some new ECM radar equipment using an experimental English Electric Canberra aircraft. The jet has been stripped of all removable parts to make it as light as possible. With this modification, he is able to leave RAF Boscombe Down \[now MoD Boscombe Down\] in Wiltshire, England, and soar to 55,000 feet, then a record for the aircraft. Cruising over Salisbury Plain, Townsend-Withers picks up a blip on his screen. It shows an object traveling 5 miles behind him and maintaining a steady course. His immediate reaction is to curse the “anomalous propagation” effects that they have gone to so much trouble to avoid. However, he soon becomes aware that this was an image of something flying right behind them. The science officer goes up to the turret to take a look and sees, glinting in the sun or pouring out a fantastic amount of its own light, a round shape trailing in their wake. Townsend-Withers calls his pilot on the microphone and tells him that he can see an unknown and suggests trying to outpace it. They reach 260 mph but the thing cannot be shaken off, so the pilot executes a sweeping radius turn. As the Canberra comes around from its turn, the object comes into view dead ahead. For half a minute they are on a collision course, swiftly trying to calculate what to do next. The object is round like a thin disc, but with two small tailfins at the rear. It seems to be metallic and enormous, and it is simply sitting there waiting for them to fly right into it.

Suddenly, it flips vertically into the air and climbs upwards at an astonishing rate. Leaving no vapor trail, wake, or detectable sound, the object vanishes within just a couple of seconds.

April–June — The US Army Chemical Corps’ Dew II project involves the secret release of fluorescent particles (zinc cadmium sulfide) and plant spores (Lycopodium) from an aircraft over St. Louis, Missouri. (Minneapolis, Minnesota, was a previous target.) It only targets black ghetto sections of St. Louis and arranges for local police surveillance “to minimize the possibility of loss of equipment.” The Army reports “much less curiosity and interference” than Minneapolis. Dew II is described in a 1953 Army report that remains classified at the time of a 1997 report by the US National Research Council concerning the zinc cadmium sulfide dispersion program. (Leonard A.

No trail, sound, or exhaust are noted. The objects pass under the right nacelle of the observers’ C-47 aircraft, which is en route to Stead AFB \[now Reno Stead Airport\]. The copilot takes control of the aircraft and turns to the right in a tight 300° turn for a better view. The objects are then picked up unassisted by two more members of the crew. The objects are seen in a right turn of a greater radius than that of the C-47 and at a lower altitude. They are observed for approximately 120° of their turn and disappear on a heading of 300°. Observers are unable to estimate the speed of the objects because of the distance and the large turn radius.

The project attempts to produce a perfect truth drug for use in interrogating suspected Soviet spies, and generally to explore any other possibilities of mind control. Another MKUltra effort, Subproject 54, is the Navy’s top secret “Perfect Concussion” program, which uses subaural frequency blasts to erase memory. However, the program is never carried out.

April 14 — 9:23–11:50 p.m. A Navy P2V Neptune spy plane on an electronic intelligence (ELINT/ferret) mission over the Sea of Japan (about 200 miles southeast of Vladivostok, Russia) is paced and attacked by 10 agile and highly maneuverable UFOs. The encounter takes place with only 400 feet of distance between the aircraft and the sea. The objects make more than “70 aggressive non-firing passes” in “high-speed runs,” many just a few hundred feet directly underneath the Navy aircraft for just over an hour. The UFOs transmit Morse Code light signals (the letter “D”), an unprecedented occurrence in UFO history. The objects are tracked on radar and by the Navy’s ELINT systems (which pick up and analyze radar beams emitted from the objects) for almost two and a half hours.

May 5 — 9:45 a.m. Chemist Wells Alan Webb is standing in a field near the Vacuum Cooling Company plant, not far from Spain Flying Field and about a mile north of Yuma AFB \[now Marine Corps Air Station Yuma\] near Yuma, Arizona, when he sees a fuzzy-white oblong object at an angle of 45° in the north. He observes it both with the naked eye and with Polaroid glasses with a greenish tint that he uses for cloud observations. It is about one-half the diameter of the full moon. After 5 minutes, the object moves to a position 30° eastward and suddenly becomes circular in appearance, becoming gradually smaller. Three concentric dark rings appear around the object, the largest about six times its diameter when viewed with Polaroid glasses.

May 16 — 8:15 p.m. Photographer Herman Charmanne is near Bouffioulx, Belgium, when he hears a strange metallic vibration. Looking up, he sees a long white trail in the wake of an object that shoots off at a great speed. The object, a luminous sphere, stops and hovers, allowing him to take two photos that depict a fried-egg-looking shape with a long tail. Recent analyses indicate that the photos are likely the result of a chemical reaction during the developing process, perhaps a flammable fluid deliberately poured on the image carrier that is then ignited.

May 20 — At the junction of Jordan and Marble Creeks in Plumas National Forest, northern California, titanium prospector John Q. Black sees a silvery object, 8 feet in diameter, land on a nearby sand bar. On June 20 the saucer returns, along with a barrel-chested “midget pilot” wearing a “forest-green outfit” and a “peak-billed cap with a cord” around it. The UFO is about 40 feet away, resting on a rock, and has tripod-like landing gear. The pilot fills a rubber-like pail with creek water and goes back inside the craft (which has one small window) after hearing Black step on a stick. The craft takes off at a 45° angle with a hissing sound. Black had seen the same object on March 20, for a total of seven times.

May 21 — 10:00 a.m. Eight disc-like objects are observed maneuvering in the sky for an hour or so above Prescott, Arizona, by sportsmen’s club president Bill Beers, post office employee Ray Temple, and O. Ed Olson. Two of the discs are stationary, while the other six discs participate in maneuvers similar to a dogfight. The six swoop around in formation, peel off, and shoot directly up and down in a maneuver that cannot be duplicated by a plane. When they move, they vary from very slow to speeds faster than a jet plane. (Prescott (Ariz.) Evening Courier, May 22, 1953; Nukes 87)

June — Night. An F-94C Starfire with classified electronic gear takes off from Otis AFB \[now Otis Air National Guard Base\] in western Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Piloted by Capt. Suggs and radar operator Lt. Robert Markhoff, the jet takes off in a westerly direction. Shortly after attaining 1,500 feet over the Base Rifle Range, the engine quits functioning and the electrical system fails. The jet’s nose drops and Suggs signals Barkhoff to bail out.

June 30 — 11:45 p.m. An orange-colored, oval object is seen for a period of 20 minutes in the northern sky moving to the southeast by at least 10 personnel of the US 912th Air Control and Warning Squadron stationed at Ramore Air Station radar site \[now CFS Ramore\], 3 miles west of Ramore, Ontario. The first person to see it is A/2c Dean McDonald who comes out of the maintenance room to inspect a power unit that has caused a minor breakdown of the search radar set. He calls two other airmen to witness it. One of the two thinks the object is the moon. The first airman gets hysterical and calls the Charge of Quarters at the Domestic Area three miles to the southwest. At least seven witnesses in that area see the object, and two of them report that the moon is visible and the UFO is distinct and separate. The object soon fades away slowly to the north.

July 1 — 1:00 p.m. A cowherd, Maximo Munoz Olivares \[or Hernáiz\], 14, sees a “big balloon” on the ground behind him in Villares del Saz, Cuenca, Spain, after a faint whistling attracts his attention. Shaped like a water jug, the object is metallic. Through an opening come three dwarfs 2 feet tall, with yellow faces, narrow eyes, and oriental features.

They speak in a language he cannot understand. They are dressed in blue and have a sort of flat hat with a visor in front and a metal sheet on their arms. One of them smacks the boy’s face, then they reenter the machine, which glows very brightly, makes a soft whistling sound, and goes off “like a rocket.” Footprints and four holes 2 inches deep, forming a perfect square 13 inches in size, are found by police.

July 19 — 3:00 p.m. After an F-86 has been circling over a particular spot in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, a black object emerges from a high white cloud and takes up its position after the plane has left toward Knoxville. “This object was extremely black in color, having an appearance of a deep black metal exterior with a fine gloss. It did not leave a vapor trail or were there any lights of shine noticed. No sound was heard. The object flew east at a tremendous speed for what appeared to be approximately three miles where it stopped. The object was then joined by two more of these same objects. A formation similar to a spread V was formed and the objects, at a tremendous speed flew in an eastward direction.” The report is made by the Atomic Energy Commission and addressed to Army Adjutant General [William Edward Bergin](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edward_Bergin&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922246449&usg=AOvVaw2oWN6I3dpizYmLoGAcbZOd) in Washington, D.C.

July 26 — 9:39 p.m. At Perrin AFB \[now North Texas Regional Airport\] in Sherman, Texas, ground observers see 7 UFOs, each carrying a bright red light, hovering at 5,000–8,000 feet. They are in a formation of two groups of three, and one trailing, then come together to form the letter “Z.” Then they circle, gain altitude, and fade from sight. Citizens in Sherman and Denison also see the objects. Total duration is 16 minutes. This is classified as a “Vital Intelligence Sighting” and sent to the Air Defense Command, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA.

Equipment includes am ionospheric reactor, electronic sound measurement devices, gamma-ray detector, gravimeter, magnetometer, and radio set. (Clark III 1078–1079)

August 5–6 — Around 8:00 p.m. Ground Observer Corps observer Phyllis Killian spots a UFO in Black Hawk, South Dakota. Soon after, radar at Ellsworth AFB near Rapid City tracks a “well-defined, solid, and bright” object. The base scrambles an F-84 and the pilot sees the UFO. Many witnesses see the object accelerate and climb. The F-84 pursues but can reach no closer than 3 miles. Now low on fuel, the F-84 returns, followed by the UFO. Immediately, another F-84 is sent up. Before long, the pilot receives strong radar returns of a target right in front of him. Fear prevails and he breaks off the chase. The UFO goes off the scope, traveling northeast. Reports soon come from Brunswick of a fast-moving, bright blue object, similar to the Rapid City object. It hovers near an air filter center, performing more maneuvers and disappearing after midnight. Before it leaves, three more UFOs are seen at 10,000 feet for three hours.

August 6 — 5:00 p.m.–12:00 midnight. An estimated 75 objects with lights are seen by many witnesses on the ground around Naval Air Station Barbers Point \[now Kalaeloa Airport\], Hawaii, from the airport control tower and from the air. Many are also detected by radar. At 9:00 p.m., the crew of a Navy patrol aircraft reports three head-on passes. These close calls alarm the pilot so much he lands immediately. Jet fighters are scrambled and the same night an interceptor pilot sees a “glowing blob” rising rapidly toward him.

August 17?— Lina Ivanova Kravets is in her garden in Shtanivka, Ukraine, when she sees a trio of intruders cutting branches off her apple, plum, and cherry trees. Approaching closer, she sees they are 11-foot-tall entities wearing dark overalls, helmets, and gloves. They claim to be extraterrestrials, converse with her about God and their peaceful home world that is prone to natural disasters and somehow affected by the earth’s wars, and insist they are on a mission to rescue a missing scout team. They then point out a silvery sphere hovering just above the ground with similar tall being standing next to it. Before the lengthy encounter ends, the beings offer Kravets a piece of bread the size of a small coin. Breaking it open, she sees something dark and odorless inside, so she refuses it. The beings then walk to the sphere in a peculiar waddling manner, wave as they enter, and take off in the craft at terrific speed.

August 26 — USAF issues Air Force Regulation 200-2, which tightens UFO reporting and investigating procedures, further restricting the release of UFO information and superseding Air Force Letter 200-5. It directs that all confirmed UFO reports be sent electronically to air force intelligence. Tangible evidence must go to ATIC in Dayton. It also confines UFO investigations to three groups: USAF intelligence at the Pentagon, the 4602nd AISS, and ATIC (although ATIC only gets reports after they go to the 4602nd). Sightings are only to be discussed with “authorized personnel.” Reports by USAF personnel no longer go to Project Blue Book, which is now only a PR front. Some good cases still go there, but far fewer unidentifieds. Only solved cases are to be discussed publicly; those still unidentified are to remain classified at the Restricted level.

The experience allegedly terrifies him, and he decides to close the International Flying Saucer Bureau. Barker immortalizes the episode in a 1956 book, They Knew Too Much about Flying Saucers, and Bender breaks his long silence in 1962 with Flying Saucers and the Three Men, in which he claims that the visitors are not government agents but monsters from the distant planet Kazik. Even Barker concedes privately that he cannot swallow Bender’s fantastic tale of abduction to the South Pole by monstrous space beings.

compares with a C-47 in size on the radarscope. The F-94 was moving at 345 mph at 21,000 feet. The same or another object is observed visually from another F-94C for six seconds at 7:00 p.m. The object is described as round, orange in color, and traveling on the same course as the first object.

Autumn — Dusk. Cecil Tenney is driving near Dutton, Montana, when he sees a cigar-shaped object about 200 feet away. Apparently in trouble, it belches fire and smoke, and after a few minutes he hears an explosion. Balls of fire rain down from the sky. He tells the story to a highway patrol officer at a nearby bar before driving on to Conrad, Montana. That evening a colonel from Great Falls AFB \[now Malmstrom AFB\] calls and tells him to show up at the base in the morning. He is interrogated there for 30 minutes, and on the way out sees soldiers carrying bags that he thinks might contain body parts. (Leonard H.

November — 6:30 p.m. Trygve Jansen and two other witnesses are driving north on the Gamle Mossevei road at the Gjersjøen bridge, Norway, when they see an object rise from behind a hill, swing out over the lake, and move back to the road, circling and following their car. Suddenly it stops and hovers above the road 30 feet in front of them, emitting a green light. Jansen stops, and all three witnesses experience mild electrical shocks until the object rises and disappears. When he returns home, Jansen’s wife points out that the car’s beige paint has turned a bright green.

November 3 — 10:00 a.m. An RAF NF.10 Vampire pilot (Flight Lt. Terry S. Johnson) and navigator (Flying Officer Geoffrey Smythe) flying at 30,000 feet near RAF West Malling \[now closed\], Kent, England, see a star-like light far above them. Suddenly it moves toward them at tremendous speed. They see it as circular and emitting a bright light around its periphery. The duration is 30 seconds.

November 3 — 2:45 p.m. In Lee, southeast London, a solid target is tracked on radar by the 256th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment moving slowly at a distance of 17 miles. Through a telescope it appears to be a circular white object. The target is tracked for 25 minutes by four aircraft technicians, including Sgt. H. Waller, who says it is about 350–450 feet in diameter and definitely not a balloon. The War Office claims the object is a radiosonde balloon.

November 22 — 10:00 p.m. A man who works in the supply transport office of the RAAF Woomera Rocket Range near Woomera, South Australia, sees a green object like a saucer fly to the north between Woocalla and Birthday Siding. It is emitting blue exhaust. Another man driving the same route around 2:00 a.m. about 50 miles from Woomera sees a bluish-green circular object moving north. It is seen again by another man in the same area around 2:30 a.m. A fourth party sees two orange flares dropping from the sky near Pimba at 3:15 a.m. All of the objects are at an altitude of more than 5,000 feet.

His CIA contacts take him to a “doctor” in New York City, who prescribes him alcohol. He then plunges to his death from the 10th floor window of the Hotel Statler in New York City. The US government calls it a suicide, the Olson family alleges murder because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he has become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs of which he has direct personal knowledge. A few days before his death, Olson quits his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Camp Detrick \[later Fort Detrick\] in Frederick, Maryland, because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research. Among Olson’s concerns are the development of assassination materials used by the CIA. The CIA’s use of biological warfare materials in covert operations, experimentation with biological weapons in populated areas, collaboration with former Nazi scientists

under Operation Paperclip, LSD mind-control research, and the use of psychoactive drugs during “terminal” interrogations under a program code-named Project ARTICHOKE. Later forensic evidence conflicts with the

December — Australian UFO researcher [Edgar Jarrold](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://theozfiles1.rssing.com/chan-25625913/all_p4.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922338172&usg=AOvVaw2PwYTylsaZMxDz0kICP3WV) is visited four times by a mysterious man who swears him to secrecy. What the visitor tells him amazes him “beyond belief,” but he never publicly reveals who the man is. However, it turns out that the man is Gordon Deller, a minor figure in Australian ufology who has some quaint and original theories about the saucers. He believes that UFOs are piloted by etherians from another dimension. He tells Jarrold this, along with some insights into a geological cataclysm and telepathic communication.

1954 — The powerful Type 80 centimetric radars introduced in the UK this year are plagued by radar “angels” that become a hazard for air traffic controllers. A Fighter Command investigation concludes that most of them are caused by migrating seabirds, and others are the result of “anomalous propagation.” Later computers filter out smaller echoes and increase the strength of those created by aircraft.

1954 — After RCAF pilots fail to intercept several UFOs in Canadian air space, the Defence Research Board sets up a restricted landing field near the Suffield Experimental Station \[now CFB Suffield\], Alberta. All RCAF planes and commercial aircraft are restricted from the area. However, the effort is abandoned after the government determines that UFOs are not a national security risk. The project is kept secret until July 1967 when it is revealed by Defence Minister [Paul Hellyer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hellyer&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922365721&usg=AOvVaw1xSktVLJ1CNAaNDvi1RfYb).

January — 5:00 a.m. A strange object streaks across the sky over Harts Range, Northern Territory, Australia, seen and heard by four Native Australians. On the same day, an anonymous photographer is taking photos of Mount Gillen, Northern Territory, when suddenly an enormous (150 feet) round object appears from behind it. It moves high, then drops low. He takes a photo, then it shoots off at high speed to the west. The photo, reproduced in the newspaper, shows a dubious-looking round object on edge with six spokes.

January 1 — 10:15 a.m. Capt. Douglas Barker, a pilot with Australian National Airways, is at his home in Doncaster East, Melbourne, Victoria. He sees a “metallic, mushroom-shaped object” flying over the Yarra River valley toward the Templestowe brickworks in the northwest. He estimates it is traveling at 700 mph at a height of 2,000 feet. Its apparent size is four times that of a DC-4 aircraft. It is oscillating rapidly in and out of thick cloud. It is elliptical with a “long shaft about the same length as its body hanging below it.” Total duration of the sighting is 12 seconds.

January 4 — Shortly after 9:00 p.m. A round luminous machine, coming from the south, lands at the Marignane Airfield \[now Marseille Provence Airport\], Bouches-du-Rhône, France. There is only one witness present, a fireman at the airport named Chesneau. The machine disappears while he is telephoning the control tower. Careful scrutiny of the runway the next morning turns up a few pieces of metallic debris.

Several officers at Bordj de la Remonte fort (southwest of Magra) hear the object make a strange sound. It seems to arrive from the north. A meteorological station near Oued Hmimim (southeast of Constantine) observes a double trail of smoke at 2:00 p.m., but it concludes that the smoke comes from a plane flying at great altitude. At 2:30 p.m., inhabitants of Sétif see an object arrive from the east, emitting bluish smoke trails and moving relatively slowly. After circling above the town for several seconds, it suddenly heads back in the direction of Saint-Arnaud at great speed. Witnesses describe it as it being cigar-shaped and flying at high altitude. Finally, at 4:45 p.m., a large, luminous, rectangular- shaped object is seen over Ouled Djellal (125 miles southwest of Sétif) for over 30 minutes following a rectilinear course.

February 1 — 10:00 a.m. Mrs. W. J. Daily of La Puente, California, sees a silvery, bright, round object through binoculars. It tilts, revealing a fiery-red bottom. The UFO spins and drifts away with an odd-looking vapor trail. A large amount of cobwebby substance falls on her property. She takes three samples to the Mount Wilson Observatory.

February 4 — 11:00 p.m. A target is detected by the Carswell AFB \[now Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth\] Ground Control Approach radar, near Fort Worth, Texas, at a distance of 13–15 miles to the southwest. A “mystery aircraft” passes over Carswell tower at just over 3,000 feet.

Allen’s victim is a secretary whom he puts into a deep trance and tells to keep sleeping until he orders otherwise. He then hypnotizes a second secretary and tells her that if she cannot wake up her friend, “her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to ‘kill.’” Allen leaves a pistol nearby, which the secretary has no way of knowing is unloaded. Even though she has earlier expressed a fear of firearms of any kind, she picks up the gun and pulls the trigger on her sleeping friend. After Allen brings the “killer” out of her trance, she has apparent amnesia for the event, denying she could ever shoot anyone. (John D.

March 1 — 6:45 a.m. Castle Bravo is the most powerful nuclear device detonated by the US and its first lithium deuteride–fueled thermonuclear weapon. The test’s yield is 15 megatons of TNT, 2.5 times the predicted 6.0 megatons (due to unforeseen additional reactions involving lithium-7), which leads to the unexpected radioactive contamination of areas to the east of Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. At the time, it is the most powerful artificial explosion in history. Fallout, the heaviest of which in the form of pulverized surface coral from the detonation, falls on residents of Rongelap and Utirik atolls, while the more particulate and gaseous fallout spreads around the world. The inhabitants of the islands are not evacuated until three days later and suffer radiation sickness. Twenty-three crew members of the Japanese fishing vessel [Daigo Fukuryū Maru](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daigo_Fukury%25C5%25AB_Maru&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922410805&usg=AOvVaw04lBHM-a__DfyA-kqV0owJ) are also contaminated by the heavy fallout, experiencing acute radiation syndrome. The blast incites international reaction over atmospheric thermonuclear testing.

March 5 — Evening. At Nouasseur Air Base \[now closed\] near Casablanca, Morocco, crews of USAF KC-97 aerial tanker planes and a C-54 transport see one or two white or amber objects or lights make passes at the aircraft on collision courses as they practice ground-controlled approach landings. At 7:15 p.m., KC-97 pilots Capt. G. E. Brown, 1st Lt. L. B. Gordon, and 1st Lt. J. P. Glover, 301st Air Refueling Squadron, 301st Bomb Wing, while flying a KC-97 to a practice landing at 1,500 feet about 5-8 miles southwest of the base, see two white lights to the right on an apparent collision course. The KC-97 takes evasive action. Later \[at 8:20 p.m.? 9:20 p.m.?\], after landing and takeoff, they see the same or similar two white lights on the same course from the south on a collision course and they made an evasive 360° turn. At 7:38 p.m., pilots Capt. Robert R. Zadnick, Lt. Paul R. Fisher, and Lt. George A. Kerr flying another KC-97 at 1,500 feet about 5 miles southwest of Nouasseur base see a light at about the same altitude and to the left, apparently headed west on a collision course. As it crosses, they see 2 lights like jets but with no aircraft running lights. One light passes over and one under the KC-97. At 9:55 p.m., senior pilot Capt. [William M.

It then turns onto a direct head-on course, passing within 2 miles, then suddenly disappears like turning off a light. It then reappears 10–15 seconds later, hovers, descends to the ground, then rises and disappears behind the C-54 after completing its turn onto final landing approach.

The mother and daughter go outside and see an object like a rowboat with a transparent dome, 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, pass slowly overhead, then stop and hover over a nearby tree. Inside the dome are five helmeted men staring at the witnesses. Their “rather long faces” are olive-colored, and their eyes and hair are dark.

Stoker calls the Coast Guard. A cutter appears after 10 minutes, then the UFO approaches the shore.

Stoker sees a short human-like occupant in a green, tight, one-piece suit suspended below the object. It gets out in undergrowth along the shore then walks around. When the cutter gives up searching, the occupant returns to the object which moves back over the lake then takes off at high speed to the east.

April 22 — 10:30 p.m. Six workers from the Reynolds Metals plant in Jones Mills, Arkansas, are waiting on a carpool near Pearcy, Arkansas, to go to work when they see a gleaming white ball about 10 feet in diameter float 50 feet above a house. It appears alternately as a sphere and an oblong, and sometimes circles and sometimes hovers above the house for a total of 20 minutes. One man claims it approaches him to within a few feet, causing him to duck behind a car. One of the vehicles has a spotlight that they try to point at the object, but it always avoids the beam.

Late April — Afternoon. Roger Mougeolle and Gilbert Doridant are logging in a clearing in a forest area near Bois-de- Champ, Vosges, France, when they hear a noise above them “like the sound of a train passing over a metal bridge.” They then see three metallic, cigar-shaped objects silently approaching them from over a nearby hill.

* * *

Two pass over them, but the third slowly descends above their clearing and stops only a few feet from the ground. It is over 600 feet long. Doridant flees, but Mougeolle walks toward it and touches it. The object is smooth, cold, and hard like steel. He touches it with his woodsman’s axe, and he is instantly thrown about 18 feet away toward the base of a large rock. He feels paralyzed for a few minutes, but the object ascends and disappears, and he can move again.

April 29 — 10:11 p.m. An unidentified illuminated object is seen above the Second Army Radio Station, Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, by the supervisor radio operator and two coworkers, Cpl.

May 5 — 4:45 p.m. Sydney Baker is at a radar post in the RAAF Woomera Range Complex in South Australia when he notices a gray, circular object at 60,000 feet maneuvering around an English Electric Canberra aircraft he is monitoring from about 35 miles away. It appears to be traveling three times as fast as the Canberra. He watches it for about 5 minutes before it shoots out of sight to the south at about 3,600 mph. The same object is apparently tracked on Woomera radar at approximately the same time.

May 14 — Around 12 noon. A flight of Marine Reserve jets led by Maj. Charles Scarborough is headed north near Dallas, Texas. At a point 6 miles west of the city, Scarborough sights 16 unidentified objects in groups of four, dead ahead but at higher altitude, 15° above. He radios Capt. Roy L. Jorgensen, whose jet he has in sight by its contrail. Jorgensen, at a higher altitude, sees the UFOs below his left wing. Just as the two pilots try to box in the UFOs, Scarborough sees them fade from glowing white to orange and disappear, apparently speeding away due north.

Triangulation shows that the UFOs were at about 32,000 feet. (“[4 Jet Fighters Report Race with ‘Saucers’ over](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.project1947.com/fig/1954a.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922467399&usg=AOvVaw1NTRfx1XIP753b8O3mqsO_)

June 5 — 6:23 p.m. Janette Brown, 16, is standing on Princes Highway (M1) at Dandenong, Victoria, Australia, when she hears a loud drumming noise. A large, dark cylinder, about 30 feet long and 15 feet high with a canopy and window on top and a window at each end, appears above a nearby factory.

June 21 — 8:14 p.m. An unidentified radar blip located over central Vancouver Island, British Columbia, responds to coded IFF Mode 1 signals from the Naselle Air Force Station radar site \[now Fort Stevens Historic Site\] in southwestern Washington State, and instantly transmits back the correct coded responses. The blip is tracked on 3 ground radars at both Naselle and McChord AFB \[now Joint Base Lewis-McChord\] in Tacoma. The UFO splits into two (or consists of two objects in close formation), separates, and outmaneuvers one of two F-86D jet interceptors, both of which also radar-tracked the UFOs.

June 27 — The Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant, at the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering in Obninsk, Kaluga Oblast, Russia, becomes the first grid-connected nuclear power plant in the world. The plan achieves criticality on May 6 and now is set up to provide electrical power to Moscow.

June 29 — 5:03 p.m. A BOAC Stratocruiser leaves New York City bound for London, England. 30 minutes later, Capt. James R. Howard receives directions from Boston Air Traffic Center to hold his position over the Rhode Island coast. Howard circles for 10–12 minutes, after which Boston tells him to detour over Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Around 11:30 p.m. while crossing at 19,000 feet near Sept-Îles, Quebec, Howard, his copilot Lee Boyd, and navigator H. McDonnell see a large cigar-shaped object and six smaller black ovals moving the same speed as his airliner, 265 mph, on a parallel course. The small objects are strung out in a line, changing relative positions but always at the same level. The large object slowly and continually changes shape, “in a way that a swarm of bees might alter its appearance.” They appear opaque, hard-edged, gray in color, with no lights or flames visible.

Goose Bay AFB \[now CFB Goose Bay\], Labrador, orders an F-94 to vector toward the location. Just as Howard is giving the pilot his position, the small objects disappear. McDonnell says they enter the large object. As the F- 94 approaches, the large object dwindles in size and disappears. Howard lands at Goose Bay and is questioned by RCAF and USAF officials (McConnell says they take the flight logs); when he lands in London, the Air Ministry does the same, telling the pilots they viewed a solar eclipse (which took place at 7:00 a.m. on June 30). Howard later hears that there are UFO sightings in Massachusetts while he is in a holding pattern, and he contests in the December 11 issue of Everybody’s Magazine that what he saw was solid, not a mirage.

June 30 — 2:17 p.m. Johnny Björnulf and Raun Conradi are aboard one of three Scandinavian Airlines planes flying above the Lifjell plateau, Telemark, Norway, to observe a total solar eclipse. Conradi takes some footage through a window on the north (port) side of one airplane.

Summer (or Summer 1955) — Evening. Dianne Vezza and two other teen girls are sitting in a backyard in Marietta, Ohio, when they see a star-like light moving at great speed. Suddenly it comes to a dead stop and two other stars speed in and come to an abrupt stop. The three objects form a perfect triangle. An oval object then becomes visible as the starlike objects disappear. Two other oval objects take up the same triangular position with the first. They then begin a light display with wildly colored lights that continues for a few seconds. The lights go out, and each of the objects beams a bright white light to the center of the triangle. The beams meet in the center for a few seconds and then go out. The oval objects disappear and the starlike lights return, but they soon speed off in different directions faster than a jet. The display is completely soundless. (Michael D. Swords, “Another Type of UFO Display,” IUR 30, no. 2 (January 2006): 11)

July 2 — 11:05 a.m. An F-94C Starfire takes off from Griffiss AFB \[now Griffiss Business and Technology Park\] in Rome, New York, on an operational training mission. It is only a few miles out when the Griffiss control tower orders the plane diverted to intercept an unidentified aircraft. When Pilot Lt. William E. Atkins cannot find the aircraft, the controller tells him about a second unidentified aircraft, which Atkins identifies as an Air Force C-47. The control tower vectors him back to the first target. Atkins cannot see any aircraft above the cloud cover, so he descends below the clouds. During the descent, a furnace-like heat fills the cockpit and the engine plenum chamber fire warning light goes on. Atkins shuts the engine off, but the light remains on. Atkins and his radar man, Henry F. Coudon \[or Condon\], eject, landing without injury. At 11:27 a.m., the plane crashes into the town of Walesville, west of Utica, striking a building and an auto, killing 4 people, and injuring 5 others. Atkins tells reporters about the heat but clams up under Air Force pressure. The official investigation confirms the fire was caused by a malfunction of the fire detector circuit. There is no evidence of an in-flight fire.

August 20 — Morning. Edith Jacobsen, 2, and Åsta Solvang, 32, are on a blueberry-picking trip to Øyfjellet, near Mosjøen, Norway, with their uncle, Halvdan Jacobsen. The two sisters wander off to a fen when suddenly they see a man in the distance. They approach him and he smiles and stretches out his hand, but he only brushes Edith’s palm with it. He has long hair with a natural wave, a dark complexion, and a tight-fitting suit with a wide belt. He begins to talk but they can’t understand him. It does not sound like Norwegian, English, German, Spanish, French, or Russian. He takes out a “little mirror” from a pocket and with something like a pencil draws circles, apparently representing planets. He finally indicates he wants the women to accompany him and he takes them to a landed disc in a clearing. It is gray-blue and looks like two giant pot lids put together. He makes a sign to not come too close, then he opens a hatch on the top, crawls in, and shuts the door. The sisters hear a faint humming and the UFO rises while rotating on its own axis.

He sees an object like an enormous (300 feet long) cigar standing on end, hovering above the north bank of the Seine River about 1,000 feet away. Suddenly from the bottom of the object comes a horizontal disc that drops, slows, and suddenly dives horizontally across the river at him. It vanishes at a high rate of speed toward the southwest. Three other discs follow in sequence. A fifth disc drops much lower than the earlier ones and remains still for an instant, swaying slightly. During this time the cigar has faded and sinks into darkness. The spectacle has lasted 45 minutes. Two police officers and an Army engineer also see the display. (Clark III 293; Loren E.

August 31— 7:10 p.m. RAN Lieutenant J. A. “Shamus” O’Farrell is returning to HMAS Albatross Naval Air Station near Nowra, New South Wales, after a night cross-country in a Hawker Sea Fury aircraft. After contacting Nowra, O’Farrell sees a very bright light closing fast at one o’clock. It crosses in front of his aircraft, taking up position on his port beam, where it appears to orbit. A second and similar light is observed at nine o’clock. It passes about a mile in front of the Sea Fury and then turns in the position where the first light was observed. According to O’Farrell, the apparent crossing speeds of the lights are the fastest he has ever encountered. He has been flying at 250 mph. O’Farrell contacts Albatross, which in turn confirms that it has two radar “paints” in company with him. Radar operator Petty Officer Keith Jessop confirms the presence of 2 objects near the Sea Fury on the GCI remote display. The two lights reform at nine o’clock and then disappear on a northeasterly heading. O’Farrell can only make out “a vague shape with the white light situated centrally on top.” The Directorate of Naval Intelligence at the time writes that O’Farrell is “an entirely credible witness” and that he “was visibly shaken by his experience but remains adamant that he saw these objects.” News of the incident leaks out in December, but the official RAN file remains classified until 1982.

Carswell AFB \[now Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth\] in Texas directs them to be on the lookout for unusual objects. The crew discovers they are being paced by a missile-shaped object only 100 feet overhead that is slightly larger and longer than their own fuselage. It has two rows of oval-shaped portholes along the sides and an orange exhaust. The bottom of the object seems to be glowing. After pacing the B-47 a short time, it shoots ahead and zooms upward at incredible speed. Carswell tells them to pursue, but they can’t keep up. The UFO then descends to within 300 feet of the bomber and begins circling it. The UFO stays with the plane, pacing it above and below, and performing figure-eights and other maneuvers for over an hour. Two other B-47s in the squadron are behind the lead bomber and also view the object. The UFO finally shoots upward and disappears again. Waste takes 32 frames of 35mm color film of the UFO with his personal camera, but his film and that of his copilot is confiscated during a 3-day debriefing at Barksdale.

September 10 — 8:30 p.m. Antoine Mazaud is walking home from his fields at Mourieras, north of Bugeat, Corrèze, France, when he is confronted by a helmeted being of average height who makes friendly gestures. It shakes hands with him and embraces him while uttering unintelligible words. Then it goes back into the brush, enters a cigar-shaped object about 13 feet long, which takes off to the northwest. A few minutes later, witnesses in Limoges report a disc-shaped, red object leaving a bluish trail.

September 10 — Around 10:30 p.m. 34-year-old metal worker Marius Dewilde comes out of his house at Quarouble, Nord, France, to see why his dog is barking. He hears hurried footsteps on his right and with his flashlight sees two creatures just beyond his fence walking in single file toward a dark object sitting on the railroad tracks. The creatures are about 3.5 feet tall with wide shoulders, short legs, and helmets covering large heads. No faces or arms are visible. When he tries to cut them off and gets within 6 feet, he finds himself paralyzed as a powerful orange beam of light is projected at him from a square opening in the dark object. The creatures continue toward the railroad tracks, a door closes, the dark object rises to 100 feet, hovers, and speeds away. Five imprints on three wooden railroad ties are found, made by an object that an engineer estimates must have weighed 30 tons. French police and the French Air Force investigate the case.

October 23 — 1:30 a.m. A woman in Cincinnati, Ohio, has fallen asleep listening to the radio. Suddenly it makes a harsh shrieking noise and the volume increases.

October 23 — 3:00 a.m. A farmer named Carmelo Papotto near Tripoli, Verona, Italy, watches a UFO land 150 feet away with a sound like a compressor. It seems to be an oval machine with six wheels and complex machinery. The top half is transparent and flooded with bright light. Aboard are six men in yellowish overalls with human faces.

When he touches part of the object, he gets an electric shock. One occupant warns him to stay away. For the next 20 minutes he watches them fiddle with instruments. The object then rises to 150 feet and takes off at a dizzying speed.

October 24 — 1:00–6:00 p.m. Officers and men at the Canoas Air Force Base near Porto Alegre, Brazil, watch a number of “circular silver-colored” objects moving at high speed. They are also seen by personnel of Varig airlines and some civilians. There are more than 100 witnesses. The chief military witness, jet pilot Lt. H. Ferraz de Almeida, sees a dull silver object moving apparently slowly above the base in a zigzag fashion. He estimates its altitude as 40,000–45,000 feet and suggests that its real speed must be tremendous. Maj. J. Magalhaes Mota is watching the same object as another one rapidly approaches the first and stops next to it. The second object then moves rapidly, abruptly changes course, and flies off in an arc. When the object is in motion, it is surrounded by a misty halo, and when it stops the halo disappears. Their movements appear mechanical and intermittent. The report is forwarded to the Air Ministry in Rio de Janeiro with a request to investigate. Brazilian Air Force Chief of Intelligence Col. João Adil de Oliviera heads the investigation, which concludes on December 2 that the “saucers appear to be some kind of revolutionary aircraft” that are not “conventional phenomena or illusions.” (UFOEv, [p.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id%3Dmdp.39015006091691%26view%3D1up%26seq%3D131%26skin%3D2021&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922670204&usg=AOvVaw1rPtIUg11ZCWECwuqZD7O7) [119](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id%3Dmdp.39015006091691%26view%3D1up%26seq%3D131%26skin%3D2021&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922670528&usg=AOvVaw3qo9LLuNJHBZ87TUuIVsmf); Swords 461–462)

October 25 — Lucien Jeune, mayor of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Vaucluse, France, following numerous UFO sightings, issues a police order prohibiting “The overflight, landing, and take-off of aircraft, so-called flying saucers or flying cigars, on the communal territory.” The announcement, which also threatens the confiscation of any craft and the arrest of occupants, is done as a publicity stunt. Claude Avril, the city mayor in 2016, refuses to rescind it.

Some cows have gathered around it. The object is moving slowly and stops at a barbed wire fence. Hée goes inside. At 11:00 p.m., his son-in-law René Marais and a friend, Jean Chéradame, arrive on a motorcycle.

November 2 — 10:30 a.m. Taxi driver Maurilio Braga Godoi leaves the streetcar trailer at Santo Amaro, a suburb of São Paulo, Brazil, and starts to walk home. When he arrives at the corner of Rua Andaguara, he is startled to find a glowing, circular object landed in an empty lot. It is about 90–120 feet in diameter and surrounded in a violet glow. He approaches it hesitantly from 60 feet away, feeling like running but he is rooted to the spot and is unable to call for help. The anxiety dissipates, and he walks toward it again, noticing a sliding door on the object. He goes inside, entering a circular room illuminated by a soft light. On a table he sees some maps, including one of South America with mushroom-shaped marks on it. He looks up and sees three humanoids less than 5 feet tall with dark brown skin and dressed in a light gray coverall and a belt that holds what might be a weapon. They appear to be conversing in an unknown language. He tries talking to them, but they don’t understand. He backs out of the object, dragging his feet. He jumps out of the door and runs away.

November 4 — A laborer named Jose Alves of Pontal, São Paulo, Brazil, is night fishing in the Rio Pardo in a deserted spot. He sees a silvery, glowing UFO like two washbowls placed on top of each other, closing in from a westerly direction and wobbling. It lands near him and three little men emerge from a window, 3 feet tall with dark brown skin. They are dressed in white clothes with tightly fitting skullcaps, and collect samples of grass, herbs, and leaves, as well as water, which they put into a metal tube. They jump back into the object, which takes off vertically.

November 4 (or 7) — 3:15 p.m. A motorcyclist, Gianni Cambosu, sees a silvery, disc-shaped object about 50 feet in diameter land near the road at Monte Ortobene, Sardinia, Italy. He swerves sharply to avoid it and falls off his cycle. A taxi driver, Francesco Tanca, stops to observe the object, which is making a soft whirring sound before it takes off.

They are moving at variable speeds, as high as 750–850 mph. At first he calculates that there are about 50 of them, but later realizes there are 100. Sometimes they are single, other times in pairs, threes, fours, sevens, or twelves. Frequently they are in diamond formations of four or V- formations of seven. At 12:00 noon, a formation of 20 objects appears from the east, followed by another 20 moving from the west. The two V-formations converge until their vertices form a St. Andrews cross, with 10 objects to each bar. The convergence takes place over the Trastevere–Monte Mario district above Vatican City.

The cross then performs a three-quarter turn on its axis, turning into an X-formation, then breaks off into two separate curves that take off in opposite directions. Another concentration of about 100 objects appears 10 minutes later and Perego notices shining filaments falling from the sky. He grabs a handful of the glassy substance, which evaporates in a few hours.

November 23 — Afternoon. A UFO follows three 10-year-old girls (Anne Storedal, Tora Storedal, and Tora Moy Haugo) returning home from school in Torpo, Viken County, Norway. It descends and hovers only 3 or 4 feet away from them. It is round, about 10 feet in diameter, and the bottom is black, trimmed with yellow spots which could have been lights, with a number of small “red jags.” The upper part is a transparent dome; a man who is operating controls is visible inside. He wears black trousers, a black jacket, and immense red goggles over his eyes. He stares at one of the girls. When the craft ascends it collides with a high-tension power line making a shower of sparks, and the girls run away.

November 28 — 2:00 a.m. Meat merchants José Ponce and Gustavo Gonzáles are driving a panel truck along Calle Bella Vista in Petare, Caracas, Venezuela. They find their way blocked by a 10-foot-wide, glowing ball hovering 6 feet above the street. When they get out to investigate, they are confronted by a dwarfish creature covered with stiff, bristly hair. Gonzáles grabs it, but it tosses him to one side. Two more dwarfs, gathering dirt and rocks nearby, approach. Ponce sees them and runs to find a police station. Gonzáles recovers in time to see two of the entities climb through an opening in the UFO. The third comes toward him, claws extended, and Gonzáles tries to stab it in the shoulder with his knife, but the blade glances off. One of the dwarfs inside the UFO points a tube at Gonzáles that emits a brilliant beam of energy. He is paralyzed and temporarily blinded but manages to stagger to the police station. A doctor at the emergency room at Esquina de Sálas hospital treats an abrasion on Gonzáles’s left side. Other witnesses to a UFO in the area come forward.

December — The US Air Force acknowledges that it is contemplating a “New type of jet aircraft, powered by a turbine larger than any now in use, \[that\] is expected to take off, land vertically, and be able to hover. It may cruise at 1,500 knots and have a range of 15,000 nautical miles.” It speculates: “If the Soviets now have such an aircraft in operational use, would the United States air defense system be able to detect, identify, intercept and destroy a bomber or reconnaissance aircraft moving at a 1,500 knot clip at an altitude of 65,000 feet?” (“[The Flying Disc,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cufon.org/cufon/flydisc.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922699716&usg=AOvVaw0CICUaPUw_rYH_PiXPXwst)” Air Intelligence Digest 7, no 12 (December 1954): 6+)

December 3 — Morning. Victoriano Maeso, Luis Brugeda, and Francisco Huertos are at Las Gastanas farm about 3 miles from Granja de Torrehermosa, Badajoz, Spain, when they hear an unusual noise and notice an object in the branches of an oak tree about 165 feet away. It is pyramid-shaped and about 8 feet high and 2 feet in diameter, with four fins and a box suspended from it by apparent ropes. They approach it, but the object rises and disappears toward the west.

December 7 — 1:15 p.m. R. H. Kleyweg, officer-in-charge of the meteorological station at Upington, Northern Cape, South Africa, is looking for a red balloon he has just released. He sees an object just east of the sun, moving slowly west, but when he begins tracking it with a theodolite, he realizes it is white, not red.

December 9 — Giovanni Aquilante, a farmer of Gricignano d’Aversa, Caserta, Italy, disappears after leaving home to work in the fields. His family and police fail to find him. On December 10, near 12:00 midnight, two of Aquilante’s sons and a friend see two mysterious entities with luminous eyes in a field. They quickly vanish. Aquilante returns home on the morning of December 11, silent and shocked, and explains that he met two “dwarfs” in the field wearing multicolored suits. They float him in the air and take him to “unknown places.”

They release him, but promise to come back for him later. Aquilante is terrified of being abducted again. (1Pinotti 89)

December 9 — Evening. Farmer Olmiro de Costa e Rosa is feeding his animals at Linha Bela Vista, said to be 2.5 miles from Venâncio Aires, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, when he hears a sound like a sewing machine that causes some of his cows to run. An object shaped like an “enormous polished brass kettle” with a rectangular structure on top is hovering in the air with an oscillating motion. Two small humanoids “enveloped in a kind of yellow sack from head to toe” are standing in a nearby field. As he approaches, one runs toward him and the other raises its arm.

The first one kneels down and plucks a tobacco plant from the field, then both jump into the craft, which vanishes within a few seconds.

December 9 — Night. Lorenzo Flores and Jésus Gómez are hunting rabbits near an unfindable town called Carera along the Transandean Highway in Venezuela. They run across a huge red UFO like two washbowls put together hovering above the road with flames spurting out. Four small hairy figures, 3 feet tall, scramble out and grab Gómez and try to drag him toward the craft. Flores strikes one with his gun butt, but it has no effect and feels like striking rock. The wooden rifle butt cracks from the impact. Gómez faints from fright, and both men are scratched and bruised. A passing motorist takes them to a police station, their clothes torn and skin abraded. When they tell their story to the police, it is obvious that their shirts have been shredded into ribbons.

December 14 — 11:00 a.m. Three bright lights appear in the sky above Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. Around 12:00 noon, they descend to a lower altitude, and witnesses see they are metallic discs. The Brazilian Air Force scrambles some jets, but they fail to intercept any of the objects. By 1:00 p.m., several groups of witnesses around the city are watching when two of the objects take off to the south, while the third comes closer and approaches some buildings in the city center. Chief of Police Col. Carlos Assunção sees a “reddish and slightly bluish object” moving at incredible speed. Maxim Cicaida, a professional photographer for Foto Heisler, snaps a photo of the disc above a building. He sends the negatives to the Brazilian Naval School in Rio de Janeiro, but they are never returned, and no analysis is released. (Brazil 29–31)

December 15 — A man is fishing in a river near Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, when he sees an unusual object landing a few hundred feet away. His dog gets nervous and begins to howl. He uses his telescopic gunsight to get a closer look. He sees two spheres of different sizes, the smaller one revolving around the larger one, which is about 6 feet above the ground and has three balls attached to its underside. Soon he sees small beings come down from the large object, moving rapidly. One is holding a phosphorescent bucket, and another has a metallic tube that is cone-shaped at one end. They use these tools to collect calcareous soil from the riverbank. They take two buckets’ worth inside the craft, which then takes off. The witness later finds square-shaped holes in the riverbank. Col. Adil de Oliveira of the Brazilian Air Force has the soil analyzed and it yields a composition of 61% silica, 19% aluminum oxide, 11% magnesium and iron, with other trace elements.

He writes: “If one assumes these Intelligence reports are authentic, then the evidence presented is such that it is difficult to assume any interpretation other than that unidentified flying objects are being observed…. Indeed, the superiority is such that it is highly improbable that such objects have a terrestrial origin… the evidence presented by the reports held by the RAAF tend to support the above conclusion—namely that certain strange aircraft have been observed to behave in a manner suggestive of an extra-terrestrial origin.” Turner goes on to recommend appointing at least one full-time investigator; publicity to encourage more people to report sightings; a liaison with the USAF to exchange information and verify [Keyhoe](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Keyhoe&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922720843&usg=AOvVaw0MlhE-XCpC4d_G7-paXZSH)’s claims; liaison with the RAF and the possibility of forming a panel to assist in analyzing reports.

December 26 — 8:30 p.m. Willis St.-Jean, a hoistman at the Agaunico Mine on the shore of Lake Timiskaming northeast of Cobalt, Ontario, sees a bright white light maneuvering in the sky. He calls John Hunt, a reporter at the North Bay Nugget office in Cobalt, to drive 3 miles to the mine to view it. The light is emanating from a large, rotating, slightly wedge-shaped disc. They watch the object for an hour after he arrives there. It circles, moves away, dances in the sky, disappears (apparently when it banks), and returns repeatedly, and at one point it flies over the lake, illuminating the surface. It disappears for good shortly after 10:15 p.m. (John Hunt, “[Reporter Sees ‘Saucer’](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/98861495/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922722868&usg=AOvVaw01R3QTVgafs1IBktQqj09U) [over Cobalt Mine,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/98861495/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922723187&usg=AOvVaw3plOwEXF9dvtQ0pRv9qObZ)” North Bay (Ont.)

1955 — Project Rover, a US project to develop a nuclear-thermal rocket, is initiated at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, New Mexico, and runs until January 1973. It begins as an Air Force project to develop a nuclear- powered upper stage for an intercontinental ballistic missile. The project is transferred to NASA in 1958 after the Sputnik crisis. It is managed by the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, a joint agency of the Atomic Energy

Commission and NASA. Project Rover becomes part of NASA’s Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) project and henceforth deals with the research into nuclear rocket reactor design, while NERVA involves the overall development and deployment of nuclear rocket engines and the planning for space missions.

Miller are flying a TB-25 bomber-trainer about 20 miles east of Cochise, Arizona, at 13,000 feet and 238 mph when they see a bright round object with red and white hues. It approaches them then hovers off the left wing for 5 minutes about 5° above the horizontal. Radio interference prevents Ritzdorf from reporting the sighting. The object climbs rapidly on a parallel flight track for 3 minutes before pulling away at 500–600 mph and disappearing.

February 2 — 11:15 a.m. A Venezuelan Aeropostal airliner piloted by Captain Dario Celis is flying between Barquisimeto and Valera, Venezuela, at 7,500 feet. Celis and his copilot B. J. Cortes spot a strange, round “apparatus” flying swiftly toward the plane. Rotating counterclockwise, the object shines with a greenish light. Around its center is a red ring or band that emits flashes of brilliant light. Above and below this band are lighted portholes. Hurriedly the pilot cuts in his mike to call the Barquisimeto radio station. After reporting the UFO, he waits for an answer, but the receiver is dead. Later the radio operators state that just as the pilot began his report, communication is cut off. The copilot banks toward the rotating UFO. Instantly the object whirls downward, then levels off, and races away at tremendous speed.

February 6 — Several witnesses in Greymouth, New Zealand, see a dazzling, silvery, cigar-shaped object moving inland at a high speed. Two observers see it consisting of two parts, with the leading part larger than the other. A loud explosion like a thunderclap is heard, causing the earth to tremble slightly.

February 10 — 9:30 p.m. Many residents of Caracas, Venezuela, see a strange object crossing the sky silently from northeast to southwest. José Agustín Díaz in Altamira clocks its time as 6–8 minutes. It looks like a disc with two bright, pulsating, bluish lights on the underside. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, p. 64)

February 15 — ATIC sends a memo to Maj. Joseph A. Cybulski, commander of the 4602nd AISS at Ent AFB \[now the US Olympic Training Center\] in Colorado Springs, Colorado, complaining about the high number of unknowns. It suggests that AISS and ATIC “strive to reach as many case solutions as possible, thereby reducing the percentage of the unknowns to a bare minimum.” As long as there is sufficient information, most cases “will fit to some extent one of the hypotheses.” The probable and possible cases are merged into the “identified” category.

February 21 — Early morning. “Cobwebby gray fibers” fall in Horseheads, New York, covering one-half square mile. Some “ragged sheets” are many feet in length. Chemist [Charles B. Rutenber](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/110704304/charles-blackman-rutenber&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922750045&usg=AOvVaw2nahxFPj5_-g36lbNvEaIh) of Elmira College in Elmira, New York, describes it as “badly damaged, slightly radioactive cotton fiber” that might have come from a Nevada atomic test. He concludes it is a “short-staple cotton, possibly lint from waste cotton used in industrial plants.” [John B.

He thinks it comes from powdered milk residue, perhaps from the Dairylea milk processing plant in Elmira. But milk plant chemists Louis R. Hermani and Robert L. Mix say the material is composed of “cotton and wool fibers with pieces of fine copper wire mixed in” and looks like it comes from a carpet sweeper bag.

Briggs, a bricklayer and former army sergeant employed at Broadlands, Romsey, Hampshire, England, the manor then owned by [Lord Mountbatten](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten%252C_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922751996&usg=AOvVaw0MqBnTXVNxG-6zDqHoEhkV), [Prince Philip](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip%252C_Duke_of_Edinburgh&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922752328&usg=AOvVaw2045wxVmzAEUzMZ2Sa6z73)’s uncle, sees a large disc-shaped UFO over a nearby meadow as he is bicycling to work. The object is shaped like a spinning top, metallic, and about 20–30 feet in diameter with portholes around the center. Watching from less than 100 yards away, Briggs estimates that the object is 80 feet above the ground. He sees a humanoid figure dressed in what look like overalls and a helmet descend from the craft on some sort of column with a platform at the bottom. He is then dazzled by a bright blue light from the craft and falls over, unable to move, as if held by a strange force. The UFO then flies off at high speed. Mountbatten takes a personal interest in this incident, interviews Briggs, and searches the area of the meadow over which the UFO is seen. He subsequently has a statement prepared, detailing Briggs’s claims.

He engages in speculation about Fortean phenomena, ancient astronauts, levitating forces to explain megalithic structures, and experiments in ancient times with flight and even space flight. He identifies 1877–1887 as an “Incredible Decade,” in which astronomers observe strange space objects, and meteorologists note strange falls from the sky. He speculates that mysterious disappearances of ship crews might constitute a curiosity among “our space friends” on “what has happened to us since they put us down here.” (Morris K.

March 24 — 2:30 p.m. The pilot of a private Beechcraft plane is flying at 1,500 feet with a student in the Ryukyu Islands, Japan. They see a domed disc with three windows about 900 feet on their left that appears to change color from white to orange and back again. Over the next few minutes, the object flies over, in front of, and under the airplane. When the pilot puts the plane into a dive, the craft stays with it. The plane’s instruments stop working. The pilot makes a steep right turn but the object still paces the plane. When the Beechcraft’s engine begins to stall, the pilot calls Naha Airport on Okinawa, which alerts the US Kadena Air Base. Two jets are scrambled, but by the time they arrive the object is long gone. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, pp. 65–66)

May 4 — A survey team arrives at Groom Lake, Nevada, and lays out a 5,000-foot north to south runway on the southwest corner of the lakebed and designates a site for a base support facility. The “Ranch” initially consists of little more than a few shelters, workshops, and trailer homes in which to house its small team. In a little over three months, the base consists of a single paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and rudimentary accommodations for test personnel. The few amenities include a movie theater and volleyball court. There is also a mess hall, several wells, and fuel storage tanks.

May 25 — Around 3:30 a.m. Robert Hunnicut is driving along the Loveland-Madeira Road in the Branch Hill area of Loveland, Ohio. At the Hopewell Road intersection, his headlights illuminate three short figures kneeling next to the road. They are grayish humanoids with a wide slit for a mouth, an indistinct nose, and normal eyes without eyebrows. The heads are hairless with prominent wrinkles on the forehead. They are wearing one-piece grayish garments. One arm seems longer than the other and the upper torso is lopsided. One of the figures is holding a rod emitting blue-white sparks. Hunnicut gets out of the car and walks towards them. They look towards him and there is a 3-minute standoff. Hunnicut goes to the police station and returns with Police Chief John K. Fritz. No trace of anything is found.

June 5 — 7:30 p.m. François-Gilbert Muyldermans is cycling on a deserted road near Saint-Marc, near Namur, Belgium, when he sees a bright disc moving at a high speed at an altitude of around 4,900 feet. He takes out his camera and snaps a photo. The object descends, then rises again emitting a cloud of white smoke. He takes two more photos. Anomalies in the blurred grain, inconsistencies in orientation, and the circumstances by which the story entered UFO lore suggest a deliberate hoax, perhaps with the help of a journalist.

June 23 — 12:15 p.m. A Mohawk Airlines DC-3 is cruising at 3,000 feet in good daylight visibility about 15 miles east of Utica, New York, on a heading to Albany. Both pilot and copilot see an object come over the top of the aircraft from behind, an estimated 500 feet above their altitude. They estimate the length of the object at about 150 feet. It is described as “light gray, almost round, with a center line        Beneath the line there were several (at least four)

windows which emitted a bright blue-green light. It was not rotating but went straight. \[The lights\] seemed to change color slightly from greenish to bluish or vice versa \[as the object receded\].

June 26 — 10:45 p.m. A brilliant round object with a trail 4–5 times its own length approaches National Airport in Washington, D.C., stops, oscillates, and moves off at high speed. Ceiling lights at the airport go out when the object approaches and return to operation when the UFO leaves. Searchlights are trained on the object, but when they catch it in their beams, the searchlights go out.

June 30 — The 4602nd AISS reports that of its 194 preliminary UFO reports for 1955, it has made 23 field investigations and has 25 unsolved reports, or an unknown rate of 13%. Going back to August 12, 1954, and removing cases of insufficient evidence, the percentage of unknowns is lower: 23 unknowns from 306 reports, or about 7.5%. In reality, however, none of these numbers mean much; they reflect the creativity and audacity of the explainers at ADC and ATIC. ()

Late July — A man, a female companion, and two children are picnicking on a Lake Ontario beach in St. Catharines, Ontario, when a silvery disc approaches them rapidly across the water, then hovers above them before heading to another family nearby. It swings back to the original group, “moving like a clock pendulum.” The man flees to his car but finds it will not start. Through the windows of the UFO, just a few feet above the ground, the witnesses see the faces of four pale-faced men with black hoods covering their ears and heads, sitting straight and rigid. The object shoots over the lake, ascends rapidly, and disappears. (Clark III 268)

July 29 — 8:30–9:30 p.m. An aircraft engineer and four others notice a “2nd magnitude star” in the vicinity of Saturn at Lake Ronkonkoma on Long Island, New York. The star moves in a perfect circle around Saturn, heads east until it gets to the Moon, where it executes a half-circle pass and disappears. The object then appears 120° away and moves horizontally until it takes an abrupt turn vertically. It disappears again at about 70° above the horizon.

Then it reappears in a straight dive-like descent until it reacquires its original 30° elevation. It proceeds horizontally again, makes an abrupt angular shift again downwards, and is lost in the trees. Through binoculars the object looks spherical and yellowish. (Michael D. Swords, “We Know Where You Live,” IUR 30, no. 2 (January 2006): 8–9; Swords 227)

August — Hundreds of people gather each night at the Black Arch, on the Antrim Coast Road near Larne, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, to watch a mysterious display of lights at sea. The light flashes three or four times in quick succession, then flashes again about 6 minutes later. The Larne police suspect that the lights are flares dropped from aircraft.

August 1 — 8:45 p.m. William M. Sheneman, the owner of a radio/TV store in Willoughby, Ohio, pulls into his driveway and walks across the street to check his mailbox. He sees a red light about 1,000 feet away coming at him at a right angle. He thinks it is a plane about to crash. Then the ground is illuminated with two brilliant lights aimed directly from the object. He runs back into the house as the UFO moves over his garage about 50–100 feet in the air. He sees a big red light at the front and a green light at the rear. Then all the lights turn off and the object moves away over the woods.

August 16 — Early morning. Truck driver Ernest Suddard and his 13-year-old son are returning home to Bradford, West Yorks, England, when their headlights light up a small figure in the street. It is 4 feet tall, dressed in skin-tight black clothes, and is hopping forward in a series of jerky movements. A circular, silvery object, perforated with holes, appears on the figure’s chest just below its throat. It approaches the truck then turns away abruptly into a passage.

It is silvery-white in color and sending out rays from its surface or sparkling “as if some electric force or very hot air was flowing from all the surfaces.” It tilts on its side about 600 feet from them, then straightens out with the flat side parallel with the ground and hovers about 225 feet from them and 40 feet above the surface of the lake.

August 21–22 — About 7:00 p.m. Billy Ray Taylor goes into the backyard of the Elmer “Lucky” Sutton farmhouse 7 miles north of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and sees a bright object come from the south-southwest, pass over, and descend into a gully about 500 feet north and about 35-40 feet lower elevation.

P. Baker) plus 3 children (Charlton, Lonnie, and Mary Lankford), see several gremlin-like creatures float down from trees and approach the house from the dark. They are about 3 feet high with roundish heads, elephantine ears, slit-like mouths extending ear to ear, huge and wide-set eyes, no visible necks, and long arms ending in clawed hands. They wear glowing silver clothing. When they run, they drop on all fours. When one of them approaches the house, Sutton and Taylor fire shotguns through the window screen, scoring a direct hit. The creature is knocked over, but gets up and scuttles off. Taylor walks out the door and one of the creatures grabs at his head. This activity continues the greater part of the night and includes heavy gunfire at times. Sutton fires point blank at it, knocking it from the roof, but it just “floats down.” At about 11:00 p.m. they run out of ammunition, and the entire group flees in terror in two cars and drives at high speed into Hopkinsville to report the incident to the police. A state patrolman leaves the Shady Oaks restaurant 3 miles north of Hopkinsville in a car to respond to the call and sees several meteor- like objects streaking over him sounding like artillery fire. He sees two in a series looking like meteors coming from the southwest, headed towards Kelly from the direction of Fort Campbell, a US Army installation. City, county, state, and military police and reporters drive out to the Sutton farm to investigate from 11:30 p.m. to 2:00

a.m. The UFO entities return at about 2:30 a.m. Glennie Lankford is trying to get to sleep when she sees one outside her window stretching its claw-like hands up to the screen. Elmer Sutton again shoots at them without effect. The last one is seen at about 5:15 a.m. Clark writes that investigations by “police, Air Force officers from nearby Fort Campbell, and civilian ufologists found no evidence of a hoax”; however, [Brian Dunning](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_(author)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922822861&usg=AOvVaw2mE1E5QBSkk4jo-cjswZIm) reports that “the claim that Air Force investigators showed up the next day at Mrs. Lankford’s house has been published a number of times by later authors, but I could find no corroborating evidence of this.” Dunning also observes that “the four military police who accompanied the police officers on the night of the event were from an Army base, not an Air Force base.” Skeptic [Joe Nickell](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Nickell&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922823137&usg=AOvVaw0IOU3emKSn1u6aR0XW4Cgg) notes that the family could have misidentified great horned owls, which are nocturnal, fly silently, have yellow eyes, and aggressively defend their nests. He thinks Taylor and Sutton were drinking heavily.

August 23–24 — 11:50 p.m. Personnel at the Ground Observer Corps tower in Hamilton County, Ohio, notice three white spheres between Columbus and Cincinnati. Tracking the UFOs on radar, they notify SAC at Lockbourne AFB \[now Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base\], which scrambles jets to investigate. The UFO approaches the tower and hovers in pendulum-like motions directly above it. The interceptors give chase, but the UFO disappears at an incredible speed. The Greater Cincinnati Airport also tracks unidentified blips on radar.

Hathaway stated that he got to the window with the Senator in time to see the first \[UFO\], while Mr. Efron said that he got only a short glimpse of the first. However, all three saw the second disc and all agreed that they saw the same round, disc-shaped craft…as the first.” A fourth witness is unidentified. “One disc ascended almost vertically, at a relatively slow speed, with its outer surface revolving slowly to the right, to an altitude of about 6,000 feet, where its speed then increased sharply as it headed north,” the report states. “The second flying disc was seen performing the same actions about one minute later. The take-off area was about 1–2 miles south of the rail line.” The Air Force report is written by Lieut. Col.

October 25 — Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 is released, months after it is completed by analysts at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, using cases supplied by the Air Force and tabulated on IBM punch cards. The original report by Battelle is about 300 pages, but the Air Force distills this down to 100. It is accompanied by a press release in which Secretary of the Air Force [Donald A. Quarles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_A._Quarles&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922854454&usg=AOvVaw2oXbeuQZbBWTjk6KN_5FES) states: “On the basis of this study we believe that no objects such as those popularly described as flying saucers have overflown the United States.” (At the same time, Quarles states that the Air Force is working on radical new aircraft that “are sure to be mistaken for flying saucers.”) Only 100 copies are printed initially, but scientist [Leon Davidson](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Davidson&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922854886&usg=AOvVaw3rHbE9U1YZmNeRqFth0ZPN) prints and sells copies of it beginning in 1956, along with his analysis and commentary. The report includes 3,201 reported UFO sightings.

Battelle employs four scientific analysts, who divide cases into knowns, unknowns, and a third category of insufficient information. They also break down knowns and unknowns into four categories of quality, from excellent to poor. For a case to be called identified, two analysts must independently agree on a solution; for a case to be called unidentified, all four analysts must agree. A report classified as unidentified is defined as: “Those reports of sightings wherein the description of the object and its maneuvers could not be fitted to the pattern of any known object or phenomenon.” Out of 3,201 cases, 69% are judged to be identified, 22%

* * *

are unidentified, and 9% have insufficient information to make a determination. The report further breaks these results down based on whether the identification is considered certain or merely doubtful. For example, in both the astronomical and aircraft IFO categories, 12% are considered certain and 9% are doubtful. Overall, of the 69% listed as IFOs, 42% are thought to be solved with certainty, while 27% are still considered doubtful. In addition, if a case is lacking in adequate data, it is placed in the insufficient information category, separate from both IFOs and UFOs. A key feature is to statistically compare IFOs and UFOs by six characteristics: color, number of objects, shape, duration, speed, and brightness. If there are no significant differences, the two classes are probably the same, the UFOs then representing merely a failure to properly identify prosaic phenomena that can already account for IFOs. On the other hand, if the differences are statistically significant, this suggests IFOs and UFOs are indeed distinctly different phenomena. In the initial results, all characteristics except brightness test significant at less or much less than 1% (brightness is greater than 5%). By removing astronomical sightings from the knowns and redoing the test, just two categories, number and speed, are significant at less than 1%, the remainder having results between 3% and 5%. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the characteristics ascribed to UFOs and IFOs, but perhaps not as significant as the initial results suggested. For two characteristics, brightness and speed, the significance actually increases with the revised test.

Ruppelt says the report “was a shock to me. I was the one that had the IBM system tried out. It didn’t prove a thing, and I had written it off as worthless before I left the project… also this report was drawn up in 1953, yet the Air Force released it as the latest hot dope in October, 1955.” The Air Force releases a second edition, with a new preface and an addendum that brings the subject up to date, in July 1957. In the 1990s, after interviewing three men (Art Westerman, [Perry Rieppel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/star-gazette/obituary.aspx?n%3Dperry-rieppel%26pid%3D87901417&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922857404&usg=AOvVaw21DPEcNMutS2prvfBDt906)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/star-gazette/obituary.aspx?n%3Dperry-rieppel%26pid%3D87901417&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922857706&usg=AOvVaw1cvdgc2e74T6qTp2b8SfBY) and William T.

intelligence requirements and the need for new and more effective interrogation techniques. Overall, about 7,000 soldiers take part in these experiments that involve exposure to more than 250 different chemicals. Some of the volunteers exhibit symptoms at the time of exposure to these agents but long-term follow-up is not planned as part of the Department of Defense studies. The experiments are abruptly terminated by the Army in late 1975 amid an atmosphere of scandal and recrimination as lawmakers accuse researchers of questionable ethics. Many official government reports and civilian lawsuits follow in the wake of the controversy. The chemical agents include VX, sarin, mustard gas, atropine, scopolamine, 2-PAM chloride, LSD, PCP, cannabinoids, riot control agents, alcohol, and caffeine.

February 9 — In a memo, “Responsibility for Unidentified Flying Objects,” the CIA’s Applied Science Division retains files for incoming raw reports that might provide information on foreign weapons R&D. Other (more significant?) reports are forwarded to the Fundamental Sciences Area for review of information on foreign science developments. Still others are to be destroyed.

February 12 — 10:55 p.m. Two F-89D fighters flying at 20,000 feet, one crewed by pilot Bowen and radar observer Crawford, suddenly see a green and red object 40 miles southeast of Goose Bay AFB \[now CFB Goose Bay\], Labrador. It rapidly circles thir jet, and the other fighter tracks it on radar but cannot see it visually. About 15 minutes later, operators at Goose Bay paint a stationary target about 40 miles southwest of the base. The two pilots vectot toward the object and obtain radar contact, but it vanishes when they get within 8 miles.

February 17 — 10:50 p.m. Air traffic controllers at Orly Airport, Paris, France, see a target appear on their radar screens that is twice the size of a conventional aircraft. It cruises around, hovers, and accelerates at fantastic speeds, and is tracked for a total of 4 hours. When it first appears on radar it is directly above Gometz-le-Châtel, Seine et Oise, and 30 seconds later it is 19 miles away, having moved at nearly 2,500 mph. A second, smaller target appears, identified as an Air France DC-3 airliner flying over the Les Mureaux military base, Yvelines, at 4,500 feet (800 feet lower than the UFO). Orly radios the pilot to alert him to the unidentified target. Radio Officer Beaupertuis sees the object through a window on the starboard side of the plane—enormous in size, indistinct in outline, and

March — Mechanix Illustrated publishes a story on the Avro Canada MX-1794 (Y-2, or Silver Bug) vertical take-off gyroplane under development by the US Air Force. The cover proclaims, “U.S. Air Force Reveals Our Flying Saucer.” Through 1958, Avro spends $2.5 million and the USAF $5.4 million funding the project. Numerous models are built, and wind-tunnel testing is undertaken at MIT and Wright-Patterson AFB. The design includes eight Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engines, a very large center rotor/impeller with Lundstrom compressor turbines, with the cockpit mounted in the top center. Control is achieved through eight small exhausts at the outer edge, directed either through the top or bottom, in addition to the main turbine exhaust through the bottom center of the craft. A multiengine test rig is built and tested in 1956, resulting in powerful thrust, a great deal of noise, and vibrations. In 1957, the USAF provides additional funding to extend the project, by then highly classified and designated as Weapon System 606A. The concept developed is for a circular-winged, supersonic aircraft. Over 1,000 hours of wind-tunnel testing are performed. Drawings developed by Avro show an aircraft that appears to be a merging of a flying saucer with more conventional fuselage shapes—a tailless aircraft with circular wings.

The spaceship is waiting for her, and Akon takes her in his hands and says, “Not afraid this time?” He leads her on board the craft, which she learns also carries a second alien, who looks much like Akon except he is darker and more muscular. As the ship first rises into space, Akon says he has been watching her for some time. He lets her look at the earth below through a viewing lens that also has x-ray capability. The saucer goes to a “mother ship” filled with friendly space people. At one point a huge video image projected on the wall allows her to view scenes from their home planet, Meton, in the Alpha Centauri system. They serve her a vegetarian meal. Klarer and Akon begin a lifelong romantic attachment that includes sexual activity.

The white light moves about 90° to dead ahead position about 8–10 miles away at high speed, estimated at about 800–1,000 mph, where it changes color to orange and seems to block the airliner’s path or risk collision. It disappears briefly and reappears as an orange light again but standing still ahead of the airliner to the west. The Convair airliner contacts Griffiss AFB \[now Griffiss International Airport\], Rome, New York, where controllers ask Ryan to turn his lights off and on to help identify aircraft. He is told the airliner is seen and the orange UFO are to the south. The airliner is ordered to maintain course to follow the UFO to the west, skipping its scheduled landing at Syracuse after nearly 30 minutes of following the object. The promised fighter jet interception is never seen. The object disappears at high speed to the northwest towards Oswego, New York.

p.m. Holwadel banks right to the southeast somewhat behind the object, which is now a great distance away. The object suddenly comes straight at them at high speed, passing in front of the T-33 at about 225 feet away. It flashes an intensely bright white light from a “greenhouse-shaped dome” or cockpit window at its front end that lights up the canopy of the T-33. The object is about 30-40 feet long, elliptical in shape, shorter than a C-47 but wider, a small steady red running light in the center, with no wings, only stubby protrusions extending 3-4 feet and 25 feet long on each side. The bottom surface is like steel with ribs extending down 2–4 feet with a wave-like appearance. It moves away then returns at high speed on a westerly course with “fantastic” maneuverability.

June (or June 1957) — RNZAF Airman Derek Mansell is a passenger in a Bristol 170 Freighter Mk 31M near Wellington, New Zealand, when the aircraft encounters severe turbulence and its compass and other instruments spin wildly. All communications fail and the engine spurts intermittently for 25 minutes before everything returns to normal. When the Freighter lands at RNZAF Base Ohakea near Bulls, the pilot of a Douglas C-47 Dakota lands and asks them whether they had seen a huge metallic disc about 250 feet in diameter with a blue light on top and a red light on the bottom, which he had observed just above the Freighter pacing it.

June — 10:00 p.m. Two women are driving north toward New Hampshire, Ohio, when a bright light approaches them from a small wooded area. They stop their car to look at it. The light is attached to a large rectangular object resembling a railroad box car that settles near the ground at the edge of the highway opposite to them about 30 feet away. Suddenly the side of the object facing them lights up from inside with a pale green light and they can see three small entities. One is standing next to a console “operating some kind of controls,” and the two others are also active. For 5 minutes, they appear to be observing the women. The entities have dark hair on their heads and arms and are wearing short-sleeved smocks. The object moves up and away toward the southwest and disappears.

He flies from Wiesbaden over East Germany and Poland before crossing the Soviet border near Grodno, Belarus, then over bomber bases at Minsk, Belarus; Leningrad \[now St. Petersburg\], Russia; and the Baltic states. The mission is tracked by Soviet radar; a number of MiG fighters unsuccessfully try to intercept the U-2.

Multiplying by the number of Soviet bomber bases, the intelligence suggests the Soviets are already well on their way to deploying hundreds of aircraft. Ironically, the U-2 has actually photographed the entire Bison fleet; there is no bomber at any of the other bases. Similar missions over the next year finally prove that. At least in official circles, the bomber gap is disproven. (Spyflight, “Lockheed U-2”)

A door opens, a metallic stairway emerges, and two tall, human-looking men with long, fair hair emerge wearing green jumpsuits. Through gestures, they encourage him to enter the craft. Inside, the saucer takes off and the crew communicate with him telepathically, telling him about a radiation protection system that exists around the ship and that they have left the atmosphere. They are supposedly from Venus. His alleged trip lasts an hour. When he returns, his watch no longer works.

August — FBI Director [J. Edgar Hoover](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922959424&usg=AOvVaw32YbN_RLE3ZPCEyaH3f5Jz) launches COINTELPRO (counter-intelligence programs). These are employed against American dissidents and their organizations; the first one targets the American Communist Party. Typical methods are anonymous or fictitious letters, false defamatory or threatening information, forged signatures, and other disinformation. The FBI blackmails insiders to spread false rumors or promote factionalism. It creates bogus organizations to attack or disrupt a bona fide group, and instigates hostile actions through third parties, such as employers, elected officials, and the media. It enables the FBI to investigate any political organization on the pretext of checking for Communists, including the NAACP, women’s rights groups, and gay rights groups. These programs prompt nearly 330,000 FBI investigations and create a Security Index of over 200,000 dangerous Americans to be detained in the event of war. Documents relating to these programs are marked “Do not file,” offering no clues that they exist.

August — Late night. Two young men are camping near Newark, Ohio, when they see five bright lights in a rigid V- formation. They fly in erratic, sharp-turning patterns for about 5 minutes, including sharp 30° turns. One man takes a photo. They report the sighting to the newspapers and the Air Force, but a USAF officer confiscate both the print and the negatives; the newspaper’s copies are also taken. (Michael D. Swords, “Timmerman’s Triangles,” IUR 29, no. 2 (Summer 2004): 16)

August 3 — A press leak from the Air Force Association reveals that proposals for two types of UFO-detecting satellites are under development. A television subsystem is cancelled as impractical, but an infrared subsystem requires much lower data transmission rates. Lockheed has signed an Air Force contract. The CIA’s [Richard M. Bissell](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Bissell_Jr&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922963704&usg=AOvVaw2_9ZYY3fY4H4RzLMF4mj22) later reveals that the CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence Deputy Director Gen. [Philip G. Strong](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/25/archives/gen-philip-strong-expert-on-u2-dies.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889922963997&usg=AOvVaw3eeaSj3reN7kzY9kcjukBL) has been pushing the Air Force to develop an infrared tracking satellite. The infrared system actually begins as planned in 1968, with initial operational status in 1970. (Clark III 813, 1032)

August 13–14 — 9:30 p.m. A radar-visual UFO sighting begins at RAF Bentwaters \[now Bentwaters Parks\], Suffolk, England. A blip traveling approximately 4,000–8,000 mph on an east-west course is picked up on radar. It moves in a straight line to a position about 15 miles northwest of Bentwaters. Within a few minutes, about a dozen normal targets are spotted 8 miles southwest, moving northeast at about 100 mph. In front of the targets are three objects in a triangular formation, about 1,000 feet apart. All the targets then appear to converge into one extremely large target (several times the size of a B-36), which continues moving to the northeast, then stops for a few minutes, then resumes, and is lost to radar. The entire sighting up to this point takes 25 minutes. Five minutes later, another solid target appears, flying east to west at 4,000 mph or more, then vanishes when it moves out of range. A T-33 trainer from the 512th Fighter Interceptor Squadron crewed by 1st Lts. Charles Metz and Andrew Rowe is sent to investigate the radar contacts, but sees nothing. No visual sightings of the objects are made from Bentwaters in this period, with the exception of a single amber star-like object which was subsequently identified as probably being Mars. At 10:55 p.m., another target is picked up 30 miles to the east, traveling west at 2,000–4,000 mph. It passes directly overhead and is seen as a white light by both air (a C-47 at 4,000 feet reports it passed underneath him) and ground observers. Bentwaters notifies RAF Lakenheath, also in Suffolk, about what is going on, and Lakenheath personnel see a luminous object stop, then zoom off to the east. Also, two white lights are seen joining from different directions, which are tracked on two screens at Lakenheath. According to T/Sgt. Forrest Perkins, watch supervisor at the Lakenheath radar center, at midnight Lakenheath notifies RAF Neatishead, Norfolk, that a strange object is buzzing the base. A de Havilland Venom night fighter is scrambled, directed by Neatishead radar controller Flight Lt. Freddie H. C. Wimbledon. Perkins and Wimbledon claim the jets are sent up around midnight, but the crews think it is at 2:00 a.m. The Venom, crewed by Flight Officers David Chambers and John Brady from 23 Squadron at RAF Waterbeach \[now closed\] in Cambridgeshire, finds the object on radar north of Cambridge and sees it as a bright white light, which then disappears. The navigator says it is the “clearest target I have ever seen on radar.” The object, however, is behind the plane and stays there for some time, despite climbs,

dives, and circling. Ground radar operators say that the object is glued right behind the fighter. After 10 minutes, the fighter heads back. The UFO follows briefly, then stops and hovers. Another Venom, crewed by Flight Officers Ian Fraser-Ker and Ivan Logan, is scrambled at 2:40 a.m. but experiences engine problems and aborts. Ministry of Defence officer Ralph Noyes says that one of the Venom pilots has taken a gun-camera film, which was later shown at a briefing in Whitehall. The object is tracked on two radars, leaving the area at 600 mph. The encounter is classified until 1969, when it is analyzed by the Colorado project.

They also assert no visual contacts were made. Chambers and Brady comment that “my feeling is that there was nothing there, it was some sort of mistake,” while Ivan Logan, the second Venom’s navigator, states that “all we saw was a blip which rather indicated a stationary target.” At the time 23 Squadron decides that the radar contact had, if anything, been with a weather balloon.

While approaching a large thunderhead (cumulonimbus) at a ground speed of about 460 mph, he sees at a much lower altitude a “bright light which was sharply defined and disc- shaped” or “like a shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal.” He takes a color photo. An analysis suggests that it would have been radiating in excess of a gigawatt of power within the spectral range of the film.

August 30 — Day. Two RAF Gloster Javelin interceptors, one piloted by E. H. “Wilbur” Wright, are flying west over the English Channel south of the Isle of Wight, England, when one of the navigators obtains a radar return at 19 miles distance (later calculations indicate it has a diameter of 600 feet). The pilots get permission to abandon their test exercise and investigate the object. Wright turns north toward the object on his right wing, but it has apparently slowed down and is maintaining its position. The second Javelin pilot has caught up from behind and confirms radar and visual sightings. The two aircraft bank steeply so the object is at 15 miles dead ahead on the radar screen They close the distance to 10 miles and see that the object has a metallic gray appearance. At 8 miles distance, the object suddenly climbs vertically too fast for radar to track (estimated at 18,000 mph) and vanishes. After landing at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, the crews are told that ground radar at RAF Sopley \[now closed\] has tracked the object. They are ordered not to speak about the event.

September — Just before 8:00 a.m. A domed, disc-shaped craft allegedly lands within White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, just 150 feet away from US Highway 70. Radios and ignition systems of passing cars go dead, as witnesses—including two USAF colonels, two sergeants, and dozens of base personnel—observe the object as it takes off with a whirring sound. All personnel at Holloman AFB are assembled in a hangar, debriefed, and sworn to secrecy.

September 7 — 12:30 p.m. Thomas J. and Maud Hutchinson watch an object drop out of low clouds and land in the middle of a bog at The Loup (near Moneymore), County Derry, Northern Ireland. They wade 600 feet into the bog until they come upon the small (3 feet high, 18 inches in diameter), red, rubbery, motionless object. There are 3 white stripes around the middle and it is pointed at both ends. Hutchinson kicks the object, which rolls over then resumes its upright position. He picks it up and is surprised at its lightness (estimated 2 pounds); the top is spinning while the bottom (a small, saucer-shaped base) remains stationary. It appears to be made of canvas-like material. They try to take it back with them, but Thomas has to put it down to negotiate a hedge, and the object takes off and disappears.

September 15 — About 6:30 a.m. A married couple is driving in Salem, Indiana, when they notice a saucer hovering about 100 feet away in a field by the road. They stop the car and get out for a better look. The object is gunmetal gray in color and looks like two shallow bowls with a dark gap between them. Wisps of smoke are coming from the gap. The object looks as large as the town’s courthouse. It begins undulating as it hovers. After 5 minutes, it tips over on its edge and vanishes. (NICAP case file)

September 22 — 7:50 p.m. An amateur astronomer in Williston, North Dakota, sees a dull-metallic, elliptical object the size of a small plane, oscillating side to side as it moves at 150 mph above the Missouri River.

She places it in an airtight jar. After the Stringfields contact the Air Force, M/Sgt Oliver D. Hill retrieves the sample on October 12. Analysis was done by C. G. Cocks and L. Leatherland, who find that the fibers are “multifilament bundles” that are characteristic of “regenerated cellulose fibers, either viscose or cuprammonium rayon,” perhaps from a defective filter.

Fall — More than 30 pilots, navigators, and flight engineers are on their way home from special duty in Europe on a US Navy Super Constellation transport. When they are about 50 miles northeast of Gander, Newfoundland, the pilot notices a cluster of lights beneath the aircraft. Suddenly, the lights dim and spread out, the largest light ascending on an apparent collision course with the transport. As it reaches the plane’s altitude, it tilts, shoots to one side, and paces them at a distance of 300 feet. It is a huge metallic disc, 30 feet thick at the center and 350–400 feet wide, with a blurry glow around the rim. Gradually it pulls ahead, tilts upward, accelerates, and zooms away in 5–8 seconds. Gander Airport confirms that it had a radar target near them. (Keyhoe, FSTS, pp. 16–19; Keyhoe, Aliens from Space, Signet ed., 1974, pp. 78–84; Yurko Bondarchuk, UFO Sightings, Landings, and Abductions, Methuen, 1979, pp. 104–106)

Fall — A man in Falls City, Nebraska, sees a winged human with a demonic face that approaches him from three blocks away. It is about 8–9 feet tall and approaches him closely, hovering in the air about 25 feet away. As it passes over him, the man feels numb and paralyzed. The episode haunts him for the next 23 years when he talks to an investigator. (Clark III 778)

Fall or winter — Shortly after 12:00 noon. An Air Force Convair RB-36H of the 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing based at Ellsworth AFB, Rapid City, South Dakota, captained by Lt. C. Lenny Marquis, is flying in northern South Dakota at 423 mph when one of the crew sees a metallic disc 100 feet in diameter fly toward the airplane from the left and take up a fixed position on the left wing less than 300 feet away. Other crew members rush to the portholes to take photos. The object has a low dome at the top with three round openings or light sources. The bottom is nearly flat. Its narrow vertical sides are populated by many separate light sources, each a different color. The rest of the disc is a “light golden” hue. After 5–8 minutes, the object suddenly accelerates in parallel with the B-36 and then rises about 30° above the horizontal. The peripheral lights become brighter and turn greenish as it speeds out of sight in several seconds. Both inflight and ground radars detect the object. Substitute navigator Lt. Jimmie Lloyd says the crew turned in all photos, logs, and equipment to an intelligence unit after landing. (Richard F.

October 2 — 3:45 a.m. Harry J. Sturdevant is on duty as a night watchman at Herbert Elkin and Company, a construction firm in Trenton, New Jersey. He sees a cigar-shaped object some 60–100 feet long and 15 feet in diameter swiftly descending toward him. Emitting a red glow, the object is making a hissing noise like steam and generating a foul odor. It swoops past him and vanishes. He loses his sense of taste and smell, possibly permanently. His face is burned to the point where he cannot shave for two weeks. He begins to lose hearing in his right ear. When he returns to work the next day, he finds leaves on the ground that have burned up like tissue paper. Sturdevant applies for workmen’s compensation from the state for his medical expenses. An adjudicator awards him the

October 7 — 10:45 p.m. UFO reports by police and civilians around Merced, California, reach Castle AFB \[now Castle Airport Aviation and Development Center\] and a lighted elliptical object about 100–120 feet in diameter is seen by the tower. Two interceptors are scrambled. The object ducks under and above a narrow cloud bank. The pilots can see it from various angles and as close as a few hundred yards. It appears to be a flattened circular shape. The pilots decide to fly one above and one below the overcast. Ground radar picks up the planes but not the UFO. One pilot breaks off to return but sees that the UFO is now chasing his buddy’s plane. Several officers arrive from another base to debrief the pilots and they appear very knowledgeable about UFOs. They seek “confirmation, not information” and tell the pilots not to discuss the sighting at all. Citizen witnesses are told the pilots were chasing ducks or geese. (Loren E.

November 11 — 10:00 p.m. Stig Ekberg and Harry Sjöberg are building a house on the island of Väddö, about 56 miles northwest of Stockholm, Sweden. Ekberg is driving his Ford V8 pickup when they see a bright flying object with the shape of a flattened sphere 24 feet wide and 9 feet high approaching from the east. It moves about a half mile in front of them at an altitude of 300 feet. As it makes a sharp turn toward them, the truck engine sputters and dies and the headlights go out. The object starts “slowly gliding down,” rocks back and forth, and comes to a stop in the middle of the road, about 300 feet in front of them, 3 feet above the ground. The object illuminates the surrounding landscape with such a tremendous amount of light that a nearby barn is clearly visible. The air smells of ozone and smoldering insulation. After about 10 minutes the object gets brighter, lifts off the ground, moves to the left and up, makes a sudden turn, and speeds away in the direction it had come. Ekberg restarts the truck and the headlights come back on. Seeing that the grass at the landing site is flattened, they investigate further and find a shiny rock that is hot to the touch. It is a heavy, three-sided piece of metal about the size of a matchbox. After several unsuccessful attempts to have the sample studied, it is taken to the Saab aircraft company where Sven Schalin conducts a thorough analysis. Other tests are later run in laboratories in Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. The general conclusion is that the rock is composed of tungsten carbide and cobalt, consistent with manufactured products.

He has become convinced that UFOs are secret devices developed by the US government and that Special Report No. 14 is a clever attempt to hide the fact.

Mostly, however, he focuses on discrepancies in the Air Force’s public announcements and the actual data in the report.

They are acting in response to a series of Williamson channelings that had begun April 18 when Lord Aramu-Muru announced that “those we have commissioned” are to establish a priory of the Brotherhood of the Seven Rays “in a remote area of another country to the south.” After spending some time in Mexico, they head for Moyobamba, Peru, under the direction of their spirit masters. The Laugheads (who apparently were in Mexico in July) and Stanfords leave around this time. After a while, those remaining move to the Valley of Pariahuanca east of Lima, Peru, and set up the Outer Retreat of the Monastery of the Seven Rays, which has some cult-like attributes. There they attract new members, including Williamson’s later coauthor John McCoy. Williamson devotes himself for several years to paranormally guided archaeological expeditions.

December 15 — 11:00 a.m. While out gathering Christmas greens near Derry, New Hampshire, A. G. Horne looks up and sees a 2-foot tall green dwarf with a high-domed head, floppy ears, a face like a bloodhound, and lidless eyes like a snake. His skin hangs in folds like an elephant’s.

December 17 — 4:20 p.m. Near Itazuke Air Base \[now Fukuoka Airport\] in Fukuoka, Japan, a USAF pilot flying an F- 86D interceptor picks up a large blip on airborne radar. The pilot sees a tan object, round on top, at 9.2 miles and closes to within 5.7 miles. The object starts to pull away from the fighter and at 13.8 miles all radar disappears.

The pilot estimates its speed as 1,700–2,000 mph. Both the pilot and his wingman report interference resembling ECM (radar jamming).

He writes that space people first arrived 1 billion years ago \[prior to the earliest known multicellular life on land\], were 12 feet tall, and built an underground city beneath Lake Titicaca, Peru. Migrants from the “Sirius system” arrive during the Miocene Epoch \[23–5 million years ago\] looking for terrestrial bodies to inhabit—they select the evolving apes. The next visitation took place in Arizona in 10,000 B.C. \[the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution\] when Venusians land and interact with the Lemurians. Records documenting earth’s unknown history are hidden in various inaccessible places (“secret places of the lion”) around the globe. Williamson’s book Secret Places of the Lion follows in 1958 and Road in the Sky in 1959. These are among the first ancient astronaut books. In the latter book, Williamson claims that the Hopi’s ancestors are Martians, while their neighbors the Navajo are from Maldek, the planet whose destruction formed the asteroid belt.

January 16 — 8:00 p.m. The crews of two Air Force B-25s are flying about 90 miles north of Sweetwater, Texas, when they see a round white object make rapid maneuvers. Pilot Lt. Col. [Howard T.

Cameron does not know that the money originates from the CIA. In addition to LSD, Cameron experiments with various paralytic drugs, electroconvulsive therapy at 30–40 times the normal power, and sensory deprivation in a “sleep room.” This is a dimly lit dormitory of about 20 beds, which the nurses call “The Zombie Room.” His “psychic driving” experiments consist of putting subjects into drug-induced comas for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments are typically carried out on patients who have entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffer permanently from his actions. His treatments result in victims’ incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators are their

February 13 — 9:40 p.m. Amateur astronomer Steve Papina is walking south in Placerville, California, when he notices off to his left the ionized track of what he takes to be a meteor. It is about 20° above the eastern horizon, rising at a 70° angle. The trail begins widening at about 35° above the horizon and veers in a westerly direction. Suddenly a black disc appears directly in front of the trail, whose diameter is approximately the width of the trail and the size of a nickel held at a distance of 5 feet. Its surface is not smooth but crisscrossed with grooves. It continues to move from east to west and acquires a white, dusty appearance before speeding directly away from Papina at high speed.

But on April 17, the Air Ministry sends an investigator to interview the witnesses and tells them not to talk about the sighting.

Van Winkle pulls the plane upward in a climb to avoid the object. This sudden maneuver causes four of the passengers to be thrown out of their seats, resulting in injuries. Copilot Dion W. Taylor and Flight Engineer John Washuta also observe the object.

March 22–23 — Mrs. Robert Beaudoin, the wife of an [Air Force officer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fidler-isburgfuneralchapels.com/obituary/robert-beaudoin&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923064464&usg=AOvVaw1LXRvs1Wcv2naQz9d8VHzI), along with her 17-year-old daughter Carol Litten, sees a series of unusual lights at 11:15 p.m. northeast of Camarillo, California. First they see a large, soundless, and pulsing light, with something like a pole on top, making fast and erratic motions. She calls a military friend and then 1st Lt. [Leonard E.

At 12:30 a.m., they see a green object accompanied by two smaller red lights below the horizon of the Los Palos Hills. The green object seems to be hovering over the North American Rocketdyne plant in the Simi Hills. At this time both the green object and the red objects seem to jump around, and the two red objects are zooming past the green object at tremendous velocities. Ott inquires about radar and a Lt. Martin tells him that radar is detecting a stationary object in the same area. The sheriff’s office is contacted, and they send a patrol car. Deputy Sheriffs Segura and Rausch confirm Beaudoin’s report, with the exception that by that time there are five red objects flying well below the green one. All are in motion and constantly changing altitude. Radar calls Ott back and says they have a scramble underway and they will have the aircraft check the area upon their return. Upon the arrival of the interceptors from Oxnard the red objects join the green object and speed away up and to the east. The aircraft are unsuccessful and return to base. At this time two Navy aircraft are sent to the area. Somehow, between the time of this report to Oxnard and the later Air Force investigation by the 4602nd, these red objects are changed, on the report, to stars and the moon above. This happens despite the witness stating that the red lights were below the hills on the horizon. To deal with that, the Air Force adds the theory that a temperature inversion caused light to bend the images of the stars, or, alternatively, the witness saw lights on a barn. Beaudoin herself is judged hysterical due to her pregnancy. The Air Force’s explanation is completed without anyone bothering to interview the teenage daughter or taking anything associated with the airbase into account (for example, the radar returns).

April 24 — 6:27 a.m. Project 57 is an open-air nuclear “dirty-bomb” test conducted in Area 13 at the Nellis Air Force Range, Nevada. The high explosives of a nuclear weapon are detonated asymmetrically to simulate an accidental detonation of an XW-25 warhead in an airplane crash. The purpose of the test is to verify that no yield would result, as well as study the extent of plutonium contamination. Some 4,000 galvanized steel pans sprayed with tacky resin are set up around a 10-by-16-square-mile block of land to capture plutonium samples. Some 68 air- sampler stations equipped with micropore paper are spread over 70 square miles. Mock-ups of sidewalks, curbs, and asphalt are set up in the desert; cars and trucks are added; giant air-sampling balloons are tethered in place; 9 burros, 109 beagles, 10 sheep, and 31 white rats are put in cages. Afterward, the contaminated area is fenced off and the contaminated equipment buried in place. Data from the test confirms that plutonium has a 24,000-year half-life; many of the test animals are killed, but security guard [Richard Mingus](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mingus&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923076191&usg=AOvVaw1X5ZMNFKWuq5TiVV1w4K2-) manages not to inhale any particles.

He notices an object like a metallic, fluorescent-blue submarine with tail fins sitting at the end of the runway. It is about the size of an airliner. He watches it a while, then gets out of the truck and approaches it. He has the object in sight a total of 10–15 minutes and realizes it is hovering just above the ground. When he is 600 feet away, he encounters a type of force field that prevents him from approaching. The object then rises straight up into the sky to about 1,200 feet and shoots

It is 15 feet in diameter with a rim about 3 feet wide. It hovers with one side tilted toward her 50 feet away. Its lone occupant, a helmeted figure with a long, olive- colored face and a shiny, light gray suit, gazes at her with a quizzical expression on his tanned face.

May? — 3:45 p.m. Two men in Orlando, Florida, see an oval object emerge from a larger cigar-shaped UFO about 75– 100 feet long. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Satellite Objects: A Further Look,” IUR 29, no. 2 (Summer 2004): 7, 25)

May 1 — 7:00 a.m. A man driving a motorcycle about 9 miles from Pajas Blancas International Airport in Córdoba, Argentina, sees a UFO shortly after his engine fails. It is 65 feet in diameter and 16 feet thick, hovering about 50 feet above the ground. He hides in a ditch and sees the craft come down, making a sound similar to air escaping from a valve. A lift descends from its base almost to the ground. In it is a man of average height who makes friendly gestures. He is dressed in a plastic diving suit. The witness enters the machine and sees several people inside seated in front of instrument panels, lit by an extraordinary light. He is then escorted out, and the disc rises to the northwest. During the next hour, there are 6 other sightings made by independent witnesses. (Loren E.

Bittick and [John R.

As they approach their station in the Mojave Desert, they see a bright object in the sky. It is initially at about a 45° elevation and seems to be hovering. They need to get permission from Baker to photograph anything, so they call it in, begin readying the scope, load the film, and wait for the okay. Gettys says the base of the object has a circular appearance when high in the sky.

Baker gives them his approval and they begin filming, each viewing the object through spotting scopes while the film rolls. They shoot about 100 feet then stop. During filming, the object moves from 1 mile away to 5 miles.

What they see is a disc-shaped object with a low dome on top. They contact the base, which scrambles two jets, but they are too late. After they turn the film in, three officers show up and interrogate them.

May 10 — After 10:45 p.m. At Beaucourt-sur-l’Ancre, Somme, France, a 29-year-old Hungarian refugee named Fekete is cycling when he is “dazzled by a strange projectile.” He sees four men 4–5 feet tall approaching him in a threatening manner. One of them carries a bright light which prevents him from seeing much detail. He flees on his cycle to a nearby home, where others look out and see the occupants 300 feet away. The UFO is emitting red and white (or yellow) rays of light alternatively. They watch for about 20 minutes until 11:15 p.m. when the UFO takes off at a 45° angle. (Loren E.

May 28 — Boltzmann, the first of 29 nuclear tests in Operation Plumbbob, takes place at the Nevada Test Site. At 12 kilotons, it is about the same size as the Hiroshima bomb and causes Area 51 personnel 11 miles away to be temporarily evacuated. Another test blast buckles aircraft hangar doors in Area 51, shatters windows in the mess hall, and breaks a dormitory ventilator panel. The Plumbbob tests continue until October 7, 1957. While

most tests contribute to the development of warheads for intercontinental and intermediate range missiles, they also test air defense and anti-submarine warheads with small yields.

July 5 — During the 74-kiloton Plumbbob Hood nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site, the Marine Corps conducts a tactical maneuver involving the use of a helicopter airlift, tactical air support, and an amphibian tractor called the LVTP5. Despite the AEC’s assurance that no thermonuclear devices are being tested, Hood is thermonuclear and is the largest atmospheric test in the continental US. All Area 51 personnel are evacuated prior to the blast, but the military neglects to secure the sensitive information in the buildings with security guards. Seventy anesthetized Chester White pigs in military uniforms (as test fabrics) are placed in cages a short distance from ground zero.

Several types of wood houses are constructed to see how each handles the blast. The Mosler Safe Company sponsors the construction of a steel vault to withstand the blast. Some 100 soldiers, lying in trenches, are stationed to gauge the psychological impact of the bomb. The flash is visible from Canada to Mexico and 800 miles out in the Pacific. The blast wave reaches Los Angeles 25 minutes later. Afterwards, security guard [Richard Mingus](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mingus&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923100914&usg=AOvVaw2RLz4IoL6CrfCrxBn2wTQ-) has to drive through a highly radioactive ground zero to reach the buildings at Area 51 ten miles away.

July 17 — Before dawn.

The crew detects on its Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) equipment an airborne radar source that mimics some but not all of the signal characteristics of a common air defense ground radar. Aircraft normally do not carry such high-powered radars. As the key ELINT officer on the RB-47 puts it, “an antenna bigger than the airplane” would be required to emit as strong a signal as he detected from the UFO. Because the UFO signal appears to have comparable or greater received signal strength than the one-megawatt ground radar beam and the UFOs distance is about 5 times closer than the ground radar, a crude estimate of the UFO radar power output using the inverse-square law would be about 40 kilowatts. The maneuvering radar signal coincides in location with a bright UFO. At times the signal moves ahead of the RB-47, then circles around as if airborne, highly maneuverable, and flying faster than the RB-47. The 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing Intelligence report states that the Wing’s director of intelligence “has no doubt the electronic D/F’s coincided exactly with visual observations by a/c numerous times thus indicating positively the object being the signal source.” An air defense radar station near Dallas, Texas, reportedly confirms tracking a UFO at the same location reported by the RB-47 crew but later tries to deny it in an unclassified message to ATIC. The UFO is reportedly tracked by the RB-47’s airborne navigation radar as well, though the crew has differing recollections on this point. Twice the UFO blinks out visually when pursued by the RB-47. At the same time the strange signal disappears, either that, or the ground radar site and the RB-47 onboard radar loses the object from their scopes. At least once, the UFO suddenly reappears visually at about the same time the ground radar regains tracking of the object. The main part of the incident occupies 30 minutes over the Fort Worth, Texas, area from 5:30–6:00 a.m. Some earlier ELINT and visual incidents are noted as early as about 4:30 a.m., but they catch the crew off guard, and consequently reports at the time and later recollections have had to be carefully reconstructed. The UFO may have trailed the RB-47 up to 6:40 a.m. following the main events, for a total duration of possibly more than 126 minutes. The RB

\-47 incident is the first conclusive instrumented proof for the existence of UFOs. Calibrations of the RB-47’s electronic measurements provide an irrefutable case. When the Colorado Project scientists asked the Air Force for the Blue Book file on the RB-47 case, the file could not be found. Ultimately, the case was put together by better file searching at Blue Book, [James E. McDonald](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._McDonald&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923108651&usg=AOvVaw0rj3N1m-TZtsmS_P9G3TMt)’s success at locating several crew members and interviewing them, and FOIA searches that located more of the lost documents.

July 25 — 4:00 a.m. Several workers are taking a break at the Daye Steel Plant in Huangshi, Hubei, China, when they hear a humming sound. They notice a bright spot in the clear sky that is increasing in apparent size. As it comes closer, it is seen as a circular plate giving off a dazzling white light and leaving a white trail. It flies above the observers at an altitude of 3,300 feet and produces a whistling sound that is louder than a jet. As the object approaches the witnesses, the low pitch changes to a high pitch.

July 30 — 10:30 a.m. Jack Stephenson is walking his dog four miles south of Galt, Ontario, when he sees an aluminum- colored object with a dome. It circles, stops, and hovers, then lands in a gulley surrounded by woods. He watches it for 45 minutes as it hovers about 2 feet off the ground. It finally takes off at a 45° angle to avoid a power line, then shoots away. Local residents examine the area and find burned patches on the ground and small tree limbs that are broken. There are four burned or charred areas, each about 1 foot 3 inches in diameter, forming a four- sided figure with these measurements: 20 feet x 20 feet x 6.5 feet x 11.5 feet. Two large three-toed prints are also found, but the relationship of the prints to the object is unknown.

August — Night. A young woman is driving home after work in Peru, Indiana, and notices people standing along the road looking at the sky. She stops, and they point to a large black object hovering above some nearby trees at about 100 feet. It is about 1,000 feet long and has a “soft delta” shape with rounded corners and window-like lighted areas underneath. There seems to be movement within the lighted areas. In the middle of the bottom is a round area that looks like it might be the outline of an entryway. It moves slowly away, making a noise like a quiet vacuum cleaner. (Michael D.

At 7:56 p.m., the IFF target becomes a direct radar “skinpaint.” At 8:02 p.m., the IFF equipment APX-6/APX-7 is turned off, but the target is still tracked on airborne radar. At 8:15 p.m., the target is at a 2 o’clock position 10 miles away when the aircraft starts a right turn to reverse course, putting the target dead ahead. It suddenly takes off to the northwest at very high speed, disappearing 58 miles away. Radar contact is regained at 8:18 p.m. as the target is tracked moving right to left, crossing in front of the aircraft again, and closing distance to 8 miles at 11 o’clock. At 8:20 p.m., the target turns to head on a parallel path. The crew loses contact at 8:24 p.m., 15 miles behind the plane. No visual confirmation.

August 4 — An Italian Air Force noncommissioned officer on duty in the control tower at Naples International Airport, Italy, and about 30 other witnesses see a number of luminous, disc-shaped objects passing above them. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, p. 80)

August 5 — 10:00 p.m. Policeman Ernst W. Akerberg and his wife Karin are at their summer cottage on the island of Gotland, Sweden, in the Baltic Sea when they see a disc-shaped object heading toward them from the sea. When it reaches the shore about 600 feet away, the object changes course and executes a sharp turn at less than 90° of arc and turns on its edge, swaying briefly. The disc moves toward the southeast and makes another sharp turn just over a half-mile away, again turning on its edge and fluttering before passing out of view. A second, smaller object approaches and goes through the same maneuvers. Air currents from both objects make the water surface ripple and the treetops swing. Estimated to be about 80 feet in diameter, the objects seem to be made of shining metal, and the upper part rotates slowly over the lower part. Both objects have a kind of tube with two red lights. They are silent except for a hollow clicking sound.

August 20 or 22 — A member of the Argentine Air Force guarding a downed aircraft is in a tent near Quilinos, Córdoba, Argentina, when he hears a high-pitched hum. Dashing out, he sees a disc slowly descending, making the grass and plants flutter wildly. Reaching for his revolver, he feels that something is preventing him from drawing his weapon, which seems glued in his holster. A voice from the disc tells him in Spanish that spacecraft have a base in the Salta region and that they are here to warn about nuclear energy. The craft rises vertically and speeds off to the north.

Former KGB officer Stanislav Lekarev claims, however, that Khokhlov is poisoned by radioactive polonium (not thallium), exactly as Litvinenko is later.

Early September — Several people fishing near Ubatuba, São Paulo, Brazil, watch a disc dive down from the sky and explode, showering the area with flaming fragments. One of the witnesses writes an anonymous letter and sends three pieces to O Globo, but no witnesses to the event have ever come forward. APRO representative [Olavo T.](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%2520States/APRO%2520Bulletin/APRO%2520Bulletin%2520-%25201968%252005%252000%2520-%2520May-June.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923140550&usg=AOvVaw27o2GcH1l9_lGE5EaO_WMg) [Fontes](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%2520States/APRO%2520Bulletin/APRO%2520Bulletin%2520-%25201968%252005%252000%2520-%2520May-June.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923140795&usg=AOvVaw0BFK6Sn8pkHGNi5Jm_zY4S) examines the fragments, which are dull gray, irregular, and strongly oxidized. One sample is shot through with microscopic cracks and shows a fissure running through two-thirds of its length. All three have whitish smears of a powdery substance like cinders. Fontes takes one sample to the Mineral Production Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture for analysis, which shows it to be “magnesium of a high degree of purity.” Chemist Luisa Maria A. Barbosa, who conducts a spectrographic analysis, says that not even trace elements are apparent. Fontes also has it analyzed by chemist Elson Teixeira and the Brazilian Army. The Laboratory of Crystallography conducts some X-ray diffraction work. All conclude that the material is pure magnesium, while one gives it a density of 1.866 (normal magnesium is 1.741). APRO sends a second fragment to the US Air Force, which accidentally destroys it. The third sample is sent to the Colorado Project in February 1968. [Roy Craig](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/ufo-investigator-isu-alumnus-dead/article_d3e1f4e4-28e6-5600-bff7-846c287c3b6b.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923141306&usg=AOvVaw0siTP-mDlSgn_gERszZm9H) runs tests on it at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the IRS in Washington and Dow Chemical’s Metallurgical Laboratory. Both determine that the level of purity is not as high as was determined in 1957 (although this is now seen as a major misrepresentation of the actual results). APRO does two further tests with University of Arizona metallurgical engineer Walter A. Walker and Robert W. Johnson of the Materials Research Corporation at Orangeburg, New Jersey. Walker and Johnson both find that the sample “had undergone a directional crystal growth type of manufacture.” Walker concludes that the material was likely exposed to the earth’s atmosphere at elevated temperatures.

September — 3:00 p.m. Hélio Penteado and his foreman Zaca Sabiá are repairing a fence on Penteado’s farm in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil, when Sabiá’s dog begins growling at something in the mint field. They hear a loud, irritating sound and see a disc about 50 feet wide landing in the field and supported by three legs with spheres on the end that pierce the ground. Penteado goes closer to investigate and sees two beings about 4 feet tall leave the UFO wearing green coveralls. They seem to float along the ground and take a vessel from under the craft. One of them is carrying something like a gun or flamethrower. They pass through a fence on the way to a river. After 10 minutes the beings return with the vessel apparently full of river water. The entity with the flamethrower shoots it at a jacaranda tree and a eucalyptus tree, damaging their trunks. They reenter the object via the dome, which takes off toward the city. Back at his barn, Penteado notices that all his metallic tools are stacked in a cone, the birds are dead, his monkey is agitated, and his watch has stopped working. The same day, people observe a UFO over a hospital on the Avenida Julio Mesqita, where the object dumps two drops of liquid metal that falls in the street.

The UFO goes so low that it hits the corner of a parked truck. An analysis of the metal by an unnamed organization (possibly the Brazilian Air Force) shows that the metal is high in magnesium. Penteado later goes to the landing site and takes plaster casts of the footprints, which he sends to the Agronomy Institute of Campinas.

Near Granada they turn to head to Portalegre, Portugal. At this point, Ferreira notices a UFO like a bright star with a scintillating, colored nucleus that changes from deep green to blue. The object suddenly grows to 5 or 6 times its original size, then shrinks to a barely visible yellow point. These changes repeat several times, possibly due to changes in position. The UFO maintains its position 90° to the left of the squadron. Suddenly a small circle of yellow light emerges from the object and three smaller yellow objects appear, maneuver, then disappear.

September 20 — 3:05 p.m. A national defense alert is called when the first of two or three supersonic objects, varying in speed for the next 30 minutes from 800 to 12,000 mph and varying in altitude from 50,000 to 135,000 feet, is picked up over the Atlantic by NORAD radar at Montauk, New York. A second (or same) UFO heads straight toward SAC headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, in what is perceived as a threat trajectory potentially aiming for a nuclear knockout kill of the entire US nuclear force. At 3:10 p.m., interception is attempted by two F-102 jets from Kinross AFB \[now Chippewa County International Airport\] south of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and later from Truax AFB \[now Truax Field Air National Guard Base\] northeast of Madison, Wisconsin. At 3:24 p.m., another UFO joins the first on a similar trajectory 150 miles behind. It passes over Ontario, Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa. The UFO sends radio replies to IFF interrogation signals, on different frequencies, confirming its location on the radar plots and making it impossible to explain as a malfunction or interference. Interception is impossible at these speeds and altitudes. SAC goes on high alert and apparently launches nuclear bombers toward

October 4 — The USSR launches the first artificial earth satellite, [Sputnik 1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923155522&usg=AOvVaw1nZRMmzezF1hthmHyw-RHI), which transmits radio pulses for 21 days. Some 4% of Americans claim to have seen Sputnik in orbit. However, what most are actually seeing is the 100- foot-long R-7 rocket core stage, outfitted with reflective panels that make it a first magnitude object, trailing 600 miles behind the 22-inch satellite until October 26 when the batteries run out. The satellite is barely visible at sixth magnitude.

Six other observers also watch the object, which measures approximately 3 minutes in diameter along its major axis and 1 minute along its minor axis. Smaller flat-white or silver-white objects, as many as 6–10, seem to emerge from the primary object as observations continue. The smaller objects are apparently short traces of light at some times and semi-wedge-shaped at other times. The smaller objects disappear from the field of the telescope until only the original object is visible, and it disappears as if moving directly away. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, p. 80)

October 8 — Day. Four Fijians in a punt with an outboard motor off Nabouwalu, Viti Levu, Fiji, see a white, circular object, which is hovering about 20 feet above the ocean. They approach it. It appears to be revolving, and they can see the figure of a man standing on the outside. The figure shines a blinding light at their boat, which makes them feel dazed and weak. As they draw closer, the figure disappears and the object rises rapidly upward, disappearing straight up. R. O. Aveling, an official of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, sees a similar object at the same time but at a different location. It is hovering at about 5,000 feet and swinging in a balloon-like fashion. Its color varies from bright white to deep, flashing red.

October 9 — 7:24 p.m. The tower operator at Naval Air Station South Weymouth \[now the Shea Field Naval Aviation Historical Museum\], Massachusetts, sights a constant, conical, greenish-blue object with a phosphorescent glow through binoculars. In sight approximately 90 seconds, the observer sees no navigation lights. It is traveling faster than a jet plane on a track from northeast to south-southwest. The object comes out of the horizon and toward the end of its path makes three “crazy” gyrations then vanishes, possibly behind cloud cover. The object has no trail like a meteor. (Walter N. Webb, “Allen Hynek As I Knew Him,” IUR 18, no. 1 (Jan./Feb. 1993): 7)

October 10 — The coffee truck driven by Miguel Espanhol Navarrete and his driver stalls northwest of Ceres near Quebra Coco, Goiás, Brazil, as a UFO lands nearby. They see an intense light as they begin a steep ascent, and then realize that the flying object appears to be more than 600 feet long. It lights up the entire area, even though it is gliding at a great height. The driver panics and tries to speed away, but the truck’s engine stalls as the object approaches and flies over the vehicle about 130 feet away. The object is about 3 feet in diameter by 40 inches high and is unevenly oval, with the upper section greater than the lower section. It looks like two superimposed plates separated by a strip 65 feet thick. When it is at an altitude of 20 feet, the UFO stops in the air and its light goes out. It lands, a door opens, and seven apparently human people come out dressed in luminous suits. Then the crew reenters the UFO and takes off, stopping at about 1,650 feet altitude. At that moment a smaller object detaches itself from the larger one and flies north. The larger object follows in a southeasterly direction. Navarrete is interviewed by Judge Gabriel Barbosa de Andrade, then-Secretary of the Interior and justice of the State of Goiás; Joaquim Neves Pereira; and Antenor Gomes, then-Secretary of Public Security for Goiás.

October 14 — 7:00 p.m. The Naval Air Station North Island tower in San Diego, California, directs a Navy S2F-1Tracker anti-submarine aircraft toward a bright light over Point Loma.

October 15 — Afternoon. Robert Moudy sees a glowing object hovering above his combine in Franklin County, Indiana, at about 1,500 feet. It appears to be silver and platter-shaped, perhaps 12 feet in diameter, with a pink flame coming from its base. It makes a loud whirring noise as it hovers. When it starts ascending at a 22° angle, its color changes from pink to light blue and the combine stops working. He notices two stalled cars on a nearby road.

They see a flash of light to the right of the road. Then a 200-foot-long, 6-foot-wide blue rocket-shaped object, with yellow flame and white smoke coming from the rear, rises up out of the field, heads straight toward their truck, passes directly overhead at about 200 feet with a loud thundering roar, a rush of wind, and great heat. Their truck engine dies and the headlights to go out. The UFO disappears in the east towards Levelland. The lights come back on spontaneously and the engine restarts. A frightened Saucedo calls the occurrence in to Patrolman A. J. Fowler of the Levelland sheriff’s office. At Pettit, Texas, the same night, two grain combines, each with two engines, fail as a UFO passes overhead.

November 3 — 12:05 a.m. Texas Tech college student Newell H. Wright is driving west one mile west of Smyer, Texas, when the ammeter gauge on his car dashboard starts fluctuating widely. The car motor gradually goes out then the headlights and radio die. He gets out to check and sees a white or aluminum-colored, oval-shaped object flat on the bottom like a loaf of bread, with a bluish-green tint, about 75–125 feet long. After a few minutes, the object suddenly rises up from the road ahead and ascends almost vertically at great speed slightly to the north, disappearing in seconds. Afterward the car can start again.

November 4 — 1:30 a.m. Chief Pilot Captain Jean Vincent de Beyssac and his copilot are flying a Varig Airlines C-46 cargo plane from Porto Alegre to São Paulo, Brazil. They are near Araranguá, Santa Catarina, when de Beyssac notices a red light on his left. It seems to be getting bigger, so he banks towards it out of curiosity. The light gets much bigger then begins to glow more brilliantly. The pilot and copilot smell smoke and, as they are looking for the source, the light disappears. De Beyssac returns to Porto Alegre. It turns out that the right engine’s magneto (or generator), automatic direction finder, and the radio (both receiver and transmitter) have burnt out, allegedly simultaneously.

November 4 — 2:00 a.m. Two sentries at the Fortaleza de Itaipu in Praia Grande, São Paulo, Brazil, watch an orange object approaching the fort. It holds its course until it is directly above them. Its diameter is at least as large as the wingspan of a DC-3 and scarcely 300 feet away. Suddenly there is a strange buzzing noise and the men feel a wave of glowing heat. One of them collapses on the spot, but the other succeeds in reaching safety in the shadow of the gun emplacements. His shouts of alarm rouse his comrades inside the fort, where the lights suddenly go out. In the meantime, the emergency power is switched on but immediately gives out. Only a few minutes after the alarm, two other men are out of the fort and at their sides. They too see the UFO, which is now heading out to sea. It leaves a luminous trail as it shoots away across the Atlantic. The two sentries are taken to a hospital in Rio de Janeiro. They suffer second and third-degree burns on large areas of their body, chiefly in areas covered by clothing. Afterwards, Brazilian Army and USAF personnel, along with investigators of the Brazilian Air Force, fly to the fort to interview them. There is some reason to think that [Olavo T.

November 4 — 1:10 p.m. James W. Stokes, electronics technician at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, is driving on US 54 about 8 miles south of Orogrande, New Mexico. The car radio fades, and the car slows as if the battery is failing. Stokes notices 6–12 cars ahead of him have also stopped and drivers are out looking at the sky (looking behind him to the northeast), including a Mr. Duncan and Allan D. Baker. Stokes stops and gets out, sees a pearl-white oval or egg-shaped object about 500 feet wide with a slight purplish tinge heading south at an estimated speed of 1,500–2,000 mph. It is below the elevation angle of the Sacramento Mountains ridgeline, descending from about 5,000 feet above ground level in a shallow dive to about 1,500–2,500 feet altitude as it swerves to pass to the south of Stokes and the other stopped cars. At its closest it is about 2–5 miles away. It then circles around headed west and disappears. The same or another object appears in the northeast (as if the object has completely circled) and performs the same rounded course but passing farther to the south of the parked cars and disappears in the west. Duncan takes a 35mm film of the object. Stokes notices a wave of heat from the object at closest approach. Later that evening he is sunburned, but it clears up the next day. The Air Force calls it a hoax based on the Levelland sightings.

November 4 — 7:30 p.m. A Texas state border inspector is driving 3 miles southeast of El Paso Airport in Texas when his car engine stalls and the headlights go dim then out. He gets out and notices an object approaching that is making a whirring sound like an artillery shell. It passes above his car at about 150 feet, heading west and changing altitude occasionally. When it gets to the Franklin Mountains, it lifts into the air vertically.

November 4 — 10:00 p.m. Jan Boucher, a policeman in Kodiak, Alaska, sees a red ball of fire with a greenish-yellow trail as he is patrolling on Mission Road. It apparently moves 50 feet above a nearby school. He tries to radio in a report but his radio gets interference for 2 minutes after the sighting.

November 4 — 10:45 p.m. CAA air traffic controllers R. M. Kaser and E. G. Brink see a highly maneuverable 15–20-foot egg-shaped object with a white light at its base circle over one end of Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at 150–200 mph. It comes down in a steep 30° dive as if landing on Runway 26 to the north of the tower at about 1,500 feet. Radar tracks part of this maneuver. The object then crosses the flight line, runways, and taxiways heading towards the tower at about 50 mph and 20–30 feet above ground, observed through 7x binoculars until it reaches about 3,000 feet near the northeast corner of the flood-lit restricted Manzano Nuclear Weapons Storage Area and a B-58 bomber service site. It hovers for 20–60 seconds, then heads east again at about 200–300 feet altitude. Suddenly it shoots up in a steep climb. Controllers contact Radar Approach Control, which tracks the object on CPN-18 radar traveling east, then turning south, circling the Albuquerque Low Frequency Range Station. It then heads north, disappearing at 10 miles and reappearing 20 minutes later to follow 1/2 mile behind a USAF C-46 that has just taken off to the south. It continues for 14 miles until both go off the scope. A hovering radar target then appears to the north over an outer marker for 90 seconds before fading.

He is soon escorted inside the spaceship, which turns out to be crewed by completely human-looking space aliens, four males and two females, who apparently speak perfect German and claim to be from the planet Saturn. They also claim to be interested in the recently launched Russian sputniks and the satellite-launching plans of the US. Later Schmidt brings local police to view the landing site, where they find deep imprints and some “mysterious green residue.” Schmidt also claims subsequent visits to the spaceship and many friendly conversations with its learned crew. Schmidt notices they drink MJB brand coffee, and also carry in their cigar-shaped craft an ordinary terrestrial MG sports car, which they use for running errands and buying groceries. (A schematic drawing of the ship’s interior in Schmidt’s later booklet depicts a Volkswagen Beetle.) Unlike most spaceships, the Saturnian ship has large propellers at both ends. Eventually Schmidt gets a ride up to earth orbit and a tour of the mother ship. On October 26, 1961, Schmidt is convicted in Oakland, California, for grand theft after bilking a widow out of $5,000 for a worthless mining venture in Tulare County, where he claims to have seen huge quartz crystals from a spaceship.

November 5 — 6:30 p.m. Larry and Marilynn Beaman are driving near Antioch, Illinois, when they notice a ball of fire fluctuating from white to yellow pacing their car on the right side, about 1,000 feet up. It goes out for a time then switches back on. At its largest, it seems 30 feet in diameter. It follows them all the way to Ringwood and then lands in some trees behind a school building two blocks from where they live. It glitters like a welder’s arc and makes a sound like water swishing. Beaman rounds up some other witnesses and goes back to the landing site, but the object takes off, changes to purple, and moves away to the southwest. TV sets in town dim, finally losing both picture and sound during the same time period.

November 5 — 11:00 p.m. Two young men see a red light north of US Highway 62 at a point 38 miles west of Hobbs, New Mexico. They watch for 9–10 minutes, thinking it is an oil flare, but the light suddenly rises straight up. After pacing their car for a few minutes, the light turns toward the car, passes over it, and hovers over the Permian Basin Pipeline plant. As it passes overhead, the car engine sputters, then dies, and the lights go out. After the men coast the car down the road, the motor restarts and they drive away. The battery is found to be dead the following morning and the dashboard clock is stopped.

November 6 — Just after 12:00 midnight. A taxicab company owner, Joe Martinez, and one of his drivers, Alberto Gallegos, sees a UFO approach them in Santa Fe, New Mexico. They hear a humming sound as it comes close. The object is egg-shaped and multicolored. As it passes over their car, the engine stalls and the dashboard clock stops. The UFO then pulls up and moves rapidly into the southeast. One witness later discovers that his wristwatch has also stopped at the time of sighting.

November 6 — 5:40 a.m. Richard Kehoe is driving along Vista Del Mar in Playa Del Rey, California, when his engine fails. Two other cars on the highway are also affected, and the drivers (Ronald Burke and Joe Thomas) all get out. They see an egg-shaped object that seems to be wrapped in a blue haze. It is tan or cream-colored and has two metallic rings around it. Two smallish men, about 5 feet 5 inches tall and wearing black leather pants, a white belt, and a light-colored jersey, exit the object. They ask Kehoe and the others where they are and what time it is in something approaching English. They walk back to the object, which takes off. After it leaves, Kehoe’s car starts with no problem.

November 6 — 5:00 p.m. Two Malay fisherman are in a waterway near Bagansiapiapi, Sumatra, Indonesia, when they see a black and red object swiftly approaching their boat and trailing black and greenish smoke. The top and bottom of the object are curved like discs. When it is 60 feet away it stops in mid-air about 35 feet above the water, and the bottom part continues to rotate as the water foams below it. The object is a triangular shape and white smoke is coming out from each point. The object speeds up and disappears, leaving behind black and greenish smoke lines. (Marler 133)

Outside, they see a glowing, yellow-white sphere 2–3 miles away to the southwest. It remains in place for 15 minutes. During this time the radio goes off, and one of the men’s shortwave radios is working on only one frequency that emits a strong, rapidly modulated tone that sounds like, but is not, Morse code.

November 6 — 11:30 p.m. Olden J. Moore is driving home in Montville, Ohio, when he sees an object like a bright meteor split into two pieces, one of which heads straight up. The other becomes larger while its color changes from bright white to blue green. It hovers about 200 feet above a field and lands with a soft whirring sound, perhaps 500 feet away. Moore watches cautiously for 15 minutes, then approaches it. The UFO is shaped like a “covered dish,” and is about 50 feet in diameter, 15 feet high, with a cone on top about 10 feet high. It is pulsating slowly, and a haze surrounds it. Moore goes home to get another witness (his wife) but when they return the UFO is gone.

Another report claims that Vanguard and Federal Communications Commission watchers at 18 monitoring stations throughout the Western Hemisphere are picking up signals at

14.286 megacycles, possibly connected with Sputnik 2. The signal is a long note of low pitch followed after a few

November 7 — 7:46 p.m. Bright, flashing objects hover for 30 minutes over the Atomic Energy Commission’s Pantex Plant 15 miles east of Amarillo, Texas. The UFOs are reported to the State Highway Patrol office by plant guards, and a patrolman dispatched to the plant arrives at 8:15 p.m. and sees a strange light. Guards at the plant are “all shook up” from watching three objects floating 50 feet above the ground. One of the objects apparently lands on Farin Road 2373, three miles north of Highway 60. Guards tell the patrolman they tried to approach the objects by turning off their lights, “but the things would just slip away from them when they got near.” They are unable to estimate the size of the objects but seem positive “they saw more than just lights.” (NICAP, “[Lights Shake Up](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/571107amarillo_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923246744&usg=AOvVaw0PE7-RP4XXHOOzlxESV1Uh) [Guards at Nuclear Plant](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/571107amarillo_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923247008&usg=AOvVaw1HhSoRjfhxN-TD4cujjiK1)”; [Sparks](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nicap.org/bb/BB_Unknowns.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923247247&usg=AOvVaw2_dsRdgAEs-0KzsHqfnh6x)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nicap.org/bb/BB_Unknowns.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923247435&usg=AOvVaw0YG56Uh0yG3akbWs3gNlMA) p. 258)

In September 1958, the spaceman informs her that she is pregnant, which is apparently true, as she gives birth on June 2, 1958, to a boy with blond hair that she and her husband Ron name Matthew.

November 17 — An Air Force car with two officers comes to UFO witness Olden Moore’s house in Montville, Ohio. He is told they are taking him to Washington, D.C., for extended questioning. They drive him to a waiting airplane, which stops briefly at Wright-Patterson AFB to pick up one officer and drop another off. In Washington, Moore is housed in a building said to be a federal courthouse \[US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces?\]. He is kept there and interrogated for several days. Officers watch him constantly, even when he is sleeping. Toward the end of his stay, Moore is shown slides of UFO photos and a UFO film taken from inside a military plane. Moore is asked to sign a document that swears him to secrecy.

November 21 — Night. Frank Dickenson and two friends are driving up Reasty Hill near the village of Silpho, North Yorkshire, England, when their car stalls and they see a glowing object in the sky that appears to fall to the ground on a ridge above Broxa Forest. Dickenson leaves the car with a flashlight, climbs up a bank, and finds in a patch of bracken a metallic saucer shaped like a “large flattish spinning top,” 18 inches in diameter and weighing 33 pounds. As he returns to tell his friends, he passes a young couple walking toward the scene. When the tree men return to search for it, the disc is gone. Dickenson places an advertisement in a Scarborough newspaper about the disc, and he is able to recover it for £10 from a man who claims he was the mystery man on the moor. Photos taken by UFO researcher John Dale show that the copper base of the object is inscribed with a mystery script. The top of the disc is made from layers of laminated metal that has been painted with a white substance. The two halves are stuck together with a grayish substance resembling cellulose, and a pencil-thick iron rod runs through a “white metal bearing” in the top. When the bearing is drilled out, they find a heap of ash inside the cavity, as well as pieces of fused glass and a tightly rolled cylinder of copper. Also inside is a tiny booklet of 17 sheets of thin copper foil fastened at one edge. The booklet is engraved with script similar to that found on the outside. The coded script is translated by a café proprietor from Scarborough named Philip Longbottom, who claims the 2,000- word inscription is from an alien named Ulo, with later text added by an apparently female companion named Tarngee. A metallurgist at the University of Manchester analyzes the disc and finds the outer casing is made primarily from lead, and the copper foil is triple laminated an unusually free from impurities.

November 23 — 6:10 p.m. Fighter pilot 1st Lt. Joseph F. Long’s car engine stalls 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nevada. He hears a high-pitched whining noise and sees four 50-foot, domed, saucer-shaped UFOs landed on the right side of the road about 900–1,200 feet away. They are glowing brightly and equipped with three landing gears. Long estimates they are about 10–15 feet tall. When he approaches to within 50 feet of the closest object, the hum increases in intensity and Long’s ears begin to hurt. The objects take off abruptly, retracting the landing gears.

The rise about 50 feet into the air and proceed across the highway to the north at about 10 mph. The total time of the sighting is 20 minutes. Shallow, bowl-shaped ground impressions in the shape of a triangle are found at the landing site.

The fireball bursts like fireworks, seen by others on the island as well as Scotland. The crew notices that the white paint on the metal railings at the edge of the boat has disappeared, leaving only the red undercoating. At daybreak, however, the paintwork is perfectly normal again.

December 3 — 7:00 p.m. Many residents of the Menastash Ridge area of Ellensburg, Washington, watch a “strange ball of fire” for 20 minutes. A truck driver sees the light hovering above his truck, causing the motor to cough and sputter. His engine does not stop completely, however, so he drives away. The night is misty, but the object is so bright that it lights up the sky as if it were daytime.

December 7 — 10:00 p.m. In western Victoria and eastern South Australia, witnesses see a moon-like object explode with a vivid flash. Unexpected blackouts are reported in the area. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, p. 87)

December 8 — 5:30 p.m. A disc-shaped UFO with a dome and three pads on the underside suddenly comes toward a car with three passengers at Woodward, Oklahoma. The car heater, wipers, and radio fail and finally the car stalls out as the UFO hovers overhead at 200 feet. It emits a high-pitched whining sound. It is over 50 feet in diameter and has portholes. The whine increases in pitch after about two minutes, and the UFO rises vertically out of sight. The headlights come on and the engine of the car starts by itself. The driver spends 4 hours with two officers from Kirtland AFB in New Mexico who tell him of similar observations.

December 8 — 9:00 p.m. Eight people traveling together in two cars on Highway 17 between Coulee City and Soap Lake, Washington, see a huge, fiery object pass overhead from north to south. Both cars stall out and their headlights also fail as the UFO passes overhead. In addition, the inside dome lights come on, even though they aren’t turned on. The cars remain stalled until the object passes out of sight. Police say the object stalled as many as six cars along that sparsely traveled road.

December 11 — Night. Mexican pilot Gilberto Castillo del Valle is flying at 10,000 feet near Mexico City when a brilliant light illuminates his cockpit. He turns off the aircraft lights and sees a large luminous object darting from left to right and back again ahead of him. Passengers and crew also see the light, as do personnel at the Mexico City control tower. (Lorenzen, UFOs; The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, p. 88)

December 15 — 1:00–2:00 a.m. Three young men see a huge light in the sky at Almind, Denmark. It is oval-shaped, emits red or orange rays, and appears to be descending. They watch it for 18–19 minutes as it hovers at a 10° angle and quivers. Suddenly it becomes still and from its center emerge two small objects that drift away in a northerly direction and soon disappear. The large object lies on its side and quivers some more. Later it ascends and a fan-shaped tail of light spreads after it. The UFO is seen later along the coast and photographed.

December 21 — 6:30 p.m. Yvonne Torres de Mendonça, her three small children, and a servant are traveling in a jeep driven by her mechanic, Marcio Gonçalves, towards Ponta Porã, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, along the Paraguayan border. They see a large ball of light about the size of the full moon that starts moving toward them, and they realize that it is two lights flying silently side by side. The lights straddle the road, oscillating from one side to the other in a strange wobbling motion and spinning on their axes. One of them stops in mid-air and dives toward the ground in a falling-leaf motion 60 feet ahead of them, while the other maneuvers in circles around the jeep. The lights are spherical and encircled by a Saturn-like ring at the center. The upper hemisphere and rim are fiery red, while the lower hemisphere is silvery white. The two objects follow the jeep for 2 hours, all the way to town, maneuvering intelligently around them, especially when the jeep stops twice to evaluate the objects. (Olavo

December 30 — Night. George Chowanski is cutting wood at his home in Schooley’s Mountain, New Jersey, when his two dogs begin to bark and howl. He hears a whirring noise like an electric shaver that persists for one minute. Then he sees a saucer-shaped object, 5 feet high and 15 feet wide, hovering about 2 feet above the ground in a grove of trees 100 feet from the back porch. Three individuals come out of the craft and walk about in the clearing. One of them bends over to pick something up and carries something heavy back to the object. After 2–3 minutes, it slowly rises, spiraling through the tall trees, and flies off. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, pp. 88–89)

1958

beyond question, and the ‘psychological’ explanations seem to have misfired”). Michel contends that each day’s sightings, when plotted on a map, occur along straight-line paths, even though different objects seem to figure in each sighting. The alignments, which he calls “orthotenic lines,” do not necessarily correspond to a trajectory.

1958 — Night. A sergeant in charge of a fire truck crash crew at an air base in South Korea is positioned near the runway awaiting an emergency landing by an American jet fighter low on fuel. The men see a bright light approaching from across the Yellow Sea. It grows bigger and, within several hundred yards of the shore, stops and hovers. The control tower operators, watching the object through binoculars, do not know what it is. Suddenly the object shines a beam of light straight down on the water. It soon goes out, but the water remains luminescent for a while before fading out. The object again shines a light on the water and turns it off a minute or so later. By this time, the jet that is low on fuel is landing. A second jet is asked to check out the object, which instantly shoots back toward China and disappears in seconds.

January — The US Senate Committee on Government Operations asks to meet with representatives from the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Legislative Action to discuss the possibility of holding open hearings on the Air Force UFO program. USAF fears “uncontrolled publicity,” but agrees to go along with it.

January — 1:30 a.m. A woman is driving along the New York State Thruway near Niagara Falls, New York, when she sees an illuminated 50-foot pole in the center parkway ahead. It seems to be retracting and getting shorter. As she closes in on it, her engine stops and the headlights go out. The pole is attached to a saucer-shaped object, and she sees shadowy figures floating around it. The UFO rises and moves away, and she starts the car again. An area of snow a foot in diameter has melted dry where the pole has been. (Michael D. Swords, “Messing Around with the Force,” IUR 31, no. 4 (Mar. 2008): 16)

January 3 — Cliff DeLacey, a 23-year-old college student from Vallejo, California, shoots 90 seconds of film of UFOs at Diamond Head, Hawaii. DeLacey sees nine UFOs flashing across the sky and immediately grabs his camera. He is careful enough to shoot the tops of nearby trees, allowing a reference to the height and relative speed of the unknown objects. The objects appear to be about 3–4 miles away from the camera, flying at an altitude of 7,000– 8,000 feet, and moving at a speed slightly greater than that of a jet. The silvery globules appear to be no more than 20 feet in diameter. They are spherical, and no tail fins or protrusions of any kind are visible. The film, in color, is said to be clear and to show at least two of the nine UFOs in considerable detail.

January 10 — Day. Capt. Chrysólogo Rocha is sitting with his wife on the porch of a house in Guarujá, São Paulo, Brazil, overlooking the South Atlantic. He is trying to focus with his binoculars on what appears to be a small island.

When he does get focused, he realizes the island is getting bigger and is in two parts, both a clear, gray color. One part is in the sea, while the other seems suspended above it. Without warning, both parts suddenly sink out of sight. Shortly afterwards, a steamer comes into view, on a course that will take it very close to the object. About 15 minutes later, when the ship is out of sight, the object again rises slowly out of the sea. He now sees clearly that the two parts are joined by several narrow upright shafts or tubes that are bright and visible to the naked eye. These shafts, “like beads on a necklace” pass in a “disorderly and simultaneous movement.” Shortly afterwards the two parts of the object close up again, and it disappears below the waves. Probably an inferior mirage of an island in combination with a towering effect.

January 13 — 11:45 p.m. Brian Crittenden sees a dome-shaped light with a long narrow light underneath coming directly towards him as he is leaving a friend’s house southwest of Casino, New South Wales, Australia. He jumps into his car and heads home. The UFO chases his car along Benns Road, practically touching the telephone poles. His car radio develops interference when the UFO approaches him. It follows him all the way to town, 7 miles away.

January 16 — Around 12:00 noon. As the International Geophysical Year research ship [Almirante Saldanha](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.naval.com.br/ngb/A/A044/A044.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923310143&usg=AOvVaw3Pir3bVVsqSbtwq6vwYYdd) is anchored on the south side of Ilha da Trindade, Brazil, 730 miles off the coast in the Atlantic Ocean, the commander and many crew members, including photographer Almiro Baraúna, see a Saturn-shaped object maneuvering over the island. It reportedly comes toward the island from the east, flies towards the Pico Desejado, makes a steep turn, and goes away very quickly to the northwest. Baraúna takes four photos with a Rolleiflex 2.8 model E. Commander [Paulo Moreira da Silva](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Moreira_da_Silva&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923310488&usg=AOvVaw2Xb6dfK7nM6vR33yAUYRrJ) of the Brazilian Navy Hydrography and Navigation Department (who technically outranks the ship’s captain, [José Santos de Saldanha da Gama](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%25C3%25A9_Santos_de_Saldanha_da_Gama&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923310747&usg=AOvVaw3qxuOAFQMOo-TY-k2EaMVP)), is apparently an eyewitness and states, “the object was encircled by a greenish glow, our \[meteorological\] balloon was of a red color.” Baraúna is officially there to take photos of the island, underwater photos, photos of the IGY activities, and the ship’s operations. The radar detection of an unexplained supersonic target reportedly occurs the day before, at about 12:05 p.m. There is a power failure on the ship when the object is seen; the power returns upon the object’s departure. Instruments like radio transmitters and apparatus with magnetic needles cease operating while the flying object remains in the island’s proximity.

He \[Baraúna\] replied that it hadn’t because all the electrical power aboard ship was out at the time. He was sure of the reality of the power outage because just before the object appeared a launch was being hauled up from the water by electric pulley, and it stopped midway just as the UFO appeared!” The ship’s log is provably incomplete since it does not even mention the UFO photo incident.

The two women are temporarily blinded. Their trip home to Albuquerque inexplicably takes 4 hours instead of the normal 2 hours. Both witnesses are exhausted and have burned or reddened areas on their skin, some on their kneecaps and the back of their lower legs, even though they have not left the car. Evans has a reddened area shaped like a triangle on her back. An acquaintance, Paul Boyett, has a Geiger counter, with which he gets a high radiation count from both women on February 19. The next day Evans, who is working in some capacity in civil defense, goes to her doctor at the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, to see about possible radiation burns and exposure. She overhears a comment about “178 roentgens” exposure, but the doctor says there is nothing to worry about. McIntosh’s symptoms (nausea, vomiting, rash) are initially more irritating but subside substantially, although both women have swellings in their lower legs, and both gain serious weight (some 50 pounds) over the next few months.

The next inhabited place is far away, so the travelers decide that the best thing to do is to sleep at that spot, beside the road.

It then descends in a falling-leaf pattern to about 12 feet. They can see it is about 60–75 feet in diameter with a rotating center section. Suddenly it climbs vertically to 600 feet, makes a tight circle, then tilts to 45° and makes a number of high-speed maneuvers, then descends again in a falling-leaf motion before shooting up vertically at tremendous speed. After this, the car starts easily and they proceed to Salvador. (Olavo T.

May 13 — 12:15 p.m. A Royal Canadian Air Force Dakota DC-3 is flying to RCAF Station Cold Lake, Alberta, from Victoria, British Columbia. When it changes its heading about 25 miles southwest of Calgary, Alberta, a large, thick, black cloud suddenly appears directly across their flight path at the same altitude. Their VHF communications with Cold Lake and Calgary suddenly cease working. The cloud has indistinct, hazy edges, and it increases in size as they approach at about 155 mph. The pilot unsuccessfully tries to radio Calgary to request a flight path change to avoid the cloud, which is now about 10 miles away. Suddenly he sees a brilliant white pinpoint of light materialize in the dark mass. It grows in size, forming a brilliant ball that quickly approaches the aircraft on a collision course. He braces himself, but the light disappears, and the black cloud vanishes. (Don Ledger, “Two Spherical UAP Cases Witnessed by Pilots in Canadian Airspace,” IUR 33, no. 2 (July 2010): 7–9)

Summer — At an unidentified Air Force base in the Southwest US, two jets are vectored in on two UFOs flying together as seen on radar. As the jets close in, one UFO disappears from the radarscope and quickly reappears behind the first jet. The first pilot reverses his course and again tries to close in. The UFO climbs out of range. The second pilot has the same difficulty with the other UFO.

July — Night. A 509th Refueling Mission is returning to an Air Force Base in New Hampshire \[Pease AFB in Portsmouth?\] from Goose Bay \[now CFB Goose Bay\], Labrador. The crew is flying a KC-97 at about 17,000– 18,000 feet. A light like a “moving star” appears. It approaches below the cloud cover and seems to be spherical and as bright as Venus. It soon becomes the apparent size of the Moon, lighting up the clouds above it. The light is a brilliant blue-white with two dark spots, possibly indicating a structure. The object angles upwards and speeds out of sight in 5 seconds. (Michael D. Swords, GrassRoots UFOs: Case Reports from the Timmerman Files, Fund for UFO Research, 2005, pp. 24–25)

July–September — A civilian in Washington, D.C., manages to repeatedly photograph “geometrically shaped flying objects as they passed between his telescope and the moon.” The photos are “remarkably clear and certainly indicated a phenomenon for which he had no ready explanation.” The writer of an October 1 memo, a CIA employee, requests advice on “how we might get our hands on these materials to examine them firsthand and to make a more complete analysis of them.” (ClearIntent, [pp. 136–137](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/clearintentgover00fawc/page/136/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923383929&usg=AOvVaw2LssGAr83c5QsqJokub1lS))

July 18 — 8:30 p.m. High-school student Chris Kauffman is gazing at the night sky in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he sees an object shaped like an equilateral triangle pass directly overhead in a north to south direction at 70–100 mph and 1,000 feet altitude for 10 seconds.

August — Polish Air Force pilot Apoloniusz Czernów of the 3rd Fighter Regiment in Warsaw, is returning from an attempted balloon interception in the area around Świdnica, Poland. Flying at 26,000 feet, he sees another possible balloon 9 miles away at a height of 3,200 feet and turns his MiG-17 toward it. But when he approaches it, he sees it is a cigar-shaped object tilted at a 45° angle, silvery-orange in color, and pulsating with a weird light. He gets closer and the object ascends at high speed, heads north, changes to orange-red, and disappears. Base radar has detected nothing. (Poland 63–64)

August 1 — The Teak thermonuclear test, part of Operation Hardtack I, is launched from Johnston Atoll in the North Pacific Ocean and carries a payload of 3.8 megatons. The warhead is carried on a Redstone missile, which has a “program failure,” causing it to go straight up and detonate directly above the island. In a sanitized film record of the event, men in flip-flops and shorts can be seen ducking for cover as a phenomenal fireball consumes the sky overhead. During the Teak test, all crew on and around Johnston Atoll are given protective eyewear to prevent flash blindness from the explosion. Besides the hazard of blindness, thermal radiation is another concern—even at an altitude of 50 miles. A crew member on Johnston at the time is said to have received a slight sunburn from the amount of thermal radiation that had reached the island. While only slight to the crew member, it creates issues for the local fauna. Many birds are seen in distress. Unsure if this is caused by blindness or thermal radiation, the project members decide to take precautions to protect local wildlife during the next test. The explosion can be seen from Hawaii 806 miles away and is said to be visible for almost half an hour. After the explosion, high- frequency, long-distance communication is interrupted across the Pacific. Due to this failure, Johnston Atoll personnel are unable to contact their superiors to advise of the test results until about 8 hours after the detonation. The detonation disturbs [Wernher Von Braun](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923390296&usg=AOvVaw3rJnS82DP1qqh7yIBKOsnJ) so greatly that he leaves the island shortly after comms are restored. The explosion causes the blue sky to turn red, white, and gray, and it creates an aurora 2,100 miles long along the geomagnetic meridian.

August 3 — 2:25 a.m. A sudden violet-orange brightness illuminates the sky over Rome, Italy, for about 3 seconds. Lights in the city dim, failing completely in some areas. Physician Angelo Corsi witnesses it 37 miles southeast of Rome in Sgurgola. After his car radio fails, and the house and streetlights go out, he sees a long whitish trail like a fan in the sky. At 2:22 a.m., in Rieti a sergeant and some guards see a yellow-green cigar-shaped object moving rapidly toward the southeast. It leaves a luminous trail that lights up roads, mountains, and houses for several seconds. A similar sight is seen in Naples.

August 16 — Around 5:00 p.m. Several persons on Lake Geneva, Switzerland, watch a bright light descending. It comes to hover about 45 feet above their boat.

He watches the object through 8x30 mm Japanese artillery-observer field glasses. It looks to be a Saturn-shaped grayish object like a “fried egg in pan.” Later it flips over, and another more elongated ring can be seen surrounding it. The object is about 60 feet long and is stationary for 5-8 minutes. However, the object is probably a Skyhook balloon launched from the University of Minnesota on August 17.

The tests are proposed by [Nicholas Christofilos](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Christofilos&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923398413&usg=AOvVaw1I0z7JfgaCkkUeuJ7mQLH9) in an unpublished paper of the Livermore branch \[now the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\] of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, as a means to verify the Christofilos effect, which argues that high-altitude nuclear detonations will create a radiation belt in the extreme upper regions of the Earth’s atmosphere (they do create artificial electron belts that persist several weeks), or an electronic pulse that could hypothetically damage the arming devices on Soviet ICBM warheads (they do not).

The object is oriented vertically with the blunter end highest. After several minutes, the object turns dull orange-red and becomes sharper in outline. A swarm of about 10 “black specks” appears to “cavort” around the lower end of the object for about one minute before disappearing. Then the cylindrical object begins to rotate counterclockwise and starts drifting slowly to the south from due west and drops in elevation angle over about 5 minutes. During the final 5-minute observation, the object continues angular descent and gradually decreases in angular size, but it begins rotating clockwise until it disappears by fading into the slight atmospheric haze. A USAF colonel takes several color photos with a 35mm camera on a tripod but later claims nothing came out. (Loren E.

September 21 — 3:00 a.m. Mrs. William H. Fitzgerald of Sheffield Lake, Ohio, sees through her east-facing bedroom window a metallic domed disc, 12–22 feet in diameter and 6 feet thick. It sweeps in over the front lawn heading north and descending in a falling-leaf oscillating motion to about 6 feet altitude, then crosses over her driveway, and stops for several seconds about 40 feet away. It then reverses course heading south and hovers 5 feet above the lawn about 25 feet away, making a jetlike sound. The object wobbles and emits gray smoke, makes two tight clockwise turns, then rises and takes off straight up over the house towards the east. Her 10-year-old son also observes the event from another room.

September 25 — The Project Moonwatch team in Portland, Oregon, is looking at the Moon when they see objects crossing the lunar disc. Occasionally they recognize the transit as a bird, but there are “tiny dark objects” that behave differently. All the object pass in the same direction and in the same location for about one second.

Supervisor Alex Geddes, who was not present, sends a supportive letter to the observers, thanking them for the data. (Michael D. Swords, “Gazing at the Moons,” IUR 32, no. 4 (October 2009): 15)

September 29 — 5:30 a.m. Pvt. Jerome A. Scanlon, stationed at Nike missile base W-93 in Derwood, Maryland, is walking from his sentry post to the barracks to sound reveille when he hears a humming sound above him. He looks up and sees a teardrop-shaped object 300 feet up and coming in for a landing at 30 mph. It moves over trees, breaking branches, and lands about 1.5 miles away. Exhaust flames issue from its rear, and its luminous green skin illuminates the terrain. It rises again and disappears. Scanlon runs to inform Riney Farris, the sergeant of the guard, who has also seen the object. They go to the landing site and find broken branches and a scorched strip of earth and vegetation about half a mile long. After the story appears in newspapers, the Air Force explains it as repair trucks doing welding jobs.

October 3 — 3:10 a.m. A Monon Railroad freight train is traveling between Owasco and Kirklin, Indiana, when a formation of four odd white lights crosses ahead of the train. The entire crew watch the UFOs turn and traverse the full length of the train, front to back (about a half mile). After passing the rear of the train, the objects swing east, turn back, and follow the train. The bright glow conceals their exact shape, but they appear flattened and sometimes fly on edge. The objects follow the train until the conductor shines a bright light on them. Immediately the objects speed away, but return quickly and continue to pace the train.

October 7 — 6:02 p.m. Chemist John R. Townsend, special assistant for research and engineering to the Assistant Secretary of Defense, sees a large, stationary, sharply outlined Saturn-shaped silvery object (with a “gossamer” surface appearance and a rim or girdle around its equator) in a clear sky in Alexandria, Virginia. It rapidly rises at an estimated speed of 1,000 mph and disappears to the south after 40 seconds. At one point a passing Capitol Airlines Flight 407 flies directly between his line of sight and the UFO at 2 miles distance, allowing him to estimate the UFO’s size as about 500 feet. Townsend reenacts the timing by walking the half block down Lee Street to get a better feeling for its distance and size.

November 4 — 9:03 p.m. The pilot of a KB-50 USAF tanker is in the downwind leg of the traffic pattern during a ground- controlled approach to Pope AFB \[now Pope Field\] in Fayetteville, North Carolina, when he notices an object on a collision course. He and his flight crew also notice that “strange lights were observed in his cockpit while he was on the final approach...” He executes a go-around maneuver and climbs in altitude to await the disappearance of the object. Air Force tower personnel also see the UFO hovering above the airport, watching it through their binoculars for 20 minutes. They are convinced it is not an atmospheric phenomenon.

November 9 — 10:00 p.m. Two carpenters, Stig Ekberg and Harry Sjöberg, are returning from Stockholm, Sweden, to their cabin on Väddö island, about 20 miles to the northeast. About 6 miles north of Älmstä their car engine begins to sputter and fail, and the headlights go out. They see a huge, shining object descending toward them and making a turn above Väddö Bay to the left of the road. It lands in the middle of the road about 300 feet in front of their car, its neon glow illuminating the landscape. They estimate it is 53 feet long and 20 feet high, with a bright glow underneath the object and a dazzling mist surrounding it. They watch the object for about 10 minutes, then it rises from the road and shoots into the sky to their right. Afterward, the air is stifling and hot, but the engine starts up right away. A few minutes later they return to the landing site and find flattened grass and a still-hot, smooth, triangular piece of metal the size of a matchbox, which they retrieve. They submit the metal to several labs over the next few years, apparently without ambiguous results, but in the process it is split into three pieces. Finally, an

engineer in Linköping named Schalin finds the metal has the hardness of sapphire and a specific weight of 15.2. It can take several thousand degrees C. heat without getting red hot. One of the pieces is submitted to the US Air Force and not returned.

November 11 — 1:35 a.m. A Mrs. Kinney, who is a Lt. Col. in the Civil Air Patrol in Topeka, Kansas, wakes up when her bedroom floods with an amber-colored light and her three dogs begin barking. The source is a 25-foot diameter sphere that is sitting on the walkway in the yard about 30 feet away. Kinney opens a door to go out on a porch, but the light zooms straight up and out of sight. She goes back to bed and the phone rings; it is a neighbor who has seen the light going toward her house. At 7:30 a.m., the phone rings again; this time it is the controllers at the Philip Billard Municipal Airport, who know her well and tell her about the light they saw. In the evening, she finds there is an electrical failure on the east side of the house. Lights, radios, and refrigerators are not working.

Kinney replaces some fuses, but not everything turns on again. An electrician comes and replaces some wiring on November 12, but Kinney’s eyes develop subconjunctival hemorrhages and sensitivity to bright light. She begins to wear sunglasses regularly. Both of her male dogs develop cataracts. (Swords 287–288)

November 30 — Tom Gerber of the Boston Herald features interviews with unnamed Air Force officers who proclaim an “undeclared war on phony organizations that capitalize on the ‘mystery’ of flying saucers.” Supposedly, the Air Force has evidence that “perhaps as many as 100,000 persons belong to these UFO organizations” and are “making a wad of money.” As many as 16% of the UFO sightings investigated by USAF are “hoaxes originated by members or officials of these organizations”—an obvious swipe at NICAP.

December — The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is transferred to NASA from the Army, becoming the agency’s primary planetary spacecraft center.

December — Some 450 airline pilots have signed a petition protesting the official policy of debunking UFO sightings.

One pilot describes the policy as a “lesson in lying, intrigue, and the ‘Big Brother’ attitude carried to the ultimate extreme.” Of the signatories, more than 50 personally have reported UFO sightings but are told by the Air Force that they are mistaken. USAF warns them that they face up to 10 years in prison under JANAP 146 if they reveal details of their sighting to the media. Because of situations like this, Maj.

December 6 — Between 6:38 and 6:40 p.m. Along the border of Russia and India, an observer sees a bright UFO cross his field of vision through his telescope from north to south as he is observing Mars.

December 6 — 5:44 a.m. The first launch of a Juno II, carrying Pioneer 3, at LC-5 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, suffers a premature first-stage cutoff, preventing the upper stages from achieving sufficient velocity. Pioneer 3 cannot escape Earth orbit but transmits data for some 40 hours before reentering the atmosphere. A malfunction in a propellant depletion circuit is found to be the cause of the failure, although the exact nature of it cannot be determined. The circuit is redesigned afterwards.

December 19 —John Lester, a writer for the Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger, has polled 1,000 US government radar operators over the past month and found that 80% have observed UFOs traveling at fantastic speeds, executing perfect 90° turns, steep vertical climbs, and hovering stops. They fly in formation and manage to stay just ahead of USAF jets scrambled to intercept them.

December 20 — 2:55 a.m. Hans Gustafsson, a 24-year-old truck driver, and Stig Rydberg, a 30-year-old student, claim that while driving home to Helsingborg, Sweden, from a dance they see a strange light in a glade on their right near Domsten. They leave the car and walk up to the object, which turns out to be a disc-shaped vehicle 16 feet in diameter resting on 3 legs. The two are suddenly attacked by four gray creatures about 4 feet tall who try to drag them to the UFO. In January 1959, a medical doctor, Lars-Erik Essén, hypnotizes the men in what is perhaps the first use of hypnosis of a UFO witness, but the two manage to fool Essén.

December 21 — A group of more than 50 commercial airline pilots, all of whom have had at least one UFO sighting, tell reporter John Lester with the Newark (N.J.)

1959

1959? — According to weapons specialist David Middleton, sometime in the late 1950s a few hours prior to a nuclear weapons test at the Nevada Test Site, he and several other technicians watch two silver discs race across then swoop down and maneuver near the detonation tower where the atomic weapon is mounted. The two objects fly a tight circle around the tower before zooming off at high velocity. The test is immediately postponed by senior AEC personnel. Middleton is debriefed and sworn to secrecy. (Nukes 58–59)

1959 — The original US Navy Space Surveillance System goes into operation. From 1960 until the early 1990s the system is used in conjunction with a network of Baker-Nunn cameras that can see an object the size of a basketball at 25,000 miles. The system is operated by the US Navy for NORAD from 1961 to October 2004. Initially independent, it is run by Naval Space Command from 1993 to 2002, and then by Naval Network and Space Operations Command from 2002 to 2004, when it is taken over by the Air Force.

1959 —The US Army and CIA at Edgewood Arsenal at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, show significant interest in deploying a new drug, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (BZ), as a chemical warfare agent. The drug’s effects last for three days, perhaps as long as six. Between 1959 and 1975, some 2,800 soldiers are given BZ at Edgewood.

February 20 — Pfc. Bernard G. “Gerry” Irwin, on leave from Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, is driving near Cedar City, Utah, when he stops to investigate what seems to be a crashing plane. He is later found unconscious in the snow and treated at the Cedar City hospital. He suffers from amnesia, continues to have fainting spells, and returns more than once to the site in some kind of fugue. He soon deserts and perhaps disappears, but not forever, as he is living in Idaho in 2013, where [David Booher](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/booher-david/88852&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923458429&usg=AOvVaw3pq6iK1QqUpIJ4Rnis7eWy) interviews him about his PTSD-like symptoms.

February 20 — Just as the first working models of the Army’s VZ-9 Avrocar are being manufactured, the Canadian government cancels the Avro CF-105 Arrow program. Almost all Avro Canada employees are laid off, including those with the Special Projects Group. However, three days later, many of the Special Projects employees are rehired, but it isn’t quite business as usual. The USAF Project Office devoted to the Avro projects recommends that the WS-606A and all related work (including the Avrocar) be cancelled. However, in May the USAF authorizes Avro to continue its “flying saucer” programs.

February 24 — 8:20 p.m. Capt. [Peter W.

The initial detection takes place when the aircraft is flying at 8,500 feet and 50 mph about 13 miles west of Williamsport, Pennsylvania. At first Killian thinks he is seeing Orion’s sword, but he can see those stars elsewhere. One of the objects abruptly leaves formation and approaches the plane, slows down before Killian takes evasive action, then rejoins the other two. Killian alerts copilot James John Dee and then announces on the intercom for the passengers to take a look. He also puts out a call to nearby aircraft, and five other commercial airline pilots indicate that they can see the objects. The lights remain at about the 9 o’clock position for 40 minutes, providing an opportunity for many of the 35 passengers to observe them.

They are also seen by the crews of two other planes flying much farther to the south, as well as by the tower operators in Pittsburgh. The Air Force quickly identifies the objects as the three Orion stars, changes that to an aerial refueling operation, then accuses Killian of being drunk. But an independent sighting of the UFOs by an Air Force transport plane 150 miles further south confirms Killian’s observation, and no refueling routes exist in central Pennsylvania.

February 24 — 10:00 p.m. A 17-year-old male is home babysitting the family pets and his younger brother in Victorville, California, when he sees a bright light shining in his bedroom window. The dogs begin to howl and run around. He goes outside and sees a luminous object like an “elongated egg,” dull red with purple waves inside it, flying in a descending path toward his house. It passes over the front yard at a height of only 8–10 feet. As the object returns, he goes inside to get a gun, but as he goes outside the object is making a third pass and he goes back inside.

Spring — Soviet radar and Air Defense personnel observe UFOs circling and hovering for more than 24 hours above the headquarters of the Tactical Missile Command at Sverdlovsk, Russia. Fighter aircraft sent to intercept them report that the UFOs easily outmaneuver them and zigzag to avoid machine gun fire. (Flying Saucers, no. 47, May 1966, pp. 6–10; Good Above, [p. 227](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/226/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923475762&usg=AOvVaw0VQF03k0CKDT2y_TaAg6jU))

Spring — Early evening. A weather officer with the US Fifth Air Force in Tokyo, Japan, is in the operations center when the staff tracks a UFO near Misawa Air Base on the north end of Honshu. One of the officers says this happens frequently, that the objects travel at 2,000 mph, and they often stop in one position and hover for 30 minutes to several hours before taking off westward along the Tsugaru Strait and disappearing in a burst of speed. The center commander orders the pilots of two specially equipped F-106s based at Misawa to intercept the target. One of the planes is having instrumentation problems, but the other goes up. After 10 minutes he is being guided toward the target through Misawa. The pilot says the object is circular and metallic with a cockpit on top. The commander calls the Pentagon for authorization for the pilot to fire on the UFO, and he gets permission for the pilot to make a firing pass. The pilot fires two missiles, but they detonate just at the edge of the object, as if it is protected. The UFO then turns toward the terrified pilot, and the command center watches as the two blips merge into one. The blip disappears. Crews search for wreckage for 4 days but find none.

April 1 — An Air Force C-118 plane with four on board crashes between Sumner and Orting, Washington, about an hour after taking off from McChord AFB \[now Joint Base Lewis-McChord\] in Tacoma.

June — The Argentine Navy bottles up a fast, submarine-like object in the Buenos Aires harbor, Argentina. It is shaped like a huge fish, is silver in color, and sports a tail like the stabilizer on a B-17. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, pp. 52–53)

June — The radiation effects reactor at Lockheed’s Georgia Nuclear Aircraft Laboratory \[now closed\] in the Dawson Forest outside Dawsonville, Georgia, is brought up to full power and unsheathed for the first time. It is a water- cooled 10-megawatt nuclear reactor in a shielded underground shaft with the purpose of irradiating military aircraft as well as the forest itself to determine the effects of nuclear war on wildlife. The experiment exposes everything within a 1,000-foot radius to a lethal dose of radiation. Bugs fall from the air, and small animals and the bacteria living in and on them are exterminated, in a phenomenon the technicians call “instant taxidermy.” Oak trees turn brown, yet crabgrass is seemingly unaffected. Pine trees are the hardest hit of all. Clear Coca-Cola bottles turn brown, hydraulic fluid coagulates into chewing gum, transistorized equipment stops working, and rubber tires become rock hard. Documents about the reactor remain highly classified, and the entrance to the underground portion of the facility has been buried. The area is closed in 1971, and only objects left above ground were the concrete foundations on which the buildings and reactors were placed.

It has an electric blue spotlight and is hovering about 500 feet away at a height of 300–400 feet. On top of the object, four humanlike figures, their bodies surrounded by illumination, are busy with some unknown task. The men and spotlight disappear at 7:20

p.m. and the object vanishes into the clouds. It reappears at 8:28 without the men or spotlight but now joined by second, third and fourth objects at 8:29, 8:35, and 8:35–8:50 p.m., coming and going through the clouds. The

main UFO, “large, clear, stationary,” gives off a red light and disappears overhead into clouds at 9:10 p.m., reappears at 9:20, moves across the sea to Giwa appearing white-red-blue, then disappears at 9:30. An overhead object reappears at 9:46, hovering, disappears behind a cloud at 10:10, reappears in a gap between clouds at 10:30, then is gone at 10:50. The next day, the object returns at 6:00–6:30 p.m. with two others, one to the west and one overhead. “Two of the figures seemed to be doing something near the center of the deck. They were occasionally bending over and raising their arms as though adjusting or setting up something (not visible). One figure seemed to be standing, looking down at us.” Father Gill and another teacher wave their arms, and two of the figures on the main object wave back. Gill waves a flashlight and the object moves back and forth laterally. Gill goes in for dinner and a church service; when he returns at 7:45 p.m., the UFO is gone. The next evening at 6:45 p.m., some eight objects align themselves across a section of the sky. No occupants are visible.

Julius Larsen, an ONI liaison officer to the CIA’s Photographic Intelligence Center in Washington, D.C., rediscovers the Swan-Knowles-Affa correspondence from 1954 in a file and decides to follow up on it. He goes to Eliot, Maine, to visit Adm. [Knowles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/03/06/75711948.html?pageNumber%3D23&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923514274&usg=AOvVaw25rbfvjyogIazeI9uwb7qr) and interview Frances Swan.

Larsen goes into a trance, asks Affa questions, and writes the answers down. When Neasham challenges Affa to appear in person or let them see his spaceship, Larsen stops writing and tells Neasham to go to the window. Lundahl sees nothing unusual, but Neasham insists a spaceship is hiding behind some fluffy clouds. He also insists that he later contacted Washington National Airport and heard from the radar tower that the sector where the UFO appeared had been “blocked out.” Neasham urges Project Blue Book’s Maj.

July 13 — 5:30 a.m. Eileen Moreland, a farmwoman in Blenheim, New Zealand, goes to the barn to milk her cows and sees a huge object, about 20–30 feet in diameter, with two intense green lights on its underside descend towards her and hover at rooftop height. It bathes her in green light. Two rows of jets around the middle shoot out orange flames. She can see two men inside, dressed in close-fitting suits of shiny material and opaque helmets. The jets turn on again, the object tilts, and it shoots up vertically at great speed, making a high-pitched sound. (Loren E.

August — Stan Seers, president of the Queensland Flying Saucer Research Bureau \[now UFO Research Queensland\], is contacted by a man who requests a meeting with him in a Brisbane car park and offers him important information on UFOs. At the meeting he finds out that the man is an agent of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, who indicates he knows quite a bit about the group and its officers. By suggesting that ASIO could offer them significant information, the agent subsequently infiltrates the group and causes dissension and confusion. Some QFSRB members are pacifists, apparently, and are seeking to contact Russian scientists about the UFO phenomenon through the Soviet cultural organization VOKS.

August — 2:00 p.m. A son and his father are driving near Skiatook, Oklahoma. Upon nearing a bridge, the car engine dies. Another car is stopped on the other side of the bridge with its hood up. They see a metallic, domed disc with a flexible hose hovering less than a foot above the water of a creek. They watch it for 5 minutes, then the hose draws in and the disk rises to 10 feet, disturbing the water’s surface into a foot-deep trench. It flies upward and the cars start again. (Loren E.

August — Kathleen O’Rourke is asleep with her two children in her bedroom in New Matamoras, Ohio, when her son yells her awake. There are a dozen globes of yellow light circling about a foot above his bed. They are about 3 inches in diameter. Then a second group enters the room, passing through the screen. They split, half joining the first and half sailing over Kathleen. They all then move to her bed and circle above her. Not one of the lights goes to her daughter’s bed. She presses the light switch, and the lights turn into straight-edged streaks of light and disappear. There are no holes in the screens. (Michael D.

August 9 — 7:30 p.m. Petroleum engineer Armando Uribe is returning home from Cerro Sombrero, Tierra del Fuego, Chile, with his wife and an 11-year-old housemaid when their pickup runs out of fuel. As they are waiting for another vehicle, the girl spots a bright blue light around 7:54 p.m. that is swinging in the air with a pendulum-like motion. As it approaches, they see it is an object like a metallic egg standing on end with two shafts of white light projecting from the bottom. A rose-colored, rotating device is on top. The object makes a quick movement when Uribe gets out of the truck, but then moves closer. Uribe points a rifle at it, and it quickly recedes and disappears.

around a slow 360° rotation in about 4–5 seconds. His other standard magnetic compass is spinning wildly. About this time, he sees three small, gray, and slightly fuzzy elliptical objects in close echelon formation passing in front from left to right and around his plane at a distance about 450–600 feet at a speed of about 200 mph. The Magnesyn compass follows the objects’ position as they circle the plane, and after one full circle they disappear to the rear. Then both compasses settle back to normal. The controller at Albuquerque cancels his flight plan and orders him to land at Kirtland AFB, where he is interrogated by a USAF major, who tells him that he might become ill from the experience.

August 13 — Around 9:45 p.m. Orville Shanks is driving with three passengers on Highway 332 north of Freeport, Texas, when they see a bright object with two satellite lights approach at low altitude. The car motor stalls and the headlights go out. The two lights appear to land, the main object follows them, continually changing colors and varying the intensity of its light. The motor and lights come back on when the UFOs cross the road, and Shanks drives on. About midnight they return, and the object is still there.

September — Employees of Lockheed’s Skunk Works are the first to return to Area 51 in Nevada to develop an aircraft that will replace the U-2. The Archangel-12 (A-12) spy plane will be designed to reduce its radar cross section by 50%. Following tests with wooden models at Burbank, California, proof-of-concept tests are to be carried out at Area 51 with full-scale mockups elevated onto 50-foot pylons. The CIA program to develop the follow-on aircraft to the U-2 is code-named Project Oxcart. EG&G agrees to move its radar test facility here.

Among other purposes, experiments focus on measuring people’s reactions under extreme stress. The unwitting undergraduates are submitted to what Murray calls “vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive” attacks. Specific, tailored assaults on their egos, cherished ideas, and beliefs are used to cause high levels of stress and distress. The subjects then repeatedly view recorded footage of their reactions to this verbal abuse.

September 13 — 9:58 p.m. A radar target is tracked at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, moving at 2,300 mph at an altitude of 60,000 feet and heading northwest. A total of four radar stations track the object. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, p. 103)

Lockheed has also added twin canted fins instead of a single right-angle one. Project Oxcart is officially established. The A-12 design, a combination of their A-7 and A-11 submissions, emphasizes low radar cross section, extremely high altitude, and high-speed performance.

September 24 — About 4:55 a.m. In Redmond, Oregon, police officer Robert Dickerson sees a bright white light rapidly descending north of the airport. It stops abruptly and hovers about 200 feet above ground for several minutes, lighting up the juniper trees below. Dickerson drives toward it on the Prineville Highway, then turns toward the airport. The object turns reddish-orange and moves rapidly to about 10 miles northeast of the airport to hover again. Dickerson arrives at the airport to report his sighting in person to the FAA Air Traffic Communication Station. Flight Service Specialist [Laverne Wertz](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189049553/laverne-john-wertz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923543679&usg=AOvVaw1mj2F62v5BtgA3sVLZgpEL)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/189049553/laverne-john-wertz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923543873&usg=AOvVaw36Qoo7Gz_dn_iz8nDj1kjN) Dickerson, and others view the object through binoculars as flat and round with occasional flames extending from its edge. The FAA reports the UFO to Seattle Air Route Control Center in Washington at 5:10 a.m., which in turn reports it to Hamilton AFB \[now closed\], Novato, California, which scrambles six F-102 jets from Portland to intercept the object. FAA station observers see the object hover and emit long tongues of red, yellow, and green light that extend and retract at irregular intervals. As the jets approach the object from the southeast, it turns into a mushroom shape, emits red and yellow flames from the lower side, and ascends rapidly, disappearing above scattered clouds at about 14,000 feet. The object’s departure forces one F-102 to swerve to avoid collision. Another nearly loses control from the UFO’s turbulent wake. The UFO is tracked on one F-102 gunsight radar, but the jets cannot intercept. The UFO reappears about 20 miles south of Redmond at about 25,000 feet. The Seattle Center reports at 6:20 a.m. radar contact with the object about 25 miles south. The USAF Air Defense Center radar site at Klamath Falls, Oregon, tracks a large target abruptly changing course and vectors B-47 and F-89 aircraft to identify it. Redmond FAA controllers lose sight of the object. Seattle FAA reports at 7:11 a.m. that Klamath Falls radar still is tracking it at 25 miles south of Redmond but varies in altitude from 6,000 to 52,000 feet. The Air Force claims the UFOs are caused by false radar returns, with excitable witnesses imagining the glow. But locals notice the FAA is checking for abnormal radioactivity, so the Air Force changes its explanation to weather balloon. And NICAP obtains FAA logs showing all the details. The Air Force again changes its explanation to Venus.

September 29 — The first attempt to hover a tethered Avrocar is made. After the vehicle becomes airborne, an uncontrollable roll and pitch-coupled oscillation starts that forces each of the three wheels into the ground in turn. The pilot, W.

October — 10:00 a.m. Fr. Raimundo Nascimento Teixeira, a professor at Don Bosco College, is walking in the Núcleo Bandeirante region in Brasília, Federal District, Brazil, when he sees a crowd watching a strange object moving and stopping in the blue sky. He sees a student of his with a box camera, and he takes six photos of what he calls a flying saucer. A few days later, Teixeira meets with another witness, Israel Pinheiro, president of the New Building Company, who takes the negatives of his three best photos to forward to the Brazilian Navy for analysis.

October 2 — 12:20 a.m. For three hours, a Hercules radar site (#13) at McChord AFB \[now Joint Base Lewis-McChord\] near Tacoma, Washington, tracks a total of five objects that usually appear in pairs. The radar returns are said to be “weak.” Visually, at least one soundless, round. “quarter sized,” blue-white light is seen in the sky. ARTC reports no air traffic in the area of the radar site during the time of contact. The first object on radar is seen at 10° elevation. The last object seen on radar was at 20° elevation. The visual object is at 10° degrees elevation. When last observed, the visual object is 20° elevation. Flight patterns are erratic.

October 8 — Night. Two amateur astronomers in Mobile, Alabama, observe an unknown object traverse the Moon’s disk from west to east directly over the crater Copernicus. They watch the fast-moving shape “every night the weather permitted for a period of 33 days.” They write to Project Moonwatch about the observations, but they reply that no other lunar observers have seen the phenomenon, so it must be closer to the Mobile observers.

October 12 — 1:00 p.m. Multiple witnesses at Washington, Sharon, and Crawfordville, Georgia, watch “brown or black footballs” traveling southeast to west, followed by angel hair covering a vast area. The substance consists of “threads from 10ʹ to 50ʹ long connected at ¾ʺ intervals by minute particles resembling snowflakes.” The material falls for about 2 hours. Five samples are collected and sent to the Chemicals and Materials Laboratory at Robins AFB, Georgia. No unusual elements are discovered except for high amounts of silver in one and some silver in three others. The conjecture is that “cloud seeding with a silver salt could have caused the phenomenon.” (Brian Boldman, “Angel Hair Physical Analyses: A Review,” JUFOS 9 (2006): 103–104)

October 22 — Night. Three witnesses are driving through Cumberland, Maryland, when they see a metallic disc emitting a bluish-green light around its edge. The driver abruptly stops, but leaves the car running. Suddenly the object drops down to 50 feet altitude and hovers 100 feet away in front of the car, making a humming vibration. As two of the witnesses open the door to get out, the car engine, lights, and radio fail. Shortly afterward, the disc shoots straight up, then forward, makes a 90° angle, then disappears in clouds. The car begins functioning normally

Late October — 6:55 p.m. Electrician Gideon Johansson is at home in Mariannelund, Småland, Sweden, when there is a power failure. He goes outside to look at the power lines when he bumps into his son Rolf, who points out a brilliant white object hovering above a three-story building. The object descends slowly and appears to be heading toward Johansson’s garden. The machine oscillates three times and smashes into the top of a maple tree, descends through the branches and hovers about 18 inches above the ground. Only about 10 feet away, Johansson can see the object has a large window, through which two entities are visible. Their heads have high crown and they have big, friendly eyes. They have mall mouths and pointed chins and are wearing white uniforms with broad black belts. One seems to be working at an instrument panel. They are only the size of a 14-year-old. Soon the object moves up and shoots away in a flash. Glassy deposits are found on some power lines in addition to the damaged tree, and Johansson gets prickly pains in his lower body.

At about 6 miles from the airfield, the car engine begins to stall. Suddenly they see a light sapphire-colored band moving at high speed at an altitude of 1,600–2,600 feet. It is completely silent. Some minutes later they are able to start the car again.

Personnel at the airfield tell them they had seen a flaming ball that rotated, made a 90° turn, and passed over the airfield again.

December — 5:45 a.m. Larry Jensen is driving to work on US Highway 99 near Proberta, California, when his radio begins making “snapping” noises, and his lights dim. He pulls over to the side of the road and gets out to check his headlights, which he finds are shining feebly. He notices a huge, bright, bluish-green, crescent-shaped object hovering about 60 feet above the road a quarter of a mile behind him. It appears to be 80–90 feet across and 15– 20 feet thick. Suddenly and inexplicably, he finds his clothes are soaked and he feels an alarming feeling as if he is getting crushed inside. He also feels as if he is being sucked up into the object. He grabs for a car door, then collides with a side mirror and staggers backward, but manages to get inside. Looking out the right-door window, he sees the UFO a few miles away, heading northeast and climbing at a shallow angle over the Sierra foothills. It vanishes within 10 seconds. Jensen’s car lights come back on. He resumes driving, but 600 feet away is forced to stop because he smells burning rubber. The battery caps are blown out, and the battery is swollen out of shape, the generator is not working, and the armature and field wires have melted together. Later, he finds it odd that he has not encountered another single car during or after the episode. (Clark III 866; Loren E.

[Curtis LeMay](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_LeMay&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923570520&usg=AOvVaw3mTzPLXob1QBk93VheOpOp) is conducting an exercise to test his bombers’ capability to penetrate US air space. An F-89J Scorpion jet instructor pilot and his radar observer, 1Lt. Joe Meyer, have just successfully intercepted a B-47 and are descending to land at James Connally AFB \[now TSTC Waco Airport\] near Waco, Texas. They notice a pinpoint of light at their level 12 miles away over Waco and decide to approach and attack it as if they are armed. As they approach on a collision course, they see the object has four bright blue- white lights on it and it is stationary. They estimate it is 25–30 feet in diameter. But the object shoots straight up at incredible speed before they reach it. They look up and see the object is bright blue white on its underside. It disappears at about 90,000 feet altitude.

On their third day in Tucson, an “exterminator” visits them, offering to inspect their rented premises for free. He fails to mention the name of his company, nor does he seem interested in his occupation. He talks with Coral about their reason for moving, where Jim is employed, and UFOs.

1960 — [Brinsley Le Poer Trench,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinsley_Le_Poer_Trench%252C_8th_Earl_of_Clancarty&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923572196&usg=AOvVaw3xyVTq08WccsfmuwP0SPQ6) 8th Earl of Clancarty, publishes The Sky People, in which he claims that [Adam and](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923572496&usg=AOvVaw2cw6KeCgOzfZ_4EO5vBQjM) [Eve,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923572662&usg=AOvVaw3jmuQxm5ucGY75jYVpfBg5) [Noah,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923572838&usg=AOvVaw04NXGtCZpGQE88n4Dw2T9q) and many other characters in the Bible originally lived on Mars. Trench believes that Adam and

Eve were experimental creations of extraterrestrials. The biblical description of the Garden of Eden is inconsistent with what Earth is like, and because Mars contains canals, the Garden of Eden must have been located on Mars.

He further claims that the north polar ice cap melted on Mars, causing the descendants of Adam and Eve to move to Earth. The Book of Genesis is a symbolic version of what actually happened to groups of people on Mars, he writes, with the Great Deluge referring to the flooding of Atlantis and Lemuria, which were populated with Adamic migrants.

1960 — Contactee [George Hunt Williamson](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hunt_Williamson&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923574260&usg=AOvVaw0UC1aIAzB5gO5yoxvZlOZa) legally changes his name to Michel d’Obrenovic, said to reflect an ancestral connection to the throne of Serbia. However, John Griffin says the real reason is that Williamson’s sensational claims have rendered his anthropological work (such as it is) completely unacceptable. (Clark III 1287; Zirger and Martinelli, The Incredible Life of George Hunt Williamson, Verdechiari, 2016, pp. 119–124)

1960 — Night. During a pause in army maneuvers near Brno \[now in the Czech Republic\], soldiers see a peculiarly colored light above the city. After hovering a while, it vanishes but reappears in another part of the sky. Their commanding officer tells them to look at it with binoculars and check the radar. Headquarters sends up interceptors to chase the object, but every time one of them gets near, the light disappears from the radar screen, only to turn up elsewhere. The incident goes on for an hour before the light disappears for good. (Hobana and Weverbergh 90)

1960 — The invention of transponders that transmit an electronic identification signal from aircraft to ground control helps to further reduce clutter on air traffic control radars. This means that “aerial phenomena” appear on radar only if they intrude on flight paths and create a near miss of the type investigated by the Civil Aviation Authority.

February 5 — 11:15 p.m. Many people see a distinctly round UFO hover and maneuver slowly over or near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and La Brea Avenue in Hollywood, California. Cars are stopped bumper-to- bumper, according to employees of several businesses around the intersection, with people gaping at the object overhead. Persons on hotel and apartment rooftops go out to see a bright “cherry-red, circular light.” Two service- station attendants at the intersection, Jerry Darr and Charles Walker, say that “hundreds of people saw it— everybody was looking” as the light hovers for at least 5 minutes over a busy drive-in. Pen Meyer, another service station attendant a third of a mile to the north, watches it hovering for about 10 minutes. Harold Sherman, his wife, and two others watch it as it resumes motion very slowly eastward. After proceeding east for a distance of a block or two, it veers southeastward and passes out of sight. No sound is heard over street-noise background. (Los Angeles NICAP Subcommittee case files; James E.

February 6 — 11:15 p.m. The red object reappears over Hollywood, California, this time about one block further east, above Sunset Boulevard and Sycamore Avenue. A number of witnesses observe it hovering for about 10 minutes at an altitude of 500–600 feet. Then with a loud explosion it emits a brilliant bluish-white flash that extends downward and to the west, lighting up the ground all around La Brea Avenue. A mushroom-shaped cloud appears and dissipates. As the red light is extinguished, an object described by most witnesses as long, tubular, and about 70 feet long shoots upwards. A few seconds later, the red light appears about 1,000 feet above Sunset and La Brea for about 8 minutes. It then begins drifting slowly eastward, turns sharply toward the north-northeast, accelerates and climbs steeply, not stopping again until it is at a very high altitude well to the north.

As he slews his antenna off Tau Ceti and onto Epsilon Eridani, Drake is greeted with a strong, periodic, pulsed signal on 1420 MHz, the hyperfine transition emission line of interstellar hydrogen atoms proposed for SETI by [Giuseppe Cocconi](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Cocconi&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923587634&usg=AOvVaw2frGrCsn_RfiD91gkEFFm0) and [Philip Morrison](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Morrison&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923587978&usg=AOvVaw2JarmB0TKKRRlU7kzaUqwY), and still favored as a promising hailing frequency for interstellar communications. Drake is ready with a second, low-gain antenna. The pulses are there as well, sadly disproving their extraterrestrial origin. But they are not exactly terrestrial interference, either. The rate at which the phantom signal traverses the sky suggests that it is emanating from an aircraft cruising at unprecedented altitude—perhaps 80,000 feet. At the time, no known aircraft can reach the stratosphere. Such an aircraft, as it happens, doesn’t “come into existence” until the following month, when [Francis Gary Powers](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Gary_Powers&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923588373&usg=AOvVaw0ITOnoy6nAq58d9w8K2tMb) is shot down over the Soviet Union.

June 12 — 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. Following a sonic boom above Quebec, a fiery object falls from the sky from an altitude of 1,000–2,000 feet and splits into two pieces that fall into the St. Lawrence River near Les Écureuils, about 20 miles upriver from Quebec City, Quebec. A beachcomber runs across the pieces, one closer to the shore and visible at low tide, the other one further out and mostly submerged. He retrieves a smaller piece (800 pounds) and sells it to a scrap-metal dealer, who fails to recognize it as ferrous and possibly ships it to Japan. The other piece is picked up by the Canadian Armament Research and Development Establishment \[now DRDC Valcartier\] near Quebec City.

CARDE’s analysis is said to have revealed an alloy with a high manganese content, although it was identified as the “normal product of a foundry, consisting of slag with semi- molten scrap embedded in it,” likely coming from Sorel Iron Foundries in Sorel, Quebec. Smith rejects those findings and and conducts his own tests (although he is an electrical engineer and not a metallurgist) on a chunk

But we don’t know whether it was a few years ago—or a few hundred years ago.” In June 1968, the Colorado project’s [Roy Craig](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/ufo-investigator-isu-alumnus-dead/article_d3e1f4e4-28e6-5600-bff7-846c287c3b6b.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923607849&usg=AOvVaw2GLyNJb3CkhsRzY2HuBMYt) is in Ottawa and offers to examine the club’s chunk of metal because they had offered it to Condon a year earlier.

Later, the Montreal UFO Society’s Ronald Anstee has a piece of it analyzed by an independent metallurgist, who finds that the composition “does not correspond to any known commercial manganese steel.” In September 1967, Eric Smith of the Canada Department of Energy, Mines, and Resources visits the Ottawa club and examines their large artifact, but fails to report back. In 1969, the National Research Council’s [Peter Millman](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Millman&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923608134&usg=AOvVaw3-4QyaFVuvSm86A-Se4J5b) takes a look and is convinced that it is ordinary manganese steel from the Sorel plant.

June 22 — 6:20 p.m. John Person is setting up camp at Clan Lake, Northwest Territories, on a prospecting expedition and is waiting for his partner. He hears a noise like an aircraft approaching and something bounces and hits the surface of the lake about 1,700 feet behind him. Person sees an object 4–6 feet wide with arms or spokes is rotating rapidly in the water, but gradually slows down and stops spinning. When his partner arrives, they get into a canoe and travel to the impact area. They find an area of burned grass and another area where grass it cut up in small pieces. They use a pole to probe the lake bottom and find a channel that is one foot deeper at one end and three feet deeper at the other, RCMP Cpl. Matheson flies to the lake in a seaplane on July 19 and August 15 and finds the impact area as Person has described but no submerged object.

July — Members of the US Senate Preparedness Committee and the House Science and Astronautics Committee, as well as the CIA, ask for hearings on USAF’s handling of UFOs. (Clark III 922)

July 1 — 10:30 a.m. Four witnesses at the Leefe Mine in Lincoln County, Wyoming, see a shiny disc move in from the south and hover above a slag heap. It has a diameter of at least 185 feet and is 14 feet thick. Five transparent bubbles are visible on the bottom as it rocks gently before moving off to the south at high speed. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, p. 221)

July 2 — Early morning. A couple driving in the vicinity of Kankakee, Illinois, see the landscape light up with a bright blue light as a ball of fire approaches out of the south. It passes above their car dragging a trail of bluish light behind it. The inside of the car heats up uncomfortably, waking up their daughter and her husband who are asleep in the back. The light gradually fades and disappears in the north. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, pp. 221–223)

July 3 — 4:30 p.m. Argentine Air Force Capt. Hugo F. Niotti is driving north near Villa General Belgrano, Córdoba, Argentina, when he notices a dark object hovering to the right of the road. He stops his car, grabs his camera, and takes a photo of the object, which is moving slowly over a field. As he is winding the film to take another shot, the object accelerates and disappears into the clouds. The photo shows a conical object low above the ground, as well as a horse whose attention is attracted to the object. Analysis shows that the object is about 23 feet high, 20 feet in diameter, and 56 feet above the ground. (Guillermo C. Roncoroni and Gustavo J.

August 10 — The Discoverer 13 Corona KH-1 photoreconnaissance satellite is launched from Vandenberg AFB \[now Vandenberg Space Force Base\], California. The primary goal of this series of satellites is to replace the U-2 spy plane in surveilling the Sino-Soviet Bloc, determining the disposition and speed of production of Soviet missiles and long-range bombers assess. The Corona program is also used to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and other US government mapping programs. On August 11, after 17 orbits, the satellite splashes down in the North Pacific and its payload is recovered. It represents the first-ever successful recovery of an object from orbit.

August 11 — 3:10 p.m. Ray Hawks is operating a farm tractor at Left Hand Canyon near Altona, Colorado, when he hears a muffled explosion. Looking up, he watches a disc dropping vertically out of the cloud cover. It stops in midair about 650 feet away from him and 200 feet above the ground, wobbling a bit. When it stabilizes, he sees it looks like two concave discs joined together at the rim and dull aluminum in color. Bluish smoke is issuing from an apparent gap in its surface. An electric hum seems to come from inside the object. The section where the smoke is issuing is withdrawn inside, and a new section appears to replace it, settling in with a click. The hum increases in intensity, and the object appears to be surrounded by a heat haze. It then shoots up into the clouds and vanishes. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, pp. 223–225)

It suddenly reverses course, climbs to 500 feet, hovers, sweeps the ground with a red beam, performs aerial gymnastics, then heads east, chased by the police car. It is joined by a similar object from the south, then it disappears in the east. A local radar operator confirms the UFO at the time but denies it the next day. Tehama County sheriff’s officers also see the UFO and another similar one the same night.

August 25 — The “dark satellite” is seen and photographed five times by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation at Bethpage, Long Island, New York. It is supposed to be three times faster than the Echo 1 satellite and travels east to west in a retrograde orbit, rather than west to east. Its inclination to the equator is about 135°. The color of the object varies from “carrot to straw.” The Grumman observers estimate that the object is in an eccentric orbit with an apogee of as much as 4,200 miles and a perigee of about 300 miles. They immediately produce a proposal to the US Air Force to share data in the hopes of plotting a firm orbit for the mystery satellite.

Late August — Two men in a car near Butte Falls, Oregon, see a pale-white light hovering 300 feet ahead of them. They watch it for 15 minutes, then decide to drive closer. The light then rises to 100 feet and recedes, then changes to orange. No sound is heard. The light performs geometrical maneuvers, creating rectangle paths and other zig- zags. It then accelerates, changes back to white, and zooms off. (Swords 294)

They watch it for 5 minutes, then see a figure standing behind the ball. It is a glowing nude, generally humanlike figure, about 6 feet tall, holding a light at chest level. The figure is square-shouldered and has disproportionately long legs that are narrow and pointed between the knees and ankles. The witnesses watch another 5 minutes, at which point the globe and the entity begin to fade and are gone from sight in another 5 minutes. (Clark III 279–280)

Declassified documents do not reveal if Roselli, Giancana, or Trafficante accept a down payment for the job.

Giancana recommends him as being an official in the Cuban government with access to Castro.

September 2 — 11:30 p.m. Richard Ireton and his wife are driving on US Highway 1 in Westbrook, Connecticut, when they notice what seems to be an aircraft about to crash. It veers close to the shore and the Iretons drive to the beach to look for it. They see a triangular-shaped object flying silently at the speed of a Piper Cub airplane, alternately hovering and moving horizontally and vertically. When it reaches the public beach, it takes off at great speed toward Long Island, New York. They see a similar object the next evening around 9:30 p.m. at Chalker Beach in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.

September 10 — A married couple in Scituate, Massachusetts, sees a trio of brilliant discs parked in a triangle formation in the sky. About 12° to the objects’ left is a huge cylinder. One witness watches them through binoculars, and the brilliance hurts his eyes for two hours. Two more discs seem to be attached to the top of the cylinder. Small domes sprinkle their surface. The large object disappears too quickly for the eye to follow. (Swords 294)

October — Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company begins construction of “Project 51” at the Nellis AFB complex in Nevada with double-shift personal schedules. They mark an Archimedean spiral on Area 51’s dry lake approximately two miles across so that an A-12 pilot approaching the end of the overrun can abort instead of plunging into the sagebrush. Area 51 pilots call it “The Hook.” For crosswind landings, they mark two unpaved airstrips (runways 9/27 and 03/21) on the dry lakebed.

October 4 — 6:10 p.m. Rev. Lionel Browning and his wife are looking at a rainbow outside their rectory in Cressy, Tasmania, when they see a gray, cigar-shaped object emerge from a raincloud. It has 4 or 5 vertical, dark bands around its circumference and an aerial array that projects from the top. Browning estimates it to be 100 feet long and about 4 miles distant. It moves north at about 60–70 mph at about 400 feet altitude. After one minute, it stops and is joined by 5–6 smaller objects that emerge from a cloud. After another minute, all the UFOs abruptly reverse back into the rain squall at the same speed.

October 5 — A formation of UFOs is detected by the new Ballistic Missile Early Warning System at Thule Site J in Greenland. The objects appear to be heading directly toward North America from the direction of Russia. Within seconds, Strategic Air Command headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, scrambles the crews of B-52 bombers armed with nuclear warheads to prepare a retaliatory strike. But at the last moment checks reveal that the objects are spurious radar echoes. Unusual atmospheric conditions create phantoms on the BMEWS that cannot be seen by other radars.

December 14 — The Brookings Research Institute in Washington, D.C., releases a 186-page report prepared for NASA titled Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs. It is later published as a 272-page Committee Print for the House Committee on Science and Astronautics on March 24, 1961. The report includes a section on “Implications of a Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life.” It is sent to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics for approval by Rep.

December 14 — The first Single Integrated Operational Plan, titled SIOP-62, is completed. It describes a massive strike with the entire US arsenal of 3,200 warheads, totaling 7847 megatons, against Russia, China, and Soviet-aligned states with urban and other targets being hit simultaneously. Nine weapons are to be “laid down” on four targets in Leningrad \[now St. Petersburg\], 23 weapons on six target complexes in Moscow, and 18 on seven target areas in Kaliningrad.

When he finds one that roughly matches, he asks how many bombs the SIOP “laid down” on that city. The reply: one 4.5 megaton bomb and three more 1.1 megaton weapons in case the big bomb is a dud. The execution of SIOP-62 is estimated to result in 285 million dead and 40 million casualties in the Soviet Union and China. Presented with all the facts and figures, USAF Gen. [Thomas D.

1961 — An Antonov AN-2P mail biplane takes off from an airfield at or near Sverdlovsk, Russia, bound for Kurgan with seven people on board. About 80–100 miles from Sverdlovsk, the aircraft disappears from the radar screen.

Ground control cannot regain contact, so a search is launched with helicopters and troops. The aircraft is found in a small clearing in a dense forest, completely intact. The authorities state that it looks like it was placed there gently from above. All the mail is intact, and there is no sign of anyone on board. No marks or footprints are seen. A 100-foot wide, clearly defined circle of scorched grass and depressed earth is found at a distance of 328 feet from the plane. A report by the Moscow Aviation Institute claims that a UFO was tracked on radar at the control tower and that strange radio signals were hear at the time of the disappearance.

1961 — A UFO appears above the iron-ore mine of Catalina Huanca, owned by the Marcona Mining Company, near Apongo, Peru. It hovers for 5–15 minutes, only about 300 feet away from a young mining engineer. It is round and glowing, with windows on the upper part. The engineer gets a look at it through his theodolite, but it still looks fuzzy. The object reappears throughout the day, allowing all the mine workers (about 70) to view it. The following day it follows a supply truck for several hours as it exits the mine heading south over a dirt track. (S. Parker Gay Jr., “Peru, 1961,” IUR 24, no. 3 (Fall 1999): 29)

January — Day. Government topographer Adolfo Paolini Pisani is driving a jeep along the highway between La Victoria and El Vigía, Mérida, Venezuela, when a truck passes him. A few minutes later, a brilliant metallic disc like polished blue steel swoops down and passes dangerously close above the hood of the truck. The truck rises a few feet into the air and overturns in the direction taken by the object, falling in a sandbank with its wheels in the air. The object ascends and is lost to view in a few seconds. Pisani stops his jeep to assist, but fortunately the lone driver has only a few scratches.

January 10 — A US Navy A-1 Polaris missile is launched from a ground pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida. A disc, whose diameter is close to the length of the Polaris, alters its tracking, but does not block the missile firing, since the tracking system continues to follow the object and later returns to again to track the Polaris downrange. The diameter of the disc is approximately 20–25 feet and it is about 6–8 feet thick at its center. It is visually lost to ground observers and the primary witness ([Clark C.

February — Forester Vasili Brodski finds a mysterious crater 100 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 10 feet deep on the bank of a frozen lake in Karelia, Russia. It had not been there two days earlier. The base is remarkably smooth, and around the edge are lumps of grass and soil but no trace of the excavated dirt. Six investigators from Leningrad \[now St. Petersburg\] arrive and find odd, crumbling black pellets on the edge of the lake. Divers discover a 330- foot strip where the soil has been displaced along the floor of the lake, as if something slid along the ground and submerged, ploughing up the soil. Geologist Vsevolod Charmov examines ice, water, and soil samples but cannot explain a green discoloration on some of the submerged pieces of broken ice. The pellets seem to be an inorganic substance. (Hobana and Weverbergh 61–63)

February 28 — 3:20 a.m. Clarence Blackwood and his wife hear a roaring sound in the sky at their home in Lakewood, Massachusetts. They look out the bedroom window and see a fiery cigar-shaped object moving at low altitude to the northeast. It is bright yellow in the middle with a bright red edge and surrounded by thin clouds of black smoke. The object rolls back and forth rapidly and travels slowly to the southwest. It passes directly above their house, illuminating the bedroom. The lights that they have left on in the kitchen dim three times and go out for 4– 5 minutes. The object returns at 3:40 and the kitchen lights repeat their previous actions.

March 16 — 8:45 p.m. Mr. F. Reynolds and his 15-year-old son Lloyd are camped in their trailer 900 feet from the Murray River, at Bowna, New South Wales, when they see what appears to be a huge trailer with four windows and a red light at the end standing by the water. A fire is visible to the right of the object, and they can see four figures moving quickly between the object and the fire. Reynolds watches through binoculars and sees the entire array moving sideways in a jerking manner. After 45 minutes, it is all gone from sight. In the morning they can find no traces on the soft mud flat.

Spring — Late evening. A couple parking in Millville, New Jersey, watch a bright light silently moving northward. It hovers, reverses direction, and maneuvers for 5 minutes.

A door opens and a man appears, about 5 feet tall and wearing a black, turtle-neck pullover with a white band at the belt, and black trousers with a vertical white band along the side. Two other figures are visible inside. The creature is holding a metallic jug and making gestures suggesting he wants a drink. Simonton takes the jug into his basement, fills it with water, and returns it to the man. Simonton notices one man frying on a flameless grill and motions for some food. Simonton receives four ordinary pancakes or cookies, 3 inches in diameter, perforated with small holes. The object takes off after 5 minutes.

May 10 — Late evening. Richard Vogt, driving on a rural road south of Osakis, Minnesota, sees a “ball of fog approximately 3 feet in diameter” swiftly descending toward him at a 45° angle from a clear sky. Unable to take evasive action, Vogt can only stare as the object hits the upper part of his hood and windshield.

Summer — Near Rybinsk, Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, crews are setting up new missile batteries as part of Moscow’s defensive network. A huge disc-shaped object allegedly appears at an estimated altitude of 12.5 miles, surrounded by a number of smaller objects. A nervous battery commander panics and gives unauthorized orders to fire a salvo at the disc. All the missiles explode at an estimated distance of 1.2 miles from the target. A third salvo is not fired, because at that point the smaller objects stall the electrical apparatus of the entire missile base. After the smaller disc rejoin the big UFO, the electrical systems return.

Summer — Day. Glenn E. Bradley watches a group of six metallic discs pass over his farm near Beloit, Ohio, at a low altitude. They are traveling in single file at about 30 mph and are spaced 1–2 miles apart. The objects are each about 60 feet in diameter at the bottom with a 30-foot dome on top.

June 3 — A civilian weather observer sees an object through a theodolite at Mercury, Nevada. It remains in sight for 2 hours at an altitude of 80,000–120,000 feet. Project Blue Book evaluators correctly identify the object as a probable U-2 aircraft flying out of Nellis AFB.

June 4 — Mrs. James W. Annis, a librarian, sees a large, narrow, elliptical object hovering low in the sky to the north of Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania. Farther to the east, a cluster of smaller objects is hovering. She then watches the smaller objects streak across the sky to the larger one. All then move out of sight behind trees to the north- northwest.

June 5 — 2:30 a.m. Patrolman Jaime de Miranda and Astrogildo de Medeiros are called to the scene of a sighting on the Rodovia Anchieta highway 30 miles northwest of Santos, São Paulo, Brazil. When they arrive, they find about 20 cars stopped along the road and people watching a luminous disc-shaped object maneuvering in the area. The patrolmen try to signal the object by shining a spotlight on it, but they get no response. When they focus a red light on it, the object moves toward the cars at high speed. They take cover. Another responder, Marshal José Otavia Leite, is about to shoot at the object but other police prevent him. After 3 hours, the object gets dimmer. At 5:30 a.m., it is still visible through binoculars when it lands on the ground some distance from the highway. By daybreak it is no longer visible.

June 9 — A second USAF/NASA flight evaluation of the Avrocar is conducted on a modified second prototype at the Avro facility in Mississisauga, Ontario. During these tests, the vehicle reaches a maximum speed of 20 knots and shows the ability to traverse a ditch 6 feet across and 18 inches deep. Flight above the critical altitude proves dangerous if not nearly impossible due to inherent instability. The flight test report further identifies a range of control problems.

June 11 — 11:00 p.m. José-Gregorio Darnaude y Rojas Marcos, 28, is lying in a hammock in the front of his house on the Fuenteluega Estate in Sevilla, Spain, when he feels a peculiar pricking sensation throughout his whole body but particularly in his head. His dogs are cowering, the sheep go completely crazy, and the crickets and cicadas become silent. Suddenly, a luminous disc about 15 feet in diameter appears from behind the house, flying from northeast to southwest. It makes an abrupt 90° turn and moves directly toward him, hovering about 400 feet away from him and 80 feet in the air, changing colors from white to orange to red to purple several times. Darnaude runs inside, but the disc turns bright white and shots away at enormous speed.

September — A National Intelligence Estimate concludes that the USSR has no more than 25 ICBMs and will not possess more in the near future, effectively discrediting the missile gap myth.

September 6 — The National Reconnaissance Office is officially launched with headquarters in Chantilly, Virginia. It designs, builds, launches, and operates the reconnaissance satellites of the federal government, and

provides satellite intelligence to several government agencies, particularly signals intelligence (SIGINT) to the National Security Agency, imagery intelligence (IMINT) to the National Geospace-Intelligence Agency,

and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) to the Defense Intelligence Agency. Its existence remains top secret until September 18, 1992. The move creates a protocol that requires the CIA deputy director and the undersecretary of the Air Force to co-manage all space reconnaissance and aerial espionage programs. The public face of the NRO is the Office of Space Systems.

September 19–20 — 10:30 p.m. [Barney and Betty Hill](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_and_Betty_Hill&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923720999&usg=AOvVaw31MFLgf5WObl93G37akbCN) are driving home to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, from a vacation in Quebec, going south on US Highway 3. Near Groveton, New Hampshire, Betty sees a bright light moving upward and erratically, growing larger. Later, Barney stops the car at a scenic picnic area south of Twin Mountain. Through binoculars, Betty sees a solid object against the moon that “appeared to be flashing thin pencils of different colored lights.” Barney thinks it’s a plane, though it might be “playing games” with them.

Barney drives slowly through Franconia Notch, watching the object. At one point it passes near the Old Man of the Mountain. About one mile south of Indian Head (north of Lincoln), the object rapidly descends toward their vehicle, causing Barney to stop in the middle of the highway. The huge, silent craft hovers approximately 80–100 feet above the Hills’ 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and fills the entire field of view in the windshield. It reminds Barney of a huge pancake. Carrying his pistol in his pocket, he steps away from the vehicle and moves closer to the object. Using the binoculars, Barney claims see about 8–11 humanoid figures who are peering out of the craft’s windows, seeming to look at him. In unison, all but one figure move to what appears to be a panel on the rear wall of the hallway that encircles the front portion of the craft. The one remaining figure continues to look at Barney and communicates a message telling him to “stay where you are and keep looking.” Barney has a recollection of observing the humanoid forms wearing glossy black uniforms and black caps. Red lights on what appears to be bat-wing fins begin to telescope out of the sides of the craft, and a long structure descends from the bottom of the craft. The UFO approaches to within 50–80 feet overhead and 300 feet away from him. Barney tears the binoculars away from his eyes and runs back to his car. In a near hysterical state, he tells Betty, “They’re going to capture us!” He sees the object again shift its location to directly above the vehicle. He drives away at high speed, telling Betty to look for the object. She rolls down the window and looks up. Almost immediately, the Hills hear a rhythmic series of beeping or buzzing sounds which seem to bounce off the trunk of their vehicle. The car vibrates and a tingling sensation passes through them. At this point in time they experience the onset of an altered state of consciousness that leaves their minds dulled. A second series of beeping sounds return them to full consciousness. They find that they have traveled nearly 35 miles south, but have only vague, spotty memories of this section of road. They recall making a sudden, unplanned turn, encountering a roadblock, and observing a fiery orb in the road. At 5:00 a.m., they arrive home, about two hours later than expected. Barney feels compelled to examine his genitals, and they both take long showers. Betty notices a pinkish powder and a tear in her dress.

There are shiny, concentric circles on their car’s trunk that were not there the previous day. Betty and Barney experiment with a compass, noting that when they move it close to the spots, the needle whirls rapidly. But when they move it a few inches away from the shiny spots, it drops down.

September 27 — 7:57 a.m. The radar operator on a USAF Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft off the California coast spots five targets on his scope. Four of the objects are on a heading of 90°, and all of them are moving at a high rate of speed. They soon disappear into sea clutter. Three minutes later, two objects appear heading 70° then also disappear into sea clutter. The speed of one of the objects is measured at about 2,070 mph over a distance of 230 miles. While the two objects are on the scope, a single stationary object also appears. After remaining stationary for about two minutes, it moves on a heading of 265° at 70 mph and is lost in the sea clutter. The objects can only be painted with the IFF on. The radar is an APS-95.

He flies toward the object to get a better look, and sees that the UFO has no wings or tail and is hovering with a slight rocking motion.

October 14 — 5:00 p.m. Mrs. Erwin Riley, a summer resident in Two Harbors, Minnesota, sees a large object slide into the water of Lake Superior about one mile from shore and bob about on the surface. She summons a neighbor, Jack Ray, and they both watch through binoculars, but they can’t make out what it is. At dusk, the Lake County Sheriff responds to their call, but he can’t see much due to swells on the lake surface. He calls the Air Force and Coast Guard to make sure it’s not part of a training exercise. Shortly afterward, Riley sees the object rise into the

October 21 — 2:00 a.m. A brilliant fireball flashes in front of Richard and Rhonda DuBois’s car on US Highway 60 as they are driving between Datil and Pie Town, New Mexico. It then veers into the sky. Later, as they approach a canyon they see that the light is traveling along in front of them. It breaks into four lights that move along with the car, even as DuBois drives at 100 mph, until they stop at a roadside motel. The lights then zoom straight up and disappear.

Late November — Evening. A group of four friends are hunting on a Sunday in the area of Harvey, North Dakota. As they are returning in the car, the two men in the front seat notice a descending glowing object in the sky ahead of them. Assuming they are witnessing a plane crash, they rush to the scene of its landing, where they find at 150 yards distance, a “silo-appearing craft which was sticking in the ground with this glow around it.” The men shine a hand spotlight and shine it on the object, whereupon they see four human-looking individuals standing around it. At this point they seem to hear an explosion and “everything went out.” The principal witness wakes up from dozing in the back seat as the car is negotiating soggy ground looking for the craft and crew. They return to the spot where the landing takes place, and they see the figures again, wearing white coveralls and standing 5 feet

high. They get out of the car and one figure waves them away. Eventually, the men agree to return to a small town, possibly Martin, North Dakota, 11 miles away, where they find a police officer, who listens to the story and agrees to accompany them back to the site. They see red lights moving in the field and both cars go in pursuit of them. The lights go out, the police officer drives away, and the four men resume driving home. Two miles down the highway, the silo-like object reappears, landing gently 150 yards away with two of the figures watching them. Two of the men get out of the car again and shine the spotlight on the craft. One of the men is carrying a rifle; he drops on the ground and shoots, apparently hitting one of the figures in the right shoulder. The figure spins around, goes down on his knees, gets help from the other figure, then yells, “Now what the hell did you do that for?” Weirdly, as soon as the men return to the car, the two who have remained inside insist the rifle had not been removed and no shot was fired. The primary witness (who remains in the car) has no recollection of what happened to the craft and figures. By the time they get home, dawn is breaking, and their wives are waiting for them. They all know it has taken longer than it should have to return. A few hours later, around 12:00 noon, the principal witness is at work when three well-groomed, official-looking men visit him. He presumes they are Air Force intelligence officers who say they have a “report” about the previous night’s event. They ask him what clothes he was wearing and what the object looked like, but they never ask about the shooting. Later, they show up at his house and ask to see his hunting gear and boots. They tell him not to say anything more about the incident. In January 1968, US Border Patrol agent \[later BATF agent\] Donald E. Flickinger manages to interview the primary witness, who works as a supervisor at Minot AFB hospital, and two of the others, one a small-town high school superintendent and the other an active-duty Air Force sergeant. They all are “extremely reliable and responsible,” Flickinger says. (J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience, Ballantine ed., 1974, [pp. 164–165](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/ufoexperience00jall/page/164/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923743193&usg=AOvVaw0l_MMJOB-bS7tPyZgq1R90); Clark III 825–827)

Late November — 9:30 p.m. Real estate agent Cavalheiro Mendes is walking along the beach in Balneário Pinhal, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, when he sees a huge light 900 feet away. As he walks toward it, he sees it is a huge disc resting on the sand. He feels compelled to approach it and sees two helmeted figures come from behind the object. They seem to be telling him telepathically not to resist. Mendes finds he is completely unable to move. He feels one of them scratching his forearm with an instrument, then he blacks out. When he wakes up, he is nearly back to his beach house and it is 11:30 p.m. After a few weeks he feels anxious and sad for no apparent reason. He refuses to be hypnotized.

1962 — Day. An Air Force pilot is flying a brand new B-52 with a full crew out of Wichita, Kansas, headed for an air base in the southwest. He notices a bright flash of sunlight in his left side and turns to see a metallic object “like polished chrome.” It is pacing the aircraft near its left wingtip. The object is 4–8 feet in diameter and has no seams or markings. His First Officer is watching an identical object off the right wing, and the crewman in the tail reports that there is a round shiny metal ball following close behind the B-52. The top and bottom gunners also see spheres above and below the plane. The pilot goes into an evasive maneuver, but after 10–15 minutes the objects are maintaining their positions. He returns to his previous assigned altitude and heading. After a few minutes, the five objects leave, one at a time, first the bottom one, then the top, then the tail. The two objects on the wings shoot away at the same time and climb out of sight parallel to each other. After landing, the crew is told not to talk about the sighting at all. (Richard F.

January — The IBM 7950 Harvest computer, designed to be used for cryptanalysis, is delivered to the National Security Agency. It includes Tractor, a large automated tape cartridge library. An NSA-conducted evaluation finds that Harvest is more powerful than the best commercially available machine by a factor of 50–200, depending on the task. It remains in use until 1976. One purpose of the machine is to search text for keywords from a watchlist.

From a single foreign cipher system, Harvest is able to scan more than 7 million decrypts for any occurrences of some 7,000 key words in under four hours.

Its aim is to cause the Soviet Union to waste time and effort in preparing defenses against fictitious aircraft and weapons that the US might be developing. Furthermore, UFOs can be used to capture headlines, diverting attention from unwelcome news coverage of espionage operations. Davidson writes that Dulles has resorted to using contactees and UFO organizations as a propaganda vehicle. Messages supposedly from spacemen calling for a halt in nuclear testing could influence public opinion in a test ban treaty that, in effect, would benefit the US more than the Russians, since the Soviets were seen as overtaking the American lead in weapons development.

Spring or summer — All base personnel on flying status attend a briefing in the theater at the Clinton-Sherman AFB \[now the Clinton-Sherman Industrial Airpark\] near Burns Flat, Oklahoma. The airmen are shown a short 20–30-minute Air Force film showing, spliced together without interpretation, five or six gun-camera clips apparently documenting attempts by aircraft to intercept UFOs. Afterward, the commander of the 4213d Strategic Wing reads a statement (probably JANAP 146(D)) stipulating fines and jail sentences for anyone publicly reporting a UFO sighting and hands out UFO sighting forms in the event of an incident. One technician recalls there is a section on reporting any electronic signature emitted from the UFO picked up by specific ECM devices. (Nukes 123–125)

April 18 — Evening. A red, glowing object is first seen at a great height over Oneida, New York, heading west silently.

There are reports from Kansas and Colorado. NORAD radar picks up the object; ADC alerts several bases, including Nellis AFB near Las Vegas, Nevada. Fighters are scrambled from Luke AFB near Phoenix, Arizona, and the jets are possibly heard over Nephi, Utah, after the object passes overhead. Capt. Herman Gordon Shields, flying a C-119 two miles west of Levan, Utah, sees it as a slender object. A man in Silver City, Utah, claims that the object is a glowing ball of light about the size of a soccer ball. He says it is white with a yellowish tint and a bright yellow jagged flame coming from the rear: “As the object passed over Robinson \[in Ogden, Utah?\], it slowed down in \[the\] air, and after, \[a\] gasping sound was heard, the object spurted ahead again. After this procedure was repeated three or four times, the object arched over and began descending to earth after which the object turned bluish color and then burned out or went dark. After the object began to slow down it began to wobble or fishtail in its path.” Several people see the object over Eureka, Utah, apparently crashing and interrupting electrical service from a power plant close to the landing site. It is described as a “glowing, orange oval which emitted a low, whirring sound.” It takes off a few minutes later, continuing to the west. The object lights up the streets of Reno, Nevada, and then turns to Las Vegas. It blares brightly like a “tremendous, flaming sword” over Nellis AFB and then disappears from their radar scopes at 10,000 feet. Witnesses say the object is traveling almost horizontally northeast of Las Vegas until a final explosion occurs from the direction of Mesquite, Nevada. Sheriff’s deputy Walter Bun, who leads the search and rescue unit, moves the unit into the Spring Mountain area in jeeps to search for wreckage. They search through the night, and when the sun comes up they continue using aircraft. They do not find anything of importance except some ashes that might easily be the remains of a campfire started by a hunter some weeks earlier. When no one reports a downed or missing aircraft, Bun and the other deputies call off the search. The object seems to have changed direction, because at Reno it passes west to east, in Utah it is seem going southeast to northwest, and at Nephi it travels west. The duration of the sighting, from New York to Nevada, is only 32 minutes, giving a speed of 4,500 mph, below the speed of meteors.

They determine it is a bolide. Blue Book lists it as two sightings: a multiple radar sighting at Nellis on April 18 with no visual (despite hundreds of observers in Las Vegas), and a bolide over Utah that it claims occurs on April 19. In reality, the Utah and Nevada sightings are only minutes apart (8:15 p.m. Mountain Time). However, there is quite a bit of information from numerous sources concerning this major incident, including Project Blue Book documents, and now possible [confirmation](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://nicap.org/papers/transcript_radarman.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923769206&usg=AOvVaw1MJmY8hXoYOt-lIO1iNwZE) by a radar man at ATIC. The case is also not explained in a Blue Book monthly sighting listing for April 1962.

The takeoff is perfect, but after the A-12 gets to about 300 feet it starts shedding all the “pie slice” fillets of titanium on the left side of the aircraft and one fillet on the right.

On May 11, at NASA’s Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space in Seattle, Washington, Walker mentions the objects photographed (and perhaps shows the slides; it is not mentioned in the proceedings). NICAP is unable to obtain the photos. NASA claims the objects are ice flaking off the aircraft (“fireflies”). They are described by a NASA spokesman as “barbell shaped, bright-orange in color, and passing in groups up to six behind the X-15.” Opinion ranges from “definitely something up there,” to “film spots,” to “sun rays on the lens.” [Jacobsen](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jacobsen&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923776130&usg=AOvVaw3BGQLuXka1_0qngV9_bT6P) implies it was the A-12 test the same day.

Late April or early May — Three women and a 10-year-old boy are driving home to Granby, Connecticut, when two bright yellow lights appear in the sky ahead. The lights cross the road and disappear behind some shrubbery. Driving nearer and stopping, the witnesses see the lights hovering above a field, one above the other. The objects realign horizontally and move toward the car. The driver starts the car up and speeds away, but the lights are right behind her, only a few feet from the rear window and matching the car’s speed. The yellow lights are only a few feet in diameter and have a reddish patch that rotates. They follow the car for four minutes then turn away. (Swords 299–300)

May 12 — 4:10 a.m. Three truckers (Valentino Tomassini, Guro Tomassini, and Humberto Zenobi) are driving from Bahia Blanca to Jacinto Aráuz, La Pampa, Argentina, when they see a lantern-like light resting in a nearby field. It brightens and dims alternately. As they slow down, a row of 20–30 lights come on. When they approach to within 210 feet of the object, it rises up and crosses the road at a height of 12 feet. Its lights go out, a reddish flame comes from the bottom, and it makes a soft humming noise. The UFO then divides into two parts that fly off in different directions. Navy Capt. Luis Sanchez Moreno, chief of intelligence at the Puerto Belgrano Naval Base, interviews the witnesses. At the landing site, grass is burned over an area 180 feet in diameter, and there are damp, gray-colored patches. These are taken for analysis to either or both the Puerto Belgrano Naval Base and Universidad Nacional del Sur, both in or near Bahia Blanca. It consists of calcium carbonate and potassium carbonate.

May 21 — Day. Capt. Gordon Pendleton and First Officer J. P. Murphy are flying an Aer Lingus Vickers Viscount airliner above southern England at 17,000 feet when they see a brown globe-shaped object approaching head-on. It speeds 3,000 feet below the aircraft at about 700 mph. The object has a number of antenna-like projections on its surface.

May 22 — 7:10–7:45 p.m. A formation of Navy planes, led by flight instructor Lt. Rodolfo César Galdos, near Comandante Espora Air Naval Base in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, observes several UFOs over a 35-minute period. Witnesses at the control tower also see an object. Student pilot Roberto Wilkinson sees a luminous object trailing his plane. It lights up his cockpit and his radio transmission is disrupted as it passes underneath.

Summer — Around 9:00 p.m. Harvey Packard and five other men are fishing near East Peru, Maine, when three orange globes show up across the pond and begin dancing about. The globes move toward the witnesses, who get scared and jump in their car and speed away. The globes follow the car, one in the rear and the others on each side. The objects appear to be transparent, 3-foot spheres that easily pace the speeding vehicle. Occasionally they leave their positions and form into a triangle with squarish bridges between them, then split up and continue the car chase.

The car radio is filled with static. Finally, they veer off and fly into the woods. (NICAP case file; Swords 300) Summer — Donald MacKenzie, a shepherd, discovers some strange wreckage in a remote moor near Ardgay, Sutherland,

Scotland, that he thinks is related to Sputnik. In October, a team from RAF Kinloss \[now Kinloss Barracks\] on the Moray Firth arrives to investigate. They find a strange box-shaped object, large enough to have carried a person and containing spaces for cameras and a brass panel that explains, in pictures, what the finder should do in the event of discovery to claim a reward. Buried nearby are a number of bottles of colorless fluid. The team is mystified and suspects something Russian but can’t confirm it. The debris now seems likely to have come from a secret spy balloon, one of many launched in 1955–1956 by the US Air Force from RAF Evanton \[now closed\], to take reconnaissance photos of Russian military and nuclear facilities. Once clear of Soviet territory, the balloons were designed to drop into the Pacific Ocean where its VHF beacon would guide recovery efforts.

June 7 — A brilliant white light, approximately 20 times brighter than first magnitude stars, is seen at Hallett Station \[now closed\], Cape Hallett, East Antarctica, at 250° (true) azimuth, and 30° elevation. Over 5 minutes it remains stationary and is viewed both with binoculars and the naked eye. It appears circular. It is a dazzling gold color and observed between two mountain peaks. The sun at the time is below the horizon. After 5 minutes it moves in a southerly direction and is lost to view behind a peak.

About 9:00 p.m. John notices a bright star in the west that moves occasionally, dips, and hovers. Around 11:45, they notice that the star is brighter and has moved closer, taking the shape of a triangle. At 12:15, the object noiselessly emits three green flares that take on a speedy horizontal flight path. They notice a second, ball-shaped object that races from west to east, flips, and stops at a higher elevation than the first. A “flare-like” light approaches the second and seems to be absorbed by it. The first UFO spits out more green flares, two of which disappear into the second object a few minutes later.

The second object shoots out a rocket that disappears in the sky. A third whitish object, larger and disc-shaped, appears above Pontano Wash with a cone-shaped superstructure. Three stiltlike protuberances appear briefly then are drawn back in. The third object also drops something like a rope that extends to the ground for 3–5 minutes.

July 28 — Before dawn. The skipper of a chartered fishing boat 6 miles southeast of Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, California, sees several stationary lights low in the water dead ahead. Through binoculars he sees a squat, lighted structure in which several men are working, apparently the stern of a submarine with no markings and dacks almost awash. He and another crew member see five men, “two in all-white garb, two in dark trousers and white shirts, and one in a sky-blue jumpsuit.” The craft swept in their direction toward the open sea, still on the surface, and the skipper has to turn hard to keep clear.

August — 7:00 p.m. Three witnesses are driving south toward San José de Métan, Salta, Argentina, when they see a light against the mountains to the west. It approaches, growing as large as the full moon when it is 300 feet ahead of them. It has a bulge at the top and reddish-pink, green, and white blinking lights. It continues to approach and passes above a Fiat truck in the road ahead of them. The truck stops, and the witnesses stop their car as well, two of them walking into some nearby bushes to observe. The object now seems to be the diameter of a DC-3’s wingspan and is 150 feet in the air. The truck’s lights go out, and the object rocks back and forth, taking off to the north at a great rate of speed. Five minutes later, they drive up to the stopped truck, whose driver is scooping up dirt to cool its overheated engine down. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, pp. 157–158)

August — Night. Marilyn Chenarides, her younger brother Roger, and their mother Mildred Anderson are vacationing in a cabin on Movil Lake, Minnesota. The two women see a glowing red, domed disc with large windows hovering

August 2 — Around 12:00 midnight. Air traffic control operators at Cambá Punta Airport \[now Doctor Fernando Piragine Niveyro International Airport\], near Corrientes, Argentina, see an unidentified light approaching the airport. They call the airport manager, Luís Harvey, who arrives from home in a hurry and sees the light circling at high speed. Harvey orders a landing strip freed up but the light, apparently a spherical object, comes down, hovering and revolving a few feet above the same spot on the runway for 3–4 minutes, emitting strong blue, green, and orange flashes. Then it climbs and vanishes at staggering speed. (Loren E.

August 7 — Midnight. A contract worker at the not-yet-operational Titan II launch complex of the 570th Strategic Missile Squadron near Oracle, Arizona, sees a brilliant light descending over the site. He is joined by a colleague as the light gets larger. Both men go inside and contact Davis-Monthan AFB outside Tucson, which sends out two jet interceptors. When the aircraft arrive, the light takes off to the north and disappears rapidly. After the jets circle and head back, the light returns, descends toward the silo, and takes off vertically.

August 17–19 — Evening. Walking home, diamond prospector Rivalino Mafra da Silva sees two small beings, about three feet tall, digging a hole near Duas Pontes, 17 miles north of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil. On August 19, Mafra da Silva and his sons are in bed when they are awakened by sounds and see a shadowy figure, apparently floating in the room. In the morning, he and his son Raimundo see two humming balls floating outside. They merge into one larger ball that moves toward Rivalino, enveloping him in yellow smoke. Raimundo says: “Then the yellow smoke dissolved. The balls were gone. The ground below was clean as if the dust had been removed by a big broom.” He tells his story to Lt. Wilson Lisbõa, chief of police at Diamantina, who conducts a search for 10 days. Only a few drops of blood are found.

Late August — 7:00 p.m. Three witnesses are driving in a rural area about 87 miles from Salta, Argentina, when two of them (the third sleeps through the event) see a light against the mountains to the west that grows larger and moves about 300 feet above the road ahead of them. It is a domed disc with flashing reddish-pink, green, and white lights around its perimeter. The object illuminates a truck ahead of them. The truck stops, and the two witnesses get out of their car and hide in some bushes to see what happens next. The object appears to be nearly 100 feet wide and 150 feet above the truck. The truck’s lights go out and the object takes off to the north at a high rate of speed, climbing out of sight within seconds. They drive up to the truck, whose drivers are throwing dirt into its smoking engine compartment and are more concerned about an insurance claim than a UFO encounter.

August 26 — 12:05 a.m. Geraldo Bichara, 18, is standing guard at the Escola de Sargentos das Armas in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil, when an electrical blackout occurs in the city. Suddenly he is paralyzed by a light beam from an unseen object, apparently for a few minutes. In 1980, Bichara undergoes hypnosis and discovers that the incident was an abduction in which he is taken aboard a UFO by beings wearing pumpkin-colored jumpsuits and subjected to a medical examination. He attempts to flee at one point and grabs his rifle lying nearby, but he is still paralyzed. After about 2 hours he is returned to the guardhouse.

August 30 — 7:35–7:55 p.m. While having supper at an outdoor restaurant near Port-au-Prince, Haiti, three men, one of whom works for Techint Engineering Company, watch a UFO that approaches and hovers for 20 minutes. The engineer has a portable theodolite with him, and they set it up and track the object. It is a silvery-gray disc, like two rounded hubcaps together, and is spinning on its axis. It has an antenna on the top and exhaust ports all around its mid-line, and it is surrounded by gaseous emissions that run through all the colors of the spectrum. The object flips to a vertical alignment, showing its base, and then tips over so that its original topside is on the bottom. The object silently accelerates and disappears in 5 seconds.

Late October — Day. Two Air Force B-52 Stratofortress bombers are returning to Loring AFB \[now the Loring Commerce Centre\] near Limestone, Maine, following an Operation Chrome Dome mission. They are on final approach to landing when a huge, metallic-gray, cigar-shaped UFO descends over the flight line and hovers for a few minutes. It stretches halfway across the aircraft ramp area, which would make it half a mile wide. Jet engine mechanic Sgt. Christopher Smith is watching the scenario from the ground and notes that the UFO is silent and has no lights or visible openings. After the second B-52 lands, the UFO silently zooms away toward the east and disappears. All the ground witnesses and the flight crews do not talk about the incident afterward and act as if nothing happened. (Nukes 132–136, 138–139)

October 28 — 7:30 p.m. Mrs. Ellen D. Sylvester is driving with her three children in Norwood, South Australia, east of Adelaide, when they see an orange glow on the ground about 2–3 miles away. It has three legs, round windows, and the boy remarks that he can see people in it. One of the “men” gets out and descends to the ground. He appears to be doing something to one of the landing legs. He seems to have some trouble in making it retract, which finally he overcomes. He is about 6 feet tall, as his head reaches the outer fringe of the craft. He wears a helmet like a gas mask. He returns to the UFO, which begins to move slowly away, then very fast, and disappears in a northerly direction. Total time of observation is 40 minutes.

November — Evening. A French businessman is driving along a minor road in Var department, southeastern France. It is raining heavily. Rounding a bend, he sees a group of figures in the road 260 feet ahead. He slows down to drive around them and sees that they are actually bizarre animals with the heads of birds and covered in plumage.

Terrified, he speeds ahead and stops about 500 feet further ahead. Turing around, he sees the entities heading toward a luminous, dark-blue object hanging in the air over a field on the other side of the road. It resembles two plates upside down. The entities are sucked into the bottom of the object. He hears a “clack,” and the UFO takes off at “prodigious speed.” (Lyonel Trigano, “[Strange Encounter in Var,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/FSR%25201968%2520V%252014%2520N%25206.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923843423&usg=AOvVaw3GroADzXwm0dUsR5M5flcu)” Flying Saucer Review 14, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1968): 18; Clark III 280)

December 7 — A full-scale mockup of the Q-12 drone is ready at Groom Lake, Nevada, and has already undergone preliminary tests to measure its stealth quality.

December 18 — 2:20 p.m. Night watchman Francesco Rizzi is reporting for work at a mill on Via Santa Valeria in Milan, Italy. In the center of the mill’s courtyard he hears a swishing sound and turns to see a domed metallic disc 12–15 feet in diameter with portholes hovering 3 feet above the ground. A door opens at the bottom and a small man just over 3 feet tall and wearing a luminous overall emerges. The man motions Rizzi to come nearer, but he is frozen with fear. Another small man comes out of the disc, but they both return, the door closes behind them, and the object takes off in a cloud of white smoke. Rizzi reports the sighting to a colleague, the police, and the press, and soon loses his job. (1Pinotti 130–131)

He comes up with the idea that some galactic civilizations could be perhaps millions or billions of years ahead of us, and creates the Kardashev scale to rank such civilizations.

Kardashev defines three levels of civilizations, based on energy consumption: Type I (planetary civilization) with “technological level close to the level presently attained on earth”; Type II (stellar civilization), “a civilization capable of harnessing the energy radiated by its own star”; and Type III (galactic civilization), “a civilization in possession of energy on the scale of its own galaxy.” Various extensions of the Kardashev scale have since been proposed, including the use of metrics rather than pure power. The idea that the CTA-102 emission is caused by a civilization is later rejected when it is identified as one of the many varieties of quasar (quasi-stellar radio source), a term coined by [Hong-Yee Chiu](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong-Yee_Chiu&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923854566&usg=AOvVaw2LFFnXsxjqZ80f1tfQlBg3) in May 1964 to describe these objects.

January — Night. Brothers Rosauro Antonio, Ricardo, and Victor Domingo López discover a burned area of grass in a field just over a mile from their house in Cañada de Alzogaray, near Burruyacú, Tucumán, Argentina.

February 11 — The CIA establishes a Domestic Operations Division for its clandestine services, conducted within the US against “foreign targets.” ()

February 15 — 7:10 a.m. Farmer Charles Brew and his son Trevor are in a shed, milking a herd of cows near Moe, Victoria, Australia. Charles sees an object descend very steeply out of the east from a low cloud, at about a 45° angle. The UFO is about 25 feet in diameter, and about 9–10 feet high.

Adamski says his meeting is at the request of the extraterrestrials he is in contact with in order to ask for a “final agreement” from the pope because of his decision not to communicate directly with them anymore and to offer John XXIII a liquid substance in order to save him from the gastric enteritis that he suffers from.

July — The CIA has synthesized many of the findings from its psychological research into what became known as the “KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation” handbook, which cites the MKUltra studies and other secret research programs as the scientific basis for their interrogation methods. [Donald Ewen Cameron](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ewen_Cameron&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923872257&usg=AOvVaw260gVrFc6IX9bEd1q4cES3) regularly travels around the US teaching military personnel about his techniques (hooding of prisoners for sensory deprivation, prolonged isolation, humiliation, etc.), and how they can be used in interrogations. Latin American paramilitary groups working for the CIA and US military personnel receive training in these psychological techniques at places such as the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia. (In the 21st century, many of these torture techniques are used at US military and CIA prisons such as Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Abu Ghraib, Iraq.) In the aftermath of the 1975 congressional hearings, major news media mainly focus on sensational stories related to LSD, mind-control, and brainwashing, and rarely use the word “torture.” This suggests that the CIA researchers are, as one author put it, “a bunch of bumbling sci-fi buffoons” rather than a rational group of men who have run torture laboratories and medical experiments in major US universities; they have arranged for torture, rape, and psychological abuse of adults and young children, driving many of them permanently insane.

August 1 — Evening. A former RAF pilot and flight instructor sees a triangular UFO that lingers for a long time over Garston, Hertfordshire, England, then climbs out of sight. Thousands of other people in the London area, including an air traffic controller four miles away and future UFO researcher [Timothy Good](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Good&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923879407&usg=AOvVaw0AobPsnMeWdBvGTltks9eO) in Bcckenham, London, also see the object, which has a tetrahedral shape and glassy appearance when seen through binoculars. A USAF F-100 Super Sabre from RAF Bentwaters \[now Bentwaters Parks\] in Woodbridge, Suffolk, and another plane from the De Havilland Aircraft Company are sent up to investigate but cannot get anywhere near the UFO, which is at an estimated 90,000 feet. An amateur astronomer in Bushey, Hertfordshire, takes a clear photo. The official explanation is a balloon.

August 4 — 11:30 p.m. Ronnie Austin and Phyllis Bruce are driving east on State Highway 15 past the Mount Vernon, Illinois, airport when they notice a bright white round object about 20° above the southwest horizon. It seems to be keeping pace with them for several miles. Suddenly it moves about 600 feet in front of them and to the left. When Austin drops Phyllis off at home in Wayne City, it is hanging in the southeast. They continue watching it about 15 minutes, then Austin leaves for home. As he turns east on a gravel road, it shoots ahead of him, taking on an orange hue. At one point it comes within 100 feet of his car, swerves upward, and passes above him as the car radio makes a whining noise and the car engine almost fails. The object then moves behind him from west to east. When he arrives home, it is hovering about 900 feet to the southeast. Ronnie is so shaken, he is given a sedative. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Orville Austin, and brother and sister also see the light, which finally becomes indistinguishable with a star by 1:10 a.m. (NICAP, “[The Wayne City Car Chase (EM RA Traces)](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/630804waynecity_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923880206&usg=AOvVaw0MQsdI-TgsYejOqNsA9V9d)”; Jeffrey Liss, “The Light That Followed a Car,” Fate 16, no. 11 (November 1963): 26–35; [Schopick](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cufos.org/books/A_Study_of_Secondary_Effects-An_Unpublished_Manuscript_of_UFO_E-M_Cases.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923880481&usg=AOvVaw3XxwwD7RiBnbhcSPUYsoCA), pp. 81–88)

August 10 — 9:32 p.m. Several airmen of the 91st Bombardment Wing at Glasgow Air Force Base \[now closed\] near Glasgow, Montana, are walking in the parking lot when a bright light appears above them, bathing everyone in an orange glow. It is coming from a disc-shaped object with a dome that has some odd characters carved in it. The object moves up, then to the right, then down and left. It makes a square, then an X within the square, stopping at all points before moving again. The underside of the object is a large panel of blue light. They watch it for 3 minutes then it disappears.

August 28 — 7:00 p.m. José Marcos Gomes Vidal, 7, and his friends Fernando, 12, and Ronaldo Gualberto, 7, are in the Gualbertos’s backyard in Sagrada Familia, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to wash a coffee strainer in a cistern.

Suddenly, Fernando notices a glow coming from the top of an avocado tree. When he looks up, he sees a UFO hovering above the tree’s branches. The craft, which is spherical and has a pair of antennas on top, is completely transparent. It holds four human-like passengers sitting inside, one of whom sits in front of a machine that appears

to be a control panel. The passengers are about 6 feet tall and dressed in spacesuits. They all have only one eye like a cyclops. Three of them are thin and bald, while the other looks like an overweight woman with blonde hair. The UFO shoots out two rays of yellow light. One of the cyclops appears between the lights, slowly floating down onto the ground. Once his boots touched the earth, the creature begins to walk toward José, who is completely unaware of what is happening since he is still collecting water. Fernando panics and tackles José, who falls to the ground, and Fernando gets back up and faces the cyclops. Now all three boys are aware of the visitor. The

cyclops moves his head and makes hand signals. It speaks a few sounds in a strange language. The creature then turns around and stares back at the UFO. Fernando, spotting a brick on the ground, picks it up and aims it at the cyclops, who turns around and shoots Fernando’s hand with a yellow light from a triangular crest on his chest. Fernando drops the brick, and all three of the boys become calm and frozen. For a few more minutes, the cyclops speaks to them, then it points one of his fingers at the moon and begins to walk back toward the UFO. José asks if he will ever come back. The cyclops shakes his head affirmatively, plucks a plant from the ground, and then waves his hand at the UFO, which shoots out two rays of yellow light again. The cyclops slowly floats back up into the vehicle, and the UFO takes off eastward and disappears out of their sight.

October — A Lisunov Li-2 airliner on the Guangdong to Wuhan, China, air route is chased by three luminous UFOs for 115 minutes. The pilots provide a minute-by-minute report by radio to the Chinese Civil Aeronautics Administration. After landing, the crew is debriefed by air traffic control, and the passengers are told not to discuss the incident with anyone.

October — 9:30 p.m. Five members of a family in Millersport, Ohio, see what seems to be an airplane on fire, but the house-sized object approaches and hovers about 300 feet away. They see a dark disc with a dome and antenna on top and three ball-shaped protrusions on the bottom. Around the rim are evenly spaced openings that emit fiery beams. In the dome, several large windows are visible in which a figure can be seen, at least by the mother. The dome rotates as the object hovers, and it makes a low humming noise. It finally rises slowly and makes a small circle in the air before speeding away.

October 12 — 3:30 a.m. Driving in a blinding rainstorm on the road between Monte Maíz and Isla Verde, Córdoba, Argentina, Eugenio Douglas feels heat and a prickly sensation all over his body. He sees a brilliant light in front of him. Temporarily blinded, he loses control of his truck and ends up in the ditch. Shaken but not injured, he gets out of the vehicle and looks up at the road, which he finds is blocked by an oval-shaped object at least 30 feet high. A door opens on the side and three huge “robots in human form” emerge. They wear helmets with short antennas and are 12–15 feet tall. Douglas takes a few shots at them with his revolver and runs away. The robots return to the UFO, which chases him down the road and eventually flies away. The next day, police find large footprints near the abandoned truck.

October 21 — 9:30 p.m. Yolié del Valle Moreno and her family at Trancas, Tucumán, Argentina, observe six strange objects for 40 minutes in the back courtyard of their house. One UFO hovers at ground level above some railroad tracks, while another with a dome and portholes is near another house. They can see some 40 humanlike figures (silhouettes) moving around within two bright lights linked by a prolongation or tube. When witnesses flash a light at the object, the house is flooded with a strong beam. The temperature rises inside the house and the inhabitants smell a strong sulfurous odor. All six objects are about 24 feet in diameter, have a white and a red beam of light, and leave a cloud of white smoke that does not disperse for 4 hours. Beneath the space where one of the objects has been rocking back and forth, the witnesses find innumerable white balls one-quarter-inch in diameter piled into a cone 3 feet high and within a circle 28–30 feet in diameter. They consist primarily of calcium carbonate.

October 23 — 11:00 p.m. Driving south of South River, New Jersey, on State Route 18, a man glimpses something like a flashlight off to his left, and three figures, 3–4 feet tall, cross the road in front of him. They are dressed in “tight- fitting silver-gray one-piece suits” that “seem to glow once they hit the headlights.” Their heads are found, but the witness can see no other features. They begin quickly “fluttering” across the road, faster than the “fastest sprinter.” (Center for UFO Studies, \[[case documents](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cufos.org/cases/1963_10_23_US_NJ_nr-South-River_MUFON_Smith-CE-III.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923896337&usg=AOvVaw1fHVbdffK2KoYUa02dQATR)\]; Clark III 278)

October 31 — Eight-year-old Rute de Souza hears a strange roar and watches a silvery object coming towards her house near Iguape, São Paulo, Brazil. It soars above her, hits a palm tree, gyrates a bit in the air, then falls into the Rio Peropava near the opposite shore. She runs to get her mother and uncle, who also hear the sound. They see the river boiling up in the spot, followed by an eruption of muddy water and mud. Fishermen, including Tetsuo Ioshigawa, also view the event. The UFO is estimated to be 25 feet in diameter. Divers, both equipped and unequipped, fail to find any wreckage in the river, which is only 12 feet deep.

November 16 — Evening. Four teenagers—John Flaxton, Mervyn Hutchinson, Jenny Holloway, and another youth—are in Sandling Park near Saltwood, Kent, England, when they see a moving reddish-yellow “star” above the woods. It comes down at an angle of 60°, then vanishes. Moments later, they see a bright, golden light in a field about 240 feet away, floating 10 feet above the ground, and seemingly 15–20 feet across. It seems to move along with the teens for a short while. It disappears behind trees, then a dark figure shambles out of the woods. It is all black, about the size of a human but without a head and has bat wings. The teenagers run away. Other witnesses come forward to report strange lights and giant footprints in the woods.

It is clear to Simon that the Hills believe they have seen a UFO, but which may have been an experimental aircraft. This has set in motion an anxiety-provoking psychological experience whose sources it might be possible to uncover through hypnosis. (Clark III 584)

December 27 — At Bank’s Stables in Epping, Essex, England, trainee riding instructor Pauline Abbott sees a shiny white UFO on the ground. It is about 8 feet long, 3 feet high at the center, and has what looks like a window on one side that is brighter than the rest of the object. It takes off, flies horizontally for 100 feet, and disappears. Grass is found flattened over a circular area. Marks “like three large fingerprints pushed together into mud” are found, forming a square with 8-foot sides within an 11-foot circular depression that contains a 3-foot central circle. (G.

1964 — MKSEARCH is the name given to the continuation of the MKUltra program. The MKSEARCH program is divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN / CHICKWIT. Funding for MKSEARCH commences in 1965 and ends in 1971. The project is a joint project between the US Army Chemical Corps and the CIA Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use agents with a focus on incapacitating agents. The purpose of the project is to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques for producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements.

The sessions will continue until June 6. The Hills undergo sessions separately, and for the most part are instructed not to remember their experiences afterwards. Barney’s sessions are particularly intense. However, by the end of the sessions, although they disagree with Simon on the nature of the experience, both the Hills and Simon agree that the therapy is successful. The stress and anxiety are gone. Simon submits a statement to the Hills’ insurance company, which initially declines to pay, until Simon explains that he was treating them for what will later be called PTSD. (Clark III 584–585)

January 23 — The landing craft Loellen M. is in the Gulf of Carpentaria between Cape Grey and Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, Australia, when a crew member notices the compass is malfunctioning (“haywire”) and the vessel is off course, He notices an odd phosphorescence in the water on the starboard side about 6 feet away from the ship. It is a ghostly, pulsating white light that is rotating in a clockwise direction. It seems to be “miles across.” As the light wheel moves to the ship’s port side, another rotating light approaches the ship’s starboard side. This undoubtedly involves some unusual bioluminescence, but it is significant that it is the first “unknown” in the RAAF’s UFO files. (Swords 390)

He says the A-11 can fly more than 2,000 mph at an altitude of 70,000 feet. The YF-12A is announced in part to continue hiding the A-12, its still-secret ancestor; any sightings of CIA/Air Force A-12s based at Area 51 in Nevada can be attributed to the well- publicized Air Force YF-12As based at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

April 11 — 6:30 p.m. Physiotherapist William B. Ochsner and his wife and two children are having a picnic on a hill about 10 miles northwest of Homer, New York. They see an unusually wide vapor trail in the sky stretching from northeast to southwest. At the far end of the white trail is a smoky, spiral portion about one mile long. The vapor trail drifts off. After 10 minutes, Ochsner notices that the spiral portion is still visible, having moved a bit to the west. With binoculars, he sees wisps of smoke streaming out of it. It changes from a horizontal to a vertical position with greater smoke activity. It stops and hangs there for 2–3 minutes before sinking into the clouds. After another 3 minutes, they see a horizontal pencil-shaped object moving from left to right on the horizon. A flash of white light erupts from its end and shoots forward a short distance then stops. It becomes thick in the middle, a cloud of smoke emanates from it, and it shoots backward rapidly. Again it hovers and changes to a saucer shape. It then divides into two parts, one above the other. The top object slowly recedes into the distance, while the bottom objects heads downward at a 45° angle, divides in two again, with the top part fading away and the bottom part assuming a vertical pencil shape, which fades away. The whole display takes 45 minutes. (J.

transport from McMurdo Station, Antarctica, with supplies. The right-side observer first sees the objects approaching at about 460 mph from above and to their right side. When they come abreast of the airplane, they slow to its speed. After a short time, they fly above the airplane and take up position above and to its left side. The pilot attempts to radio the ground but the radio is dead, and their radar also stops working. When the pilot tries to switch to auxiliary power, it too is not functioning. At one point the airplane’s engines stop (the oil begins to congeal in the cold air). Instead of losing altitude, it maintains “a steady altitude and course.” The airplane allegedly continues flying in complete silence, then it enters a “strange haze” (like a white-out) with the air filled with static electricity. There is electrical arcing from one observer’s body to metal inside the fuselage. The haze vanishes after about 20 minutes. The power suddenly returns, and the crew can restart the engines in sequence. The airplane has covered a distance of 305 miles during the 45–50 minutes at indicated airspeed of 184–218 knots.

April 24 — 10:00 a.m. Dairy farmer Gary Wilcox of Newark Valley, New York, is driving a tractor on his property when he sees a shiny object on the inside edge of a nearby patch of woods. He gets off the tractor and approaches the object, which is egg-shaped, 20 feet long, 16 feet wide, and four feet high. It is hovering two feet above the ground and making a sound like a car idling. He touches it and feels a hard metal. Two figures suddenly appear from under the object. They are 4 feet tall and 2 feet wide, dressed in seamless silvery garments. Each carries a tray filled with alfalfa, roots, soil, leaves, and brush. Wilcox hears a voice say, “Do not be alarmed. We have talked to people before.” They ask him what he is doing, and Wilcox says he is spreading manure. One humanoid asks if he can have some and converses some more about space exploration. They claim they are from Mars. After a while, the UFO takes off in a horizontal direction. Wilcox notices some small depressions where the figures were standing, as well as a thin, red, jellylike substance. (Olga M.

April 24 — Around 5:50 p.m. Socorro, New Mexico, police officer [Lonnie Zamora](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/0722057profiles11-07-09.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923933549&usg=AOvVaw2VwbmbYM0PSpG_5fOPVV3p)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/0722057profiles11-07-09.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889923933715&usg=AOvVaw27_yLU2VWo672k82COYK8j) while chasing a speeder, hears a continuous roaring sound and sees a brilliant blue “cone of flame” in the sky to the south-southwest. The bottom of the flame is out of sight behind a hill. Thinking there has been an explosion, he tries to pursue it, turning off to the right on a rough gravel road, but loses sight of it while trying to get the car up a steep hill. By the time he reaches the top, the sound stops and the flame is no longer visible. He then notices a metallic object in a ravine about 450 feet away. At first, he thinks it is an overturned car, but then he sees “two figures in what resembled white coveralls, pretty close to the object on the northwest side, as if inspecting it.” One seems to turn in a startled way as if he hears Zamora’s car approaching. The figures are small, and the object is oval-shaped and positioned so its long axis is horizontal. Zamora loses sight of object as he drives through a dip in the road. He radios headquarters that he is investigating a possible car accident. He stops a second time and gets out, hearing 2–3 loud thumping noises like a door shutting hard. He walks three steps to the front of the car to possibly 50 feet away from the object when he hears a very load roar increasing in volume and sees a smokeless blue-orange flame coming from beneath. He notes a red insignia or lettering on the side of the object. Zamora thinks it is going to explode and runs away, putting the car between him and the object and dropping to the ground. He feels some slight heat from the flame. The roaring noise stops, and Zamora looks up to see the UFO flying away to the southwest at a level height, just clearing an 8-foot dynamite shack. He runs back to the patrol car and radios headquarters, just as the object climbs slowly and goes past Box Canyon or Six Mile Canyon Mountain (about 6 miles away). The entire incident takes place in less than 2 minutes. Police Sgt. M. S. Chavez arrives, and they find burning brush (including a badly damaged creosote bush) where the UFO has been, as well as four asymmetrically placed, trapezoidal imprints 12–16 inches long, 6–8 inches wide, and 4–6 inches deep. An FBI agent, [D.

He notifies army intelligence at White Sands Missile Range, who sends Capt. Richard T. Holder. Military police arrive and collect samples, working by flashlight. The next morning, Holder gets a call from a colonel at the war room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asking for a report. T/Sgt. David Moody from ATIC and Maj. William Conner from Kirtland AFB check the area for radioactivity on April 26.

April 25 — Morning. J. D. Hatch is driving on US Hwy 70 between Mescalero and Tularosa, New Mexico, when a bright oval object descends and seemingly lands on the other side of Round Mountain east of Tularosa. (Clark III 1092)

April 25 — Evening. Two motorists driving on US Hwy 84 between Abiquiu and Espanola, New Mexico, see a strange object that is definitely not an airplane fly straight toward their car before shooting away. All they can see is a blue-flamed exhaust. (Clark III 1092)

April 25? — Night. Two Spanish-speaking people 9 miles away from Golden, New Mexico, watch a light come down from the sky and leave three “smelted” circles some 2 feet in diameter and separated from each other by 20 feet. They mention this story to James Scartacinni, 15, and his grandfather visit the site the next day and find the circles, which they estimate must have been subjected to a temperature of 2,300° F. They return to town and call the state police, who notify the military. Almost immediately, men in uniform cordon off the area, dig up the burned areas to a depth of one foot, and carry the material away.

April 30 — A B-57 pilot at Holloman AFB, Alamogordo, New Mexico, radios to the control tower that he is watching an egg-shaped, white UFO with markings that match the Socorro object. He continues to watch it as it lands at the base.

In addition, a ham radio operator claims to have heard the exchange between the pilot and control tower. Holloman AFB denies the incident occurred. Shortly afterward, an airman walks into a clothing store in Alamogordo and spins an incredible story of a UFO parked in a hangar under heavy guard at Holloman. A couple days later, he returns to the store and denies everything.

Sightings are systematically broken down by witness category and special types of evidence.

Individual chapters are devoted to sightings by military personnel, pilots and aviation experts, and scientists and engineers. Another chapter is devoted to evidence of intelligent control and another to physical evidence or interactions, such as electromagnetic effects, radar tracking, photographs, sound, physiological effects. Another section examines observed patterns, such as descriptions of shape, color, maneuvers, flight behavior, and concentrations of sightings. House Majority Leader [John W.

May 5 — 8:30 a.m. Alfred Ernst, a farmer near Comstock, Minnesota, sees a luminous UFO like a child’s top from about 1,500 feet away. It rises straight up and disappears into the overcast sky after a few seconds. Ernst and his brother find a crater-like depression, about 3 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep at the center, at the spot where the object was sitting. A series of smaller holes form an X around the larger depression. The earth seems burned on the perimeter of the hole and a whitish substance is found.

May 15 — Between 11:30 a.m. and 12:15 p.m. Two targets are simultaneously tracked on surveillance and FPS-16 radars at Stallion Site, the most northerly range of the Army-controlled Holloman–White Sands complex a few miles east of San Antonio, New Mexico. The targets are north of the radar site, performing “perfect, precise flight maneuvers” in tandem, involving separations and rejoins and “up-and-down ‘pogo’ maneuvers.” One radar operator obtains a visual sighting of two brown-colored, football-shaped objects that are flying at very low altitude and are lost from view behind buildings at the site. The two targets are displayed as skin paints. However, IFF transponder codes are also received on two different frequencies alternately.

May 19 — 7:00 a.m. Mike Bizon, 10, sees a square or spindle-shaped, bright-silver UFO on the ground in Hubbard, Oregon, while he is leading a cow out to pasture. The cow, normally eager to be let out, acts very reluctant and nervous. The object is resting on four legs in an adjacent wheat field. It rises slowly off the ground to the height of a telephone pole, then zooms straight up emitting a soft beeping sound. Bizon smells an odor like gas fumes.

Three imprints in the shape of an equilateral triangle are found in an area of flattened wheat about 4 feet wide. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

May 21 — 4:30 a.m. At Altus AFB, Oklahoma, Missile Site 7, southeast of Ranchland, Texas, a large bright light is seen directly over the facility below 10,000 feet.

When the film is developed, a man, encased in a white spacesuit and helmet, is clearly visible behind Elizabeth’s head.

Templeton and his family claim they had seen no one when the photo was taken. He tells the Carlisle police, who are puzzled. Kodak is intrigued enough to conduct an inquiry. They rule out a double exposure. However, one possibility is that the image is an overexposed view of the back of Templeton’s wife. After the photo receives some local publicity, Templeton gets a call from someone describing himself as an investigator. Templeton agrees to meet with him and an associate and visit the marsh. Two men dressed in dark business suits show up and drive him to the site. They refuse to give Templeton their names, referring to themselves only as “9” and “11.” They are mostly interested in finding out if any nearby animals had been agitated. Then they insist that the figure was just a passerby, get angry, and drive away, leaving Templeton stranded and having to walk home 5 miles away. (Gordon

May 26 — 7:43 p.m. Paul Wańkowicz, RAF pilot and ex-Smithsonian satellite tracker, sees a thin, white ellipsoid, estimated at 15–20 feet in length at 1,000 feet altitude, at Cambridge, Massachusetts. It flies straight and level from nearly overhead to the east-northeast, where it disappears behind the roof of a Sears Roebuck store as viewed from his car in the parking lot to the south. He briefly loses sight of it as it passes behind cumulus cloud cover. No noise or trail. The tops of cumulus clouds are at least 3,500 feet altitude, thus the UFO’s speed is at least 700 mph and length 50– 70 feet.

He notes that the sky is clear and there are no thunderstorms in the entire Boston area. (“Astronomers and UFO’s: A Survey, Part 2, Sightings,” IUR 2, no. 4 (April 1977): 4)

June — 2:00 a.m. A young couple is driving home from a dance at a small place north of Santa Barbara, California, when a circular, glowing object silently appears above their car. They stop to watch. It is about 100 feet high and 40 feet in diameter and seemingly emits some heat. It hovers for 2 minutes then speeds off ahead of them, lighting up the valley as it goes and apparently traveling about 1,800–2,400 mph.

June — 6:30 p.m. Bert Gammie, his mother, and his daughter Lynn are driving along the northern shore of Green Lake, British Columbia, when they see a light above a mountain across the lake to the south. Soon they notice it is moving and is now almost directly overhead. He stops the car and gets out for a closer look. The object is circular, dull metallic, and has a series of vents in the tail trailing white, blue, red, and orange exhaust. They watch it for 3 minutes moving slowly to the north at about 50 mph and making a whistling noise. It makes a sharp right-angle turn, proceeds west, and disappears from sight. Gammie reports the sighting to the RCAF in Vancouver, and a senior air force officer visits him later and shows him a bulky portfolio of glossy UFO photos, many of them showing detailed features. Gammie tells him that the UFO he had seen did not exactly resemble any of the photos, and the officer tells him that the RCAF would not admit to interviewing him if the case receives any publicity.

June 2 — 4:00 p.m. Charles Keith Davis is outside his grandmother’s home in Hobbs, New Mexico, when a small, tan, top-shaped object with a soot-like trail appears and hovers above the boy’s head, enveloping him in a cloud. He starts crying and screaming, and the object shoots straight up and disappears. His hair is singed and his face and

ears are swollen and burned, although he does not feel any pain. They take him to the hospital, where doctors notice the soot embedded in his flesh. The burns respond well to treatment and he stays 5 nights in the hospital. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, pp. 191–192)

June 14 — 8:35 p.m. Charles Englebrecht, 18, is watching TV at home in Dale, Indiana, when the house lights and TV suddenly go out. He notices that a small, bright orange-colored, basketball-sized object has landed in his back yard. As he goes out the side door and tries to approach it, he feels a tingling sensation and has difficulty moving. After a few seconds the sphere takes off and goes over the nearby barn. Several items in the backyard have been moved (lawn mower, chicken feeder). He smells sulfur or burning rubber and find three imprints in a triangle with the dimensions of 2 feet by 4.5 feet by 4.5 feet.

It is moving towards his car at a 45° angle. In an instant it appears right in front of his headlights, no more than 5 feet away and a foot above the ground. Shaped like a giant top, it emits a “hissing sound like a million snakes.” The amber-colored UFO has a sharp, steeple-like cone rising from its top midsection. It moves above his car leaving a strong odor of embalming fluid and a gaseous vapor that leaves an oily substance over his car, even after repeated washings. After several passes over his car, it starts spinning and takes off vertically. Parham now notices his arms are beginning to burn. He immediately reports his sighting to the mayor of Lavonia, then personnel at the Anderson Regional Airport in South Carolina, where he meets local FAA officials who check his car for radiation. They get readings from the oily stains, as well as both his arms from the shoulder down.

Its bottom side is fully visible; on the dark upper side are three lights: red, clear, red. The red lights are blinking. As the object ascends, the lights go out. A brilliant green light then shines from the bottom, illuminating the trees. A foul odor “like embalming fluid or brake fluid” hangs in the air after the object leaves.

July 16 — Shortly after noon. Five boys (Edmund Travis, Randy Travis, Floyd Moore, Billy Dunlap, and Gary Dunlap) are playing around an apple tree at Conklin, New York, when they notice a shiny, dome-shaped object in a field along the roadside. Looking for the source of a whistling sound, the boys spot a 3-foot-tall humanoid figure crouching in a tree about 150 feet away. It is dressed in a shiny black uniform, short-sleeved shirt, and black helmet. The whistling appears to emanate from his stomach. The boys throw stones and apples at it, but the figure is too far away. After about 15 minutes, the figure, moving stiffly, falls backwards out of the tree and floats slowly into the bushes. They can see it crawling through the weeds back to the UFO. A round, flattened area is found in the field where the grass is crushed and bushes are broken. In the middle is dried, yellow moss that
