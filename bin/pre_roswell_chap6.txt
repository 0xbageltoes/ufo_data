1932                        On the shore of the Long Island Sound, Connecticut. Around 1932 or 1933, two witnesses observed a strange cigar-shaped aerial 
                            device over the Connecticut shore of Long Island Sound. The object emitted a pink glow at the front and a light swirl of gray 
                            smoke along its sides, moving at great speed. It lacked conventional aircraft features like rudders, wings, or elevators and 
                            disappeared towards the northwest. (Chapter 6, Ref 210)

1933                        Near Allentown, PA. A Pennsylvania motorist encountered a landed UFO near Allentown while fixing a flat tire. He 
                            approached a field where he saw an eerie purple light and found a bell-shaped craft about six feet tall and 10 feet in diameter. 
                            The craft had a circular door emitting the light, and the witness briefly entered the dome-shaped interior with instrumentation 
                            and cold, ammonia-scented air. After inspecting it for around 10 minutes, he left to finish changing his tire. (Chapter 6, Ref 211)
203
1938                        La Grange, Georgia. A witness in La Grange, Georgia, reported observing a large, domed, saucer-shaped object flying over 
                            the area during daylight hours. The object was estimated to be as large as modern commercial airliners, displaying what appeared 
                            to be portholes. The witness estimated its altitude at 4,000 to 5,000 feet and its speed at nearly 1,000 miles per hour. (Chapter 6, Ref 212)
204
1938                        Idaho. A man in Idaho witnessed a high-speed UFO during daylight hours. While working as a surveyor near Boise, he observed 
                            a disc-shaped craft that appeared to be rotating rapidly, causing a blurred effect at its edges. The UFO had no visible engines, 
                            cockpit, or exhaust trail, and it moved across the sky so quickly that the witness had difficulty keeping it in focus. The estimated 
                            height of the object was around 4,000 feet when it vanished from sight. (Chapter 6, Ref 213)
205
1938                        Arbuckle, Texas. A witness in Arbuckle, Texas, reported seeing a large, gray, dirigible-shaped UFO. The object had no 
                            visible undercarriage but featured a row of windows reflecting sunlight. The UFO then rapidly shot off sideways and vanished from view. (Chapter 6, Ref 214)
206
1931                        Over the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Aviator Sir Francis Chichester reported encountering a UFO resembling 
                            an airship while flying over the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. He observed a gray-white airship-like object with 
                            flashes of light, but the object vanished and reappeared before ultimately becoming translucent, reminiscent of descriptions of 
                            flying saucers. (Chapter 6, Ref 215)
207
1932                        Greenland. Two Danish air force pilots flying over Greenland encountered a hexagonal, flat craft made of metal, which they 
                            described as unlike any flying machine of their time. They felt a sense of hostility from the craft and later believed that 
                            it resembled a flying saucer. (Chapter 6, Ref 216)
208
1933                        Sussex, England. Four British Royal Air Force fighters encountered a large, circular lighted object during a training flight over 
                            Sussex, England. The object dropped into the center of their formation, causing two planes to experience engine failures and one pilot to 
                            sustain burns to his face and hands. (Chapter 6, Ref 217)
209
Sep. 1936                   Staffordshire, England. A young girl in Staffordshire, England had a close encounter with a brown, cigar-shaped craft with 
                            portholes that descended near her as she was about to draw water from a well. She felt paralyzed during the encounter and later found 
                            that she had drawn water from the well without remembering doing so. (Chapter 6, Ref 218)
210
1936                        Italy. A confidential report to Benito Mussolini described two types of UFO sightings in Italy. The first was a polished, 
                            metallic disc with reflective properties, and the second was a gray or slate-colored metallic tube resembling an aerial torpedo 
                            with windows and alternating lights. Additionally, two hat-shaped craft, resembling priest's hats, were observed following the 
                            torpedo-like object. (Chapter 6, Ref 219)
211
1936                        Malta. Witnesses near Malta observed a "zeppelin-shaped" object flying at high speed just off the shore. Despite its 
                            appearance, the object was not a known dirigible, as all zeppelins and other airships from various nations were accounted for at the 
                            time. Some observers claimed to have seen people with strange helmets inside a gondola on the craft. (Chapter 6, Ref 220)
212
1938                        Norway. A witness in Norway had a close encounter with a disc-shaped UFO. He heard an electrical generator-like sound, saw 
                            a blue object with a reddish halo rise from the ground, and felt stinging exhaust fumes that resembled burned rubber. 
                            The UFO exhibited curious movement patterns, including rising and settling like a falling leaf, before flying off silently. (Chapter 6, Ref 221)
213
1933                        Near Tobin Lake, Saskatchewan. Residents near Tobin Lake in Canada's Saskatchewan province observed strange lights attributed to swamp gas, 
                            until three witnesses approached a glowing, oval-shaped object on the ground. The craft had humanoid figures, short in stature, 
                            moving around it, and upon returning the next day, the witnesses found deep impressions and a burned circular area where 
                            the object had been. (Chapter 6, Ref 222)
214
1933                        Near Tobin Lake, Saskatchewan. Around the same time, a woman had a potentially unsettling daylight encounter in the same area, 
daytime                     witnessing "little green men" wearing silvery suits near a pond. Her memory of the event was vague, leading her to suggest the 
                            possibility of abduction. (Chapter 6, Ref 223)
215
1933                        Australia. In Australia, a woman claimed to have experienced a UFO abduction when a shining egg-shaped craft descended from the sky. 
                            Gray-skinned beings emerged, temporarily paralyzed her with an instrument, and took her aboard the craft, where she was examined 
                            while strapped to a table. (Chapter 6, Ref 224)
216
1935                        Seville, Spain. In Spain, a farmer witnessed a large, illuminated round object descending to hover above the ground, from which small 
                            beings emerged and walked around the craft in 1935. (Chapter 6, Ref 225)
217
1938                        Guadalajara, Spain. Two Spanish soldiers had a close encounter with a lens-shaped UFO in Guadalajara in 1938. They observed two 
                            figures descending from the craft on a platform, experienced a blue beam striking them, and witnessed the occupants and platform 
                            being drawn back into the object before it took off. (Chapter 6, Ref 226)
218
1938                        Northern Greece. In northern Greece in 1938, a witness encountered two tall humanoid occupants near an egg-shaped UFO. The occupants 
                            entered the craft, which took off vertically without flames or noise. A mysterious bottle left behind by the occupants spontaneously 
                            combusted when touched, setting fire to nearby vegetation. (Chapter 6, Ref 227)
219
1938                        Northern British Columbia. In 1938, a Canadian provincial policeman claimed to have discovered the bodies of five small humanoid 
                            creatures in a remote cave in northern British Columbia. The beings were described as having large heads and long fingers, dressed 
                            in tight-fitting spacesuit-like garments. The officer shared this story with UFO investigators before his death in 1997. (Chapter 6, Ref 228)
220
1938                        Somerville, Massachusetts. In 1938, a man in Somerville, Massachusetts reported encountering a UFO with strange occupants. He initially 
                            mistook the object for a blimp but noticed that it lacked typical features. He then saw lighted windows and the silhouette of a thin, 
                            spindly entity with a long head and stooped shoulders staring down at him from one of the windows. The object disappeared behind 
                            clouds, ending the encounter. (Chapter 6, Ref 229)
221
1933                        Milan, Italy. In the 1930s, there are reports of UFO crashes outside the United States. Limited information is available on these incidents. 
                            Documents from the early 1930s in Italy suggest instructions from Benito Mussolini regarding UFO information, including a reference to a 
                            crashed UFO near Milan in 1933. (Chapter 6, Ref 230)
222
1936                        Black Forest region, Germany. A crashed UFO was reportedly recovered. (Chapter 6, Ref 231)

223
1938                        In Poland near the border with Germany. A third retrieval of a crashed UFO in Europe. (Chapter 6, Ref 232)

224
1938                        Near Tibetan border. In 1938, Chinese archaeologists discovered aligned graves in remote caves near the Tibetan border, containing small 
                            humanoid skeletons with large heads. Drawings of figures wearing helmets and a celestial map were found, along with over 700 engraved stone 
                            discs that vibrated and contained embedded alloys. The inscriptions suggested an ancient extraterrestrial astronaut story, connecting to 
                            indigenous legends of small beings from the clouds. (Chapter 6, Ref 233)
