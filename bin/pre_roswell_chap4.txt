1910                        Germany. In the years preceding World War I (1910-1919), enigmatic dirigible-type mystery airships, which 
                            had been appearing in the skies since 1896, saw their final prominence as Germany's zeppelins matched 
                            their capabilities. This period marked the convergence of known and unknown airship technology before the 
                            outbreak of the war in 1914. (Chapter 4)
146
Jan. 1910                   Chattanooga area, Tennessee and Huntsville Alabama. In the beginning of the decade, an unusual white cigar-shaped 
                            object, resembling a large airship, appeared in the skies over east Tennessee. Witnesses reported its presence 
                            for three consecutive days in January 1910, describing it as traveling at around 30 miles per hour, emitting 
                            engine-like noises, and featuring flickering blue flames along its underside. The craft eventually flew towards 
                            Alabama and was spotted again over Huntsville, around 75 miles from its initial sighting location. (Chapter 4, Ref 155)
147
Jan. 1910                   Knoxville, Tennessee. During this period, a newspaper in Knoxville, located north of Chattanooga, documented that two 
                            notable residents witnessed a sizable airship flying southward. The observers noted sparks emanating from its engines 
                            and could discern the sound of machinery. The described airship had the characteristics of a dirigible balloon. (Chapter 4, Ref 156)
148
1911                        Chatham Township, Ontario. In 1911, an enigmatic aircraft, described as enormous and lacking visible wings, captivated the 
                            Canadian province of Ontario. Several witnesses reported the UFO's prolonged presence in the sky, displaying the ability to 
                            stay aloft for days and maneuver without landing. The craft emitted brilliant lights, floated at low altitudes, and then 
                            ascended rapidly before disappearing into the distance. (Chapter 4, Ref 157)
149
Jan. 1913                   Britain. By 1913, the phenomena of mystery airships had transitioned to the British Isles. In January of that year, two 
                            individuals, including a policeman, noticed an unfamiliar aerial presence as they heard the sound of a motor near the English 
                            coast. A civilian witnessed an accompanying airborne light. The policeman's report suggested that the aircraft must have 
                            possessed strong engines and required skilled piloting to navigate in challenging weather conditions. (Chapter 4, Ref 158)
150
Late Jan. 1913              Cardiff Wales. A peculiar sighting occurred in Cardiff, Wales. A policeman recounted observing a large, fast-moving object 
                            in the dusky and foggy sky, which left behind a thick trail of smoke. The witness compared it to the Willows airship but 
                            noted its larger size. The object vanished swiftly after being spotted by both the policeman and a bystander. (Chapter 4, Ref 159)
151
Feb. 1913                   Wales. In February, other eyewitnesses in Wales were able to determine the outline of the mystery object that was spotted in Cardiff. It was, 
                            they said, dirigible-shaped. (Chapter 4, Ref 160)
152
Feb. 1913                   England. Throughout the month of Feb., a dirigible-like object was observed multiple times in the nighttime skies of England. 
                            One instance involved the craft hovering over a town for about 20 minutes, illuminating houses with a searchlight before departing rapidly. (Chapter 4, Ref 161)
153
Feb. 1913                   British Isles. A fishing boat's crew reported an airship encircling their trawler twice while directing a powerful searchlight onto them. (Chapter 4, Ref 162)

154
Apr. 1913                   Cardiff, Britain. In April, the mystery airship made a reappearance in Cardiff. A local policeman calculated its speed to be 
                            between 60 and 70 miles per hour, a remarkable velocity for dirigibles during that era. (Chapter 4, Ref 163)
155
Feb. 1910                   Greer Idaho. During the second decade of the 20th century, in addition to unknown dirigible-like crafts, witnesses reported sightings 
                            of more aerodynamic and advanced aerial objects reminiscent of modern UFOs. In February 1910 near Greer, Idaho, a young boy observed 
                            a large yellow globe with a diameter of around half a mile, moving slowly and emitting a golden light. The object traveled at low 
                            altitudes, exhibited precise control, and produced a strong draft while making minimal sound. (Chapter 4, Ref 164)
156
1910                        Fulton County, Arkansas. In 1910, a young brother and sister had an enigmatic encounter near their home in Fulton County, Arkansas. They 
                            observed a silver-colored, zeppelin-shaped object hovering above the trees without anything hanging from its underside. The object vanished 
                            after taking off, leading the witnesses to believe it wasn't a conventional balloon as they initially thought. (Chapter 4, Ref 165)
157
1912                        Alameda, California. In 1912, three teenagers in Alameda, California witnessed a group of UFOs flying in precise vertical formation. The 
                            objects were pale green and perfectly round, appearing like discs on edge rather than spherical. They were sizable, about 75 to 100 feet 
                            in diameter, and exhibited no noise or vapor trails as they flew, leaving a lasting impression on the witnesses. (Chapter 4, Ref 166)
158
1913                        Lansing, Michigan. In 1913, an unidentified aerial object captured attention in Lansing, Michigan, as it swiftly passed through the sky 
                            during sunset. Witnesses described it as elongated, lacking lights, and too fast for an ordinary balloon. An eyewitness highlighted its 
                            golden hue and estimated its diameter to be over 100 feet, moving silently at a speed of 100 to 200 miles per hour. The object's 
                            characteristics aligned more with the modern concept of a UFO than a traditional dirigible-type airship. (Chapter 4, Refs 167, 168)
159
1914                        Romania. During the early years of World War I, a village in Romania encountered a week-long series of visits by a UFO. The object, 
                            described as football-shaped with an "exhaust pipe," emitted a reddish glow and left trails of glowing sparks. It flew at low altitudes, 
                            generating a whistling noise and bending trees, and during one incident, it caused burns to a woman inside a house it had hovered over. (Chapter 4, Ref 169)
160
1917                        Salida, Colorado. In 1917, a clergyman in Salida, Colorado, observed an unconventional aerial phenomenon through his telescope. He described 
                            the object as resembling a wheel that appeared to rotate or move, accompanied by shifting colored lights. (Chapter 4, Ref 170)
161
1918                        Waco, Texas. In 1918, soldiers stationed at an Army base in Waco, Texas, were startled by the appearance of a UFO. The object, described 
                            as cigar-shaped and around 100 to 150 feet long, defied conventional dirigible characteristics. It lacked motors, rigging, and windows, 
                            emitted no noise, and had a distinct rose or flame-like color. The soldiers were left puzzled and amazed by the encounter. (Chapter 4, Ref 171)
162
1916                        France. During World War I, modern-type UFO sightings were reported in combat zones as well. In 1916, three British infantrymen 
                            stationed in France witnessed an object that initially resembled a zeppelin hovering over their trenches. However, the object swiftly 
                            accelerated forward at an incredible speed, estimated to be around 200 miles per hour. (Chapter 4, Ref 172)
163
1917                        France. In 1917, an American soldier in a French anti-aircraft balloon unit recounted an encounter with a disc-shaped UFO. The object, 
                            likened to a giant mess plate, hovered over a field before silently ascending into the clouds. The soldiers were told the sighting was 
                            likely a new German "Super Zeppelin", but the witness later began to doubt that explanation due to the object's substantial size, which 
                            would have required an exceptionally large zeppelin to carry. (Chapter 4, Ref 173)
164
1910                        Balitomore, Maryland. In 1910, witnesses in Baltimore reported seeing a cigar-shaped metallic UFO hovering over a baseball field with 
                            strange occupants inside. The craft had colorful windows, and about 20 small creatures wearing fur-like clothing and conical helmets were 
                            observed taking turns peering out, each with small eyes and slitlike mouths. (Chapter 4, Ref 174)
165
1912                        Western Canada. In 1912, a young boy in western Canada reported a close encounter with UFO occupants. He claimed a round craft landed 
                            on his family's farm, and he described the ufonauts as short beings with round feet, lacking knees or elbows. The witness also stated 
                            that they communicated with him through telepathy. (Chapter 4, Ref 175)
166
1913                        Koyuk, Alaska. Around 1913, in a remote Eskimo village near Koyuk, Alaska, an unusual account describes a landed UFO and its small occupants. 
                            According to native stories passed down through generations, these three ufonauts became stranded there about a century prior when 
                            their flying "silvery disc" was disabled. These beings, who gained strength despite their size, integrated with the Eskimo community, 
                            learned the native language, and were described as elderly by 1913, suggesting they likely passed away a few years later. (Chapter 4, Ref 176)
167
Jun. 1914                   Hamburg, Germany. In 1914, near Hamburg, Germany, a less than friendly encounter involved a UFO landing. A local man observed four or five 
                            approximately four-feet-tall occupants near a glowing, cigar-shaped craft with illuminated windows. As the man approached, the occupants 
                            entered the craft, which then ascended vertically without any sound. (Chapter 4, Ref 177)
168
Aug. 1914                   Georgian Bay near the Canadian side of Lake Huron. In August 1914, a purposeful UFO landing occurred on Georgian Bay near Lake Huron's 
                            Canadian side, witnessed by nine individuals. A peculiar craft, about nine feet high and 12 feet long, landed. Two small figures in green 
                            and purple attire, wearing square yellow masks on their shoulders, were seen on top of the craft. They manipulated a hose from a 
                            porthole, later joined by three more creatures adjusting rods on the ship's upper part. After a few minutes, the beings entered the 
                            craft through the porthole, and as it ascended, water was sucked up, leaving a mist. The craft changed color, turned left, and flew away. (Chapter 4, Ref 178)
169
1915                        Norway. In a 1915 Norway landing case, a witness encountered two small, seemingly friendly humanoids emerging from a dark bell-shaped 
                            object that landed behind a hill. One of the humanoids, around three feet tall, approached the witness, displaying distinctive features such 
                            as a large head, wavy hair, gray skin, and a smile. The beings returned behind the hill before the object ascended and departed rapidly. (Chapter 4, Ref 179)
170
1916                        Suffolk, England. During World War I, around 1916 or 1917, a woman in Suffolk, England, witnessed a peculiar UFO. She saw a round 
                            platform with a railing, roughly 13 feet in diameter, flying about 30 feet above the ground. The object, carrying around a dozen "men" 
                            dressed in blue uniforms and round hats, came from nearby marshes. As it approached, it turned, vanished behind trees and houses, 
                            and emitted no sound. (Chapter 4, Ref 180)
171
1917                        Youngstown, Pennsylvania. In 1917, a Pennsylvania man encountered a "traditional" landed UFO. While walking near railroad tracks between 
                            Mt. Braddock and Youngstown, he saw a saucer-shaped object with a dome on top, similar in size to a car, positioned about 100 feet 
                            away in a pasture. The craft featured oval or oblong windows through which figures could be seen moving. After observing it, the 
                            UFO took off gradually with a high-pitched sound. (Chapter 4, Ref 181)
172
1919                        Western Australia. In 1919, a man in western Australia encountered a landed UFO and its occupant. While walking along a rural road, 
                            he found a "man" repairing a peculiar craft. Startled by the witness, the stranger pointed something at him, causing him to lose 
                            consciousness. Upon waking up, the stranger and the craft had disappeared. (Chapter 4, Ref 182)
173
1919                        Webster City, Iowa. In 1919, a brother and sister on a farm near Webster City, Iowa, encountered unusual visitors. They saw a 
                            brown-green object near a tree and ran toward it, noticing a stern-looking figure in green-brown clothes standing by an open door. 
                            The figure made strange guttural sounds. A shorter figure appeared, quickly dipped water from the stream in a tin can, and was then 
                            hurried into the craft by the larger figure, after which the craft ascended rapidly, hitting tree branches. The craft moved sideways 
                            and over a hill with its three legs down, leaving without lights or sound. The children followed but soon lost sight of it. Round 
                            marks resembling cane imprints were left on the soil where it had landed. (Chapter 4, Ref 183)
