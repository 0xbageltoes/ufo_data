-   **1st January, 0h:** In Hertfordshire/Middlesex (England), monks from the abbey of Saint-Alban saw around midnight, a kind of large vessel of elegant shape, well rigged and of a wonderful colour, in a serene sky and in fine weather, the stars shone clearly and the moon was in its 8th day of its month; the monks contemplated it for a long time before it disappeared.
