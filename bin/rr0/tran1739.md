- On the east coast of Canada, first appearance of the Palatine Light phenomenon after the unexplained sinking of the Princess Augusta. Its degrees of brightness vary often, sometimes like a spot on the sea, sometimes like a fire. And, to note, it emits light rays just like the light wheels observed in the Indian Ocean or the Persian Gulf. The captain of the merchant ship Somerset, who saw it for the first time, describes the circumstances of the phenomenon in his logbook: This view impressed me so much that I gained the place where the burning ship had disappeared (\...), but found no survivors, no wreckage. Much effort is made by the port police, often alerted by people who claim to have witnessed a fire at sea, without any trace of anything, any clues of shipwreck or hoax.
