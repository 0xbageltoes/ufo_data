- Thousands of witnesses report the presence of huge, silent objects hovering above Westchester Wing, in the Hudson Valley (New York State), with rotating lights. Among these witnesses are meteorologists, journalists and even police officers. Yet the authorities claim that the phenomenon observed is limited to a few planes in formation. The video footage shot that day by local residents challenge the official version of events.

The guards ask the public not to enter the zone, effectively (and apparently illegally) closing the land to public use [\[Peebles 1995\]]{.source}.

-   Commander [Jean-Gabriel Greslé](GresleJeanGabriel.html) is piloting a Boeing 747 at 11,500 meters above Detroit, connecting Los Angeles and Montreal. He observes a luminous trail created by 3 metallic-looking balls, shining like polished steel but without their own luminosity.


- On the same frequency as the Detroit control tower, 2 other crews, one from Lufthansa and the other from Olympic Airways, witness the same phenomenon and alert the ground technicians. It was estimated that the 3 spherical objects were 10 km away from the Boeing 747, flying at 3300 km/h (compared to 900 km/h for the plane) and had a diameter of around 40 to 50 m.

- A Kondair Trislander cargo flight from London to Amsterdam is violently struck by an unknown object. The impact is so strong that one of the engines detaches. Fortunately, the plane manages to reach Schipol (Netherlands), where it makes a successful forced landing. The aircraft has a large hole in the tail and has clearly been pierced by something. Only metal fragments will be found at the impact site, ruling out the hypothesis of a collision with a bird.

He provides more details during a closed session [*Los Angeles Times*, November 19th 1955].
