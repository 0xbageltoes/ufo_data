- The first solid-state germanium device (semiconductor) of [Henry Moray](MorayHenryT.html) is submitted to the United States Patent Office, and is rejected due to the fact that it cannot operate without an excited cathode.


-   (or 1928) **July**: We saw, as did many people, a glowing cylinder flying towards the East above the village of Piatra-Olt (Romania) at an incredible speed and without any noise. The object was bigger than the Moon. It was yellow and illuminated the streets so much that it was as if it were midday. It exploded in the air into a fountain of red sparks [\[Eremencu Petre\]]{.source}.


-   **October 28:** In Zanesville (Ohio), [Thomas Townsend Brown](BrownThomasTownsend.html) performs experiments at his Experimental Physics Laboratory on the force acting on charged conductors. The device takes two forms, as described in a manuscript entitled *Tapping Cosmic Energy* dated this day, which at the time is submitted for publication to the magazine *Physical Review*, but rejected.
