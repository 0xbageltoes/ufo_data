- An aircraft carrying business people enters a dark cloud - the only one in the sky. Farmers suddenly see it fall back, one wing partly torn off. The fuel tanks detach and fall.

-   **November:** On the occasion of the Idu earthquake (Japan), lights were seen for 1 hour after it occurred. They were sometimes irradiated like the rays of the rising sun, sometimes like the lights of a projector, sometimes like balls of fire, reported Frank Lane. Very bright balls of light were also seen, arranged "in line", bluish, yellow or purple. They shone with such brilliance that at a distance of fifty kilometers from the epicenter, they appeared brighter than the Moon, and in Tokyo, many witnesses declared that they could make out "objects" under their light. These lights can be seen from a distance of 110 km.
