-   **April 5, 9:50am:** Near Long Beach (California), [Gerry Casey](pilotes.html#CaseyGerry) and his student pilot observe an orange UFO.


-   **June:** And July. At Båttjønndalen/Hessdalen (Norway), Jon Aspås and his uncle Martin Lyng saw 3 different lights, the largest being the size of the Moon, and the smallest being the size of a star. After a moment smoke came out of the largest object, masking the lights. When the smoke disappeared, the lights had also disappeared [\[Wisth: UFO-Mysteriet I Hessdalen, 1983, 43\] \[Krogh: Hessdalenrapporten, 1984, 11\] \[The Hessdalen report, 1985, 7\] \[Havik: UFO-Fenomenet, 1987, 13\] \[Liljegren: A bibliography of references to UFO incidents during World War II., 1987, 10\] \[Krogh: The Hessdalen report, 1990, 7-8\]]{.source}


-   **August 26:** After the Battle of Kursk, Russian military personnel
    saw the sky crossed by an engine in the shape of a crescent whose
    central part dilates and contracts alternately.

-   **September**: The Blue Division (Spanish volunteers fighting with
    the Germans against Russia), among them Jesus Arias (Austuria), Paz
    (Galicia), Tomas Carbonell (Allicante) are in a bunker during a
    battle between German and Russian air forces when they see an
    object shaped like a disk above the planes in full combat as if
    they were watching the battle. Then they disappear with a
    fantastic acceleration [\[Oscar Rey Brea, reporter who worked in
    the early 1970s in the radio test team of La Corona. Antonio

-   **Late October-Early November:** An experiment on the action of a powerful magnetic field aiming to "make disappear" a military vessel is conducted by the US Navy. This experiment is known as "[The Philadelphia Experiment](Philadel.html)".

- **December**

- At the Oslofjorden (Norway), friends eating see a light appear on the port. Fearing sabotage, they take their cars (3) and drive towards the phenomenon. At a certain distance the cars stop by themselves, and cannot start again. They leave their cars and run towards the light, which looks like a church bell, with a strange diffuse orange color. When they approach it, they hear a whistling, like air escaping from a compressor. A moment later the object rises 9 to 18 feet above the water, and takes off at an enormous speed, without any sign of acceleration. The object eventually turns a deep blue color before disappearing above the Oslofjorden. At the moment of its disappearance, the 4 witnesses start searching the area and discover a crater-shaped depression in the snow, about 4.5 feet in diameter and about 3 feet deep. Around it the snow has melted, on a diameter of 54 feet. [Australian Flying Saucer Review, 7/1968] [Phillips: Physical traces associated with UFO sightings, 1975, 5] [Rapportnytt, 4/1979, 4-5.

-   **December 18:** An object is successively reported by the Helgoland, Hamburg, Wittenberg, Neustrelitz bases. The timing between these bases gives it an average speed of over 3000 km/h. It is observed above Hamburg by a patrol of 2 Focke-Wulf 190 fighters, at 12000 m, around 11:15. The object is a cylindrical body, with a nose cone at the front, a large hole at the back with a panel; it seemed to be composed of a large number of rings, whose surface seemed convex. Reported on the ground, followed for a few km, it disappears at great speed [\[Report sent to the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe, Durrant 1973\]]{.source}.


- A well-armed Japanese division disappears without a trace in New Guinea. The world is left wondering, investigations are conducted, the Japanese government attempts to shed light on this mystery, to no avail.


- Bright balls of light regularly appear to Allied planes in flight. Moving around the aircrafts, sometimes in formation, undetectable on the onboard radar, they become so familiar to the military that they nickname them [foo-fighters](glossair.html#foofighter). The English set up a small organization to document these objects, led by Lieutenant-General Massey and inspired by the reports of a spy who, in fact, is a double agent working under the orders of the mayor of Cologne. He confirms that the foo-fighters are not German devices, but that the Germans think they are Allied firing instruments and the English know that this is not the case. The project will be classified in 1944 [\[Edwards, pp. 70 and 71\]]{.source}.


- 3 years before its first use in 1945, the father of the H-Bomb [Edward Teller](TellerEdward.html) astounded his colleagues by suggesting that the colossal temperatures of the explosion could ignite an air combustion that would set the Earth's atmosphere ablaze [\[Jean-Marc Fleury, Quebec Sciences 03/2000\]]{.source}.
