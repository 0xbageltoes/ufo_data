- **May**


-   **May 3rd, just before sunrise:** Near Canberra (Australia), various people on the ground see a large, bright white object flying northeast in the dark sky. The object appears to waver as if losing power or partially losing control. Distant observers then see a smaller object, visible with a faint red light, hovering nearby. The large white object moves towards the small one and appears to collide with it. Then the large object turns, stops wavering, and moves out of sight. According to the report of the astonished observers, the incident could be either an attack of the large object on the small one or a refueling or recharging operation. The observers' report will be examined by Dr. Paul Siple, scientific attaché of the US Embassy in Canberra, and two engineers from [NASA](NASA.html). They will conclude, first of all, that the observers indeed saw what they described. They will also conclude that the mysterious objects were not known or made on Earth devices. The embassy transmitted all this to Washington, D.C., in Airgram A-894, a copy of which is archived by NICAP [\[Keyhoe 1967\]]{.source}.

-   **December 21:** Horace Burns drives between Staunton and Waynesboro on US 250 (Washington DC). His car stalls when an immense cone-shaped UFO begins to hover above the road before landing in a nearby field. The UFO is topped with a dome and emits a blue light. After a few minutes, it takes off and disappears from Burns' view. Tests conducted by Professor Ernest Gehman and engineers from the Bridge Company reveal a high level of radiation at the spot where the UFO landed. The [USAF](USAF.html) investigation, conducted after 3 weeks of rain, snow and unwelcome visits to the field by curious onlookers, reveals no similar traces, and concludes that the appearance was a mirage. But, less than a month later, two motorists driving in the opposite direction along US 60, near Williamsburg (Virginia), report having observed an identical UFO.


-   **Late December:** 3 UFOs are tracked by a local radar (Washington DC): they move at a speed that seems to be 7700 km/h. The [USAF](USAF.html) declares that these abnormal spots were not caused by UFOs but by faulty equipment.
