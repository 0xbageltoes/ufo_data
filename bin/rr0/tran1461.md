-   **November 1st:** Gregory of Tours. On the night of All Saints 1461, something burning like a bar of iron, long and thick as half the [Moon](Moon.html), was seen for a short quarter of an hour. It was clearly visible and suddenly this strange thing twisted and turned like a watch spring and went back up to the sky.

President Wilson, member of the French Astronomy Society, BSAF, 1954\]]{.source}
