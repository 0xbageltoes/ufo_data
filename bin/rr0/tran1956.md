- Sergeant O. D. Hill, who worked for the [Blue Book](BlueBook.html) project at [Wright-Patterson](WrightPatterson.html) base, told Tom Comella and ufologist Edgar Smith that USAF ([USAF.html](USAF.html)) planes were disappearing from time to time after encounters with UFOs. To back up his claims, he gave two examples, intentionally omitting names, places and dates. One of them seems to be, with one or two details changed, the Kinross case (November 23, 1953). For the second one, Edgar Smith's notes indicate: A transport plane with 26 people on board was quickly approaching its base. It was about 16 km from the coast. On the ground, in the radar station, the operator was carefully following the transport plane and maintaining constant radar contact with it. Suddenly, the operator discovered a second trace on his screen. He immediately contacted the transport plane by radio and warned the pilot to be careful of the unidentified object. The UFO was moving at a very high speed, about 4000 km/h. It was jumping on the screen like a tennis ball. Suddenly, the mysterious "blip" flew straight to the transport plane's one and, before the operator had time to warn the pilot, the two objects became one on the screen. The remaining trace then disappeared into the sky at a dizzying speed. The search revealed no trace of oil on the surface of the water. Nothing but a general's briefcase floating. The plane had disappeared without a trace [["Have UFOs "swallowed" Our Aircraft", Fate, May 1961]]{.source}. American researcher Jerome Clark has noted that no one, neither Sergeant Hill nor the USAF, had denied Tom Comella's allegations. Moreover, *Fate* is a well-known magazine in the Anglo-Saxon world and the article had specifically named certain people.

-   **July 22-23:** In the night, a C-131 twin-engine aircraft was struck by some sort of fast and heavy object, as its pilot, Commander Stenvers, would later declare.

According to the investigators, this veteran, with thousands of flights under his belt, was wrong: the tailplane rivets popped out on their own\... In other words, the rivets made a depression, broke all ties with the Convair to go their own way, no doubt\...

They quickly found the object and, having it clearly in sight, described it as follows: it was a shiny disc that reflected the sunlight and that awaited them, motionless, as they headed straight for it. When the two planes were only a few km away, the object turned on its side and moved away at an incredible speed. A few moments later, the craft had disappeared.

Thinking it was an American aircraft, the Tupolev hid in the clouds. When it emerged 40 minutes later, the unknown aircraft was still to its left. After 15 minutes of parallel flight, the craft rose and disappeared at an incredible speed.

The organizer of this experiment, a New York firm, the *Subliminal Projection Co. Inc.*, announced that it was patenting its process and would soon be ready to offer it to companies wishing to advertise in the cinema or on television in the most subtle ways ever used to extol the virtues of a product [\[Newsweek\]]{.source}.

- Valentin Akkusatov, pilot and chief navigator at the North Pole base, is doing a reconnaissance above a strategic ice region near Greenland. As they emerge from the clouds into a clear area, they see to their left an unknown object flying parallel to them. It has the appearance of a large pear or lens-shaped construction, with pulsating ends. Thinking they were seeing an unknown US aircraft, they return to the clouds to avoid an encounter. After 40 minutes of flight the clouds break again and they see the same strange object again. It has no wings, antennas or windows, and emits no smoke. They decide to approach to get a closer look, but the object then changes its course to maintain its distance from their aircraft. After 15 minutes the object shoots up and disappears, travelling at an "impossible" speed. [[Psychic Discoveries behind the Iron Curtain]]{.source}
