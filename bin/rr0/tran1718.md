-   **March 19:** English botanist Sir Hans Sloane believes he sees a
    shooting star. I suddenly saw a great light in the sky towards the
    West. It shone with a much greater brightness than the
    [Moon](Lune.html). He quickly realized his mistake, the object
    progressing much too slowly and in a straight line. The object had
    a singular shape: A kind of long luminous thread was attached in
    the middle of this [meteor](Meteore.html) which resembled a pear
    tapered upwards. The lower part was spherical, but smaller than
    the full moon. It was white and blue in color, and its brilliance
    as dazzling as that of the sun in full daylight (\...). It moved
    for about thirty seconds and disappeared about 20° above the
    horizon; behind it, it left a kind of faintly orange trail, a bit
    like a glowing coal. It seemed to sparkle, but it did not fall. I
    heard it was also observed in Oxford and Worcester?
