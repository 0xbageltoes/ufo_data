-   **Thursday, September 17, 9 pm to 10 pm:** In Alta (Norway) a strange and unexplained light phenomenon is observed by many people in many neighborhoods. The sky is completely covered and it is total darkness when a light point like a big star appears in the East above Elvebakken, going above Bosekop, disappearing behind Skoddevarre, coming back to Kvænvik and after various other movements disappears towards Talvik. The light is generally white but shifts partly to red and blue. It is also observed with a telescope from the small steamboat *Sina*. It is thought to come from an airplane. A man would have heard a fast sound in the air, but without seeing anything however. The light moves at different altitudes and generally without great particular speed, except when it disappears [\[MORGENBLADET, 24 Sep 1914, 2\] \[Bullard: *The airship file* - Supplement I., 1983, 37\]]{.source}.
