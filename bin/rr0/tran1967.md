-   **January 6th, 11 PM:** The luminous spheres observed on June 15th 1966 return after 6 months to the same farm in Aveyron. The farmer, who had gone out to take care of the animals, suddenly sees a sphere 50 m away from him. He decides to go behind the thing to see what it was, having already assumed that there was one in front and one behind; but when he passes the door, the sphere is just there waiting for him, while it was still in the courtyard a moment earlier. The man then decides to take a small path through the fields to go around the object but the sphere follows him for 60 m before blocking the entrance of the path: This thing followed me for about 60 m, quite close to me... so there was a small path where I wanted to pass... to go around it from behind, then it followed me all the way... until I stopped there where I wanted to go around it, and the "machine" stops too, just at the entrance of the path. So I said, there, there's no arguing, I can't pass! The farmer then calls his son and both of them see 6 spheres that scare them so much that they immediately go back into the house. The large oblong object is also there and it emits a beam similar to that of a lighthouse: There was a lighthouse above, just at the end, to the right, and it was lighting up this window up there, it was lighting up the whole room... I had the window open in front. - Was it a diffuse beam, or rather concentrated? - Oh, concentrated, very concentrated. - And it was lighting up your room? - Yes, it was lighting up it... going and coming... it was turning... it was always turning. - Was it turning in a circle, like a lighthouse? - Yes, sometimes it was lighting up the window below... it kept turning in a circle... but it was there, at 11 PM already, maybe 11:15 or something like that. And then, all of a sudden, everything went out. Everything went out and I didn't see anything anymore. I don't know if it had left or if it was still there.


-   **January 10:** At [Groom Lake](Area51.html), it is decided to gradually replace the activity of the A-12 program in favor of the SR-71. The replacement must be completely finished by January 1968 [\[Peebles 1995\]]{.source}.


"-   **January 11**"


- In the car, the farmer's son sees the shell descend near the house. He approaches it in the car and notices that it is really very big. 2 of the small spheres enter it, then it becomes very bright. The witness hears a whistling. The shell inclines at 45° and leaves at a vertiginous speed. Another object arrives. It has the shape of a disc with 2 transparent domes at the top: Inside... it seemed to me that it was lit up like a green light... in the two domes... and I saw... note that I'm not sure... it was very dark, one could say that there was a kind of fog, inside or outside... I don't know... inside or outside of the 2 domes. In any case, I thought I saw 2... well, I saw 2 people like... human beings, you see?... astronauts. They were wearing green aviator suits with white stripes. The object itself oscillates back and forth: - Were the car doors closed during this time? - Yes, yes... I had to open the window, I think... Or maybe it was after, when it left, that I opened the window... and then I felt a wave of heat and I felt almost... I couldn't move my hands or feet as long as it lasted.

-   **March 8, 1:05 AM**: In Leominster (Massachusetts), two witnesses observe a UFO for 4 minutes from their broken-down car. One of the witnesses feels an electric shock and then is paralyzed, his arm is violently thrown back. The object then suddenly climbs and moves away, and everything returns to normal. Excerpt from the investigation report: Having made a U-turn, he lowered the windows and, leaving the road, he drove along the cemetery, towards the light that was just above... He got out of the car, closed the door (the window remaining open) and raised his arm to point to the object. Several events then occurred simultaneously: all the lights, the radio and the engine stopped working; he felt an electric shock, felt numb and unable to move, the arm he had raised fell back violently against the roof of the car, with such force that it was imprinted in the glass that covered it... Mr. W. could not move a muscle, yet he could perfectly hear and his brain seemed to function normally. Then the radio and the car lights came back on while the object, which had not stopped swaying, suddenly climbed emitting a kind of buzzing and was lost above the fog blanket [\[Poher 2003\]]{.source}.

-   Other intercontinental missile bases, located near the Canadian border, Great Falls (Montana), are visited by luminous objects that descend to very low altitude above the installations. At these two last strategic sites, several tens of missiles are taken out of service.

- The men of Detachment A of the 6947th Security Squadron (charged with monitoring Cuban Air Force communications) based at Key West Naval Air Station in Boca Chica Key, about 150 km from Cuba, suddenly heard Cuban radar controllers report the approach, at 10,000 m altitude and Mach 1 (a little over 1050 km/h) of an unidentified aircraft from the northeast. Immediately, 2 MIG-21 fighters were sent to intercept the intruder. The 2 pilots soon discovered a shiny metal sphere devoid of any identification marks. After exhausting radio contact attempts, the Cuban Air Defense Headquarters ordered the mission leader to destroy the UFO. He then confirmed that the target was being tracked by his firing radar and that he had armed his missiles. These were his last words. A few seconds later, the other pilot began to scream into his microphone that the MIG-21 had exploded, or rather, he specified a moment later, had suddenly disintegrated without fire or smoke. The Americans of Boca Chica Key then heard the Cuban radar controllers announce that, following an incredible acceleration, the UFO had suddenly risen to nearly 30,000 m and had disappeared in the direction of South America. The [NSA](NSA.html) under the operational control of which the Air Force Security Service units are located then demanded that all documents related to the accident be sent to it within the hour and that it be immediately recorded in the surveillance unit's archives as due to a mechanical malfunction. The case remained secret until 1978, when one of the witnesses of Boca Chica Key --- whose anonymity is protected --- revealed it to [Stanton Friedman](FriedmanStanton.html).


- A Red Cross car travelling through towns to collect blood from volunteer donors passes on Highway 2, near the Ohio River (USA). Suddenly, a kind of star quickly descends towards it and places itself just above the vehicle. It lowers two long tentacles, in the shape of arms, on each side of the car, even though the driver accelerates. The arms seem to want to grab the car. The machine finally retracts its arms, probably due to cars coming in the opposite direction. It then disappears into the sky at a prodigious speed.

- In New Mexico, a witness observed this amazing thing: A small silver white disc of unknown diameter, at an unknown altitude, but with a definite material existence; while we watched, it first appeared stationary for about 10 minutes. Then it crossed the sky, seemed to pass under the clouds and finally disappeared into the white clouds. No sound was detected. [Les OVNI, mythe ou réalité ? op. cit. p.82]{.source}.


- 5 people saw a UFO in the sky of Ohio:
    The object was oval-shaped and was heading straight from the Southeast to the Northwest. The UFO, or whatever it was, passed over the road we were driving on. The sun, very bright, was reflecting off the object which was metal, but not aluminum-colored like airplanes - I would say it was more the color of yellow or red copper. What was propelling the object, we don't know, but we didn't hear any sound [\[Les OVNI, mythe ou réalité ? p. 92\]]{.source}.

-   **April 4**: CADILLAC (AP) - Police reported a rush of sightings of unidentified flying objects in a three-county area in northwest Michigan Friday night. A Cadillac police officer and others reported the sightings to Traverse City in Grand Traverse County, Reed City in Osceola County and Cadillac in Wexford County. Cadillac is roughly halfway between Traverse City and Reed City, a distance of about 100 miles. The reports came three days after similar reports in Grand Haven on Lake Michigan and hours after a Northwestern University investigator left Michigan after examining the Grand Haven reports. "I saw something, but I don't know what it was," said Cadillac patrolman Harry Hagstrom. Hagstrom said the object was bright white and appeared in a clear sky over Lake Cadillac. He said two other police officers verified the sighting. "It seemed to change directions," Hagstrom said. "Up, down, left, right and then it stayed stationary for a moment. It was bright white the first time I saw it, but the color faded to a duller white, then red, then green. It was a very clear night and all the stars were bright," he added, "But I'm sure it wasn't a star. Other than that, I don't know what it was." [William T. Powers](PowerWilliamT.html), a member of Dr. [J. Allen Hynek](HynekJosefAllen.html)'s team at Northwestern University, Evanston (Illinois), was in Grand Haven most of Friday investigating the Grand Haven sightings. Dr. [Hynek](HynekJosefAllen.html) was commissioned by the Air Force to conduct an independent investigation of such sightings [\[Ray Varner < Michigan UFOs\]]{.source}.

-   **April 17th, at night**: In Jefferson City (Missouri), a school principal was driving on a deserted road when he noticed a huge object: I was on my way home after an Association of Parents and Teachers meeting; it was night and I was driving through the countryside (...). Suddenly I noticed a light above the hill --- and I thought, hey, that's one of those old planes (a C-47) that has gone off course and is going to land in that cornfield (...). And then this incredible object - which had a bit of the shape of a WWI helmet --- went over the hill... So I slowed down... I couldn't understand how an airplane could follow a gliding trajectory --- when this huge object, which I estimate was over 90 m, detached itself from the hill and stayed above me for a fraction of a second like an aircraft changing course; then it headed towards the airport... It was a terribly strong light. The roof of the car didn't even seem to be a shield. It's incredible, a light so intense. When I looked at my hands, it was like an X-ray photo. Several teachers will witness the event. [[Reported case to Blue Book] [Hendry 1979, p. 10]]{.source}

-   **April 21, 9 PM:** In South Hill (Virginia), Mr. Crowder is driving home when he sees an object on the road 70 meters away: a 5 meter diameter vertical cylinder, supported by 4 legs, with a half-sphere at its top. The object is gray and its base is 1 meter above the pavement. When the witness turns on his headlights, the device emits a vertical light and disappears. The road burns for 15 minutes. Mr. Martin, who lives nearby, also sees the light.
