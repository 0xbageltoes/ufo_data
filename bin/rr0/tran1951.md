-   **January 16:** In Artesia, New Mexico, two members of a General Mills balloon project observe their 110-foot balloon at an altitude of 112,000 feet when they spot a round, dull white object. It appears larger than the balloon, but does not move. Later, the balloon team, the Aeronautical Research Laboratory, the director of the Artesia airport, and three pilots see two objects from the airport.

-   **9:58 PM:** In Albuquerque, New Mexico, Hugh Young, a guard from the secret Sandia base, and another witness accompanied by his wife see a huge V-shaped formation of lights silently pass overhead, heading south. It appears to be a large winged craft with these lights. Its size is estimated to be 1.5 times the wingspan of a B-36 bomber or 350 feet. 8 blue-white lights shine along the trailing edge of the wing of the formation. The estimated speed is 650 km/h (300 to 400 mph) and the altitude 240 to 300 m (800 to 1000 feet). Dark stripes are visible from below, and 6 to 8 pairs of pulsating lights on the side band of the craft. The observation lasts about 30 s.


-   **21:20:** 4 Professors from Texas Technical College see a semi-circular formation of 20 to 30 lights moving quickly above Lubbock (Texas).

-   They see two other formations flying in the same direction and at the same speed. The lights are a yellowish white, and they shine dimly.


-   The nearby USAF radar station notices an unknown flying at 1450 km/h and roughly 3900 m altitude at the same time. The spots remain on the screens for 6 minutes, and an F-86 Sabre quickly takes off, but fails to intercept the UFO.
 - Dozens of witnesses see groups of lights passing quickly above them, forming a structure resembling a boomerang or a flying wing. The first observation, confirmed by a radar station, takes place in the suburbs of [Albuquerque](lieux.html#Albuquerque), followed by [Lubbock](1951-08-25_Lubbock.html) (Texas). A group of professors, including Dr. W. I. Robinson, a geologist, observe that the phenomenon appears in the north at an angular elevation of about 45° above the horizon and disappears in the direction of the south [\[unexplained Blue Book case n° 955\]]{.source}

-   **August 26:** Above the city of Washington, 2 radar stations simultaneously detect an unidentified echo whose speed is 1300 km/h. No terrestrial aircraft is capable of such a speed (the interceptors in service in the United States are unable to exceed 800 km/h).

- **September 10**


-   **11:10:** At [Fort Monmouth](FortMonmouth.html) (New Jersey), during a demonstration of anti-aircraft guns pointed automatically by radar, an unidentified echo appears at low altitude. It flies at about 11000 m to the South of the station, heading North along the coast. The craft is moving too fast to be tracked automatically, so the *Army Signal Corps* operator switches to manual control. The operator estimates its speed at over 1100 km/h --- 700 miles/h, an incredible performance for the time, even for the best army jets. The group follows the craft for about 3 minutes, until it disappears from the screen to the North-East at about 13000 m altitude.

-   **11:35:** A USAF T-33 piloted by Lieutenant Wilbert S. Rogers and navigator Major Edward Ballard over Point Pleasant (New Jersey) saw far below them a silver-colored object - described by Rogers as round and flat and with a diameter between 9 and 15 m (30 to 50 feet), traveling at 1400 km/h. From its altitude of 6000 m (20000 feet), it began a rotating descent towards the UFO but was unable to catch up. They saw it descend towards Sandy Hook (climb and travel about 30 km?), before banking to the left at 90° (at 120°?) and disappearing towards the sea. Ground radar picked it up and estimated its speed at 1000 km/h.

-   **3:15 PM:** At [Fort Monmouth](FortMonmouth.html) (New Jersey),
    radar detected an object at an altitude of 18 miles moving slowly.
    Ground observers quickly confirmed the sighting although they could
    only observe a small silver dot. This sighting was later identified
    as a balloon.

- **September 11**


-   **10:50:** The radar at [Fort Monmouth](FortMonmouth.html) (New Jersey) detected a new unidentified echo at very high speed. No visual confirmation, as the sky was too cloudy.


-   **13:30:** The radar at [Fort Monmouth](FortMonmouth.html) (New Jersey) detected a second unidentified echo at very high speed. No visual confirmation, as the sky was too cloudy.

-   Two other similar cases occur (5 since the beginning of the trial period); one of the detected echoes moves at a constant altitude of 28300 m. Among the witnesses is a group of senior officers responsible for evaluating this cutting-edge material.

-   **September 12:** The project [Grudge](Grudge.html), dormant since December 1949, is reactivated under the name of project [Blue Book](BlueBook.html), under the direction of Captain [Ruppelt](RuppeltEdwardJ.html).

-   **September 13 (14?) 21:30:** At the [USAF](USAF.html) base in Goose Bay (Labrador), Sgt. W. B. Maupin and Cpl. J. W. Green observe 3 objects on the radar. 2 are on a collision course, and one moves to the right at the radio request of one of the radar operators. No known aircraft are in the area. A third unidentified object then joins the first two. The observation lasts more than 15 minutes [\[case [Blue Book](BlueBook.html) #969 unexplained\]]{.source}.

 - Two powerful tugboats are towing the *São Paulo*, the most beautiful unit of the Brazilian fleet, disarmed, to a demolition yard (discarded in 1945 after having only served in peacetime and bought by an entrepreneur for the scrap metal it represents). A storm forces one of the two tugboats to leave the convoy.

-   **October 4th:** After the storm passed, the *São Paulo* disappeared from the [Azores](lieux.html#Acores). The mooring that held it to the other tugboat had broken in the meantime. A large search operation was then set in motion. As the battleship had no radio, the 8 sailors on board could not give their position. In the morning, a cargo ship spotted some light signals that could be distress rockets. Another ship confirmed this observation. The search continued with more intensity, and airplanes reported black shapes in 2 or 3 different places, 35 to 40 km apart. A tugboat also observed a kind of black mass lying on the waves, but it disappeared afterwards. The investigation showed that the battleship had been properly ballasted and it was impossible for it to capsize before the search continued in the afternoon of the 4th.

Shortly after, a second object arrived, which was confirmed by the ground observers using a theodolite, who saw it fly through the sky.
