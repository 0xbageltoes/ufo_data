-   **January 10:** A Polaris missile is launched from Cape Canaveral. The missile is on its route when an unidentified object is detected in the area: the object is large enough and maneuvers so close to the Polaris that the ground automatic radar detection, programmed to follow the missile, mistakenly locks onto the other object, which eventually leaves the radar detection range. It takes 14 minutes to lock back onto the Polaris [\[Keyhoe 1967\]]{.source}.

-   **Spring, late evening**: In Millville (New Jersey), two flirting witnesses in a car parked in a discreet location observe a nocturnal light: What caught my attention was the way the light moved\... it shone without emitting any sound. It was much brighter than any star in the sky\... As it moved slowly towards the North, I first thought it was a weather balloon reflecting the light of the Sun. Only balloons don't stop, don't change direction, don't do reverse\... Both of us watched the thing's gambols\... Finally, after 5 good minutes, from where it was, far to the South, it went straight to the North, it disappeared in about 5 seconds. I know, I timed it. The observation lasted in total 7 minutes [\[[Poher](PoherClaude.html) 2003\]]{.source}.

- The crew of the motorized fishing vessel *Santa Ameria* observed a bright red spherical body moving in a south-southeast to north-northwest trajectory. The object was seen descending, displaying purple/orange rings and emitting small rainbows. As it descended, the object seemed to become larger. The front of the object touched the surface of the water for a moment. A few minutes after the first observation, a second lenticular-shaped object followed the trajectory of the first. During the descent of the objects, a red wake was observed. [Possible meteor](Meteore.html). [[Inquiry of E. Morricone of 18/07/1979; AAVV *Ufo in Italia*, vol. 3, ed.

-   **April 18th, 11am:** Joe Simonton, a farmer from Wisconsin, hears a noise outside his house and notices a curious chrome-colored craft hovering close to the ground. As he approaches, he sees through an opening 3 figures with tanned skin and black hair. One is busy with the controls of a dashboard, while the other seems to be cooking something on a flame-less stove. Having spotted Simonton, one of the creatures hands him a kind of bucket, gesturing that it wants water. The farmer complies. As a thank you, and since Simonton shows interest in what is being cooked, the pilot of the craft gives him 4 cakes. Finally, the hatch closes and the craft flies south, causing a gust of wind that bends the trees. The observation lasted 5 minutes, no more. Simonton eats one of the cakes and finds it tastes like cardboard. The [USAF](USAF.html) has one of the cakes analyzed --- as part of the official UFO study program --- and the report concludes that the ingredients do not come from another planet, and that the farmer must have been daydreaming.

-   **April 28th, 8am:** In Karelia (USSR), a forest guard, Vassili Brodski, noticed an enormous pit (27m long, 15m wide and 3m deep) leading to the frozen lake of Korb, on the south cliff side, as if it had been breached, and which had not been there the night before at 9pm. The loggers of the region had seen nothing, heard nothing. A striking object seemed to have dug the cliff, the ice and the bottom of the lake, creating a 1000m^3^ pit swallowing the frozen ground, pushing the ice into the bottom and advancing 20m on the bottom pushing a 1.5m ridge of muddy earth and then coming out in reverse. The object was not seen but left fragments of many metals. The broken ice pieces were of an emerald green whose nature and origin no analysis could explain. Strange black grains collected on the shore revealed a metallic chemical composition so complex that it could only be obtained by operations at very high temperatures; they resisted the action of acids. It was concluded that these grains had a non-organic and probably non-natural origin. Since then, the vegetation inside the pit is inexplicably lush but, in spite of so many enigmas, the research was not pursued, because the phenomenon is not dangerous to man.

The tank still contains enough fuel for 2 hours of flight and the engine works perfectly. No trace of the 4 occupants is found. At a distance of about 100 m, a large, clearly defined circle is discovered, inside of which the grass is scorched and the ground is sunken.

- High-ranking military personnel at the [Pentagon](Pentagone.html) decide to place a crown of copper needles in orbit around the Earth. These millions of tiny needles were to reflect radio signals back to Earth and facilitate military communications, thus shielded from any interference. But such an accomplishment seriously compromised radio astronomy for several centuries. The presence of these millions of needles could therefore have disastrous consequences denounced by many scientists around the world and yet the project received government approval.

-   **October 21:** The Americans place a spy satellite, *Midas 4*, carrying 350 million copper needles, in a polar orbit 3500 km from [Earth](Earth.html). Immediately after separation from the rocket, the cloud of small copper needles disperses and begins to form an artificial ring, which will have astonishing repercussions, as in February [1950](1950.html): normal radio emissions are disturbed or mysteriously disappear. Then the incredible happens. On the radar screens, an enormous unknown object bursts in and, according to McCarty himself: Like a gigantic vacuum cleaner, it cleaned these skies in a few minutes of these needles. Despite this overwhelming event, a second shipment of needles will take place and the same phenomenon will occur. Millions of small needles are absorbed by an unknown phenomenon.
