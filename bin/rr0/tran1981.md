-   **2 h:** Chico Gama, a farm worker, is on a small beach on the Atlantic coast, not far from Fortaleza. Having come with his fishing net in the hope of improving his daily fare, he was taking advantage of the moonlight. Suddenly, a beam of red light falling from the sky hits him and makes him shiver. Looking up, he discovers that it comes from a round and violet object floating in the air. Terrified, Chico Gama runs to hide in the nearest thicket. The object follows him, touching him intermittently with its red beam. This game of cat and mouse lasts 3 hours. Unable to escape the red beam and the buzzing emitted by his pursuer, Chico Gama spends a night of terror, convinced that, tired of playing, the object will eventually kill him with its beam. 5 AM: At dawn, the object suddenly stops its pursuit and evaporates into the sky, leaving the man exhausted and close to fainting. He nevertheless manages to get home and hides for hours under his bed before telling his family what happened to him. Two days later, he falls ill. The skin on his arms and back peels off like after a sunburn, he suffers from migraines and sweats continuously for a good month. Bop Pratt, who would meet Chico Gama in 1986, five years later, will tell of having seen a nervous and fearful man, who still sometimes hides under his bed. His daughters will tell him that he no longer goes out at night and that sometimes he is afraid to stay alone in broad daylight.
