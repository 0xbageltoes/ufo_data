- Second wave of UFO (*ghost rockets*) sightings in Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Finland).


-   **October 2, 4:18 PM:** In the Basque province of Guipuzcoa, about
    120 km from San Sebastian, Valentine Williams, an English novelist
    and former soldier, and two other people, after leaving General
    Franco's HQ in Burgos to go to Biarritz, jumped in surprise at
    seeing what they thought was a flare or tracer projectile,
    describing an angle trajectory from the road and heading north at
    great speed. Williams described it as a white smoke banner\... Then
    it burst into orange flames. There was no sound or explosion. Upon
    arriving in Biarritz, they told their story. Tom Dupree, from the
    British Consulate in Hendaye, claims to have been in San Sebastian
    (about 48 km west of Biarritz) at the same time and to have seen
    the same object.


- **(or 1937):** At Gjersjøen (Norway), an object landed on the road, blocking two cars coming from opposite directions. Neither of the drivers (one of 37 years old) made any attempt to contact the other, after the object, which was 20 m away, rose and disappeared [\[Letter from Eldbjørg Fjeldberg, November 16th, 1976]{.source}\].
