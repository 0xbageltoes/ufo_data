-   **Spring:** Another jet is sent to intercept a stationary object
    detected on radar off the northeast coast of Japan. The pilot sees
    the object and is authorized to fire. The missiles have no effect
    on the unknown object which begins to pursue the plane as the radar
    follows the scene. The two signals overlap, the single object that
    results remains stationary for a moment then disappears. The
    searches conducted for several days fail: no trace of the jet is
    found. Even if it is advanced that the plane disappeared over the
    water, it remains that the radars never detected any fall after the
    "meeting" of the "blips", that a localized crash with precision at
    sea leaves traces on the surface and that one of the aircrafts
    left by its own means, which excludes for it the devastating effects
    of a collision [\[Maccabee\]]{.source}.
