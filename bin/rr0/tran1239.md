-   **July 24:** As the Sun set, a great star appeared over Hereford and Worcester (towns in the west of England, close to the Welsh border), rising in the south and giving off a great light. It had the shape of a large head, the front part was sparkling and the back part was emitting smoke and flashes. And, it turned towards the north\... not quickly, nor fast indeed, but precisely as if it wanted to ascend to a place in the sky.
