-   **January 14:** Following a FOIA pursuit by the [GSW](GSW.html), the *New York Times* reported the event, indicating that the US government, through the [CIA](CIA.html), has been investigating the presence of UFOs since [1949](1949.html), and questioning director [William Spaulding](SpauldingWilliamH.html), director of the [GSW](GSW.html). He declared: UFOs exist. They are real. The government has completely lied and the cover-up is massive.

- A law on meeting with extraterrestrials is added to American laws. It forbids anyone from having any contact with UFOs or extraterrestrials, under penalty of a $5000 fine and a one-year prison sentence. An employee of the [NASA](NASA.html) is entitled to decide, after hearing the witness or not, if he has truly been exposed to an extraterrestrial entity or not, and to place him under quarantine for any period of time. Such a decision cannot be subject to any appeal, even by a competent court, so that this law is in total disagreement with the American Constitution. This law also equates to a criminal any person having close contact with extraterrestrials. This law is described in Section 1211, Title 14 of the Federal Regulations Code.


- In the United States, a young college student observes two objects with a pulsing violet projector emitting a diffuse light. Later, the young man, troubled, consults a doctor. The doctor notes the presence of a strange red diamond-shaped mark on his chest. This mark will take months to disappear.


- In the [Rendlesham](Bentwaters.html) forest (UK), the attention of 3 people was drawn to unusual lights near an American military base. Many other witnesses swear they saw a spacecraft above the area. The investigation, which is not made any easier by contradictory testimonies, is stopped by the application of the law protecting state secrets in Great Britain. An American senator then takes a close interest in the case but suddenly interrupts his research. He has since always refused to communicate the content of his discoveries to ufologists.

- The Cosmic Studies Institute and the Academy of Sciences of the USSR publish a [statistical](Statistiques.html) analysis of 256 observations of anomalous atmospheric phenomena, of which 13 were in flight and 1 at sea. Of these observations, 12 were made at less than 100 m distance, 1 with a telescope, 2 with radar, one of which coupled with optical observation, all accompanied by 50 drawings and 3 photographs. In 64% of the cases, several witnesses were present and 15% were mass observations. Finally, 11% of these were made by observation stations and 5% by military personnel on operations. All categories of witnesses are represented, including 33% scientists. Among these are 10 astronomers, 6 meteorologists, 6 geophysicists but also 23 engineers and 14 aviators. In this survey, astronomers (7.5%) see 7500 times more UFOs than the general population. Of the 256 cases, 194 were observed in 1967. All the classic shapes were seen, however with a predominance of crescent shapes. In 94 cases there were more than one object, and in the majority they were silent. In 101 cases the luminosity was intense, even blinding in 9 cases. The most frequently observed color is orange. The estimated speed ranges from 18 to 187000 km/h, at an altitude ranging from 35 m to 100 km [[Guindilis, Menkov, Pétroskaïa, Observations of anomalous atmospheric phenomena in the USSR]{.source} [[GEPAN](GEPAN.html), Information Note No. 1, 50, 2:1980]{.source}.

-   **March 5:** The *Voyager 1* probe flies over
    [Jupiter](Jupiter.html) and discovers the rings of the giant planet.


-   **Early March:** [Eric Gairy](GairyEric.html) returns to the United Nations for a new round of debate on UFOs. A few days later, he is deposed in favor of Maurice Bishop. The coup d'état he suffers will put a stop to the debate on UFOs at the [UN](ONU.html), at least for many years.

- **May**

-   [Victor Marchetti](MarchettiVictor.html) writes an article in the American quarterly *Second Look,* where he states that UFOs were not a common topic of conversation at the time he was a member of the [CIA](CIA.html). Everyone knew that this kind of information was considered extremely sensitive. At the highest levels of the hierarchy, he had sometimes heard discreet allusions regarding the recovery of crashed disks and bodies of small men.


-  **Wednesday 9th May, 8:30am** : Marie Paule P. (10 years old, 4th grade) Descended to 1m from the ground. It was about to land then immediately rose again. It disappeared into the clouds.

    Northwest of [Groom Lake](Area51.html), due to an engine fire [\[Rich 1994\]]{.source}.


-   **September 1st:** *Pioneer 11* is the first probe to flyby Saturn.


- **September 12:** A power generation failure strikes the cities of Xuginglong and Haihua in the province of Hunan, China. A bright flying object, emitting sheets of light rays is observed by many witnesses. It moves away silently leaving behind two luminous clouds and 100 m in diameter.


-   **September 22:** The military satellite *Vela,* specially designed
    to detect atomic explosions, detects a large intensity flash in
    [South Africa](ZA.html). The characteristics of a nuclear bomb
    (gamma rays, neutron flux, radioactive cloud) are not present. A
    document from the [NSA](NSA.html) reveals that thousands of
    analogous untimely detections (*zoo events*) have occurred in the
    past.


-   **October 13th, 4am:** In Lanxi (Zhejiang, China), truck driver Wang Jian Min encounters a parked car. Its driver claims to have seen a UFO land on the road in front of him. He is too disturbed to dare approach it. Wang restarts, followed by the car and its driver, and they arrive in front of a dome-shaped UFO, stopped at the top of a hill. Next to the strange craft are two beings wearing silver suits and helmets with a lamp attached. Wang jumps out of his truck, grabs a crowbar and approaches the creatures. As he gets close to them, the UFO and the creatures disappear.

- According to pessimistic theories, an altercation occurs between the extraterrestrials and the government, informed of their violations of the treaties made. Many scientists are held hostage by the extraterrestrials in the [Dulce](ZonesMilitaires.html#Dulce) laboratory. A special armed forces unit ([Delta Force](orgsMilitaires.html#Delta)) is called in order to free the scientific personnel held in the complex. 44 high-level scientists and 66 soldiers were killed and the personnel was not freed. The treaty between the extraterrestrials and the United States is broken.
