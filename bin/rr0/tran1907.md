- In the Malacca Strait, Mr. S. C. Patterson, of the steamer *Delta*, observed for 30 minutes light rays that seemed to rotate around a center, like the rays of a wheel: they seemed to measure 300 m long. Then, in the South China Sea, a rotation of lightning was noticed: It was like a horizontal wheel, spinning quickly above the water and producing a deep feeling of unease among the crew.


-   **Autumn:** At Tviberg (Norway), Theodor Tviberg and two of his
    friends see a round, bright object coming from the North-East
    heading South-East. The speed is higher than any device of 1980.
    The sky is clear with some clouds at 200 m. The Moon is a few
    degrees above the mountains to the East. The object passes between
    the Moon and the mountains [\[UFO, 1/1983, 38\]]{.source}.
