- In the town of Cloera (old Ireland), on a Sunday when the population was attending religious service, a metal anchor with a long rope attached to it fell from the sky and one of its pointed legs got stuck in the wooden arch above the church door. The congregation immediately rushed outside and saw a man jumping from some kind of stationary ship in the sky and descending down the rope to free the anchor. He moved like a submarine diver. People rushed to apprehend him, but the bishop ordered that he be released. The stranger then quickly ascended back to the ship which rose and disappeared, after cutting the rope. The anchor remained in the church as a testimony to this event. [*Speculum Regali*, according to [Frank Edwards](ufologues.html#EdwardsFrank)]{.source}
