-   **September 24:** In Japan, General Yoritsume camps with his army. Suddenly, his sentinels observe a curious phenomenon: mysterious sources of light come and go, swirl to the southwest, describing loops, and this until morning. General Yoritsume orders that a thorough scientific examination be carried out, and his collaborators get to work. It takes them little time to draw up their report: the phenomenon is quite natural. It is only the wind that moves the stars. [\[Yusuke J. Matsumura, from Yokohama\]]{.source} [\[Vallee 1969\]]{.source}
