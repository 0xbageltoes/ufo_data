- **January 18th:** David Spoor films a UFO (pictured) from a window on the first floor of his house. At first, the UFO remains still, then makes a small movement to the left before quickly leaving the frame in less than a second. See images/1998-01-18.jpg anjd images/1998-01-18.jpg.

- **January 20th**: At the Suffolk border, David Spoor and Peter Wrigglesworth filmed powerful blue lights shone on them. See images/1998-01-20.jpg and http://membres.tripod.fr/rr0/images/1998-01-20.jpg.


- **January 27th:** David Spoor filmed this from the flat roof at the back of his house. His camera was mounted on a tripod. The UFO remained stationary before flying over the house at high speed. Due to the limitations imposed by the use of the tripod, Spoor was unable to follow the trajectory of the UFO. It seemed to be flying at low altitude, but it was difficult to assess as its size was unknown. The lights seen at the bottom of the shot are street lamps. The UFO was completely silent and had a shape very  similar to some objects that have been filmed over Mexico since 1992.

-   **January 31:** Above the rooftops of Maipu (Chile), parachutists without parachutes are filmed. A witness driving on the highway sees them heading Northwest into the clouds [\[VSD 2007 H\]]{.source}.

- **February**

- **February 2:** David Spoor films an object with a telephoto camcorder. No other object appears in the shot, so the scale and distance are difficult to assess. The UFO moves very slowly from left to right across the sky. It seems to change shape from time to time, but Spoor admits that this impression may be the effect of sudden changes of trajectory. He hypothesizes that the UFO is part of a larger device, as the lights seem to be mounted on something. For Spoor, these lights do not belong to a conventional aircraft.

- On the occasion of the 1st National Symposium on the subject of UFOs, held in the capital of the province of Coquimbo (Chile), an important group of ufologists sent a letter to the President of the Chilean Republic, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, in which they presented "a request" for the information related to unidentified flying objects to be made public. It was replied to them that the CEFAA had been created with the purpose of studying these phenomena.

-   **Week of April 20th:** The North Yorkshire radar network
    intercepts the echo of an unusual aircraft flying in a
    zigzag course at 27000 km/h above the North Sea. A
    squadron of the Royal Air Force was sent to intercept the object,
    while Dutch air forces also pursue the UFO, but the 2 F-16 fighters
    sent are not able to keep contact with it. The object distances the
    Dutch F-16s by increasing its speed up to 38400 km/h, before
    disappearing towards the North-East towards the Atlantic Ocean
