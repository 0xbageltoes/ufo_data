-   **December 5th, 7am:** A few kilometers from Tübingen (Germany), the locals could see many black clouds around the sun, like those we see when big storms occur; and shortly after, other clouds of fire and blood emerged from the sun, and others yellow like saffron. From these clouds came light effects in the shape of hats, large, high and wide, and the earth itself appeared yellow and bloody and covered with high and wide hats that took different colors such as red, blue, green and, for the most part, black.
