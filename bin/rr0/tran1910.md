-   **1st January:** If the wonderful flying machine is indeed the fruit of Tilinghast's brain... this gentleman is right to want to keep the secret. Compared to his invention, the flying machine of the Wright brothers, hitherto considered the leaders of aeronautics, seems quite rudimentary.... Tilinghast responds by announcing that he will present his machine at the Boston Air Show in February... but in fact it will never be seen.

-   **4th May, in the evening:** Dr. I. Plemely, professor of mathematics at Cirnovti (USSR), sees a bright celestial body approaching from the South with increasing speed. The object rises 40° and after reducing speed it goes towards North-North-West, disappearing in a cloud at an elevation of 20°. The object shone for 3 minutes. Professor van Hepperberg from Vienna calculated the parabolic details based on 3 positions that the observer drew and came to the conclusion that it could have had a diameter of 100m. Victor Anestin, editor-in-chief of the scientific magazine Orion in which the story appears, emphasizes the fact that the object could not have been a bolide (meteor) due to the speed elements, deceleration, change of direction, angle of fall from 45 to 20°, disappearance and ascent, etc. [\[Ion Hobana & Julien Weverbergh archive\]]{.source}.**\
    26th May:** Dr. Prudhomme, a doctor practicing in Nancy (East of [France](FR.html)) sees, like 3 other witnesses, something comparable moving slowly and silently in the sky. He states that some sudden changes in the movement of this light seemed to be due to a rudder.
