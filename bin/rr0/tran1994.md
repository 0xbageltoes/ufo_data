-  **February 19:** The witness, an amateur painter, left his home in Rosyth to go to Craiglusar (near Dunfermline, Scotland) with the intention of taking some photos of the site to help him paint a picture of the place later. Going around retention ponds, the witness heard a strange noise, like a buzzing at the foot of the high-voltage lines, then suddenly felt uncomfortable. Turning around, he observed an aircraft made of a metallic material and estimated its diameter to be 15 m. The witness says he felt, at that moment, immobilized, as if drained of his energy. He could not take any photos of the object at its closest point even though he had his camera in hand. It was only when the object was far away that he took 2 shots showing, for one, a classic saucer shape (right) and, for the other, a tiny point on the horizon. The phenomenon disappeared in a flash.

-   **July 28:** As Flight 129 was completing its approach to Mexico City Airport, the plane was struck by an unidentified object, forcing the pilot to take emergency measures before landing, fortunately without damage. Upon examination of the aircraft on the ground, mechanics and crew noticed that a landing gear shock absorber had been torn off. The pilot, Raymond Cervantes Ruana, went to the control tower to get information about the collision: They told me that at the moment I was making my last turn, 2 UFOs appeared on the control screen. We must have crossed their paths, the pilot will specify. Air traffic controllers will also confirm that no other civil or military aircraft was in the area at the time of landing. The pilot will later declare that he had never felt such a violent impact.

    a similar disaster is narrowly avoided, again at Mexico City airport.
    Flight 304 from Acapulco is in its landing phase when the crew sees
    a large, silver, metallic, circular object emerge from a cloud. The
    captain recounts: We saw the object very clearly. It passed under
    the plane and we had to perform a very delicate maneuver to avoid
    collision. On the ground, the furious pilots demand that the air
    traffic controllers explain why they weren't warned. The latter
    admit to being taken by surprise by the speed of the UFO.
