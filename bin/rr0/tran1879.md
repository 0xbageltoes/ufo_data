-   **May 15, 9:40 PM:** In the Persian Gulf, passengers of the
    vessel *Vultur* observe for 35 minutes two immense wheels spinning
    in the air and slowly descending towards the surface of the water.
    They estimate their diameter to be 40 m, and the distance between
    the two objects to be 150 m. Their speed seems to approach 80 km/h.
