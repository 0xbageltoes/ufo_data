- **January:** Observation in Mahwah (USA). See images/1971-01.jpg. (13 h)

 - A thick layer of clouds hinders the navigation of an F-111 bomber hunter from the [USAF](USAF.html) flying towards Mobile (Alabama). Above Louisiana, east of Grand Isle, the pilot indeed enters a cloud formation. He then asks the Houston (Texas) regional control for permission to gain altitude. After emerging from the clouds, everything looks good. The pilot declares that he will now fly by sight, visibility being perfect. Nothing more will ever be heard of it.

-   **January 31st:** Start of the [Apollo
    14](Apollo.html#Apollo14) mission. Astronauts of the *Antares* module,
    observe a huge object whose windows reflect a very bright light as
    they fly over the Landsberg A and C craters. They report a series
    of images of this experience ([Robert
    Dean](DeanRobertO.html)).

- **May**


-   A mysterious celestial object of planetary size, not fitting
    into any known category, is discovered in the Swan
    Constellation by Japanese and American astronomers. It is

- **July**


- Following the death of [James MacDonald](MacDonaldJamesE.html), [an article](Documents/Articles/AIAA/1971-07_AeronauticsAndAstronautics_fr.html) appears in *Astronautics and Aeronautics,* describing a detailed observation.


-   **July 26:** Launch of the [Apollo 15](Apollo.html#Apollo15) mission.

-   **August 12th, 11:30 PM:** A Finnish couple, Ben and Helen K., are
    driving through a foggy night on the winding road from Gladstone to
    Rockhampton (Queensland, Australia). They are about to run out of
    gas when, passing by a closed gas station, they notice a green light
    among the trees. Ben and Helen suddenly realize they have been
    driving in a straight line for a long time and realize they have
    been repeating the same words. They notice a circle of lights above
    them on the left just before passing a sign indicating Port Alma,
    40 km from Calliope River. The last thing they remember is being at
    a railroad crossing just outside of Rockhampton. They stop at an
    open gas station and inquire: they have traveled about 130 km in 40
    minutes, and have no recollection of that time passing.

- **September**

-   **September 4:** [Aerial Photography in Costa Rica](1971-09-04_CostaRica.html) of a strange flying disk by an aircraft of the Geographical Institute flying at 3200 m altitude above the region of Lake Cote. In [1989](1989.html), American scientist [Richard Haines](HainesRichardF.html) and ufologist [Jacques Vallée](ValleeJacques.html) were able to carry out a series of [in-depth analyses and photometric studies](http://www.jse.com/ufo_reports/Haines_aerial/toc.html) on the original black and white negative to determine the nature of the UFO photographed.


-   In Cambodia, several special forces groups
    would encounter non-human humanoids and sometimes their
    spacecraft. A certain "[Joe](Joe.html)" would testify to his
    encounter.


-   **September 16:** 4 Astronomers from the Saint-Michel-de-Provence Observatory (Alpes de Haute-Provence) follow the evolution of a small, bright, orange-yellow disk whose presence is confirmed by the Marignane radar station [\[FX 95-2562\]]{.source}.

-   **September 20:** Near Öjebyn (Northern Sweden), in the evening, a motorist suddenly finds himself surrounded by intense light radiation. The car headlights go out and the brakes stop working. The atmospheric pressure seems to increase. Then the rays disappear and the driver sees a dark object take off from a distant field 1 km away. The car restarts. The object follows it for about a minute, then disappears towards the south.

-   **October:** A Soviet-built Cuban plane lands in New Orleans without being detected. In 25 months, this is the second time American radars have seen nothing, as in October [1969](1969.html). A report from an investigative commission of the House of Representatives will establish the existence of this 2500 km breach in the American air defense system between Florida and California, one of the regions where the most mysterious disappearances occur: the famous "Death Triangle". It would cost $125 million to remedy it.

-   **November 13:** Mariner 9 is the first probe to orbit around Mars.

-   **November 14, 1:50 AM:** In Bordeaux (France), farmer Angelo Cellot is plowing one of his fields late at night under the headlights of his tractor, despite a dark sky and a light rain. Suddenly, Cellot thinks he sees a light coming from another tractor. He then realizes that the light is in the sky and is moving in his direction. He then assumes it is a helicopter and continues his work. This light, preceded by another red one, follows him along the field, hovering just above him. Then, 5 extremely powerful beams shoot out of it towards the ground. The witness is unable to guess the nature of the object that produces them. When the UFO starts to descend towards him, Cellot takes off, leaving the tractor with the headlights on and the engine running. Almost immediately, the UFO rises and slowly heads north. It is only then that Cellot realizes that it had made no noise. He returns to his home, deeply shaken.

-   **November 27:** The Soviet probe *Mars 2* in orbit around [Mars](Mars.html).

- For many weeks, the satellite *Eole* stubbornly refuses to work on Sundays! No valid scientific explanation can be given for these silences.
Radio astronomers from the [NRAO](NRAO.html) detect a transmitting source from [Jupiter](Jupiter.html) emitting ordered, perfectly rhythmic messages. This source had already been reported in [1961](1961.html). Graham Smith, a world-renowned English radio astronomer, based on these musical modulation messages, unambiguously declares that it is an emission like he has never before captured elsewhere in space. The messages continue for a period of 9 hours and 56 minutes, the same as the rotation time of the planet [Jupiter](Jupiter.html).

- A new code is established regarding the "red phone" which connects Washington to the Kremlin. This code should avoid any risk of atomic alert, any misunderstanding, in case UFOs cross their mutual airspace.

- A Buryakan (Soviet Armenia), at a conference of the academies of sciences of the USSR and the USA, one of the speakers declared: It would be megalomania to believe that we are the only intelligences in the universe!


- The Internal Review of the [National Gendarmerie](Gendarmerie.html) publishes a long article in which the possibility of the intervention of gendarmes to collect and investigate UFO sightings is outlined.
