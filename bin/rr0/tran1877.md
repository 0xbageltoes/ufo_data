-   **May 15:** At Aldershot (Hampshire), a being in tight-fitting clothes (like tights) wearing a shiny helmet rises into the air above two sentinels who shoot at him, to no avail. The apparition has paralyzed them with what they describe as a blue fire. The character is identical to that of "Jack Spring-heeled" who made a name for himself in [1837](1837.html) and [1838](1838.html).

- At Coney Island (Brooklyn), a winged human figure performed aerial acrobatics above the crowd of bathers. This strange being would be seen again until [1880](1880.html). [\[Letter from W. H. Smith on September 18th to the *New York Sun*\] \[Keel 1975\]]{.source}
