-  **7:15:** [Tunguska Explosion](1908-06-30_Tunguska.html) (Siberia). See the damage caused by the Tunguska explosion, in photo images/1908_250.jpg.

-   **0 h :** 5 hours after this explosion at the end of the world, Britain is dazzled by a sparkling sunset. The *Times* will report the event: the night is so clear that Londoners can read their newspaper in the street, at midnight, without resorting to the city lighting! A journalist thus describes this night of June 30th: The sky was as clear as in broad daylight and streaked with pink light clouds; in my life, I have never witnessed anything so amazing.

-   **July 11**: The famous Russian explorer V. K. Arsenyev was walking
    along the Gobilli River when he made this encounter: I saw a trace
    on the path that looked like a human footprint. My dog Alpha
    stopped, then growled, and suddenly something stirred close by,
    dragging itself with a heavy step among the bushes. Yet this thing
    did not flee, it stopped right next to us, invisible, perfectly
    still. We stayed like this for several minutes... Then I bent down,
    picked up a stone and threw it towards the bushes. Then something
    unexpected happened: I heard a flapping of wings. Something big
    and black emerged from the fog and flew over the river. An instant
    later, this thing had disappeared into the thick mist. My dog,
    completely terrified, huddled at my feet. After supper, I spoke of
    this incident to the men and of the Udehe tribe. They launched
    into a very animated story about a man who could fly in the air.
    Hunters had often seen his traces that suddenly vanished, in such
    a way that the only possible explanation was that "the man" had
    landed on the ground before taking off again
