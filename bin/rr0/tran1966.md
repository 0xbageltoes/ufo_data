-   **January 11, 3:05 AM**: In Meyerstown, Pennsylvania, 4 witnesses in a car (including 1 nurse) observe for 10 minutes a disc-shaped object that then flies over them for a long time at a short distance in a stationary flight: As for its shape, you know those saucers that kids slide down hills on, you know what I mean? They fit together without the edges touching. Honestly, I can't describe it any better. I won't say it reflected light, but rather that it was luminous, you know, like the luminous dial of an alarm clock at night. I know it was something material, and I won't budge on that. The outline was very clear. At no point was it blurry. We had the impression that it was a solid body, like when you look at an airplane... It was exactly as if, from below, I had seen an airplane just above me... Perfectly still... We had been observing the thing for maybe 5 minutes when it shot off at a dizzying speed. And yet, without a single sound being heard [\[Poher 2003\]]{.source}.

- At Tully (Australia), George Pedlez, who owns a banana plantation, was driving his tractor near a marsh called *Horseshoe Lagoon* when he suddenly heard a very loud, high-pitched whistle: It was as if air was escaping from a tire, he said. About 25 yards in front of him, he saw a machine taking off from the marsh. Blue-gray in color, it measured about 25 feet wide and 9 feet high. It circled and rose about 6 feet before taking off. All was finished in a few seconds, the craft departed at a terrifying speed, Pedley would declare. He later discovered the first "nest" with the reeds flattened in the direction of the clock hands. Other similar "saucer nests" were discovered nearby. See images/tully.jpg.  [\[Vallée 1969\]]{.source}

-   **January 30:** A reader of the *Sydney Sun Herald* suggests that the "nests" discovered in Queensland (Australia) a few days earlier are caused by a large, shy bird with a blue body and red spots on its head, a type of crane or blue heron. Many times when he was barefoot in the bushes, he said he had seen the birds dancing but they flew away quickly before he could reach them. They looked like a blue, vaporous cloud that, for sure, made a shrill noise when flying away. The ornithologist of the Australian Museum, H. J. Disney, states that cranes cannot make circular depressions of a geometric design. Likewise, he is skeptical of the theory of the bald coot put forward by another man, Ken Adams, from Gooloogong. I have never heard of this appearance in the bird, Disney declares [\[Vallée 1969\]]{.source}.

-   **5 PM:** At Temple (Oklahoma), an electronics instructor from Sheppard Air Force Base was driving to work on Route 65 and approaching the intersection with Highway 70: "At about 1500 meters from the intersection, I saw a very bright light about 1500 meters to my right and thought it was a truck in trouble on the highway. I turned West onto Highway 70. 400 meters further on, I changed my mind and thought it was a prefabricated house coming down the highway at an early hour. It was parked on the side of the road, I got to within a hundred meters, stopped, got out of the car and walked towards the object leaving my headlights on and my engine running. I took about 15 steps and then remembered I had a Kodak on the front seat and wanted to take a picture. I hesitated for a second and then saw the man dressed in military fatigues. I thought it was a sergeant... he had the insignia on his right arm and some kind of cap with the visor up. He weighed about 80 kg and was about 1.70 m tall. He was just a regular G.I. mechanic in civilian clothes... or a crew chief or something like that. He had a flashlight in his hand and was almost kneeling on his right knee, his left hand touching the bottom of the fuselage. The object looked like an aluminum airliner without wings or tail, and without seams along the fuselage. It rose vertically, about 1.50 m, then headed southeast, almost backwards, at about 1200 km/h judging by the barns it lit up as it flew along the valley. It was the size of a cargo plane but had no visible propulsion device. The witness was bombarded with questions by officers from the air base. A truck driver had observed the same object on the road [\[case [Blue Book](BlueBook.html) #10270 unsolved\]]{.source}.

- **April 22**


-   **9 PM:** In Beverly (Massachusetts), several people observed 3
    luminous objects spinning in a circle in the sky. A woman who
    waved her hand, one of the UFOs approached at a short distance:
    The object, as it approached, seemed to be getting bigger and
    bigger\... Above my head, I could see nothing else, in the blur of
    the atmosphere, than lights emitting very bright signals (they
    weren't blinking). I was very excited - but not scared - and very
    curious. If the object hadn't come closer, I wouldn't have run
    away, but I thought it was going to crash on me. Another witness
    ran away: I started to run. Then a friend shouted 'Look, it's
    right above us!' --- I looked up, and I was frozen in place. It
    was exactly like the bottom of a plate. It was solid\... I didn't
    hear any noise, but I thought this thing was going to fall on me
    (\...). I was fascinated, stunned, unable to think, and I found
    myself running to escape it.


-   **21 h 45 :** After the witnesses called the police, 2 officers
    went to enjoy the show. One of them testified: At 21:45, on
    orders from the police station, I went (\...) to Beverly High
    School, on Salem Road, where an UFO was reported. On my arrival,
    I observed what seemed to be a large plate hovering above the
    school buildings. There were 3 lights --- red, green and white ---
    but no noise that could indicate that it was an airplane. This
    object hovered above the school and seemed almost motionless. The
    lights shone in flashes. The object flew over the school twice
    then moved away. The television was scrambled during the
    observation.

-   **April 25**: William Haydon Burns, Governor of Florida campaigning for re-election, departs from Orlando for Tallahassee (state capital). On board the Convair, co-pilot Herb Bates spots two bright yellow globes side by side. At 6000 feet near Ocala (north Florida), Burns leaves the cockpit and announces: "We have a UFO next to us. I'm going to ask the pilot to head towards it." Frank Stockton, the Deputy Secretary, Captain Nathan Sharron of the State Highway Patrol, and all the journalists on board can then see the phenomenon to starboard. Some will describe two bright crescent-shaped lights, with a weaker section, like a column of light, between them. The yellow-orange lights vary in brightness, but remain very distinct. As the plane heads towards the UFO, it then quickly rises and disappears after accompanying the plane for 40 miles. Duane Bradford, director of the Capitol Bureau of the Tampa Tribune, will declare: "I began to think that these UFO stories weren't so funny after all." Bill Mansfield, director of the Miami Herald's central bureau, will declare: "There was something there. Something we all saw clearly. Something that still remains to be explained." The Governor (who had already seen a UFO according to a documentary broadcast on a Miami television in October of the previous year) confirmed the observation, but would not say any more.

-   **Wednesday, May 4th:** Two commercial airplanes (from Braniff and *American Airlines*) following each other at 32 km apart, as well as a ground radar, locate a target to the right of the Braniff above it and then at its height. The Braniff sees an intense light, alternately red, green and white. The following plane asks the first if it has turned on its landing lights and refuses to testify. The radar records the speed of the target at 1600 km/h. It makes a 180° turn in an area of 9 km, and there is no response to the transponder.

-   **May 10**: The famous American reporter Walter Cronkite does a report on the Michigan observations in *CBS Reports*, presenting the witnesses as not very credible. It shows [Donald Menzel](MenzelDonaldHoward.html) pouring benzene on an acetone-filled aquarium to demonstrate elementary facts of optics known since the 18th century. He tries to convince Americans that UFOs are only mirages. This is followed by an interview with a "lunatic" describing his encounters with the "space brothers". In contrast, an impressive interview with [Carl Sagan](SaganCarlEdward.html), who forcefully argues with mathematical arguments the improbability of an extraterrestrial visit. The documentary then contains a discussion with a military officer who claims that UFOs are never detected by radar, and with an astronomer who states that UFOs are never seen or photographed by satellite observation stations.

-   **June 15:** In Aveyron (France), on a calm night, a 76 year old woman living in an isolated farmhouse observes spherical "flaming" objects: "I was at the window, just for a moment, because at my age you need to take the air wherever you are. But I had never seen lights like that, nor anything similar! It was not just lights, it was fires! The objects cross the fields. The old woman gets scared: All these fires, I'm too old, I don't want to see things like that. If things start moving like this, what are we all going to become? After that it moved again, in the corner of the vineyard, you remember [\[speaking to her son-in-law\]]{.source}, that's when I called you, that's when I was scared, but if it gets closer, it will go into the barn and everything will go up in smoke, the house and us with it. So I called him, I called him. The son-in-law, who ran the farm and had seen the same thing as the old woman, goes out to check on the spot: The objects were rounded on top and rather flattened underneath; they vanished on the spot as if they were controlled by a switch. At one point there were 6, less than 2 km away; they moved in line at the speed of a tractor, then merged into a large luminous object resembling a flaming tree, an illuminated shell. Everything disappeared. The witnesses returned, completely amazed. The whole phenomenon took place without a sound. Later she will go to bed dressed for fear of "what could happen".


-   **9:45 PM:** At the [USAF](USAF.html) base in Nha Trang (South Vietnam), in addition to the usual base activities, 8 bulldozers are at work, soldiers are watching a movie outdoors, and 2 Douglas A-IE Skyraider attack planes are preparing to take off on the nearby runway. In the bay, a Shell tanker is at anchor. The sky to the north suddenly lights up. The initial reactions are that it is an enemy flare, but the light starts to move, approaching the base. As it gets close to the observers, it slows down and then stops, remaining stationary over the base at an altitude between 90 and 150 m, illuminating the entire valley. At this point, all the machines and power systems of the base stop working, as do those of the tanker in the bay and some Diesels. After remaining in this position for about 4 minutes, the UFO shoots up and disappears from sight in less than 3 seconds. After the object's departure, all the base's power returns as quickly and inexplicably as it had disappeared.

It was almost like the [science fiction](ScienceFiction.html) movies on television... It stayed suspended there, absolutely silent, like a church bell tower lit up at night. Or it looked like those Japanese suicide planes that threw themselves at night into the beams of the searchlights - it reminded me of them. It turned around for about 100 m - absolutely as if it was disheartened. 2 other cars arrive and the mysterious machine will turn off exactly like a thermostat in a household appliance, leaving only a shadow. The UFO disappears in a bluish wake.

-   **July 28th, in the evening:** Mr. Lacoste, a photographer from
    Saumur, and his wife were walking around Montsoreau (Maine-et-Loire). Suddenly, they saw a red sphere crossing the sky. The light emitted by the sphere was so intense that it lit up the whole countryside. It seemed to touch the ground and then rise again, hovering at mid-height for some time. Lacoste and his wife, now convinced that it was a military remote-controlled device, approached to a distance of about 300 m from the object, and it left and was lost from sight behind the woods. The observation lasted 4 minutes. A check will be made to see if any military experiments have taken place in that area: there were none [\[Vallée 1969\]]{.source}.

-   **August 6:** In a fairly isolated house in Texas, 3 young children (aged 6 to 9) noticed a dark object in the shape of an overturned bowl. Although it was afternoon, the children had not seen the object arrive. The object was dark, without color or light. Then a yellow glow appeared, as if a door was opening, and a small creature appeared in this square of light. The entity, 90 cm to 1.20 m tall, wore a black garment with yellow or golden reflections. The show lasted a few minutes, then the door closed. A low sound, like a buzzing, was heard, and the object left at an exceptional speed. The object never touched the ground: it hovered at a height of about 4.50 m, near a tree that was not damaged and which is about 10 m from the house.

- In the evening, a teenager living at the foot of Morro do Vintem hill goes to retrieve his kite and discovers 2 bodies about 300 m from the hill, hidden by thick vegetation. Lying side by side, their arms along their bodies, the corpses are wearing Sunday clothes protected by 2 identical new raincoats. Next to them are lead masks with visors, similar to those used by electronics technicians to protect their eyes when soldering. Despite the traces of blood near the bodies, there does not seem to have been a struggle.


- **August 20**


- The inhabitant living at the foot of Morro do Vintem Hill informs the police and firefighters of his discovery.


- The police and fire department went to the slopes of Morro do Vintem. They discovered a handkerchief, a piece of crumpled blue and white aluminum foil, some Cellophane paper soaked in a chemical and some crumpled paper strips. On some of them, one can read mathematical or electrical formulas as well as on two others: At 4:30 in the afternoon, be at the designated point. At 6:30, swallow the capsules with an orange. Once their effect is in progress, protect half of the face with lead masks. Then wait for the agreed signal. and Sunday, one capsule before the meal; Monday, one capsule in the morning; Tuesday, one capsule before the meal; Wednesday, one capsule before bedtime. The investigation was entrusted to Inspector José Venancio Bittencourt of the Rio de Janeiro police. The two victims were Miguel José Viana, 34 years old, and Manuel Pereira da Cruz, 32 years old, both electronics technicians and specialists in television. Both married, they lived in the city of Campos where they were well known. The analyses will show that the blood found near the dead was not theirs, and the autopsy could not determine the cause of their death. Inspector Bittencourt is categorical on this subject: Our specialists have excluded the possibility of poisoning, an act of violence or death by asphyxiation. According to a forensic doctor, the death, which dated back to August 16 or 17, was natural (heart attack). Inspector Bittencourt did not make the link between this double death and the UFO, nor even with any scientific experiment that had gone wrong. It was for him a staging organized by the murderer or murderers in order to conceal a theft - it is said that the victims had left home with a very large sum of money in cash. A recidivist later declared to be the author of the crime, but he was ruled out.

-   **September 3:** In the same house where the [August 6](#66-08-06) event took place, almost the entire family went out. Only the eldest daughter stayed with a friend. They were watching television in the afternoon when it suddenly went out. The house was lit up by a strange, red and yellow light, which seemed to spin around. The girls looked outside and saw an object hovering in the same place, near the same tree, as in the first event. Its shape was still that of an overturned bowl on a flat circle, like a saucer. It was bathed in light and took off shortly afterwards. There was no sign of life inside or outside the craft.


-   **September 5:** The father is sitting in his bed, and can see the dark doorway of his sons' bedroom. Suddenly, he sees a small being about 1 to 1.20 meters tall, dressed in white and tight-fitting clothing, entering the dark room. He thinks it is his little daughter who wants to talk to her mother, in the boys' room. About 10 minutes later, he sees a kind of "light bar" that seems to crumble. He then gets up and goes to the boys' room, who all saw the light bar. He does not see the creature in white. His wife will declare that their daughter had not set foot in the room. No evidence will be found to confirm the presence of the small person in the house.

Radio communications between the two groups allow for an approximate triangulation that locates the object in the sky about halfway between the two towns... They try to get closer: The object remained suspended, motionless, for about 15 minutes, extinguishing when we directed our spotlights on it. It was the size of a dollar coin held at arm's length. Shortly after, a smaller object - a light - streaked across the sky and also stopped next to the large light. Then the big light described a square trajectory, sending blue light beams to the ground from time to time. After maneuvering like this for about 1/2 hour, the lights shot off at full speed in the direction from which they came and disappeared in about 5 seconds. And all this absolutely silently [[[Poher](PoherClaude.html) 2003]]{.source}.
