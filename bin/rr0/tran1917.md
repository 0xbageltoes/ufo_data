-   **Sunday, May 13th, 12pm:** At [Fatima](Fatima.html) (Portugal), 3 young children of Portuguese
    peasants, Lucia dos Santos (10 years old) and her 2 cousins Francisco
    (9 years old) and Giacinta (7 years old) Marto, brother and sister,
    were tending to their flock of sheep after attending mass. They were
    playing at building a wall around a bush when their attention was
    drawn to a luminous phenomenon, like a shining globe in the air. They
    then descended towards their farm, and approached a vast grassy
    depression called *Cova de Iria* (literally: Saint Irene's Cave, an
    ancient sacred place) to see what was happening. A light then
    engulfed them and almost blinded them, but allowed them to see in its
    center a small woman in a white dress. She spoke to them reassuringly
    and asked them to come back to the same place and same time every
    month, for 6 months.


-   **June 13th, 12 PM:** About fifty people are present at [Fatima](Fatima.html). They see the little shepherds suddenly kneel and become transfigured. The oldest child, Lucia, 10 years old, speaks to an invisible entity whose answers are not heard. One of the spectators however claims to have heard a very faint voice or the buzzing of a bee. At the end of this dialogue, all the witnesses hear an explosion and see a small cloud rising near a tree.


-   **July 13th, 12pm:** The number of witnesses has risen to 4500. A buzzing or humming sound is heard, a decrease in the Sun's brightness and heat, a small white cloud around the tree of apparitions and a powerful noise from the Lady. The children are terrified by "a vision of hell" and receive a specific prophecy announcing "apparitions of unknown lights in the sky: The war will end, but if the peoples do not cease to offend God, there will be another, more terrible war during the reign of Pius XI (he died in 1939). When you see the night lit up by an unknown light, know that it is the great sign that God gives you that he will punish the world for its crimes through war, famine and the persecution of the Church and the Holy Father. To prevent this, I will come to ask for the consecration of Russia\... If my requests are heard, Russia will be converted and there will be peace. Otherwise, it will spread its errors throughout the world.

-   **August 19th, 4 PM:** The children, released, keep their sheep near Aljustrel when they observe a sudden cooling of the temperature. The Sun becomes yellowish and the countryside is again filled with the colors of the rainbow, which the adults of the surroundings will also observe (as the inquiry will establish later). The children see the lightning and a bright glow that settles on a tree near them. In the center stands the entity draped in white and gold. The witnesses fall to their knees and their soul is transported with ecstasy. A dialogue ensues, during which the apparition exhorts them to make sacrifices for the fishermen. 10 minutes later, the Lady of Light slowly departs to the east with a roar of an engine.


-   **September 13th, 12pm:** The crowd is 30000 people, including
    two perfectly skeptical priests who have come specially to establish
    the falseness of the so-called "miracles". The site of the
    apparitions is a vast amphitheater where most of the crowd has
    settled to be close to the tree of apparitions. However, the two
    priests have chosen a location in a higher place from where they
    can see everything. The Sun then becomes less intense although
    there are no clouds in the sky. Thousands of people: There she is...
    look! Everyone sees a globe of light descending slowly down the
    valley, from East to West, towards the children. It lands on the
    tree. A white cloud forms and bright white petals start to fall
    from the empty sky: As people stare at this strange spectacle,
    they soon notice that, contrary to the laws of perspective, these
    shining globules that fall become smaller and smaller as they
    approach them. And when they stretch out their hands and hats to
    grab them, they realize that, somehow, they have vanished. The
    children see the entity again at the center of the globe and the
    dialogue between the Lady and Lucia resumes. The promise of a
    miracle for October 13th is renewed. Then the luminous globe rises
    and disappears into the Sun. When one of the priests was asked
    what kind of globe it seemed to him, he, very impressed, said that
    it could be a celestial vehicle that was transporting the Mother of
    God from her throne to the desert down here.


-   **October:** The cargo ship *Zebrine* is found completely deserted off the coast of Cherbourg, between Falmouth and Saint-Brieuc. The table is set and laundry is drying on the deck. The logbook is regularly kept. As this disappearance takes place during World War I, the hypothesis of a submarine attack is put forward. The submarine would have fled upon the approach of a ship, fearing to be caught after having boarded the cargo. However, there is no disorder, and the cargo was not sent to the bottom.


-   **October 13th, 12pm:** In front of a crowd of 70000 people despite
    heavy rain, the vision is preceded by a lightning and a sweet and
    pleasant smell. The children enter into communication with the Lady.
    Witnesses observe the great change occurring on the faces of the 3
    children, transfigured by the vision. The announced miracle took
    place at the departure of the Lady of the *Cova da Iria*. The rain
    that had not stopped falling on the crowd suddenly stops, and the
    heavy clouds move away. The Sun appears as a shining silver disc,
    a fantastic disc that spins quickly on its axis and throws beams of
    colored light in all directions. Red rays shot from the edge of the
    Sun and colored the clouds, the earth, the trees, the people; then
    violet, blue, yellow and other colors followed. These colors were
    described by an objective skeptic as monochromatic sectors that
    spun endlessly. Reports speak of a flat disc rather than a globe.
    After a while, it stopped its rotation and plunged down in zigzag -
    like a dead leaf - towards the earth and the horrified spectators.
    Most of the observers then believe that their last hour has come.
    Many of them, including detractors, kneel in the mud and start to
    publicly confess. Finally, the disc reverses its movement and
    disappears towards the Sun, the real one, again fixed and
    dazzling in the sky. The stunned crowd suddenly realizes that their
    clothes are perfectly dry.
