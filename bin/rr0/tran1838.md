-   **February 18, 8:30 PM:** Miss Scales, from Limehouse, passes through Green Dragon Alley (London), a poorly lit passage near a cabaret. When she sees a tall silhouette hiding in the shadows, she hesitates and waits for her sister who stayed behind. The latter arrives and sees the tall, slim and distinguished character who has thrown his long cape to the side and shone a lantern on the stunned young girl. She doesn't have time to scream when Jack spits a blue flame at the face of his victim who falls to the ground unconscious. Jack then calmly leaves. Sergeant Charles Pritchel will later tell the authorities that she was suffering from hysteria and great agitation, presumably due to fear. [[[Vallée](ValleeJacques.html) 1988]]{.source}

-   **February 20th, late at night:** At Old Ford (London), Jane Alsop, 18 years old, hears a violent ringing of the doorbell and shouting: "For the love of God, bring me a light, for we have caught Spring-heeled Jack in the alley!" In an instant, Alsop runs out with a candle and is confronted with the most hideous appearance of Jack. He wears shiny clothes and a flaming lamp on his chest. His eyes look like sparkling fireballs: when Miss Alsop screams, the intruder grabs her arm with his fingers like claws. The girl's sister rushes to the rescue to bring her sister back inside. The visitor sends a burning gas (blue and white flames) to Jane's face, who faints. Curiously, Jack knocks on the door several times and waits for an answer, before finally fleeing when the sisters call for help, dropping his cape which is immediately picked up by another shadow running after him.

-   **February 28**: In Turner Street (London), Jack knocks on Mr. Ashworth's door and asks for him. The servant who opens the door starts to scream and Jack runs away.
