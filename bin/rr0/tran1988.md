-   **January 12:** [Ed Walters](WaltersEdwardDaniel.html) is in his pickup truck and by chance encounters a stationary UFO above the road. He photographs it. This time, a beam of white light paralyzes [Waters](WaltersEdwardDaniel.html) as he hides under his truck. Beings emerge from the UFO and head towards the vehicle, but [Waters](WaltersEdwardDaniel.html) manages to get back in and flee.


- **January 21**

- **1h 30:** Fay Knowles and her 3 sons, accompanied by their 2 dogs, have just come from East Perth and are heading towards Mundrabilla, crossing the Nullarbor Plain (Western Australia). Suddenly, their car radio starts to malfunction. See images/Knowles_300.jpg.

-   **1 h 45:** The quartet sees lights in the distance. As the car --- a Ford --- approaches, it turns out that there is only one light. It is parked on the side of the highway. Sean Knowles, the driver, does not realize until the last moment that this light is illuminating another vehicle. He swerves violently to avoid the accident and then turns around to see what is happening. The light moves above the road, pursued by Knowles' vehicle. Then it starts to back up towards the car. Sean turns around again, but the UFO catches up with them. Something lands on the roof of the car with a dull thud and the vehicle seems to leave the ground. Fay Knowles lowers the window and sticks her hand out to touch the object above. She claims it was hot and spongy, and compares it to a rubber plunger used to unclog sinks. Meanwhile, chaos reigns in the car. A shrill sound is heard. One of the sons will later say he thought his brain was going to come out of his head. Sean, the driver, faints briefly. The dogs become wildly furious. Dust, entering through the lowered window, swirls inside and there is a smell of decomposing corpses. Then the UFO releases the car. It falls violently to the ground and one of the tires bursts. Sean takes control of it, stops it, and the whole family gets out to hide on the side of the road until the UFO moves away.

The UFO is about the same size as the car, white with a yellow center. It emits a kind of electric buzz. When it is gone, one of the strangest consequences of the experience occurs: for about 15 minutes, everyone's voice becomes very high-pitched, as if they had breathed helium. In this state, the family changes the wheel and then sets off towards Mundrabilla. The car is covered with a deposit similar to soot. The suitcases loaded on the gallery have disappeared. At the Manor Hotel in Mundrabilla, where the family takes refuge about 40 km away, a truck driver named Graham Henley tells them he saw a light in the distance and saw it hovering above their Ford. He can see that a smell of Bakelite permeates the car and that its roof is strangely bulged in 4 places. A little later, the Knowleses present themselves at the Ceduna police station. This is what Sergeant Fred Longlet will say about them: These people had really seen something. What exactly ... well, I don't know. They were in a frightening state, even 5 hours after the incident. Returned ... you can even say pale .. and trembling. The woman thanked heaven for being alive. These people were in a state 1000 times worse than all those who had reported UFO sightings to me so far. Something had happened. Their car, after all those miles traveled, was still covered with black ash or dust. There was even some inside. Where could it come from? Out there, there is nothing but sand.


-   **February 7:** The UFO again visits the home of the [Waters](WaltersEdwardDaniel.html) and Frances Walters, Ed's wife, narrowly missing being "struck" by a blue beam --- an event that [Waters](WaltersEdwardDaniel.html) managed to capture on film.

-   **February 18th, 7:15 PM:** In the Montélimar region, during the Lialog liaison flight, Lieutenant de Vaisseau Christophe Clachant: We were returning from a liaison flight to Hyères on board the twin-turboprop Nord 262 "Fregate" of Squadron 11 S, a flight with passengers as every Thursday, heading to the Dugny-Le Bourget naval air base. As an ensign, I was the captain and occupied the right seat. The copilot, on the left, was driving the machine. We were flying at nearly 400 km/h. There was a sea of clouds below but the sky was beautiful, a superb twilight with blue and orange towards the West. And suddenly, between Montélimar and Moulins, we saw a big, bright, golden white light facing North, like a powerful torch that seemed suspended, stationary. I then said to my copilot: "Hey, did you see that?" "Yeah! What is it? An airplane?" I was certain: "It's shining so much, it's not possible!" and I decided to call the control: "There's a point, something that's shining very brightly... Do you see anything in our North sector?" The controller told me he didn't see anything. Then an Air Inter captain announced on the radio, in a very sure voice: "No, it's an airplane!" I replied: "No, it's not possible, that's not it..." Nobody answered. And then suddenly, after a minute, it seemed to go down and the phenomenon disappeared. On our return, the "pacha" of our squadron didn't want to hear anything. We weren't taken seriously at all. I was extremely troubled by this observation... [[VSD 9808 H, p. 31]]{.source}.

-   **Wednesday, June 1st:** In the Puerto Montt zone (southern tip of
    South America), on a clear and cloudless night, the ACC (air
    traffic control center) heard the crew of the Chilean civil flight
    045 asking them: Puerto Montt! Is there any traffic in front of us
    currently? The controller of the permanent tower leans out the
    window that looks north of the operational building and then
    notices something curious. He recounts: I saw a white light
    moving from the north to the airport. I was on the 3rd floor,
    where the ACC is located. At first, I confused it with the lights
    of the LAN 737, but when I checked the position of the aircraft,
    I realized that this light could not correspond to the Boeing 737
    and that it was something else. I estimate that I started to see
    the light above Osorno, as it approached the airport. About 10 km
    from the runway, I was able to distinguish the object in
    question a little better. There were several white lights in the
    upper part and 4 red lights in the lower part. This object then
    approached about 1500 m from my position, always to the north. It
    never got closer... The object stopped for a few seconds and I
    could observe that, from the lower part, bright flashes of light
    were coming out, giving me the impression that this lower part
    was flat and of a metallic appearance. I estimate that its shape
    was circular and of a diameter of about 60 m. I could see the
    base of the object because of the flashes, but I could not see
    the upper part, except for these white lights mentioned
    previously. The flashes were quite different from the 4 lower red
    lights and did not twinkle. Then, after about 2 minutes, this
    strange object moved away to the north, in the same direction it
    had come from. I did not see it turn. Shortly afterwards, I lost
    sight of it towards the north, after following it with my eyes
    until the Osorno sector. The northward movement of the mysterious
    intruder in the direction from which flight 045 was approaching
    will first cause an anxious call from the captain and then,
    secondly, an "air miss" maneuver. The controller of the permanent
    tower then hears cries from the floor below, from where the
    phenomenon can be followed even more easily. At 0 h 10 UTC, while
    we were in radio communication with LAN flight 045 in the
    approach phase, concerning the existence of an unknown traffic
    that was in front of him, I could see from the tower a light
    similar to a star, but very large and without a specific shape,
    approximately aligned on the axis of the runway, about 16 km
    north and 40° above the horizon line, of great intensity and with
    changes of colors, passing successively from red to green and
    yellow. To try to see details of the object, I took the binoculars
    of the tower to better look at the UFO, but I could not see
    anything more, except a slow movement towards the south, that is
    to say towards the airport. This lasted 3 to 4 minutes, then the
    mysterious object seemed to be instantly "sucked" in the direction
    of the north, in the same way and as quickly as when one acts on
    the wheel of a zoom of a pair of binoculars to appreciate
    something from a greater distance. Having lost the visual contact
    of this object in the field of vision of my binoculars, I then
    looked for it with the naked eye at the same time as I heard the
    pilot of the LAN flight 045, on the ACC frequency, reporting that
    he had to make a left turn to avoid collision with the UFO...
    Looking north, on the horizon, I could only see a glow similar to
    a landing light reflecting in a nebula before disappearing. 5
    minutes later, the Boeing of the LAN flight 045 made itself
    known on the tower frequency, about 25 km north of the runway,
    beginning its approach procedure, then it lit its landing lights
    which appeared very small on the horizon. Then everything went
    normally. The magnetic tape containing the conversations between
    the plane and the services of the air traffic control of Puerto
    Montt allowed to reconstitute with exactitude, and in real time
    this affair. The voice of the pilot at the controls of the Boeing
    was very stressed when he warned of the danger located right on
    his flight trajectory. This tape is the only report. He did not
    want to testify or establish an official report [\[VSD 2007 H\]]{.source}.


-   **June 25th, 2am:** Chris Davis, a 17 year old American, is driving home. After passing Scape Ore Marsh, near Bishopville (South Carolina), he realizes he has a flat tire. He stops and quickly changes the tire. He is about to get back in the car when he notices a solitary figure running across a nearby field in his direction. Surprised to see someone at this late hour, Davis carefully observes the silhouette and, as the stranger approaches him, he is horrified to find out that he is not dealing with a human being. In fact, it is something the teenager has never seen before. The being is 2 meters tall, looks like a giant green and scaly lizard with red and shiny almond-shaped eyes. Apparently, it has only 3 fingers and 3 toes, each ending with a 10 cm black claw. Paralyzed, Davis eventually jumps into his car. In the meantime, the creature has reached the vehicle and started to fight with the outside rearview mirror as if it wanted to open the driver's door. The lizard-man is so excited that when Davis accelerates to escape its grip, it jumps onto the car roof and clings to it, while the terrified teenager drives at almost 120 km/h through the marshlands. The creature eventually lets go, falls off the roof and finally disappears in the distance [*Houston Chronicle* July-August]. Davis returns home to his parents terrified that night. He is hysterical, crying and trembling. When he calms down, he tells them what happened. The county sheriff, Liston Truesdale, also believes Davis' story and says He's a good, honest boy. He even agreed to take a lie detector test and be interrogated under hypnosis. No doubt: he is telling the truth. Several similar testimonies are reported to the police in the following weeks, attracting the attention of the media. The Scape Ore Marsh is invaded by television teams fighting for the best shooting locations; a local radio station even offers a $1 million reward for the capture of the famous "lizard-man". Several 3-fingered 35 cm long footprints are later discovered in the marsh. Plaster casts are made of them.


-   **June 28**: At a military base near the experimental nuclear
    facilities of Kapoustine Yar, on the banks of the Volga River, at
    the edge of the Caspian Lowlands, 4 people see a UFO maneuvering
    above the base for more than 2 hours. When the UFO flies over the
    weapons storage area, it sends a beam into the missile depot [\[FX

- The naked and horribly mutilated body of a man of about 40 years old was found near the artificial lake of Guarapiranga. He was identified, but his family asked for his anonymity to be preserved. The case was not made public and added to the pile of unsolved crimes of the Brazilian police. In 1994, the ufologist Encarnacion Garcia, who had been investigating cattle mutilations in Brazil for a long time, learned by chance that Doctor Rubens Goes, one of his friends, was in possession of 7 strange photographs that he had received from Rubens Sergio, his cousin, a technician of the police services. The similarities between the wounds inflicted on the man of the Guarapiranga lake and those of the cattle dismembered by the ghost mutilators jumped to the eyes of the ufologist. Doctor Cuenca, who had conducted the examinations at the time, agreed to give him his file. In addition to the autopsy report, this file contained the police report which specified that the victim seemed to have not struggled nor been tied up. Although found between 48 and 72 hours after death, the body showed no signs of putrefaction or attacks by predators and did not emit any smell - a surprising detail in a hot climate like that of Brazil. The cheeks and lips had been precisely cut, the tongue sectioned, the eyes and ears - including the inner part - removed. The absence of any trace of blood seemed to indicate that an instrument cauterizing by heat, such as a laser, had been used. Circular perforations made with a punch, with a diameter varying between 3 and 4.5 cm, were visible under the arms, shoulders and legs. A neat hole of 4.5 cm was visible at the navel and the scrotum had been cut following an elliptical incision of 3.5 cm by 1.5. The testicles had been extracted with the same surgical precision. On the other hand, the penis was still in place but strangely distended. As for the anus, it had been excised following a large ellipse of 8.5 cm by 17 cm. It was also noted that almost all the internal organs had been removed, probably extracted through the perforations. Everything seemed to suggest that the victim had undergone a monstrous surgical operation for which he had been prepared, as suggested by the neatly shaved pubis. The similarities with cattle mutilations are striking: same precise technique, same organs cut and extracted with the same skill and same contempt for the corpse, thrown away after the operation like a mere debris.

-   **18 h:** Above the area between the small towns of Lajas and Cabo Rojo (Southwest of the island of Puerto Rico, between Santo Domingo and the Virgin Islands), a large triangular UFO appears. Wilson Rosa, a ufologist living in the municipality of Betances, testifies, as well as his wife and children: From 6 pm, we saw fighter jets flying over the region. At 19:45, we heard other planes belonging either to the Puerto Rico National Guard or to the US Navy. They flew very high, but we could clearly hear their engines. I followed their flight with attention because, about a week earlier, another one of these jets, an F-14 or an F-15, had pursued a UFO --- of small size --- above the Sierra Bermeja and the Laguna Cartagena. So I went out to observe them, and that's when I discovered a large UFO flying over the Sierra Bermeja.<br/><br/>It was huge! It blinked and had many colored lights. I ran to get my binoculars and I could clearly see that it had the shape of a triangle and was slightly rounded towards the back. It turned, returned to a lower altitude and seemed even bigger.<br/><br/>That's when we noticed 2 jet fighters flying just behind it. As the UFO moved away (towards the West), one of the planes tried to intercept it by passing in front of it. The UFO turned to the left and made a U-turn, reducing its speed. For 3 times, the planes tried to intercept it: the UFO slowed down even more and almost stopped. It was incredible!<br/><br/>That something so big could remain almost motionless was inconceivable. According to its size, it must have been extremely heavy. The second fighter stayed to the right of the UFO and the other one placed itself to its left towards the back. That's when.. I'm unable to say what exactly happened.<br/><br/>I don't know if the plane entered the UFO from the back or from the top. We all started to shout, fearing a collision, or even an explosion. The fighter placed in the back had disappeared inside the UFO because, in my binoculars, I didn't see it reappear neither towards the back, nor towards the top nor towards any other point.<br/><br/>The second plane stayed on the right of the UFO, very close. It seemed tiny compared to this huge machine. When the UFO took the direction of the West, the plane disappeared, as well as the sound of its engine. That's exactly what had happened when the first one had seemed to disappear inside the UFO. After having "swallowed" the planes, the UFO lost altitude and approached very close to the ground (above the small lake of Samàn). It stayed in the air for a moment, then its angles deformed and a big luminous flash jallited from the central yellow light ball. Then, it split in two triangular parts in the middle. It was incredible! The right triangle was now illuminated in yellow and the other one in red. The 2 triangles started to fly at full speed, one towards the southeast and the other one towards the northeast, towards Monte del Estado. When the UFO split, we could see some kind of red sparks coming off it. (See *US Jets Abducted at Puerto Rico*, The UFO Report, under the direction of Timothy Good.) <br/><br/>Another witness, Ivan Coté, added that it had seemed to him to see small red machines surrounding the UFO and trying to move away the planes. He specified that a 3rd fighter had turned back when it had seen what was happening to the others and that the red triangle had pursued it for a moment. The ufologist Jorge Martin didn't stop at collecting Wilson Rosa's testimony. He found in the region numerous witnesses whose stories overlap even in the details. In order to know more, Jorge Martin hastened to contact the competent authorities.<br/><br/>The [FAA](FAA.html) office for Puerto Rico replied to him that it had had no knowledge of any incident with a UFO, but that it knew that forces coming from the naval base of Roosevelt Roads, on the other side of the island, had accomplished military maneuvers in the zone in question --- which the said base denied afterwards. As for the air bases of the Puerto Rico National Guard of Muniz and Salinas, they were even less explicit and affirmed that none of their planes had flown over the region that evening. However, this beautiful unanimity cracked when Jorge Martin set out to interrogate the responsible units of the police specialized in the chase of drug traffickers and their planes, the *Fast Action United Force* (FURA), of which a radar unit was based in San German, very close to Cabo Rojo, as well as the *Criminal Investigation Corps*. He then learned that an intense activity of combat planes had been registered at the said hour above the region. Recontacted, the [FAA](FAA.html) said not to understand why Roosevelt Roads had denied the evidence and Mirabal, the officer interrogated by Jorge Martin, made him this surprising confidence: I know nothing about this incident, but even if it was the case, as soon as there is a report concerning UFOs, we are not allowed to investigate because these investigations are reserved to a special department of the [FAA](FAA.html) based in Washington, DC.. There was thus a special department at the [FAA](FAA.html) to study a phenomenon which officially didn't exist.


-   **20:20:** The Sierra Bermeja and Laguna Cartagena, flown over by the UFO, were surveyed at very low altitude until midnight by unmarked black helicopters with no distinctive markings and extinguished position lights.


        -   **20 h 30 :** According to Carlos Racfort, the supervisor of air operations at the Mayagüez airport, near Cabo Rojo, a Cessna from the army lands with 4 men on board to investigate an event that has just occurred in the region.
