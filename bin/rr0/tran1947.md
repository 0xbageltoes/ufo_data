-   **January:** The [Highjump](Highjump.html) operation is organized in Antarctica (South Pole) by the [US Navy](USNavy.html). In total 4700 men, 13 ships and 23 planes are involved. A base is set up at *Little America*. An exhaustive mapping of the coast and inland areas is developed. Over 70000 aerial photographs are taken. Perhaps the goal is also to ferret out Nazi bases, and Nazi resistance is suspected to have been encountered.

- **February 12**

-   **10:38:** A monstrous bolide strikes the USSR near the city of Sikhote-Alin, in the Soviet Far East north of Vladivostok. It is first spotted as a bright light in the daytime sky, bright enough to burn eyes as it hurtles towards the ground at a sharp angle. Followed by a huge smoky trail, the [meteor](1947.html) streaks towards the Earth, filling the sky with deep reverberating thunderclaps and shaking the ground. The meteorite, estimated to weigh more than 100 tons, explodes into fragments that impact a large area, digging more than 120 craters, the largest of which is 20 feet deep and 90 feet in diameter. Blocks of iron weighing up to 2 tons are scattered across the landscape. It is unclear what details [LaPaz](LaPazLincoln.html) will have of this incident by the end of [1948](1948.html). As unlikely as it may seem today, judging by the comments he will make in his papers, he will clearly suspect at the time that this event, like other unusual meteors in [1946](1946.html) and 1947, could have been caused by a man-made object. Although it is now known that the meteor traveled from the North-Northeast to the South-Southwest, the Soviet investigator initially dispatched to the scene, Krinov, will indicate a trajectory from the North-Northwest to the South-Southeast. The erroneous estimation of the trajectory could have led [LaPaz](LaPazLincoln.html) to believe that the object was a missile from the western part of the USSR.

 - The governments of the United States and Canada agree on a Joint Declaration on Defense Collaboration emphasizing the continued importance of defense planning and efforts in this regard. Among those proposed are the exchange of military personnel, the adoption of common weapon, equipment and organization designs and standards, and the cooperation and exchange of observers in exercises.

- **April**

-   **April 15th:** Engineers from the Richmond Weather Bureau, including Walter A. Minczewski, launch a balloon they track with a theodolite. They observe, just below the craft, a silver object in the shape of an ellipse. It appears larger than the balloon and they can make out, through the theodolite, that it is flat on the bottom and has a dome on the upper side. They observe it for about 15 seconds, then the object disappears to the West at the altitude of commercial airplanes.

They are convinced, according to the dispatch, that the device comes from another planet and that these saucers were piloted by small men (less than 1.20 m). 17 bodies were reportedly found. The story comes from a dispatch that appeared only one day in the U.S. news before being silenced by the military. [[Several sources including Dorothy Kilgallen]]{.source}

-   **Saturday, June 21, 2 PM:** Start of [the Maury Island affair](MauryIsland.html). An American Coast Guard vessel (2 fishermen?), with the captain's son (15 years old), his dog, and another crew member, is patrolling in Puget Sound. The boat stops in a bay of Maury Island, about 5 km from Tacoma. People on board the vessel then see 6 very large, doughnut-shaped objects just above their heads. None of these objects make any noise. 5 of the UFOs start to circle the 6th, which loses altitude until it stops, hovering. Afraid that the object might fall into the sea, Dahl moves the boat onto the beach. That's where he takes 4 photographs of the objects. The central UFO then vomits out pieces of molten metal that fall into the water and onto the shore. One of them kills the dog, another severely burns Dahl's son, and a seagull is also killed. The boat is damaged. Then the UFO rises, joins the others, and all 6 of them speed off over the Pacific. The men collect samples of the still-hot metal. Back at the port, [Dahl](DahlHaroldA.html) reports the events to his superior officer, [Fred Crisman](CrismanFredLee.html).

-   **Sunday, June 22nd:** In the morning, a man dressed in black arrives at Dahl's in a black Buick and invites him to lunch. During the meal, he indicates to Dahl that he is aware of everything that happened in Maury and tells him: Silence is the best thing for you and your family. You have seen what you should never have seen. Dahl later establishes that no one has spoken to anyone about their strange experience.

- **Monday, June 23:** [Fred Crisman](CrismanFredLee.html) goes to Maury to see the metal debris for himself. While he is there, a saucer-shaped flying object appears, flies over the bay and then disappears into a thundercloud. He then develops the photographs: they are covered with white spots, as if they had been exposed to some kind of radiation.

   -   In the rocket testing zone of [White Sands](WhiteSands.html) (New Mexico), the American Naval Laboratories rocket expert, Dr. C. John, along with 2 (3?) other scientists (Dr. Zohn and Curtiss Rockwood, rocket experts) see a silver disc that appears to be moving in the sky at a speed they estimate to be faster than the speed of sound.

-   **4:45 PM:** The driver of a vehicle traveling from Des Moines to Mason City is about 10 km from Clarion (Iowa) when a group of 5 UFOs passes in his field of vision. They are followed by 13 more, whiter and more oval, coming from the opposite direction, making a sound similar to that of a dynamo, and flying northwest.

-   **9:10:** An American [Navy](USNavy.html) pilot flying South sees near Williams Field (Arizona) 2 gray spheres about 3 m in diameter, diving at an inconceivable speed and seeming to land about 40 km South of the Grand Canyon.

- Police officers in Portland (Oregon) saw 5 discs resembling bright hubs, of chrome structure appear, disappear and then reappear, flying as if they were spinning wrong. Agent K. Mc Dowell, on patrol duty, will affirm: "I saw 5 large objects in the sky, they were shaped like discs and had no special color. They lowered and then rose in a very fast oscillating movement, and disappeared very quickly."

-   2 other police officers and 1 private pilot see 3 discs at the same moment, flying at a terrifying speed, grouped in a straight line. The last disc was moving laterally, inside a lateral arc, very quickly. They were silent and left no condensation trails behind them.

- On the Kenyan coast, 12 members of the crew of the steamer *Landovery Castle*, including the captain, observe a huge dark object approaching. It stops 800 m away and 30 m high, then turns on a blinding white spotlight that illuminates the sea and reveals a 300 m long cigar. It moves in formation with the boat for a few minutes, then turns off its spotlight and disappears into the night. [[Pottier 1974]]{.source}

- **July**

-   **9-10 h**: 50 miles northeast of St. Louis (Missouri), on a clear, cloudless day, a 14-year-old boy was nailing corrugated panels to the roof of a barn. He then saw an object in the shape of a disc, non-luminous and smaller than the Moon, pass over him from east to west, slightly to the south, at an estimated altitude between 10,000 and 20,000 feet. Becoming a scientist, he would not report his observation until much later in [1973](1973.html), during an internal survey of the [AIAA](AIAA.html).

- Observation at Montusson. [[Vallée 1966]]{.source}

-   **Tuesday 1st July**

-   [Arnold](ArnoldKenneth.html) sees the fragments compared to
    slag, cinder, but not the negatives of the lost photos. He calls Lieutenant Frank Brown, an intelligence officer from the Hamilton Air Force Base (California), to ask him to join the investigation. Brown and a certain Captain Davidson take the road that same hour, aboard a B-25 bomber. They talk that afternoon with [Crisman](CrismanFredLee.html) in [Arnold](ArnoldKenneth.html)'s hotel room. Brown says he has to return to California that night and can therefore not visit the island. But he fills a large box with kilos of metal fragments before leaving.

-   The radars located at [Roswell](Roswell.html), [White Sands](WhiteSands.html) and [Alamogordo](lieux.html#Alamogordo) detect an unidentified flying object moving at incredible speeds.

- **Wednesday 2 July**

-   Early in the morning, [Crisman](CrismanFredLee.html) is on the phone with [Arnold](ArnoldKenneth.html). The B-25 where Brown and Davidson were has crashed near Kelso. Both are dead. One of the plane's engines mysteriously caught fire 20 minutes after takeoff. The fragments are not found. [Arnold](ArnoldKenneth.html) organizes an expedition to Maury Island with [Crisman](CrismanFredLee.html) and Dahl, but it turns out that the engine of their boat dies. [Crisman](CrismanFredLee.html) promises to call Arnold as soon as the problem is solved. He never does. And he does not return the photographs either. He has become untraceable --- according to Dahl, he left town on business; according to other sources, he was last seen boarding a military plane bound for Alaska. Then Dahl's son disappears in turn. Moreover, it seems that someone has filled Arnold's hotel room with microphones, transmitting to local newspapers the details of his conversations, even those he had alone with Brown and Davidson. He contacts another intelligence officer, a certain Major Sanders, who obstructs him. Arnold, now deeply shaken, leaves town. Official explanation: hoax set up by the coast guard to get publicity. However, they are not prosecuted.

-   David N. Johnson, a specialized journalist in aeronautical matters at the *Idaho Daily Statesman* of [Boise](lieux.html#Boise), where [Kenneth Arnold](ArnoldKenneth.html) resides, cites 2 new observations that confirm the description given by Arnold of one of the devices: in the shape of a flying wing. The article also cites Lieutenant General [Nathan F. Twinning](TwiningNathanFarragut.html), reached by phone, who declares that the army is investigating these affairs. He even asks witnesses to send a description of what they saw to the "commanding general" of [Wright Field](WrightPatterson.html). When Johnson wants to know if these objects could come from a foreign country, the general answers that they should then fly over great distances. Twinning doubts that they are guided missiles: the remote control technique is not advanced enough when the distance is too great.

- Peak of the wave of observations with 88 observations made by over 400 witnesses in 24 states and one Canadian province. In half of the cases, they were single objects; in the others, there were two or more, some flying in formation. Two-thirds of these observations were made in broad daylight and concerned round, spherical, or disc-shaped UFOs.

-   **16 h :** At Clovis, Clines Cornes (New Mexico), one of the
    greatest American astronomers (wishing to remain anonymous) who
    was driving with his family saw an elliptical object maneuvering
    in an enigmatic way near a cloud region. During the 2 minutes and
    30 seconds of the observation, the whole family had time to
    meticulously observe the object. The astronomer guarantees his own
    calculations: rigid, elliptical object, with a size of 50 to 80 m
    and moving at a speed of 190 to 290 km/h. Oscillation and silent
    movement: We had before our eyes a flying machine of an unknown
    type. (...) Against a background of dark clouds, the object gave
    a strong impression of self-luminosity. (...) The appearance and
    behavior of the object do not correspond to any known optical or
    celestial phenomenon. No plane, no rocket, no guided missile can
    make such a rapid ascent (from 966 to 1450 km/h) without leaving
    vapor trails.

- **August**

-   **August 2, 17:41:** The *Lancastrian Star Dust* of the British
    company *South American Airways* is flying over the Andes. Despite
    the snowfall, a few minutes before landing in Santiago, Chile, the
    plane's radio operator Dennis Harmer sends a Morse message to
    announce a good arrival: ETA [*Estimated Time of Arrival*] Santiago
    17.45 hrs STENDEC. The official report on this will be as follows:
    The signal of 17.41 was received by Santiago only 4 minutes before
    the ETA. The Chilean radio operator in Santiago indicates that the
    signal was received loud and clear but that it was given very
    quickly. Not understanding the word "STENDEC" he asked and received
    the same word repeated twice in succession. No explanation for the
    word "STENDEC" was found. From that moment nothing more was heard
    from the plane and no contact was established with the control tower
    in Santiago. All subsequent calls were unanswered. This last word
    will therefore remain incomprehensible, like the disappearance of
    the plane. The plane will not be found until January [2000](2000.html).

-   **August 8:** Federal Agent Coyne writes in a memo addressed to one of his sub-directors: we have no reason to consider these discs as anything other than a military weapon, and, in the impossibility of attributing the paternity of these discs to the navy, the army, or the Soviets, suggests that the file be entirely handed over to the army.
