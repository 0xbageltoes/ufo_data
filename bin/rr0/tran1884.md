-   **June 6:** A flaming object falls from the sky above Dundy County in
    southern Nebraska (USA). Agricultural workers rush to the scene of
    the accident. Upon arriving, they find a burned grass area and sand
    that has melted into a substance resembling glass. The heat
    emanating from the strange object is still high several hours after
    the crash: a man who approached too closely saw his skin blister.
    Today, this story resembles the description of symptoms resulting
    from radioactive exposure. For several days, the locals went to the
    site. Many debris are cold. Those who dare to lift pieces evoke
    their incredible lightness, as well as their solidity comparable to
    that of brass. This type of material was unknown in the 1880s.
    However, the characteristics described correspond to those of many
    modern metals, such as aluminum alloys. The description of these
    properties is recurrent in reports on UFO wrecks.


-   **August:** The brig *Resolven*, departed from Labrador, is found in the middle of the Atlantic, all sails set, lights and kitchen fires lit, by the cruiser *Mallard*. It is completely deserted.
