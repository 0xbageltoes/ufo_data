- **May:** In Japan, balls of fire are constantly being observed above Kyoto and, one night, many samurai notice that a ball of fire similar to a red wheel is spinning and flying above the Nijo Castle. The next morning, the city is full of rumors and people are murmuring: This must be an omen. [\[Vallée 1969\]]{.source}
