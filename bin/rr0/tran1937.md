-   **July**: Nazi leaders (Hitler, Goering) begin to send special teams
    of their elite forces to collect all kinds of supernatural,
    scientific and religious objects related to the supernatural,
    occult and fringe sciences. During the search for Noah's Ark,
    along the borders of Turkey and Persia in the Ararat mountain
    range, the team is faced with a story by some of the oldest
    members of the village near the Tigris river. The story is that
    200 generations ago a strange bright house fell from the sky,
    making such a noise that it woke everyone in the village. Some
    time after, a man travelling from one village to another comes
    across the object, which he describes as having "sang", was
    warm to the touch, had a foul smell and seemed like the
    trading material used by the stone-hatted men. The story is
    reported back to the investigating team in Germany.


- A month later, two additional teams arrive. One is a group of scientists, arriving before the division of Hitler's special weapons machine. This group of men manages to find the "house", in fact an extraterrestrial vessel. The disc is 25 m in diameter, 8 m in height. It is solid without an apparent entrance, and surprisingly reactive to external forces, i.e. it seems to float a few meters above the ground, and requires a small effort to move it.

- **Summer**: In Czernica (East Germany, now part of Poland), a multicolored UFO in the shape of a ball or globe is seen falling into a field (or near a field) belonging to Eva Braun's parents (Hitler's future mistress). The area is cordoned off by SS troops from the town of Jelenia Gora (known as Hirschberg at the time). The crashed disc is taken to the SS base in Hirschberg and kept under very tight guard and extremely high security. It is 7.6 m in diameter and 3.8 m high, consisting of a large dome "covering" encircled by a thin outer ring, with a smaller flattened dome on top and a flat lower section. The top of the dome is also flat and large. The craft has 6 oval-shaped structures resembling openings but not transparent, or apparatus emitting some kind of light, located near the base of the upper dome. On the underside of the outer ring the craft has 12 lights. The color of the disc is a matte metallic gray. There is an insignia on the dome resembling the letter "T" with 2 vertical supports on its sides. The entrance to the disc is found on the top of the upper dome. The general shape of the disc resembles that of a German soldier's helmet with a slight bulge underneath. Inside the circular cabin are 3 small seats, and control panels around the dome, as well as 3 extraterrestrial beings: 1 is dead, and the other 2 alive. One of the extraterrestrials alive dies shortly after the crash. The 2nd remains under guard for about 1 and a half months and dies. The extraterrestrials were small dwarves, about 0.9 m to 1 m tall, with large hairless pear-shaped heads, slightly dystrophic-looking bodies, long thin hands with 4 fingers, grayish skin and large dark slanted eyes. The Germans fear moving the disc to a more distant location, for fear that it might explode during a long journey during transport. So a research laboratory is built nearby. From Hirschberg the disc is moved to a safer place which, more likely, is called "Der Riese", a Nazi complex in the nearby Gory Sowie mountains (now in southwestern Poland), which is also a site used to extract uranium ore. This complex has an extensive network of underground hangars, connected by tunnels. The bodies of the occupants and the living extraterrestrial are also moved to this complex. The extraterrestrial who lived for a month apparently provided some kind of information to the Germans and desperately asked for the help of the Nazi doctors, but they could not help him due to the different biological structure of his body. The extraterrestrial dies of an unknown illness. The origin of the crashed craft is apparently the double star RA known on Earth as 78 mu-1, Cygni, at 73.1 al away. Among the information given to the Germans by the surviving extraterrestrial is the fact that they have built underground bases in the polar region of the Canadian Territories, perhaps Baffin Island. This data is provided to Hitler himself. But no substantial technical data is actually provided by the extraterrestrial that could help the Nazi scientists to compete with extraterrestrial technology, despite their desperate attempt to obtain this data [Robert K Lesniakiewicz, Milos Jesensky *Wunderland, Extraterrestrial Technologies*, Anton Anfalov, Lenura A Azizova, Iryna V Volyk & Sergey V Kovalevskiy].
