-   **Saturday, August 15th, mid-day:** Peasants from the village of
    Robozero (in the county of Bolozero, Russia), among them Levka
    Pedorov, are in the church when they hear a loud noise in the sky.
    They leave the church to see what is happening, and see a flaming
    ball descending from the clear blue sky of the South. The object
    passes over the church and goes towards the nearby lake of
    Bieloziero. It measures 40 or 45 m in diameter, and 2 jets of
    "fire" come out of its front. After that the object leaves from the
    South towards the West (500 m from Pedorov), then "disappears". It
    reappears 1 hour later, above the same lake, which it flies over
    for 1 hour and 30 minutes. A fishing company on a boat on the lake
    1 mile from Pedorov is painfully burned by the light of the
    "ball", which is so bright that one can see the bottom of the lake
    at a depth of 8 or 9 m, which allows to see the fish moving away.
    The water seems covered in rust under the glow. [\[Testimony of

-   **November 30**: Another case, in many ways similar to that of August 15, still above Robozero. [\[Brief mentions in the Historical Archives of Saint Petersburg, found by the archaeological commission, part IV in 1842\]]{.source}
