-   **March:** A comet suddenly becomes visible and excites the public's curiosity to the highest degree. It can indeed be seen in broad daylight and very close to the Sun. What makes its tail so remarkable is its small size and uniform width. It is suspected of causing floods in the south of France and an earthquake in Guadeloupe.
