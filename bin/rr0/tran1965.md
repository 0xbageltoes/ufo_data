-   **January 11:** 6 engineers from the Army Signal Corps in the
    munitions building near the center of Washington see 6 UFOs in the
    shape of zigzagging discs heading towards the Capitol, pursued by 2
    delta-winged interceptor jets. The UFOs quickly outdistance the
    jets and disappear from view. Reporters from the print media try to
    find out more about the incident from the Department of Defense,
    but officials, both civilian and military, tell them that the chase
    never happened.

-   **18:15:** Industrial draftsman William Blackburn was cutting wood near the snow-covered field belonging to the Augusta club when he saw a pyramid - or cone-shaped object - descending from the sky towards the south. This UFO then remained stationary at an estimated altitude of 900 m. Blackburn estimated its diameter to be greater than 60 m. As he watched, a smaller UFO, about 18 m in diameter, landed 15 m away from him. Its surface was polished like a mirror. At the top was a bell that gave Blackburn a rather strange impression when he observed it. An opening appeared on the side of the UFO, as if someone had taken a piece of pie out of it, and 3 humanoid figures emerged floating: their feet never touched the ground. They approached within 11 m of Blackburn and emitted various unintelligible sounds. They were about 1 m tall but, apart from this detail, they looked like ordinary humans. Blackburn, petrified, did not answer them and the beings returned floating to their craft. Then the two UFOs quickly left. There were no traces in the snow. Shortly after Blackburn's story was published in the local newspaper, the *Waynesboro News-Virginian*, a car with federal license plates appeared in town: the inhabitants said it was visible as the nose on the face. Blackburn was apparently severely warned by government agents (belonging to an agency he did not want to cite) not to say anything more about his experience.

    to have been pulled out of the ground, uprooted. The case will be
    examined by A. Candusso and Larray Moyers, delegates of the *Flying
    Saucer Investigating Committee*, accompanied by Garry Davis. They
    find the strange circular configuration in Stavano's farm located
    on a ridge. At the center of the circle is a depression about 28
    inches in diameter. It is explored with a probe but only soft
    soil is found to a depth of 9 inches. A good part of the wheat
    has been moved, roots included, and clods of earth a few inches
    long have been scattered. The ears lie on the ground, in the form
    of a wheel spoke. Analysis of soil and wheat samples finds no
    evidence that could be caused by an explosion [\[Vallée 1969\]]{.source}.

-   On Deception Island (Antarctica), technicians from several bases observed for several hours a giant disk-shaped object flying over the island at high altitude with very variable speeds. Photographed, the object disturbed Earth's magnetic field measuring devices. In addition to the British troops stationed on the island and the personnel of the Chilean base Pedro Aguirre, technicians from the Argentine navy also reported the passage above their ship of a very large lenticular object. The government of the Argentine Republic will issue an official statement confirming in all points the observation reports made by its navy as well as those of two other powers belonging to different nationalities. Other observations were also made in June, and declassified documents attest that the [DIA](DIA.html) was aware.

-   **July 6, 9:30 PM:** In Kiel, Wisconsin, Miss E. R. Hayner observed a twinkling light, like a satellite, for 1 minute [\[case [Blue Book](BlueBook.html) #9474 unsolved\]]{.source}.

-   **July 7th:** A report from an Argentine detachment based in
    Antarctica relayed by an official statement from the Argentine
    Ministry of the Navy describes the gigantic UFO observed for
    several hours: It had the appearance of a solid material, red and
    green, iridescent from time to time with yellow, blue, white, and
    orange. The object moved silently eastward following a winding
    trajectory, but always without noise and at variable speeds. It
    often changed direction, heading sometimes westward, sometimes
    northward. In the afternoon of the same day, the same object was
    spotted by the South Orkney Islands base. It was moving northwest,
    at an angle of 30° relative to the horizon. It was at an approximate
    distance of 10 to 15 km. The Chilean Antarctic base also spotted
    the same object in the afternoon of the same day. On July 9th (?),
    an extremely important message arrived from the South Orkney
    Islands base. As a strange object flew over the base, 2
    variometers, which were functioning perfectly before the flight,
    recorded disturbances of the magnetic field on their tapes.

- At the Ogre Observatory (Latvia), astronomers Robert and Esmeralda Vitolniek and Yan Melderis saw a green, triangular UFO resembling a star. Examining the object more closely through the observatory's telescope, they realized that the UFO was composed of 3 green balls in a triangular formation around a larger central light. The central sphere was estimated to be 90 m in diameter and its altitude was estimated to be 100 (200?) km, but the observers were unable to provide an explanation for what they saw. The observation lasted about 30 minutes.

However, the shape of the object resembles that of a [Lockheed](LockheedMartin.html) SR-71A "Blackbird" aircraft, flying since December 22nd, 1964.

    Rigel and Capella. This explanation is later refuted by Robert
    Risser, director of the Oklahoma Scientific Foundation's planetarium,
    who states: We couldn't be further from the truth. Apparently, none
    of the mentioned stars were visible in the US at the time of the
    visions.

-   **1:30:** Nebraska trucker Don Tenopir is heading north to Abilene with a load of grain. An UFO descends from the sky above his truck and lands on the road in front of him. A car coming in the opposite direction swerves around the craft and stops with a screech of brakes. Tenopir slams on the brakes. His headlights go out, although his GMC Diesel semi-truck keeps rolling: the UFO moves and the truck's headlights come back on. Tenopir can now see the object: a disk (topped with a dome) about 4m in diameter, hovering a few meters off the ground. There are square windows on the top. Too scared to move from his cab, but the driver of the car gets out and approaches him. Before they can talk, the UFO shoots sparks from where it is and takes off with a loud noise. The two drivers flee. Tenopir reports the incident to the Abilene police, but neither the city, nor the state, nor the government nor the military authorities take any action. The case bears an interesting resemblance to the encounter that took place in Hampshire (England) in November 1967.

Major Struble of LAADS orders the conversations to be recorded. He involves NORAD and other air bases: Norton, Hamilton, George, and March. The major wants to send planes towards the objects but cannot do so until a captain from Edwards has approved the sending of the planes. This captain is the "UFO officer" responsible at the base.
