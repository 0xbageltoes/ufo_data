-   **On a clear morning**, coast guards stationed at the Canby (Oregon) lighthouse observe the maneuvers of the 26 m long schooner *J.-C. Cousins* heading West. Suddenly, it turns and heads straight for a sandbank, sails correctly trimmed. At the moment of impact against the sandbank, the masts violently oscillate. No silhouette jumps into the water. No distress signal is observed and no boat is launched. When boarding, the deck is deserted. The boats are still on their cradles and everything is in order. In the kitchen, the stove is still warm. The water in which potatoes had been put to boil has evaporated. Furthermore, a meal is served in the cabin, but nobody has touched it. In the crew quarters, the same order reigns and the last entry in the logbook --- dating from the dawn --- does not report anything particular.

- During the eruption of Perbuatan, on the island of Krakatau (Sunda Strait), 2 astronomers observed a signal emitted from 61 Cygni. Some suggested that extraterrestrial intelligences were trying to communicate with Earth. The explosion pulverized the island. The sound was heard as far as Australia, that is, more than 4000 km away, as if an explosion in New York had been heard from Paris. The gigantic volcanic dust cloud raised into the stratosphere made several laps around the globe in the following months, the first one in a dozen days. The effects of this dust created green suns. Spots in the sky were observed, green-gray, blood red, copper red or light copper... A tsunami, a 40 m high wave, swept the coasts of Java and Sumatra, engulfing 300 cities and drowning 36000 people.
