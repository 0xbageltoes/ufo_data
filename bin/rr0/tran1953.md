-   **May 20:** Fritz Wermer, working in Nevada as part of a team of scientists whose mission is to scientifically estimate the damage caused by a strictly confidential nuclear test, is called by the physicist leading the research group and is given the order to board a special flight to Phoenix. From there, he is taken into the desert on a large bus whose windows have been made opaque, along with 15 other passengers. All are given the order to keep silent during the journey.

-   **May 21st, evening:** The group arrives and is escorted to a canyon near Kingman (Arizona), where huge spotlights illuminate a large disc embedded in the sand. The vessel, about 9 m in diameter, appears to be made of aluminum and forms an acute angle with the ground. Following the impact, the object sank 50 cm into the ground. It is guarded by military patrols. Werner is tasked with calculating the impact speed of the object. Inside there are 2 swivel chairs in an ovoid cabin equipped with many instruments. A tent is set up nearby to shelter the remains of the sole occupant. Once his report is submitted, he is taken back in the bus with blackened windows, awaiting departure for Nevada. Just before getting on the bus, he manages to take a quick look inside a tent. That's when he sees a being measuring 1.20 m, whose skin has a brownish appearance, wearing a silver suit and a cap. Signing a declaration keeping him in secrecy, Werner does not believe for a single moment that it is a top-secret American fighter jet - as the army claims. He contacts [Ray Fowler](FowlerRaymondE.html) in the hope of clarifying this mysterious event. Unfortunately, he proves unable to help him. However, he will publish the declaration under Werner's seal in *Official UFO Magazine,* in April 1976. It will be 4 years later that another ufologist, named [Leonard Stringfield](StringfieldLeonardH.html), will be able to collect the testimony of a 2nd witness who seems to confirm in all points Werner's version. The witness, a former pilot of the National Guard, explains to [StringField](StringfieldLeonardH.html) who was, in the 1950s, stationed at the [Wright-Patterson](WrightPatterson.html) air base in Dayton (Ohio). It turns out that between 1948 and 1969, this base was jointly the headquarters of a UFO research project set up by the US government, as well as that of the [FTD](FTD.html). The [FTD](FTD.html) was tasked with training specialists in the study of enemy technology that fell into the hands of the Americans. Generally, these were Soviet MIG fighters that had crashed on American soil and were likely to provide information on enemy capabilities. But nothing says that this technology did not come from more exotic sources. According to the pilot, it was during the year 1953 that boxes containing debris recovered from the Arizona desert arrived at the [Wright-Patterson](WrightPatterson.html) base. Inside were the bodies of 3 strange beings --- measuring about 1.20 m tall, with incredibly large heads and skin like parchment. They had been packed in dry ice containers to preserve their tissues. Many other boxes followed, containing various pieces of wreckage. The pilot unfortunately did not have the opportunity to examine their contents, but he nevertheless remembered that some debris bore symbols similar to Sanskrit.

It was 6ft tall and perched on the branch of a pecan tree. Its halo of light slowly diminished and it disappeared. Immediately after, we heard a loud rustling noise above the houses on the other side of the street. And then there was a white torpedo-shaped flash.

-   **14-17 September:** Across the British Isles, many viewers saw on their television screens the logo and call sign of a Houston (Texas) transmitter: KLEE. Local transmitters were unable to quell the strong interference, which lasted 3 to 4 minutes each time. Upon investigation, this transmitter had been inactive for 3 years. A BBC spokesperson told reporters that in this case, we are faced with circumstances that contradict everything we know about television broadcasting. It is inconceivable that these signals could have traveled around the Earth from this transmitter which had last broadcast them 3 years prior. It is physically impossible that they were randomly reflected by some celestial body in our direction from such a great distance. This leaves only one possibility, however bizarre it may be, that these signals were sent back to us voluntarily by intelligent people of unknown origin and for reasons currently impossible to determine.
