-   **1:30:** A woman is driving on the highway in New York State, near Niagara Falls, in the middle of a snowstorm. She is going to see her son, who is in the army, and is driving very carefully, looking for an exit, as she fears the highway may be blocked further ahead. Visibility is extremely poor. She has no time to think when she suddenly discovers an object that looks like an airplane carcass in the middle of the road: A large shape was visible, and a thin, 15 m high rod, illuminated, which seemed to shorten and sink into the ground. My engine slowed down and, as I approached, my car stopped completely. I was panic-stricken and desperately tried to start it again as I had no lights. My first thought was to get out and see what was going on, when suddenly I saw two shapes standing next to the rod that was getting shorter and shorter. They were suspended but spinning around. It looked like animals with four legs and a tail, but with two antennas under the head, like arms. Before I had time to breathe, the things disappeared and the craft rose into the air; I then realized it was a UFO: it turned and zigzagged about 3 m above the ground, then rose again and I couldn't even see where it went. Suddenly my headlights came back on. I started the engine and everything was fine. I drove to the place, got out my flashlight, and walked to the scene itself. In a large hole about 30 cm wide, where the snow had melted, a little grass was visible. The grass was warm but no depression was observed.

-   **12:30:** A 28 year old French legionnaire on duty at the Bouah-Mama camp (Algeria, in the desert south of Constantine) heard a whistling sound coming from the sky. When he looked up, he saw a huge object, about 300 m in diameter, descending to about 45 m from him. The most remarkable thing about this object was not its size but the conical beam of an emerald green light coming from underneath and directed towards the ground. The legionnaire's memories of what followed are quite vague, and, as he himself admits, may not correspond to reality: instead of shooting to alert the others or taking the field telephone to call his superiors, the young man stayed there staring at the object for more than 45 minutes. Questioned by [Joël Mesnard](MesnardJoel.html), he declared that the pale green and emerald colors were the most beautiful, most soothing and most fascinating he had ever seen. The object left in the most classic way: first the whistling, then the elevation to an altitude of about 90 m and finally the ascent at a dizzying speed towards the northwest. The object gone, the man regained consciousness, and the happy, ecstatic feeling he had was replaced by sadness. It was as if time was passing very slowly... it was like being in another world he would later declare. He grabbed the phone and reported to his superiors what he had seen. At first, they thought it was a hallucination due to stress; however, a thorough investigation was carried out. The officers went to the scene, examined it minutely, without finding any physical evidence, re-interviewed the witness and, as he maintained that the event was real, they sent him to Paris for a more detailed examination. There, he stayed a week under observation at the Val-de-Grâce hospital. An electroencephalogram revealed nothing abnormal. The doctors concluded that he was in good mental and physical health and was not excessively suffering from the tension due to the war.

-   **October 26, 10:30 PM:** At Loch Raven (Maryland), 2 witnesses whose car had broken down observed a UFO for 1 to 2 minutes. The object emitted a powerful white light beam which caused a sensation of heat on their faces (they were burned to the 1st degree and hospitalized), then it left vertically in 5 to 10 seconds: Shortly after crossing the dam... the point rose, at 200 m or 250 m from there... So we saw, at this distance, what seemed to be a large oblong and flattened object suspended between 30 and 45 m above the superstructure of the bridge crossing the lake. We slowed down and then decided to get closer and examine the object... When we arrived at 25 m from the bridge, the car completely let us down. It seemed to come from the electrical circuits; the dashboard and headlights went out, the engine stopped. Mr. S., who was driving, tightened the brakes (the engine no longer running) and maneuvered the key 1 or 2 times. The mill remained silent; so then we really started to be afraid... We contemplated it... for maybe 30 to 45 seconds and then, although I'm not sure of the order of events, it seemed to emit a very bright white light beam, and both of us felt the heat on our face... At the same time, we heard a fairly loud noise, which I took for a muffled explosion... And then, very quickly... the object started to go up vertically. As far as we could judge, it did not change position (aspect) during its ascent. The only difference is that it was very bright and its edges became unclear so that, as it climbed, its shape was no longer distinguishable. It disappeared in 5 to 10 seconds. We were really scared... It took us maybe 1/4 hour to get back to a telephone booth [\[Poher 2003\]]{.source}.
