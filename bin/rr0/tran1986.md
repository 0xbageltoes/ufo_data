-   **9 PM:** Civil and military radars detect numerous UFOs in the vicinity of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro - 300 km further down the coast - as well as in the state of Goiás, in the center of Brazil. Pilots taking off or landing from airports in these places report having seen UFOs or having detected them on their on-board radar.


-   **10 PM:** Ospires Silva, president of the government-owned oil company Petrobas, is about to land his plane in Sao José dos Campos (Brazil) when he and his companion see orange-red lights chasing them. The lights stop and then reappear, each time in a new place.


-   **21 h 40 :** Silva gives up the pursuit.


-   **22:23:** 3 Northrop *F-5E Tiger* fighters take off from Santa Cruz Air Force Base, near Sao Paulo. One of them approaches within 20 km of an UFO that changes color, from white to green, and rushes towards the sea. Another *Tiger* also pursues an UFO that changes color, from red to white and from green to red, but loses speed due to lack of fuel before being able to approach it. Both UFOs are seen from the ground and picked up by the on-board radars.


-   **22 h 50 :** A Dassault *Mirage 3* fighter jet is surrounded by
    a dozen of invisible UFOs, except on radar, before they rise
    above the fighter jet at speeds that conventional aircrafts are
    unable to reach.


-   **August 12:** First launch of the Japanese rocket H1.

    
-  **October 25th, 9am**: On a clear day, Lago de Cote (Costa Rica) is peaceful and smooth like a mirror. Joaquin U. A., a 40 year old farm owner, and Ronaldo-Alerto L. A., a 23 year old farmer, then see from about 600 meters away a row of 3 or 4 cylinders, similar to posts rising less than 1 meter (3 feet) above the lake. They seem to be attached to a structure that remains submerged. See images/1986-10-25_LagoDeCote.jpg.

Approaching the lake with their tractor, they see another series of objects rising out of the water, still 3 feet high and 3 feet apart. They can clearly and leisurely observe the cylinders, dark in color (gray or brown coffee). After 5 or 10 minutes, the objects disappear together causing ripples and waves, always as if the emerging parts belonged to an invisible single structure.

2 weeks later, they give Carlos Vilchez a detailed account and hand him a drawing of the event.
