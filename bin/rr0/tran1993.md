-   **January 16:** Captain Adolfo Morales is piloting a Boeing 727
    above Tenerife when he and his crew see a UFO following them for
    22 minutes. Here is his account: It followed our movements,
    rising and falling with us. Then, without warning, it shot off to
    the right at an incredible speed and stopped above the city of
    Santa Cruz on the island of Tenerife. It covered this distance of
    about 160 km in less than a second and a half. It hovered for a
    moment, shining with a purple-red light, then began its descent.
    Finally, it disappeared behind the island. The UFO was seen by
    all the members of my crew, as well as by the stewardess who
    joined us in the cabin. An amazing experience.


-   **February 28, 9:30 PM**: Between Parmain and L'Isle-Adam (Val d'Oise), observation of 3 cabins in the shape of a triangle, with each having 2 projectors and 1 red light, for at least 2 hours at 200 m from the ground. [\[*Gazette du Val d'Oise,* July 16, 1997\]]{.source}


-   **March 2:** At Qujing (Yunnan, Southwest China) Pilots of a Chinese Air Force unit sight an orange-colored object, seemingly suspended at an altitude of 7000 m. Engaging pursuit, the aircrafts follow the phenomenon for about 15 s at a speed of 900 km/h, before it disappears.


-   **March 5th:** At the same place and time as 3 days prior, other crews from the same unit observed an object located at 6000 m altitude, which changed color, going from red-orange to white intermittently. Again, the chase is ordered and engaged for 8 minutes, after which the phenomenon makes a rotating movement, gaining speed to disappear towards the North.

-   **March 13:** A bright light hovers over Bispham (Great Britain), 26 km from the nearest airport. The object, filmed with a camcorder by Stephen Woolhouse, emits no sound or blinking. After research, it is confirmed that no identified craft had flown over the area that day. Frame-by-frame analysis of the film did not provide a rational explanation for the phenomenon.

- **March 31**

- In the middle of the night, last observations of the wave of "flying triangles" in the sky of Great Britain, by police officers on duty or military personnel on duty. The descriptions resemble the Belgian observations: 3 lights moving in perfect formation where, on the occasion of more precise testimonies, an immense triangular UFO illuminated at each of its angles. Many observers frequently report an additional characteristic: a low buzzing seems to emanate from the device.


- At Cosford (Shropshire) base, an entire guard platoon sees the UFO pass exactly above the base. Quickly, a verification of aircraft movements is requested from the air traffic controllers: no plane, both civil and military, to report in the concerned area.


- The weather officer at another [RAF](RAF.html) base located in Shawbury, just a few kilometers away from Cosford base, having heard that an UFO had been reported above the nearby base, stepped out of the building to see it for himself. To his astonishment, he then saw a triangular shaped craft heading directly towards the base, accompanied by a low humming sound. According to his estimation, the craft was almost the size of a Boeing 747. The craft projected a light beam towards the ground, sweeping the ground from right to left as if it was looking for something. Then the beam went off and the craft continued its route, flying over the base at a low altitude.


-   **1 h 10-2 h 40 :** Fishermen from the West and South of Wales observe above Bridgewater (Somerset) a "very large object in the shape of a catamaran" flying in their direction and passing silently over them at a height of about 240 m. They see 2 very bright white lights at the back and 2 orange lights in the middle.

-   **June 15th, during the day**: Many witnesses, located throughout Central Italy, report the observation of what could be likened to flying humanoids. One of the most spectacular observations is made from a helicopter, by a crew of 5 men, all belonging to the Pescara fire brigade. About 7 km from the airport, while at an altitude of 500 m (feet?), the men observe something that seems to be on a collision course with their aircraft. The object measures 1 m in diameter, with 2 legs and a trapezoidal antenna on what could resemble a head. Panicked, the pilot veers to the right to avoid the object and makes contact with the control tower. The controllers have nothing on the screen, but ask the helicopter to take the intruder in pursuit. The chase begins. After 3 minutes, the humanoid turns towards the aircraft which it seems to be looking at with its 2 large black eyes, then makes 2 complete turns around the helicopter before diving towards the ground and disappearing [\[London UFO Studies, Skylink \# 6 and 7 Type: E \< HC addition \# 1706\].]{.source}

Do not approach; it might be radioactive, says the message. In fact, this information is broadcasted by the local police in order to trap a group of radio pirates who were illegally tuning in to its frequency. Unwanted listeners are arrested when they arrive at the alleged landing field.
