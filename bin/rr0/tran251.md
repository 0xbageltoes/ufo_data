- Under the consuls P. Posthumius Tubertus 2 and Agrippa Monenius Lanatus, in the year 251 of Rome, in the thickest of the night, lances of fire were seen in the sky. [\[Julius Obsequiens \< Costaglioga 1998\]]{.source}

-   Sometimes a star shoots out of the sky, or else they are fires,
    sometimes stationary and still, sometimes rolling through space.
    We observe various kinds: we have wheels, when a luminous edge
    surrounds a vast depression in the sky, similar to a deep and
    circular cavity... When an enormous mass of rounded fire moves
    through the sky or burns in place; chiasmas when a corner of the
    sky opens up and through this sort of crevice reveals a flame in
    the mysterious space. [\[Julius Obsequiens \< Costaglioga 1998\]]{.source}

-   There are those brilliant [meteors](Meteore.html) that suddenly depart like shooting stars, others remain in place emitting such a bright light that they dispel the darkness and bring back the day until, having consumed what fed them, they become less bright and like a diminishing flame gradually fading away. They often appear in the clouds, better seen above them. [\[Julius Obsequiens \< Costaglioga 1998\]]{.source}
