- **April 14th, 3 PM:** In Vins-sur-Caramy (Var), Ms. Garçin and Rami observe an object in the shape of a top, hemispherical on top, conical underneath, 1.5 m tall and 1 m in diameter, slowly flying at 2 or 3 m above the ground, over the intersection of the departmental road 24 and the road to Vins. The lower cone is formed of a bundle of luminous, multicolored and parallel tigelles, agitated by a rapid movement, and the noise comes from one of the two road signs at the intersection, which is also vibrating violently, as if there was a resonance between the movement of the tigelles and that of the sign. Frightened, the two women scream and attract the attention of a third person. At the same time, the object, which has descended to the ground level, makes a kind of jump and flies over a second road sign which also starts to vibrate, producing the same metallic noise. Continuing its flight, but in silence, the craft travels about 200 m, approaches the ground, perhaps touching it, stops for a few seconds, makes a second jump, accelerates and disappears towards the Southeast at a moderate speed, raising a whirlwind of dust. It is then noticed that the two signs are abnormally magnetized: compass needle deviated by 15° at 5 cm of distance, while, under the same conditions, a third sign, further away, does not produce any deviation. It is also noticed that a canal irrigation valve located near the second point of approach to the ground is also magnetized. The grass is scorched and trampled at the landing site.

-   A cloud layer is the cause of the disappearance of an aircraft over the region between Venice and Padua: The pilot requests to descend from 11000 feet to 5000 feet. Permission is granted. Not only will the pilot not send any more calls, but no trace of it will be found.


-   The Russian launcher model R7 is ready.

-   **Wednesday, July 17:** At dawn, an [RB-47H](appareils.html#RB47) *Stratojet* electronic reconnaissance bomber of the [USAF](USAF.html), call sign Lacy 17, was heading to Oklahoma City, with 8 officers on board, including Commander Mac Clure and Major Chase, the pilot. At 10,500 m it was followed by a big and intense white/bluish light: An [Air Force](USAF.html) RB-47, equipped with electronic countermeasures (ECM) apparatus, with a crew of 6 officers, was followed by an unidentified object for more than 1200 km for 1 hour and 30 minutes, while it flew over Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and reached Oklahoma. The object was several times seen directly by the cockpit crew as a very bright light; it was tracked by ground radar and detected by the ECM equipment carried by the plane. The particular interest of this case lies in the simultaneous appearances and disappearances observed by 3 distinct channels and in the speed of the maneuvers that exceeded anything the crew had experienced before [\[review *Astronautics and Aeronautics*\]]{.source}. The object thus disappeared from the radar screens several times in a row, to reappear simultaneously following the plane almost all the time at a distance of about 17 km, before quickly changing position to be in front of the plane. Chase momentarily forgot his mission and headed towards the mysterious light that disappeared as he approached. Chase resumed his initial course but the "target" reappeared under the Stratojet. The plane dived again towards the UFO which disappeared once again. Out of fuel, the Boeing had to return to its Forbes base. The [Condon Commission](BlueBook.html#Condon) was seized of this case 10 years later, but classified the case for lack of access to the file [\[report [COMETA](COMETA.html)\]]{.source} [\[J. P. Petit\]]{.source}.
