-   **July 24:** In the Mesopotamian desert, the plane of Lieutenant Pilot W. T. Day and Officer Pilot D. R. Stewart is found in perfect working condition. The tracks of the two men lead away from the aircraft for a distance of 36 m, where they abruptly cease. The search will continue for 4 days without result.


-   **Between 21st and 23rd August:** For 9 hours, an experiment occupied all the transmitter-receiver posts in the United States. The goal was to record any form of cosmic message proving that extraterrestrial life is not a myth. On that day, Mars was closest to Earth (this proximity will be repeated in the year 2000), and both the [US Army](USArmy.html) and the [US Navy](USNavy.html) agreed to have their transmission services be silent for 5 minutes at the beginning of each hour. A radiocamera used by Dr. David Todd, professor of astronomy at Amherst College, on behalf of the Navy, recorded strange groups of signals that were also picked up in Europe. The *New York Times* reported that the film had shown, in black and white, on the one hand a continuous alignment of signals, and on the other hand, at regular intervals, signals presenting in groups - and curiously scrambled - shapes resembling human faces cruelly emaciated.
