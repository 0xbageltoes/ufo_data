-   **November 12th, 0:00:** At Cap Race (Atlantic Ocean), several
    passengers of the *Siberian* ship observed a huge sphere of fire
    coming out of the ocean. It reached an altitude of 16 m, flew
    against the wind, and approached the boat. The observation lasted
    5 minutes, before it disappeared towards the South-East. [\[BSAF,
