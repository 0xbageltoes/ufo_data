-   **Wednesday 5 February:** Here was a great sign in the sky (\...).
    Two great columns of fire were revealed, one in the East, the other
    in the West, and as they moved they formed the letter A.
    They united after that and turned into a rainbow,
    emitting a strong light for three hours, before their
    disappearance. [\[Biblioteca Academiei, *manuscris slavon* 706, f.1.\]]{.source}
