-   **April:** Lucia, 8 years old, is saying her rosary near Fatima when she sees a white, translucent cloud and a human form. This will happen again a second time, then a third in October.


-   **Summer:** At Sulitjelma (Norway), a dark bell-shaped object descended from the western sky and landed. 2 humanoids appeared from behind the hill where the object had landed. They walked towards a road, then turned around, and came towards the witness. One of the humanoids stopped and smiled at the witness, Bjarne Westvand. The humanoid was as tall as the witness, who was 6 years old, that is, 1 m tall. He had long dark wavy hair. The skin was grey, and its head was large in comparison to its body. They were dressed in dark brown/dark suits. The humanoids went behind the hill, and shortly afterwards, the bell-shaped object rose and quickly disappeared into the sky [\[RAPPORTNYTT, 4/1981, 3\]]{.source}.


-   **Tuesday, July 13th, 12:30 PM:** At Østre Slidre (Norway), 4 female visitors leave the Fredheim hotel heading North on the main road, and arrive at the Valsted farm when they suddenly hear the loud sound of an engine, thinking a car is approaching. They move away from the road expecting the car to arrive, but are surprised to not see a car; in fact the two women who are a bit ahead of the others see an airplane flying towards them from the North. An officer's wife, who sees the machine, is certain she is not mistaken and that it was an airplane, having seen many airplanes in flight before. However, as the women observe the machine for a short moment the engine stops and the machine falls like lightning in an inclined trajectory, pointing towards Volhufjorden. She sees all this very clearly, and her impression is that the machine and the aviator are about to be destroyed. The sheriff of Østre Slidre is immediately notified of the event and with 4 other people conducts an investigation at Skogene outside Rognagårdene directly in the fjord, without discovering any element. Men are posted on both sides of the fjord while all of Volbufjorden is searched in all directions. In an interview, the sheriff of Østre Slidre indicates that no trace of the mysterious airplane could be found (once again the officer's wife is questioned), although she was certain that what she saw was an airplane, and she seemed totally sincere.

-   **Friday, August 20th, evening:** At Christianiafjord (Norway), 20 minutes before 10 - when the violent storm arrived over the fjord and Østlandet, a man stood in front of the window of his house and looked towards the Southeast above the fjord. Suddenly he saw a dark object appear in front of the illuminated horizon, far ahead in the direction of Rauer. What he initially thought to be a small dark cloud moved in the sky with an unusual speed for a cloud, convincing him that it must be something else. He took his telescope (binoculars) and went outside into his garden. He turned in the direction where he thought the dark object was and - sure enough - the most beautiful of Zeppelins (in full power) floated above Christianiafjord. As he stayed to observe it with the telescope he managed to see a bright light emitted from the center of the large body; it shone intensely for about 1 minute and then it left. Right after he could see the vessel turn and float away to the South and soon disappear into the darkness.

-   **August 21:** Dardanelles Expedition: Allied troops fight the Turks in the Gallipoli peninsula. Sapper Reichart, belonging to the 3rd section of the 1st New Zealand Engineer Company, from Matada (Bay of Plenty district), observed along with 2 other witnesses an unexplained phenomenon to this day.


-   **October:** Lucia observes a phenomenon similar to [that of April](#15-04).

-   **Autumn** (or 1914): In the village of Bujoreanca (Romania), a
    teacher was eating with his family in the garden when everyone's
    attention was drawn to an object of a reddish glow that appeared
    when it started to get dark. The object was the size of a soccer
    ball or a man's head with a protruding neck, like an exhaust pipe.
    It was 20 or 25 m in the air and seemed to move easily, making the
    acacias and oaks lean due to the wind it created. It left behind a
    trail of 8 or 10 m long glowing sparks and reappeared again 6 or 7
    days later in front of all the villagers. The object made a
    whistling sound and appeared "out of nowhere" above a particular
    house 800 m away from where the witness lived, and suddenly
    disappeared above another residence. Once, it stayed stationary
    above one of the houses where the body of a woman was found,
    apparently covered in burns [\[D. S. Ionescu\]]{.source}.

-   **One evening around 11 pm:** In Bergen (Norway), Henr. Angel Hansen
    saw a large, bright object twice, as big as the Moon, towards the
    North. It did not move for 30 s, then descended a bit, pausing again
    for about 15 seconds. The same action was repeated 2-3 times.
    Finally it accelerated and moved away to disappear in the horizon
    towards the West. The color of the object was brown-red and the
    weather was clear [\[UFO-NYT, 3/1972, 118\]]{.source}.
