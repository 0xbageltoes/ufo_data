-   Raimundo, the son of Rivalino da Silva, is awoken by footsteps and sees a strange shadow in the room. It is small and of non-human shape. Voices are heard, saying: This one looks like Rivalino and afterwards that they were going to kill him. The family stays alert all night.


- Raimundo da Silva testified to the police that, while he was working in a field, he saw two stationary spherical objects 2 meters above the ground, a few meters from the house. One was black with a protrusion resembling an antenna and a small rudder; the other was black and white. Both emitted a humming sound and a flashing light through an opening. The boy's father warned him to stay away as Rivalino advanced towards the objects, praying. As he was only 2 meters away, the two spheres merged into one, raising dust from the ground and spreading a yellow mist that enveloped the man. The boy ran after his father, noting that the cloud had a pungent smell. As it dissolved, everything had disappeared. The police investigation, led by Lieutenant Lisboa, revealed no clues. Many people in the area were terrified.

-   **August 24, 7am:** In an isolated farm in Duas Pantas (Brazil), a 9 year old child exits his house and discovers two balls with a diameter of 40 cm on the ground, facing the door he just crossed. He immediately calls his father who also sees the balls and approaches them closely. At that moment, a violent whirlwind of air is triggered and raises a cloud of dust. The child can no longer distinguish his father in this turmoil, then the whirlwind calms down while rising. His father has disappeared forever. The investigators are unable to find his trace and this event intrigues the authorities so much that the child is immediately put under psychiatric observation: they want to know the reasons why he invented this story.

- The satellite *Transit 4-B* stopped transmitting for 6 months, then started up again on its own.

-   **August 27:** Launch of *Mariner* 2 to [Venus](Venus.html).
In its No. 1, the Soviet magazine *Simena* publishes an article where one can read, among other things, that the skull of a man 40,000 years old was discovered in Broken Hill (now Kabwe) at a little more than 50 km from Lusaka, the capital of the current Zambia. Strangely, this skull would be pierced with a neat hole, without radial cracks, which would suggest the impact of a bullet. The same type of impact appears on a prehistoric bison skull dating from around 8000 to 10000 BC, which this time is preserved by the Paleontology Museum of Moscow. This fossil would have been found west of the Lena, a river that crosses the Autonomous Republic of Yakutia, famous for the countless mammoth tusks found buried in its frozen soil most of the year. You can see a photograph of this skull in Erich von Däniken's *Gods from Outer Space*. The latter, as well as Soviet scientists such as K. Flerov, claim that this hole is indeed from that time because its edges have been re-calcified, proof that the animal would have survived its injury. As the photograph is taken from far enough away to encompass the entire bison skull, it is impossible to detect this re-calcification. But one can indeed see a neat round hole at the forehead level."
