-   **December 24th, 11 PM:** Not far from the small town of South Bend (Indiana), Tom Lerch, his family and his neighbors' friends were gathered in the big farm kitchen for the Christmas Eve vigil. Mrs. Lerch asked her 11-year-old son Oliver to go to the well to get some water, and handed him an empty bucket. Oliver put on a scarf, as it was freezing outside. Less than 10 seconds later, after he had closed the door behind him, Oliver screamed outside, calling for help, freezing everyone. Everyone immediately thought a wolf had appeared. Once outside, there was no wolf nor little boy. They were all frozen in horror when they heard the desperate screams of little Oliver, somewhere in the night, but above their heads. The child was invisible in the black sky. Oliver shouted Help! They're holding me! Help! The screams and calls continued to tear the air for about 1 minute, but decreasing in intensity, as if the child was going up, up\... Stupefied, the audience only reacted when the pastor decided to follow the little one's tracks. In the fresh snow, the tracks were normal and showed that the child had headed towards the well. But, about 20 m from the house and 10 m from the well, the tracks suddenly stopped, as if the child had been lifted off the ground. The bucket was found 2 m further. The investigation led to nothing.
