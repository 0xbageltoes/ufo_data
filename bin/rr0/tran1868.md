-   **June 6:** At the Radcliffe Observatory (Oxford), an object of light was observed moving in the sky, stopping, changing its course to the west, then to the south. [\[Trouvelet\]]{.source}


-   **July:** At Atacamena in the Copiago zone (Chile), a strange
    aerial construction pointing lights and producing engine sounds
    flew low over the city. The local population also described it
    as a giant bird covered in large scales producing a metallic
    noise. Although it did not land, this object is the first case
    of close observation of an unknown object at low altitude in
    the 19th century. [\[Fort 638\]]{.source} [\[Anatomy 11\]]{.source}
