- The physicist Konstantine Tsiolkovski, one of the founders of Russian cosmonautics, in his work *Volonté de l'Univers, Forces intelligentes inconnues*, is convinced that evolved beings from the Universe can move from one planet to another to intervene. Throughout his life, Tsiolkovski will seek the means to make interplanetary trips. His ideas will often be invoked by Soviet scientists when they begin to see in the sky unknown objects of which they denied the existence.
