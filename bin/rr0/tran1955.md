-   **January 11**: In France, the Official Journal responds to the question of Deputy Jean Nochet of [October 7, 1954](1954.html#10_07): 1° Instructions have indeed been given to the air force formations to pay more attention to "unidentified aerial objects" and to systematically report the phenomena observed. The exploitation of these reports and verifiable information of all origins is ensured by the "air" armed forces general staff ([Scientific Bureau](BSAA.html)) where personnel has been designated for this purpose; 2° observation at close range of these phenomena with the extraordinary qualities of speed, ceiling and maneuverability that it requires, has never given any result when it has been attempted. It is however authorized when it does not involve any risk for the material and personnel. But efforts will be made to photograph and especially to cinematograph the phenomena, which, until today, has not been done with the desired clarity and authenticity [ \[Official Journal of Thursday January 27, 1955 \< Velasco 2004\]]{.source}.

-   **March 9, 5:30 PM:** Near St. Louis (USA), a woman observed: I was watching a jet plane flying in my direction when, suddenly, without warning, a strange craft came up behind it and instantly made it disappear from my sight. This craft had an opening in the field of my view and near the plane. After it had "absorbed" it, it stopped and its "door" closed. Then, it went up and down for about 30 seconds, and finally disappeared quickly. While it was going up and down, I could see steam or smoke coming out of what looked like round doors or windows at the top of the craft. This craft had the shape of an ordinary bell and was wide enough to carry several planes of the type it had captured. All this happened, so to speak, near me, and I could perfectly see the plane and the craft. The plane was a light bomber fighter, and it was reported missing by St. Louis radio. It was never found. Some time later, a similar craft pursued 3 jet planes. These strange crafts are, without a doubt, the fastest objects I have ever seen. I timed the speed of the planes when the craft was pursuing them: it covered in a few seconds the same distance that the "Jets" did in 3 minutes.

- The [ATIC](ATIC.html) publishes Special Report No. 14 of the [Blue Book](BlueBook.html) project. This is a computerized study of nearly 4000 UFO sighting reports received by the [ATIC](ATIC.html). This study, consisting largely of statistical tables, concludes that there is no evidence that extraterrestrial craft have visited the earth and that with more information all observations could be explained. This report also includes summaries of the best unexplained cases received. To help alleviate criticism of a "cover-up" by the USAF of its UFO discoveries, the USAF Secretary decides to place this report in the public domain and authorizes the Department of Commerce to sell copies to the public.

-   **August 20, 10:45 PM:** One of the witnesses was on a dock in Ontario (Canada). A night watchman pointed out an unusual apparition to him: Its shape resembled two saucers placed one on top of the other, side by side\... the whole object was of a beautiful silver-white color and it seemed to be radiating, like a lighthouse in a foggy night. The device performed a series of maneuvers about 100 m away from the men: It seemed to be throwing sparks as if all its surfaces were radiating an electric current or overheated air\... After a first stop, the machine seemed to slide laterally for about 15 m, then stopped again. Its speed did not exceed 6 to 7 km/h. After 1 or 2 minutes, it accelerated so violently that it disappeared in 3 s, like a star would diminish. It left in the direction it had come from, from the west. It was climbing at an angle of about 40°. I reported this observation to the Canadian government\... It was silver-white in color\... I cannot better describe this hue, I have never seen anything like it\... It was luminous, but without glare, rather like a fluorescent glow\... It kept sparkling, like the lights of a diamond. It was a beautiful luminous thing\...

-   **August 20, 10:45 PM**: In Kenora (Ontario), two distant witnesses
    (1 pilot president of a seaplane company and 1 night watchman)
    observe for 4 minutes a small disc. The luminous object descends,
    skirts the clouds, makes various inclinations, stops at low altitude
    above a lake, throws sparks, then suddenly accelerates and
    disappears into the sky. Extract from the pilot's account: Coming
    from the West, it was heading towards us. It was in the shape of a
    saucer. It turned and dove to skirt a low cloud. It did not venture
    into the low drifting clouds in the sky but remained in the clear
    areas. When it arrived about 180 m from us, it inclined on its side
    and then returned to its initial position, parallel to the ground...
    it stopped about a dozen m above the lake, and about 75 m from us.
    We detected neither noise nor smell. The thing seemed to me at most
    1.20 to 1.50 m wide with a thickness of 20 to 25 cm. It was silver
    white in color. I cannot better describe this shade, I have never
    seen one like it... It seemed to throw sparks as if all its surfaces
    were radiating an electric flux or overheated air... After a first
    stop, the machine seemed to slide laterally for about fifteen m,
    then stopped again. Its speed did not exceed 6 to 7 km/h. After 1 to
    2 minutes, it accelerated so violently that it disappeared in 3 s,
    like a star that would diminish. It left in the direction from
    which it had come, from the West. It was climbing at an angle of
    about 40°. I reported this observation to the Canadian government

-   **October 4, 7:10 PM**: In Russia, 3 US officials (Senator Richard Russell, Lieutenant Colonel E. U. Hathaway and Ruben Efron, Commission Counsel) travelling by train between Atjaty and Adzhijabul (Trans-Caucasian region) see 2 unconventional round objects resembling discs or flying saucers taking off almost vertically at one-minute intervals. The disc-shaped object rises near dusk with its outer surface rotating slowly to the right and with 2 stationary lights at the top of its central part. Sparks and flames are seen emitted by the object. No openings are seen on the object as it passes over the witnesses' train. The 2 flying discs rise relatively slowly up to 6000 feet, then suddenly increase their speed in horizontal flight towards the North. The disc's altitude remained the same during the ascent (?) as in cruise, as a disc launched in flight. Two searchlights pointed almost vertically are seen near the takeoff zone about 1-2 miles (16-32 km (?)) south of the railway. After their observation the Soviet railwaymen are very excited and close the curtains and forbid looking out the windows. The US observers are convinced that these unconventional objects are authentic discs or flying saucers [\[Timothy Good, _Above Top Secret_, page 227\]]{.source}.
