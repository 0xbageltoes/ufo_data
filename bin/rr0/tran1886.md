-   **October 24th:** To the editors of *Scientific American*. The brief report that follows, concerning a recent and strange meteorological phenomenon, may interest your readers as a new example to add to the list of electrical eccentricities. During the night of October 24th last, marked by rain and even a storm, a family of 9 people sleeping in a cabin a few kilometers from Maracaibo was awakened by a dull buzzing and a dazzling light that brightly illuminated the inside of the house. Completely terrified and believing --- as they said --- that the end of the world had come, its occupants threw themselves to their knees to pray, but their devotion was almost immediately interrupted by violent nausea, while swellings spread over the upper parts of their body, mainly the face and lips. It should be noted that the bright light was not accompanied by any sensation of heat, although the air was apparently charged with smoke with a particular smell. The next morning, the swellings had decreased, leaving large blackish patches on the face and body. <br/><br/>No particular pain was felt, until the 9th day when, the skin beginning to peel, the pustules transformed into painful raw wounds. Hair fell out on the side that
    had been directly exposed to the phenomenon, the body being most
    affected on that side. What is remarkable about this phenomenon is
    that the house was absolutely intact, all doors and windows being
    closed at the time of the facts. No trace of lightning was observed
    in the rest of the dwelling and all the victims declare that there
    was no detonation, but only this already mentioned low buzzing.
    Another strange circumstance is that the trees around the house
    showed no particular sign before the 9th day, the date on which they
    withered quickly, almost all, while the wounds appeared on the
    occupants of the house. There may be a coincidence there, but it is
    still surprising to observe that animal and vegetable organisms
    react in the same way, and in the same time frame, to electrical
    effects. <br/><br/>I went to visit the victims in one of the hospitals of this
    city; although their appearance is really horrible, it is to be
    hoped that these wounds will not be fatal to them. Signed: Walter
    Cogwill, Consulate of the United States, Maracaibo, Venezuela,

    strong radiation and is closer to the effects of nuclear power than
    to the "mysteries" of electricity. [\[Letter from the American Consul in Maracaibo - Venezuela - published in *Scientific American* of December 18th, 1886\]]{.source}

-   **November 3, from 8-9 PM:** In Hamar, Norway, it is pitch black when suddenly a bright white cloud appears in the sky, moving towards the Northeast and occasionally emitting bright beams of light in various directions. During the observation the cloud always maintains its original shape, then disappears into the darkness.
