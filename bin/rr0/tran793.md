-   **January:** At the monastery of St Cuthbert (Lindisfarne), the monks witnessed remarkable phenomena: terrible portents appeared in Northumbria, greatly afflicting its inhabitants. These were exceptional lightning bolts [*sky-bourne portents*], and fire dragons seen flying in the air and Fire dragons in the sky terrified the unfortunate nation of the English. Shortly after the observation, the monastery was attacked and razed by invading Vikings. The dragons observed were seen as an ill omen.
