-   **December 24, 7:30pm to 9:00pm:** Just before Christmas. In Bergen (Norway), the priest Absalon Pederssøn Beyer, with Christern Ulff and a goldsmith, as well as their respective wives and servants, observe a round, unnatural black "cloud" pass in front of the [Moon](Moon.html) and cover it. A jet of smoke and fire is then emitted from the black "cloud", and all hear a whistling. The "cloud" then moves from back to front, and then disappears.
