-   **January 31, 8:45 PM:** Near Rochford (England), Air Force Sub-Lieutenant J. E. Morgan, flying at 1500 m altitude, sees a row of lights similar to the lit windows (curtains drawn) of a train. Believing he is dealing with a German Zeppelin, he draws his Webley Scott pistol and fires. The light rises and quickly disappears.


-   **January 13:** At Dyfjord (Norway), a man sees 6 lights, one green, one red and 4 white, and thinks he sees the silhouette of the craft. After a while the 4 white lights go out and a beam like a searchlight is directed downwards. The supposed aircraft emerges in the South-South-West, then moves to the East and finally disappears to the South-East. The observation is made by many credible witnesses, including the entire rescue team based in Dyfjord, and none of them have any doubt of having seen what was a gigantic aircraft [\[Finnmarksposten, January 1916\] \[Morgenbladet, 15 January 1916, 2\] \[Bullard: The airship file - Supplement I, 1983, 41\]]{.source}.


-   **January 19:** At Rolvær (Norway), Captain Bergfjord of the steamship *Ofoten*, as he arrived in Ofotenfjord, saw a Zeppelin above Rolvær at about 500 m high [\[MORGENBLADET, January 19, 1916, 2\] \[Bullard: The Airship File - Supplement I., 1983, 41\]]{.source}.


-   **March 15th, 11pm:** At Vesterålen (Norway), an aircraft was clearly seen above Vesterålen. It arrived at high speed from the sea, first made a complete circle, then was above the Børøy area, and finally Stokmarknes. During the arrival and return flights a nearly steady light changed from red, blue and white. This looked more like a signal. Many people were able to clearly observe the night visitor in the light of the Moon [\[NY TID, March 1916\] \[Morgenbladet, 24 Mar 1916, 4\] \[Bullard: The airship file - Supplement I, 1983, 41\]]{.source}.


-   **Spring:** Lucia is with two of her cousins when the rain starts
    to fall. The children take refuge in a small cave. After lunch,
    the rain having stopped, they start to play at the entrance of the
    cave. Suddenly, they hear the roar of a powerful wind and see a
    white light hovering in the valley above the treetops. In this
    light is a young man of remarkable beauty who approaches them and
    says: "I am the angel of peace". He teaches them a prayer and
    disappears. The three little ones remain in a trance; they keep
    mechanically repeating the prayer until they literally fall from
    exhaustion.

-   **April 4:** At Jæren (Norway), two dockers and a police officer
    saw a light in the air from the quay towards the West above
    Jæren, probably a Zeppelin. The light disappeared to the West [\[Morgenbladet, April 5, 1916, 4\] \[Bullard: The airship file - Supplement I., 1983, 41\]]{.source}.


-   **April 16:** In Stavanger (Norway), students of Stavanger Folkeskole, aged between 9 and 11, see a black cloud appear in the sky. There is a red light behind it. The observation takes a religious turn when they see an angel with a cross. Later a message appears in the sky [\[Stavanger Aftenblad, April 1916, March 1917, March 1918, December 19 1942, April 1943\] \[Hiorth: Lebesbymannen, 193-?, 45-8\] \[Omvend Dere for Jesus Kommer Snart, 198-?\] \[UFO, 1/1989, 22-3\]]{.source}.

-   **April 20, 2:00:** Off Stafjorden to the West of Svanøen (Norway), the steamboat *Fjalir* of the Nordre Bergenhus company was passed by a Zeppelin. It was lit up and the buzzing of the engines was clearly heard. It disappeared to the North [\[Morgenbladet, 23 Apr 1916, 4\] \[Bullard: The airship file - Supplement I., 1983, 41\]]{.source}.


-   **Saturday 24th June, 11pm:** In Bergen (Norway), an airplane is observed above Ulrikken. It is a biplane, observed by many people. It flies at such an altitude that it can only be observed with a telescope. It seems to have come from the sea [\[BERGENS AFTENBLAD, Jun 1916\] \[MORGENBLADET, 27 Jun 1916, 2\] \[Bullard: The airship file - Supplement I., 1983, 42\]]{.source}.


-   **Summer:** On a hot day, the angel reappears and asks: "What are you doing? Pray! Pray a lot! Offer prayers and sacrifices constantly. How can we make sacrifices? asks Lucia. Sacrifice all that you can... Above all, accept and patiently endure the sufferings that the Lord will send you. He leaves the children completely paralyzed. It is only at nightfall that they regain their senses and start playing again. Here again, as in the previous case, the witnesses did not want to talk about what they had seen, not even among themselves. The next day, they still could not understand their reactions to the apparition: I don't know what's happening to me, said one of the little girls. I can neither speak, nor play, nor sing, and I have no strength to do anything.


-   **Autumn:** "The Angel" appears once again, at the Cave of Cabesco. He gives the children communion.
