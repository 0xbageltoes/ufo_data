-   **November 2, at dawn:** In Scutari (Turkey), a luminous object
    circles around the port, at an altitude of 5 or 6 m. It illuminates
    the entire city for 1 h 30, like a blue-green flame, then plunges
    into the sea. It made several circles above the ferry-boat
    dock. [\[LDLN 48\]]{.source} [\[Anatomy 14\]]{.source}
