-   **0 h :** One evening, near the banks of the Egray river, a group of women who had been chatting outside were returning to the village. They had just crossed a bridge when they heard a terrible noise and saw something that froze them with terror. An object, which they would describe, not finding a better expression, like a cart with creaking wheels, climbed the hill with astonishing speed. The terrified women huddled together at the sight of the apparition. One of them, although scared to death, made the sign of the cross. The strange cart leapt over the vineyard and disappeared into the night. The women hurried home and told the story to their husbands, who decided to investigate. They went to the scene... as soon as the sun rose. There was nothing to see anymore.


- On the coast of Durham (England), one can see quite low glows above the ground. Ships, confusing these glows with lighthouses or beacons, run aground one after the other, so much so that the fishermen are accused. One of the witnesses finally describes these glows as considerably high above the ground, but without anyone finding their account.


- Farmers and fishermen living in a village of Easron Beach, near Newport (Rhode Island), spot a ship, the *Seabird*, heading straight for the coast. The sails are unfurled and the flags are flapping in the wind. The ship is heading towards a sandbank. It glides ashore without damage in front of the crowd that has gathered. Several people board the ship, but there is no one alive. Yet, the coffee is boiling in the stove and breakfast for the crew is ready. The logbooks are up to date and the navigation instruments remain in perfect condition. Only a small dog is quietly sitting on the deck. Not only is everything in order, but the smell of tobacco still lingers in the crew quarters. No bodies were washed ashore in the weeks that followed.
