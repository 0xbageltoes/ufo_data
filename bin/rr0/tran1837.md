-   **29/30 August**, above Tîrgu-Neamt and Dorohoi: During this night a meteor was seen, or a physical phenomenon. It was a sphere, lit up, long of about 12 hands and wide (close to 3 m). It descended in the twilight and the whole field shone with a powerful and luminous light. [\[*Albina Românesca*, 2 September\]]{.source}

- **September**:

- Jack "Spring Heeled Jack". See images/SpringHeeledJack_2.jpg.

-   **Later that night**: In London (England), Jack attacked a group of 3 women and 1 man. All managed to escape except Polly Adams. Jack ripped off the top of her corset, seized her breasts, and began to scratch her stomach, tearing her dress at the waist as if with iron-plated fingers. The attack left Adams unconscious, discovered later by a policeman. The victims would later describe Jack as able to spit blue flames: The intruder was tall, thin and strong. He had a prominent nose, bony fingers, extremely powerful, resembling claws. He was incredibly agile. He wore a long flowing cape, like those worn by people going to the opera, soldiers and wandering actors. On his head he had a high helmet, appearing to be made of metal. Under the cape, a tight-fitting suit of a shiny material like oilcloth or metal mesh. He had a lamp attached to his chest. The strangest of all: the creature's ears were short and pointed like an animal's. [[[Vallée](ValleeJacques.html) 1988]]{.source}

- **October**:

- In London (England), Mary Stevens, a servant, is returning to her employers' house on Lavender Hill. As she crosses Cut Throat Lane in Clapham Common, a figure leaps out of an alley, tightly embracing her, kissing her face and beginning to put his hands in her corset. Stevens screams, causing the figure to flee. Men from the area are alerted by the screams and quickly arrive on the scene. They search for the assailant, without success.

- The next day, "Jack Springheels" strikes again in a place near Mary Stevens' residence. He jumps in front of a moving car, causing the driver to lose control and have an accident. Witnesses of the scene report that Jack Springheels escaped by effortlessly jumping over a 3m (9 feet) wall. Shortly after the car incident, Jack accosted a woman near Clapham Church.

-   Shortly after the carriage incident, Spring Heeled Jack accosted a woman near Clapham Church. The character left two deep footprints of 7.5 cm (3 inches), suggesting some kind of "spring" mechanism in the shoes.
