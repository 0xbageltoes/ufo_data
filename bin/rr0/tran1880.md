-   **March 26, Evening:** Near Galisteo Junction, New Mexico, four men walking are surprised by the sound of voices coming from a strange balloon flying above them. The object has the shape of a fish and seems to be directed by a fan. Between 8 and 10 figures can be seen on board. Their language is unknown, they speak and laugh and drop various objects over the side: a beautiful flower, a ribbon of paper with a silk-like appearance with Asian characters, and a cup of a very particular make. The object flies at low altitude over Galisteo Junction and quickly disappears in the direction of the East. A few hours after the objects were displayed in the window of a nearby station, a man claiming to be a collector of curiosities arrives. He identifies the articles as being of Asian origin and offers a considerable sum for their acquisition. The deal made, he takes them away. A first [MIB](MIB.html)?

-   **May:** In the Persian Gulf, on an extremely dark night, J. W. Robertson, Captain Avern and Mr. Manning, 3rd officer of the *Patna*, a steamer of the British East India Company, suddenly see two huge luminous wheels appear on the sea, on either side of the ship, spinning on themselves and whose rays seem to brush the ship as they pass. These rays measure 200 to 300 m long and resemble the rods of a schoolmistress. Although each wheel must have 500 or 600 m in diameter, the 16 rays it contains are always clearly visible, without any other visible light in the air, above the water, this phosphorescent glow seems to glide flat on the surface of the ocean. The appearance of these rays can be exactly imitated by shaking a lantern horizontally above the water and making it describe concentric circles. The wheels escort the ship for 5 minutes. The testimony of the 3 sailors is published in the *Knowledge* magazine. It arouses vigorous criticism and a remark saying that if the indications were correct, the wheels must have been moving at least 160 km/h!


-   **June:** At the end of the evening, off the coast of Malabar (Persian Gulf), Commander Harris of the steamer *Shahjehan* observed calm seas and clear skies with interspersed waves of bright light and an unknown substance floating, not emitting any fires, but appearing illuminated by gigantic luminous beams. He ordered the ship to stop. As the commander himself declared: Wave after wave succeeded in one of the most grandiose and solemn spectacles that can be imagined!

-   **September 12**: Relating events that have been occurring since
    [1877](1877.html), a journal reports that many people of unblemished
    reputations have seen a man flying towards New Jersey with wings
    resembling those of a bat. He maneuvers at an altitude of about 300
    meters and moves like a swimmer. Witnesses claim to have clearly seen
    his face. He wore a cruel and determined expression. The entirely
    black figure stands out perfectly against the clear blue sky.
    As he was not dragging any advertising banners behind him and at that time the
    first experimental gliders never flew very far, usually crashing
    instead, the phenomenon remains unexplained. [\[*New York Times* of September 12\]]{.source}
