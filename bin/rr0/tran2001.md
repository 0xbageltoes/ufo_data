-   **April 5th, 12:20 PM**: Mr. A.J.A. steps out of his house to have a cigarette when suddenly he notices a figure approaching from his right. At first he thinks it's a large owl, but as it flies directly in front of him he realizes it's a strange creature. As the creature flies near a nearby street lamp, the witness notices it's a humanoid shape with a very large head, no wings, and flying at a constant altitude, without making any noise. The body is about 1.4 m long. It seems to be covered in a dark green "braided" fur. It has a pear-shaped head, but the witness can't see its eyes. It has long thin arms. As the creature flies in front of the witness for about 10 m, he feels a cold sweat and an illogical panic. The creature flies next to the street lamp and makes a 90° turn, quickly disappearing from view. The street lights go out as the creature flies by and then turn back on later [\[Calama UFO Center, Chile\]]{.source}.

One of the boys had a cell phone and noticed that it had turned on by itself and had dialed the number 1 several times. They also noticed that the light from the street lamp had dimmed. A few minutes later, a larger form, about 15 m away, also took off and landed on the roof of a nearby truck, while the other dark form landed on the roof of a house and was lost from sight [\[Calama UFO Center, Chile\]]{.source}.
