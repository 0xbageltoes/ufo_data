-   **July 1st, 12 PM:** The radars of the Griffiss Air Base (New York) detect the approach of an unidentified flying object. A two-seat F-94 *Starfire* fighter jet armed with missiles is immediately sent to intercept it. As it approaches the craft, an intense heat suddenly fills the cockpit. It becomes so unbearable that the radar operator, then the pilot, are forced to eject. As the UFO moves away, the F-94 dives into the Walesville agglomeration where it hits a house, catches fire and ends its course on a car, killing its 4 passengers (a couple and their 2 children). The disaster causes 5 other injuries, 2 of them seriously. The 2 aviators, safe and sound, are quickly recovered by USAF cars and the military authorities order them total silence on the matter (to the point of forbidding the pilot, very shocked, to go see the injured and explain what happened to the victims' parents). But, before being taken back to the base, the pilot has time to report the strange phenomenon to a journalist who rushed to the scene ([Keyhoe](KeyhoeDonaldEdward.html)).

- **July 2**

- The USAF issued an official statement on the incident of the previous day: the plane had taken off in an emergency to intercept an unknown aerial object at all costs and the mission had been successfully accomplished. The crash of the plane was due to an engine failure. The USAF categorically denied the journalist's allusions to an unbearable heat that would have forced the crew to eject while the F-94 engine was still running. In 1968, 14 years later, Donald Keyhoe would learn from one of his contacts at the USAF headquarters that the pilot had been the victim of some kind of mental blank between the moment the radar operator had jumped and the moment his own parachute had opened. In fact, he did not remember having ejected... The radar operator, on the other hand, had not felt anything like it.

    hair is long, naturally wavy. The stranger wears some kind of
    jumpsuit with a wide belt, without buttons or visible closures,
    tight at the neck and wrists. The sisters are struck by the
    impression of kindness he gives them. As they cannot talk to each
    other, he draws them a picture that seems to evoke the solar
    system, then he leads them to a curious machine on the ground,
    resembling two giant pots stuck one on top of the other, gray-blue
    in color. He slips inside through a hatch after making them sign

The object, about 10 m in diameter and 3 m in height, oscillated slowly in suspension like a helicopter above the ground, without ever touching it. It did not emit light, and seemed to have a door on its side. After the men had run up to 50 m from it, it flew away without a sound, leaving a trail of smoke escaping from a small conduit. After an oblique flight of about fifteen meters, the object rose vertically, and disappeared. The witnesses observed the object for at least 3 minutes. The police did not find any traces.

The object appears to be at a considerable altitude and moves in all directions very slowly. Mr. Rabot gets back in his car and returns to Ponthierry while keeping an eye on the apparition. In Ponthierry, he informs the village's appariteur, who observes the disappearance of the phenomenon at great speed in the clouds. At that moment, Mrs. Gamundi (192 av Jean Jaurès in Paris) is driving north on Nationale 7, leaving Fontainebleau. She is in the forest when she perceives the phenomenon and stops. She describes the object as a red cigar surrounded by clouds, motionless, vertical, and sees it give birth to more than a dozen flying saucers that fall one after the other from the lower part of the cigar. When a commercial aircraft crosses the sky, the phenomenon definitively moves away [[Vallée 1966]].

The child throws stones at it and tries to get closer. An invisible and icy force prevents him and throws him to the ground. He then runs away screaming, while the creature moves away towards a meadow. When the children alert their parents, they still have time to see a bright red sphere, 150 m away, flying over the meadow.

 - **5:20 PM:** Eugene Farnier (one of the first airplane pilots in 1907; he gave flying lessons to Guynemer and devoted his life to aviation) is walking his dog in Jouy-sur-Marin when he witnesses a spectacle that astounds him: "I first heard a whistling sound similar to that of a jet engine but much weaker, then, 300 or 400 meters above me, I saw an object shaped like a lens, 8 to 10 meters in diameter and 2 meters thick. It was gray, shiny like aluminum and emitted red and violet flames. The craft stayed in place for 20 minutes, spinning at around 300 revolutions per minute. Suddenly, it tilted and shot up vertically at a prodigious speed of several thousand kilometers per hour---without making a supersonic bang! I then made out the presence of portholes and a dome 50 cm in diameter."

He also distinguishes a vague silhouette. Frightened, he flees. 3 other workers would have seen the same light in the same place [[*A large shell pierced with portholes* in *Le Lorrain* (Nancy) Saturday 9-Sunday 10 October 1954, p. 7 \<Sider 1997]]{.source}.

- **Saturday 9 October**

- **7 h :** An agricultural worker (riding a bicycle?) near Lavoux, near Poitiers (Vienne), sees a creature 1 m tall, dressed in a kind of diving suit, with bright eyes and long hair. The creature aims at him with a double beam of light, and seems to have heel-less boots, a hairy chest, and two headlights, one below the other, at the front of its clothing.

- **Sunday 10 October**

-   **23 h**: At the Metz fair (\...) the army had installed a radar system as well as anti-aircraft searchlights. (\...) one of the powerful searchlights, which swept the sky to the delight of the onlookers, suddenly caught in its beam a mysterious object. It was a kind of luminous globe, motionless in the sky and which, according to the expression of some witnesses, "sparkled like a Christmas tree ball". The officer present estimated that the object must have been at least 50 m in diameter, and that it seemed to be about 10000 m high. To make sure it was not a phenomenon or an optical illusion, it was decided to carry out a complete cleaning of the searchlight. The charcoal was also changed and relit. The object was still there. For 3 hours, the device remained motionless. It looked like a kind of vertical cigar. But since nothing was happening, they finally turned off the searchlight. Commander Cotel, who was in charge of the anti-aircraft detachment, sent a report to the military governor of Metz. "There is no need to take into account this information in this particular case". The case was closed. Not a word of the observation made not only by the technicians but also by the visitors, and by the inhabitants of Metz up to the suburbs of Sablon and Queuleu. The object had the shape of a small motionless and regular-shaped cumulus. But its shape, its dimensions and its position remained rigorously identical, moreover the sky was perfectly clear except for this supposed cumulus. Which would rule out the possibility of a cloud. Now, a diameter of 50 m is a lot for a balloon\... Strangely enough, the radar had constantly swept the sky during the observation, without catching anything. This could mean two things: either the object was not metallic, or it was out of range of the type of radar that was operating in Metz [[Sider 1997]]{.source}.

-   **In the night**: In Moncourt (64 km from Metz, 43 km from Nancy)
    inhabitants of an isolated farm, a few hundred meters from
    Moncourt, were awakened by a strange whistling. Through the
    shutters they distinguished a blinding light that seemed to be
    located on the side of the hill. A few minutes later, they saw a
    luminous sphere rise vertically and disappear quickly. The next
    day, in the afternoon, the gendarmes led by the farmer to the
    place where the strange light seemed to have landed, discovered
    traces of intense calcination on a dirt road. Samples of soil and
    stones were taken (...) The results of the analyses were never
    known. [[Sider 1997 > LDLN]]{.source}

-   **Monday, October 11th:** In Royan, 3 people from Bordeaux saw a red light above the coast at nightfall. They moved closer to the phenomenon and saw an object in the shape of a disk, with an orange-red dome, hovering about ten meters above the ground. A little further away, the Bordeaux people were surprised to see 4 creatures about 1 meter tall, crouching under the device. These quickly returned to their craft, which took off while changing color.

-   **Friday, October 15**: In Thionville, a "saucer" is again reported as well as a "Martian" roaming in the nearby countryside. The police, armed to prepare for any eventuality and assisted by citizens armed with pitchforks, go to the scene and, after a large encirclement maneuver, manage to apprehend a small individual, with a shaggy beard and ultimately human appearance. Taken to a security post and vainly interrogated for more than 2 hours, he maintains complete silence. The "Martian" obviously does not understand French and the best German, Polish, Italian, English, etc. interpreters pass in front of him one after the other; but all without success, as he still does not answer the questions asked. Yielding to discouragement and not knowing which saint to turn to, the gendarmes are ready to give up when the person starts speaking in a language dear to the Grand Ducal neighbors: "Enough with this comedy, is there anyone here who can speak Luxembourgish?" Stupefaction and consternation among the "Martian hunters", exclaiming with dismay: "Another ... Luxembourger!". [[Sider 1997]{.source}

-   **Sunday, October 17**: Mr. Mozin, on his way to Reims to attend a football match with his friend Mr. Houssière, stops at the place where he saw the object the day before to check for traces, hoping to prove to his friend that he had not dreamed. In a narrow space between a 1 m wide and 50 cm deep ditch and the road, 3 semi-circular and deep imprints of 8 to 10 cm are visible with in the center of the imaginary circle of about 1.40 m formed by these 3 imprints, a 20 cm diameter carbonized circle giving off an odor that the witness compared to that of benzene. The car must necessarily have passed between 3 and 5 meters from the object.

- **Monday 18 October**

   -   In Fontenay-Torcy (France), a man and his wife saw in the sky an
        object shaped like a cigar, red in color. Suddenly, it dove
        towards them, leaving behind a reddish trail, and landed in the
        bushes. As they reached the top of a hill, the witnesses found
        themselves face to face with a corpulent individual, of human
        appearance, but no more than 1 m tall. He wore a helmet and his
        eyes shone an orange color. One of the two witnesses fainted.

- At Parravici d'Erba near Como (Italy), a man had just put his car in the garage when he saw a strange being, dressed in a luminous garment, about 1.20 m tall, standing near a tree. When it saw the motorist, the creature sent him a beam from some kind of torch; the witness remained paralyzed until the movement he made to tighten the fist that held the keys seemed to free him. He leapt forward to attack the stranger, who rose from the ground and flew away in a almost silent whirl. The narrator of this incredible story, aged 37, was considered in his country to be a man of trust. He arrived home in such a state of depression that he had to go to bed with a high fever. It was an investigation by the Italian police that allowed details of this case to be obtained.

-   **18:30**: Between Sarrebourg and Turquenstein (Mozelle), Jean Schoubrenner was driving near the village when an immense light shone on the road in front of him. When he arrived 18 m away from this strange inverted cone-shaped object blocking his path, he felt paralyzed, his hands stuck to the steering wheel and the engine of his vehicle stopped working. He felt a heat spreading through his body. The UFO flew away a few seconds later, and he and his vehicle returned to normal.

-   **December 16th, Night**: 3 young men (Jesus Paz, Luis Mejia, a
    member of the National Guard and another friend) dined in a
    restaurant in San Carlos, then drove home. As they were in the
    suburbs, near a park of the Ministry of Agriculture, Paz asked his
    friends to stop the car so he could go to a secluded place in the
    park to relieve himself. Paz had barely taken a dozen steps before
    he called for help. His friends ran to his rescue and found him
    unconscious and lying on the ground. At a short distance there was
    a small, hairy humanoid, running towards a bright device resembling
    a disk, resting on the grass. Mejia had just enough time to grab a
    stone and throw it at the disk, which began to rise with a huge
    rumbling noise. Paz was quickly taken to the city hospital, where
    the doctors found him in shock. He also had long and deep scratches
    on his right side and down his spine, like claw marks, the doctor
    said. Paz told the authorities he had walked around a grove of
    large flowers, his tracks softened by the thick grass. Suddenly he
    would have fallen on this small humanoid and hairy creature, which
    was examining the flowers. Paz tried to escape but, as he turned
    around, the creature attacked him, first by scratching and pulling
    his shirt, then with a breath on the neck that knocked out Paz.
