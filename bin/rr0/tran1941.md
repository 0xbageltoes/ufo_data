- In Switzerland, a rescue team searching for 3 mountaineers who had not been heard from in some time found after days of difficult efforts the footprints of the 3 men. They followed them and noticed that they stopped in the center of a snowy field. No crevasse could have swallowed them and beyond, the snow remained untouched. However, from the last traces, 3 irregular holes forming an equilateral triangle of 12.80 m side were discovered. The investigation concluded in a triple disappearance in circumstances that the facts did not allow to establish clearly.

-   **June:** Germans test the prototype of the flying disc *Schriever-Habermohl Model I*.

-   **Beginning of Summer, Sunday, 1 PM:** It was in Le Mans, at the beginning of summer 1941. The *Luftwaffe* had occupied the old aerodrome of Le Mans, at the Circuit de la Sarthe, and maintained several groups of *Messerschmitt* 109s, not very fast, but excessively maneuverable. The German pilots were in a permanent state of alert and, several times, I observed from quite close up the take-offs in groups of the *Messerschmitts* in broad daylight. The weather was magnificent, a Sunday as far as I remember, and around 1 PM, the very clear sky contained only a few large cumulus clouds, clouds which were moreover very far apart from each other. Around 1 PM, the whole city heard the roar of the planes taking off in haste and I could see that the cause of the alert seemed to be in one of the large cumulus clouds which, at that moment, was flying very slowly over the aerodrome. One could see the Messerschmitts whirling around like mad around the cloud, diving into it at full speed, coming out in a loop or sideways, and starting their maneuvers again, a spectacle which was truly very pretty, but which must have been terribly dangerous for the pilots. Was it an exercise ordered by the commander of the camp or an alert? I never knew, but it was curious to observe the terrified airs of the German soldiers and officers quartered in the city, who followed the spectacle from the windows of the houses. I could then observe that the cloud which, upon its arrival, seemed to have its base at 300 m and to culminate at 1000 m, began to swell and, when it moved away from the aerodrome to move away from the city, it had taken the shape of a very high pyramid, with perfectly sharp contours and brilliantly lit by the sun; its very sharp peak must have been probably at 3000 m, according to a height visible on the horizon and its probable place on the ground. My observation point was 4 km from the aerodrome and the cloud was approximately 5 km away when I observed its summit [\[scientific review *La Nature*\]]{.source}.


-   **7 December:** Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.


-   **December 8:** [Roosevelt](RooseveltFranklinDelano.html) asks the US Congress to declare war on Japan and directs all national effort towards the global war.


-   **Autumn Evening:** At Skår/Osterøy (Norway), a relative of Berit
    Clemmensen is with some friends at the local cinema. The night is
    clear and full of stars. Suddenly they see a luminous phenomenon
    to the West, heading towards the North-West at great speed. It
    can be described as a luminous fireball, resembling a bolide at
    first glance. It seems to fly very low above Osterfjorden. It is
    visible for at least 1/2 minute, and no sound is heard. The
    witnesses are quite excited by this experience [\[UFO, 2/1992, 9\]]{.source}.


- **July**: A German scientist travels to the USA, revealing the secret of a saucer recovered by the Germans in 1937. The US military intelligence, under the code name *Oz*, takes control of the Nazi installation containing the disk, and brings it back to the USA, narrowly missing the Soviet troops, who will learn of the disk's existence 6 months later (likely from captured German scientists).


-   **July/August (or July/August 1942), 11 PM:** At Marøy/Nordhordland
    (Norway), Irene Skram and her cousin see a silver disc. It rises
    from the ground to the South-East of the witnesses, at about 300 m
    away. Three grey coils follow the disc, rotating on their own axis.
    It slowly rises to a height of about 100 m, when it seems to
    descend again, and the three coils following the disc fall about
    100 m north of the witnesses' house. The disc disappears. Two men,
    who also saw the disc (the cousin's husband and his friend) come to
    retrieve the coils, and bring back 3 haystacks. Nothing seems
    strange about these haystacks. They ask their neighbor to the South
    without talking to him about the disc, and he confirms that 3
    haystacks are missing from his property. The object was observed
    for 2 minutes, and its size was about 10 m in diameter. The
    diameter of each haystack is 12 to 15 m, and the separation between
    each is 5 to 6 m [\[UFO report form, 6 January 1965\] \[UFO-NYT,
