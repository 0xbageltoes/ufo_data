-   **January 31:** An American 5-masted schooner, the *Carroll A. Deering,* which had passed 48 hours earlier off Cape Zookout, north of the Carolinas at a speed of 5 miles per hour, is found aground on sandbanks, off the coast of Florida, with all its sails set. No distress signal was detected. There is not a soul on board. Empty davits indicate that boats have been launched. Ropes hang along the hull and, finally, only two gray cats are found in the kitchen, dying of hunger. All sails are rigged, except the main staysail, but two slashed arrows are discovered. The ship's papers, logbook, chronometers, clothing in the forecastle before the messroom clock are missing. In the captain's cabin, there is some disorder and drawers have been left open. On the other hand, three pairs of rubber boots in an adjacent locker may indicate that other men have used the cabin. A reserve cabin also seems to have been occupied. The captain's large trunk and canvas bag have disappeared. The steering apparatus is no longer working, the wheel is demolished and the cockpit has been crushed.

  lit 2 hours before.
