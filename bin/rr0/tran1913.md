-   **End of summer, between 9 and 10 PM**: In Moravia (Czechoslovakia), a 20 year old man travelling from Brnoyto Zidence on a clear night sees 6 very high objects in the sky resembling large, flaming red stars, moving silently around a fixed point in a clockwise direction. This formation of "stars" follows an elliptical orbit with an apparent diameter of 1 m (the witness determines this by stretching out his arm). He observes the phenomenon for 6 to 8 minutes, then continues on his way without waiting for the end [\[Henri Xhaloupek, Spatial Phenomena #11, 1967; drawing p. 209\]]{.source}.


-   **Autumn, 8 PM:** At Auggedal (Norway), people saw a bright ball
    coming from the South with a whistling sound towards them. It passed
    between them and a barn, at 10 m. The ball was the size of a rugby
    ball, and the passage between the barn and the witnesses was at a
    height of 5 to 6 m above the ground. Then the ball went up and
    disappeared above a hill. The object shone brightly. The witnesses
    were P.O. Møller, Tor Flatum and Gunn Berget. The whole observation
    lasted about 40 seconds, during which the bright ball traveled
    about ten kilometers [\[UFO report form, March 31, 1965\]]{.source}.
