-   **October 28th, a few hours before sunrise:** In the South Atlantic, sailors from the *Fort Salisbury* spot a long dark object a few tens of meters away from the ship in a calm sea and under a starry sky. The lookout man having alerted them, the object is quickly located by A. H. Haymer. He will later recount: It was a bit frightening. The darkness prevented us from observing the details, but it was long, from 150 to 180 m. There was a fire at each end. Some kind of mechanism - fins maybe - stirred the water. The object seemed to sink slowly. No one thought for a moment that it could be a ship capsizing as the surface was not smooth as it could have been, but seemed \"scaly\". Although checks were made afterwards, nothing allowed to determine the nature of this strange object.
