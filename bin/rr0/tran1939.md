-   **February:** An American steamship, the *Tulsa*, picks up distress
    messages from a ship communicating: Here, P.E.C.C., P.E.C.C. We
    have just been attacked by an unknown submarine. S. O. S., S. O.
    S., S. O. S\... 2 ships immediately head towards the source of
    the calls which is located about 550 km south of the Azores. It is
    the British steamship *Empress of Australia* and the Greek cargo
    ship *Mont Pelion*. When they arrive at the scene of the drama,
    they find nothing. No wreckage, no boats, no corpses or injured,
    no traces of oil or fuel. The two ships then form spirals on the
    sea, increasingly wider. They send radio messages without
    interruption. In vain. An investigation takes place: no submarine
    was in this region at the time of the drama. The distress calls
    had lasted only a few moments. Fishermen, in Horta, near the
    Azores, bring testimonies contradicting the official statements
    that this disappeared ship had never existed and that the radio
    operators had been victims of an error of interpretation. These
    fishermen had observed mysterious shapes resembling submarines
    on the surface in the vicinity of the disappearance.
