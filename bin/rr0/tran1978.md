-  **4 January (February ?), 3 PM:** At Kawaga, Miki-Cho (Japan), Hirobumi Matsushita takes pictures with a
 - Friends notice a shiny golden and colored object flying high above them in the blue sky. There are no clouds and a light breeze is blowing, but not enough to carry debris so high in the air. The object seems to be moving on its own, apparently under intelligent control. Matsushita adjusts his device and takes some photos of the strange object before it disappears.

-   **January 18:** As an [USAF](USAF.html) security officer was on a routine patrol around the American base of McGuire (New Jersey), several witnesses saw a UFO flying over the base. A member of the Military Police pursued the craft that had flown over his car. Shortly after, the military police member saw a 1m tall being which he described as brown-gray, thin, with a large head and long arms. The policeman fired 5 times at the creature and once at the UFO above him. It shot vertically to join 11 other stationary objects far in the sky. The creature's body was found near the airstrip by the security officer and a patrol who noticed the nauseating smell coming from it, like ammonia. Later in the day, a team from the USAF base of Wright-Patterson arrived on the spot, sprayed the body with chemicals, put it in a box, loaded it in a C-141 troop transport and left [\[Report of an Air Force Security Officer\]]{.source} [\[FX 95-2654\]]{.source}.

-   **March 29, 9:30 PM:** Near Indianapolis (Indiana), 3 truckers driving in convoy are chatting on their CB when a bright blue light envelops the 3 trucks for about 5 seconds. None of the 3 men can see beyond the hood of their truck. All outside noise ceases. The CBs stop working and the truck engines start to fail. Then, the blue light - described by a nearby car driver as a kind of bright blue lampshade above the 3 trucks - disappears and everything suddenly returns to normal. The last trucker in line yells into his CB: Hey, UFO, if you hear me, I want to go with you! The blue light returns, for about 15 seconds, and causes the same effects as before; the speed of the trucks drops to 8 km/h. When the light disappears again, everything returns to normal.

-  **Sunday, September 10**: In the suburbs of San Miguel de Tucuman (Argentina), in an empty multipurpose store (and also large warehouse), Miguel Angel Carbajal, the manager's son, his friend Ledesma and another disabled friend follow a television program in the dining room of the house. A few months earlier, a house near the store had been inexplicably bombarded with stones. Gradually, the image shrinks until it becomes unreadable. They turn off the television and plug in a record player but it runs slow for no reason. Convinced that the electrical network is suffering from a voltage drop, they turn on a small portable radio: the broadcasts are inaudible. They hear noises of objects falling in the store. Thinking of thieves, Carbajal and Ledesma put their disabled friend in safety outside the house, then open the door of the store. Jars of mayonnaise and a bottle of wine are broken on the floor. A scale has also fallen, glass broken. 6 m away from them are 2 beings of human appearance but of small size, dressed in tight-fitting suits, observing them with a threatening attitude. One of the two takes a box filled with cigarette cartridges from a counter and throws it towards the witnesses. Then one of the beings raises a hand to his face: when his index finger comes into contact with his nose, the two entities vanish into the air [[Lecomte]]{.source}.

- At dawn, the crew of a Safe Air Argosy cargo plane from Blenheim (south of Wellington, South Island) to Dunedin/Christchurch (New Zealand) is asked to divert to try to spot some very unusual objects followed by Wellington airport's radar. According to John Cordy, an air traffic controller, it looks like nothing known. Commander (captain?) Vern Powell and Captain John Randall thus direct their Argosy towards the area and then see a strange light following the plane for 19 km along the coast, before disappearing. The observations are recorded by the plane's radar.

-   **23 h 46 :** The observations from the previous days ([December 21](#12-21) and others) prompt an Australian television channel to contact one of its reporters, [Quentin Fogarty](FogartyQuentin.html), and ask him to investigate the case. He then boards the same flight that night.


-   **0 h 10 :** The captain and the co-pilot see lights off the Kaikoura Peninsula, which is also picked up by Wellington's radar, as intermittent spots.


-   **0 h 22 :** Another radar-visual contact takes place and the UFO is filmed.


-   **1 h:** After further brief contacts, the Argosy landed in Christchurch.

-   **2:16:** The plane takes off again to return to Blenheim. As the engine comes above the clouds, a bright UFO appears in front of it, on the right. Christchurch's radar detects a huge object with the same position, about 30 km away from the plane. The footage taken at this moment shows an oval object with rings of light. During the flight, the UFO approaches within 16 km of the plane: one of them, a flashing UFO, is filmed while it changes color, from yellow-white to dull orange-red.
 - **3:10 PM:** The plane lands. Other witnesses will manifest in the region. The film will generate huge media interest, as indicated by the following press release: The world's attention turned to the sky above Kaikoura after a film of the sightings was broadcast by American, British and Australian television. This sparked an international debate about the possible explanations of the large bright white ball captured on film. Captain Verne Powell, one of the first to see the UFO, said he watched, amazed, as the object crossed 24 km of sky in 5 seconds. He was annoyed that it was suggested he might have mistaken [Venus](Venus.html) for a UFO. A pilot since 1944, Powell declared: "I can still recognize [Venus](Venus.html)."
Stanton Friedman [met](FriedmanStanton.html) with the director of a television station in Louisiana who suggests to him during their discussion to get in touch with a certain [Jesse Marcel](MarcelJesseA.html), who had in his possession, while in the army, pieces of a flying saucer that interest him."
