-   **December:** Swedish press begins to report mysterious gray planes without markings that are quickly nicknamed "ghost planes". These devices seem as comfortable in clear weather as in the heart of the worst snowstorm that grounds the Swedish air force planes. When the fighters manage to take off to chase the intruders, they prove unable to fulfill their mission. Over the weeks and accumulating testimonies, the ghost planes become a national affair. Witnesses speak of planes, sometimes biplanes and regularly assure that these aircraft that mock the military seem to cut their engine during their maneuvers. In several cases, the presence of a powerful projector has been mentioned, as for the aircraft of [1897](1897.html) and the pseudo-dirigibles of [1909](1909.html). The observation reports dry up with the arrival of spring, but similar cases will continue to appear from time to time in the following years. In [1978](1978.html), the Swede Anders Liljegren will discover that the Swedish air force had at that time created an investigation office.
