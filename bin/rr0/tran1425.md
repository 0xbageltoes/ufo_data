- When I was about 13 years old, I had a voice from God to help me govern myself. The first time, I was very scared. And the voice came around noon, in the summer, in my father's garden. I had not fasted the day before. I heard the voice on the right side of the church, and rarely did I hear it without clarity. (...) This clarity is on the same side where I hear the voice, and there is usually a great clarity there (...) - Master Beaupère: How was this voice? - Jeanne: It seemed to me that it was a worthy voice, and I believe that this voice was sent by God. When I had heard this voice 3 times, I knew that it was the voice of an angel. This voice has always kept me well, and I understood this voice well. - Master Beaupère: What teaching did this voice give you for the salvation of your soul? - Jeanne: It taught me to conduct myself well, to attend church (...). The voice told me to come to France, and I could no longer stay where I was (...) It told me 2 or 3 times a week that I had to leave and come to France... and I could no longer stay where I was... Jeanne identifies the voices as those of Saint Michael, Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret. [[Procès de Jeanne d'Arc, Jeudi 22 Février]]{.source}
