- Doctor Charles F. Bush, B.Sc. and Ph.D., discovers strange properties in a rock called "Lintz Basalt": it would emit more heat than any other and would not accelerate in free fall; let's say it would remain more or less suspended in the air.


-   **August 5, 9:30am:** In Mongolia, explorer Nicholas Roerich and his team observed: We were at our camp, in the district of Koukounor, not far from the Humboldt range. In the morning, around 9:30am, some of our caravaners saw a remarkably large black eagle flying above us. 7 of us began to observe this unusual bird. At the same time, another of our caravaners noticed: "There is something bigger, much higher than the bird." And he expressed his astonishment. We all saw, in a direction from north to south, something big and shiny reflecting the sun, like a huge oval moving at great speed. Crossing our camp, this thing changed direction from south to southwest. And we saw how it disappeared into the intensely blue sky. We had time to take our field binoculars and clearly see an oval shape with a shiny surface, one side shining in the sun. Let us remember that Nicholas Roerich is, by definition, a highly experienced observer and his testimony comes from one of the wildest regions of Asia, where no dirigible has ever flown in the entire history of air conquest.


-   **November:** In Bolton (Lancashire, England), Henry Thomas, the
    young son of a policeman, is put to bed. He wants to play with his
    friends who are outside. He sneaks out of the house to join them.
    They start a game of hide-and-seek in the alleys. Seeing a back
    door ajar, Henry enters the yard in the hope of finding one of his
    friends hidden there. In the yard are 3 normal-sized people,
    looking through the back window of a house. The trio is dressed in
    strange costumes that seem to be made of gray-silver rubber tubes,
    and are wearing black boots. They look like "skinny" versions of
    the Michelin Man. They wear transparent dome-shaped helmets. Tubes
    come out of them to tanks that the creatures carry on their backs.
    The "men" then turn to face the boy. They have pale bulb-shaped
    faces, dark and slanted eyes, almost no nose and no visible mouth.
    Henry has the impression that they are benevolent despite their
    frightening appearance. One of them makes a gurgling sound and all
    3 start to move towards the terrified boy.

-   **1 h** : At Colun Judetul Sibiu (Romania), Ion Bunescu is with his horses on the road to a pasture and sees in the night a "illuminated lance" the size of the Moon. The object remains motionless for 5 or 10 minutes above Bunescu's head. It has the shape of a boat 3 m long and 2 m wide. The middle is darker than the ends. After that the object heads towards Arpasul de Jos (8 km further) and after going around a small wood 3 km from Cîrta it suddenly goes out (the place where the witness is is a hill with very good visibility of about 60 km). The object makes a whistling sound and all the surroundings are lit up as if it were day [\[Ion Hobana & Julien Weverberg, UFO's Behind the Iron Curtain\].]{.source}
