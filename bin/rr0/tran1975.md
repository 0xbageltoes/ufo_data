- **August**

- Beginning of a series of observations, where all the American bases in the North and some nearby Canadian bases will be visited by flying objects. Documents from [NORAD](NORAD.html), declassified in the 1980s in accordance with the [FOIA](glossair.html#FOIA), attest to this activity. Civilian observations confirm and complete a surprising picture.

-   **August 29, 6:25 AM:** In France, a French gamekeeper
    spotted a green cigar: At 6:25 AM, it was normally daylight and
    the weather was slightly foggy, I was parking my moped against a
    slope and my gaze was automatically directed towards the farm
    (\...). Suddenly I saw a strange craft hovering vertically above
    this house and about 50 m in altitude. This craft was coming in
    my direction. It had the shape of a shell, its color was very
    light green, when it passed in front of me the craft dazzled me
    as if looking directly at the sun. On its passage it left a
    trail that could be a kind of condensation and not smoke. It
    emitted absolutely no sound, its passage probably lasted only
    half a second. Its speed seemed slightly higher than the majority
    of meteors that can be commonly observed in space (\...). It
    seemed to me that the cylindrical craft at the back measured 2 m
    in diameter and about 3 m in length. It apparently had no
    windows or other visible openings. There were also no fins or
    other superstructure on this craft. The back was flat and light
    green in color as well as the entire body in the shape of a
    shell [\[J.-C. Bourret, Le Nouveau Défi des OVNI, ed. France
