- People from Franconia, between Pabenberp and the Thuringian forest, see a star of astonishing size. It descends lower and lower and then becomes a large white circle from which swirls and balls of fire escape. As they fall to the ground, the balls of fire melt the tips of spears and all that is made of iron, without causing any harm to humans or their houses.
