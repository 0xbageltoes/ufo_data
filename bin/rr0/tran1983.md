-   **May 4:** Conversation between Jean-Pierre Deloux, journalist, a military radar operator and his supervisor: *Question* : Have you ever seen a UFO? *Operator* : Of course, and very often. *Question* : On average, how many monthly observations? *Operator*: Personally, around a good ten, or even a bit more. *Question* : Is it huge? *Operator*: Incredible! And rest assured that we check what's happening in the sky before concluding to an unidentified object. *Question*: What do you mean by that? *Operator*: The same as you: an Unidentified Flying Object, UFO for short. Just like any plane, the UFO is visible on the radar. *Question* **:** What happens then? *Operator*: Nothing, I'm looking at the type next to me. He looks back at me and glances at my screen. He looks back at me again. We look at the supervisor... *Supervisor*: And I'm watching my two operators. I'm looking at the screen, and I'm not saying anything. I'm waiting for the hypothetical target to disappear. Sometimes, it seems to stay indefinitely. *Question* **:** What does that mean\...? *Supervisor*: Several hours. Up to ten hours. It's long, very long, like when you're waiting for a shell to explode. I know it's definitely a UFO. No mistake possible. But I'm not saying anything. *Operator*: He says nothing. Nobody says anything. We all know it's a UFO, but officially, it doesn't exist. *Supervisor*: We don't talk about these things. It's pointless. *Question* **:** But are you talking to a journalist?*Supervisor* : Even if we don't know what it is, it needs to be known. *Question* : If the UFO intrudes, how long before you alert your superior? *Supervisor* : If it is stationary, near the base. After 3 minutes. *Question* : Should we send out the hunt, a patrol? *Supervisor* : Sometimes 2 reconnaissance planes: one to film it, the second to film its friend and the UFO. *Question* : What becomes of these films? *Supervisor* : Nothing. They are classified as top secret. So they don't exist...

I remember that while chatting with some people in my office, I was struck by the feeling that these strangers were built like some insects of our Earth (\...)
