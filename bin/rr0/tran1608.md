- **August**

- Between Genoa (Italy) and Marseille a series of demonstrations and aerial battles is observed. People die of fright. This is followed by rains of blood along the coast up to Marseille. The battle takes place between flying apparitions and others only partially emerging from the sea off Genoa. The soldiers of the fortress of this city try to disperse the intruders by firing no less than 800 cannon shots against them. These signs are interpreted as a warning from God who would be about to punish men.

-   **22nd and 27th August:** Other strange giant figures fight for hours in the sky of Martigues, characters whose weapons make a sound of the end of the world. Then they disappear in a black rush that leaves behind a smell of saltpeter.
