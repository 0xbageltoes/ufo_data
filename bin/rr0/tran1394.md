-   **September 2, 2am:** A strange object flew over Forli (Italy)
    multiple times: At the beginning of the month of September, many
    "asud" \[name given to celestial objects, notes Professor
    Marzocchi\] appeared in the sky and shooting stars. The flying
    object was observed by many witnesses: The same year, on the 2nd
    day of the month of September, at the 2nd hour of the night, a
    large asud appeared to men who were on the public square of Forli
    and to others in other places assembled; it crossed the sky very
    slowly and stayed in the sky for the time of 2 *Pater Noster*,
    and it was large in length of one step and when it disappeared -
    the men who were on the square reported it - it sent out a smell
    of burning wood and we heard other people who assured that said
    asud of iron was traversing the air in its own way; but then it
    remained motionless for a time in space and after that time, it
    gradually disappeared leaving in its place like a cloud and the
    remains of vapor had taken the form of snakes, a thing quite
    admirable. [\[Cronica Albertina, manuscript, years 1393-1394 \< Professor Marzocchi \< [Michel Bougard](BougardMichel.html), *La chronique des OVNI*, Delarge 1977, p.72\]]{.source}
