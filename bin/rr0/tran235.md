- In China, Liang went to war against the kingdom of Wei. While his troops were stationed at Wei-nan, a [meteor](Meteore.html) red emitting "pointed rays" came from the sky towards the southwest of his camp above which it moved 3 times back and forth, each time with a greater magnitude forward than on its withdrawal. Soon, Liang died in his camp. His troops then burned it and left. A little later, Liang's generals began to fight each other. These events will not surprise anyone because all Chinese thought that the passage or fall of a meteor on an army invariably foreshadowed its defeat.
