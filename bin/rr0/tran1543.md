- A large comet approached closer to the [Sun](Soleil.html) than any other, and the same thing will repeat in [1882](1882.html). These two comets penetrated into the Sun's belt which is given an absolute temperature of 1 million degrees, reports [George Hunt Williamson](WilliamsonGeorgeHunt.html). These comets traveled 1 million km in this incandescent crown and emerged unscathed, without any change in velocity or direction. If the Sun emits such intense heat, how is it that they did not disintegrate the moment they plunged into this 1 million °C. [\[*Other Languages, Other Natures*\]]{.source}
