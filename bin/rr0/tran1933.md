-   **March 3:** During the Sankiru earthquake (Japan), the sea
    receded to reveal to the amazed spectators a luminescent halo
    resting on the ocean floor. Its color was bluish. Several years
    before, the same phenomenon had occurred. The crest of the waves,
    according to Frank Lane, emitted a faint continuous light. The
    entire surface of the sea sparkled as it broke on the shore, the
    waves illuminating the entire coast with a soft bluish light. In
    one of his works, Peter Kolosimo publishes a vaguely representing
    picture of this magical fire which only appears at certain times of
    the year in the sea in Japan. At the same time, luminous phenomena
    are also reported in the sky.


-   **March 24:** The largest [meteor](Meteore.html) ever observed crosses 9 states of the United States. According to thousands of witnesses, its passage lasts a few terrifying hours. According to a photo, the large luminous sphere in the center of the image measures 9600 m in diameter, and the trail behind it is 1600 m wide, which Ninïger verified. An odor of sulfur persists for hours. The [meteor](Meteore.html) seems to disappear suddenly at 27 km from the [Earth](Terre.html), without exploding or disintegrating.
