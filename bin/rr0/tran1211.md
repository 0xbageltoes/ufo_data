- He arrived in the town of Cloera (Ireland), on a Sunday, while everyone was at Mass, something wonderful. There is in this town a church dedicated to Saint Kinarus. It happened that an anchor was thrown from the sky, attached to a rope, and one of the beaks caught in the arch above the church door. People ran out of the church and saw in the sky a ship with men on board, which floated in front of the anchor cable, and they saw a man climb over the railing and jump to the anchor as if to free it. It seemed he was swimming in the water. People rushed to try to seize him but the bishop forbade them to catch the man because, he said, it could kill him. The man was left free and hurried to the ship; the crew cut the rope and the ship set sail until it was out of sight. It is said that the anchor was kept in the church. This story has been located in many other places the same year including Gravesend in Kent (England) or Bristol (Somerset). Other sources suggest that the Cloera story dates from 965 and appeared in the *Speculum Regale*. [Irish story telling the two incidents of Drake and Wilkin]{.source} [Mysterious Britain]{.source}
