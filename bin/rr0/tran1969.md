-   **May 4th, 3pm:** North of Belo Horizonte, José Antonio da Silva
    went fishing. He was suddenly paralyzed by a beam of light and
    transported to a cylindrical and vertical craft, with a saucer at
    the base and one at the top, by 2 creatures 1.20m tall, wearing
    silver-colored costumes and masks. Once inside, he was restrained
    and forced to wear a helmet. The machine took off and, after an
    interminable time, landed. Da Silva's eyes were blindfolded and he
    was taken to a brightly lit room, in which he saw the bodies of 4
    other humans. He was then interrogated by 15 tiny creatures. They
    were hairy, with long red beards and hair of the same color, big
    noses, big ears and no teeth. They took his fishing gear, his ID
    card, and his banknotes. They asked him to be their guide among
    men. When he refused, he was brought back to Earth.

    Cosmodrome (Kazakhstan). At 100 m altitude, an engine explodes,
    causing the other engines to shut down. The rocket falls back onto
    the launch pad where it disintegrates in a devastating explosion.
    The damage is considerable. It will take 3 years to rebuild the
    site.

-   **July 5th, 8:30 PM:** Arcesio Bermudez's two children spot a
    shining object about 300 m away from them. When they signal it
    with their flashlight, the UFO approaches to a distance of about
    60 m. The children quickly alert their family. Arcesio Bermudez
    asks those accompanying him to wait: he will explore alone and
    with his flashlight the hill behind which the luminous object
    they are 12 like him to have seen has disappeared. When Arcesio
    returns, a few minutes later, he seems to be in an intense fear.
    Pressed with questions, he tells that he saw the object, now
    dark except for its transparent and luminous top, only 6 m away
    from him. He then directed the beam of his flashlight towards
    this illuminated part and glimpsed "a small person". At that
    precise moment, the UFO lit up and moved away at great speed.


-   **July 6th:** The Liberian-flagged Golar Frost discovers the Swedish
    Peter Wallin's yacht, The Vagabond, sailing solo. This fiberglass

-   **July 7th:** At 54 years old, Arcesio Bermudez had always enjoyed good health. Yet, two days after the onset, he began to feel unwell: cold sensations, temperature drops, difficulty eating. Bluish spots appeared on his skin and blood in his stools.

-   **23 h 45:** Arcesio Bermudez dies in the hospital of Bogota where he had just been admitted. The doctors' diagnosis --- to whom the story of the UFO was not told --- is that he succumbed to gastroenteritis, a very common disease in the country. A report from Dr. Cesar Esmerald Barros, from Bogota, indicates: The victim's temperature had dropped to 35°C. The cardiovascular-pulmonary system presented: pericarditis, asphyxia, coughing, painful chest oppression, slow pulse. The digestive system was affected: bloody diarrhea, black vomiting, dry mouth, painful abdomen, particularly on the right side. Mental faculties and nervous system: normal. The skin was dry, pale, cold and dehydrated. One of the doctors who had examined the victim admitted that he would have considered this case differently if he had known what had happened.

-   **July 20/21:** Before the first moon landing, the crew of [Apollo 11](Apollo11.html) observe a large flying object heading in the same direction as the capsule. Seen through a small telescope, it looks like a hollow, dented cylinder at times, but when the telescope is focused properly, a distinct "L" shape is seen, like an open suitcase, according to [Neil Armstrong](ArmstrongNeilA.html). The crew thinks it is the SIV-B launch rocket, now detached, but the ground base announces that the rocket is 10000 km away. One of the investigators suggests that the object might have been a piece of insulation material. Neil Armstrong and [Edwin Aldrin](AldrinEdwinE.html) gently land the *Eagle* module in the Sea of Tranquility on the Moon while [Michael Collins](CollinsMichael.html) remains in low orbit (112 km) aboard *Columbia*, filming both the visible and hidden sides of our natural satellite. 6 hours later, he descends the ladder, soon joined by [Edwin Aldrin](AldrinEdwinE.html). He spends 2 and a half hours on the lunar surface.
