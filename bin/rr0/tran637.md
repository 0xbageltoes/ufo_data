- In Japan, a large star moved from east to west, and there was a sound that resembled thunder. People of that time said that it was the crash of the star falling. But the Buddhist priest Bin said: "It is not the star that falls, it is the Celestial Dog whose bark is like thunder" (...) The Celestial Dog is a winged creature with a human form, with an incredibly long nose; it frequents mountains and secluded places. [[*Nihon-shoki*, cited by W. Raymond Drake]{.source}
