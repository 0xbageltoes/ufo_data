The object is heading towards Moscow, where the sighting is confirmed by the astronomer Gindilis on duty that night at the observatory. The air defense radars have not detected anything, but the military think of a surprise attack by the Americans and trigger the alert. The UFO flies over the main airport of Moscow where it causes panic. Hundreds of witnesses see it emit a luminous crown and transform into a giant jellyfish: it moves away and expels 3 small UFOs which the Migs will vainly chase. Andropov orders the Institute of Studies of Magnetism and Earth Radioactivity to seriously study these UFOs still called anomalous atmospheric phenomena.
