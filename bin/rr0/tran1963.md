- **March**: Professor Roger Jennison (Department of Electronics at the University of Kent) is flying late at night from New York to Washington. The plane enters a storm and at one point the aircraft is enveloped by a bright and audible electrical discharge. A few seconds later a [glowing sphere](BallLighting.html) of about 20 cm in diameter emerges from the cockpit and travels down the aisle of the aircraft to approximately 50 cm from Jennison. The [ball](BallLighting.html) moves in a straight trajectory along the length of the aisle at 75 cm above the floor and at a relative speed to the aircraft of about 1.5 m/s. It is blue-white in color and its apparent brightness is estimated to be about 5 to 10 W. No heat is felt when it passes close by and the limb darkening (like that of the Sun) gives it an almost solid appearance, indicating that it is optically opaque. No asymmetry is observed in any dimension so it is impossible to determine whether it is rotating or not [\[*Nature*, November 1969 \< *AA&ES Magazine*, June 1996\]]{.source}.

- Publication of the translated narrative of the discs discovered in 1938. What does this narrative tell? That a spaceship had landed in the region of Bayan-Khara Uula 12000 years ago and had never been able to leave due to lack of fuel. The local tribes would not have accepted the extraterrestrials and would have ended up massacring them almost entirely. The surviving extraterrestrials would however have left traces of their passage and 2 tribes, the Hams and the [Dropas](dropa.html) (fragile beings, reaching about 1.30 m in height and who, to this day, have resisted any attempt at ethnic classification) would be descended from a mixture between the space castaways and the natives of the time.
