[Coral Lorenzen](LorenzenCoralE.html) has an appointment with a young woman about whom she thinks to write an article for one of the newspapers she works for. She arrives on time but the young woman is not at home and [Lorenzen](LorenzenCoralE.html) decides to walk a few blocks to a nearby drugstore for a coffee. When she turns onto the main street she notices people standing in the street pointing at the sky. Looking in the designated direction, she sees a silver, elliptical-shaped object to the northeast. The editor-in-chief of the *Door County Advocate* and one of the journalists who are also in the street tell her that the object was described to them in a call from a point further north-east at Potawotami Park.
[Lorenzen](LorenzenCoralE.html) immediately enters the drugstore and calls the local police station, asking if there is a patrol car in the vicinity of Fish Creek. She is told yes and she then asks them to call and ask what they see. Shortly after she gets the answer: at about 60° elevation to the northeast they were looking at an object that was rather round with a silver color. She then goes back out into the street, positioning herself with her back to a certain area of a brick building and aligning the object at the top of a television antenna mast, carefully noting the point from which she was observing and the point where the antenna mast obscured the object. It did not obscure it too much, however, there was a bit of the object visible on either side of the mast, she will later state. Between conversations with the officers at Fish Creek and her own observations she tries several times to reach her husband, who is at home. He does not answer and she will later learn that he had gone out into the orchard to do some pruning. "I was sick with disappointment," Jim Lorenzen will say. "I had never seen anything in the sky that was so remarkable that I couldn't explain it, so I was disgusted to have missed the opportunity. However, [Coral Lorenzen](LorenzenCoralE.html) carefully measured the angles during the observation and when she provided the results to her husband, he was able to triangulate: they then estimated that the object, observed for 40 minutes, was at least 40 miles above the Earth and was about 780 feet in diameter, ruling out the explanation of a balloon or other mundane object. A third of the area of the object became a bright red shortly after being observed, giving the appearance, from Sturgeon Bay, of a silver cigar-shaped object with a glowing red base. When it was observed by the policeman 25 miles away in Fish Creek, it was almost circular with a "opening" red in the center too bright to be observed with ordinary glasses.

-   **June 30th:** A 40 year old man is riding a motorcycle with his 11 year old daughter in the Hasselbach region (former GDR). Suddenly, the child tells him she has seen "something" in the woods. Her father heads towards the indicated spot. He recounts: Thinking it was a deer, I approached quietly. Suddenly, I stopped, struck with amazement: in front of me, between the trees, stood two beings resembling men, wearing strange metallic suits. They were carefully examining the ground of a small clearing. Close to them stood a metal saucer of impressive size, measuring at least 8 meters in diameter. Its edges were pierced with two rows of openings. Its upper part was dominated by a cylindrical metal tube in a blackish color, shaped like a turret placed in the vertical axis of the craft. Under the effect of surprise, I called my daughter who had stayed near the motorcycle. But upon hearing my voice, the two metal-clad beings rushed towards the craft, entered the cylinder and locked themselves in. One of them had a kind of lamp on his chest that emitted flashes at regular intervals. In a few seconds, the edges of the craft where the openings I had mentioned appeared began to vibrate as if under the effect of an intense inner fire. They took on a green hue, then became vermilion, like metal heated to red. While these phenomena were occurring, I heard a faint humming. I had the impression that the cylindrical tube disappeared while the craft was lifting, which allowed me to observe that this tube extended underneath and served as a support. Taking advantage of this powerful support, the craft continued to rise. It was like a monstrous pink mushroom... When it had reached a certain height, it began to spin at an increasing speed. Then it moved away vibrating and without ceasing to spin like a top. The cylindrical tube had completely disappeared from the underside. The craft's ascent speed increased rapidly. Suddenly, it stopped horizontally and disappeared behind the hill at a dizzying speed. [[*These Mysterious UFOs*, op. cit., p. 133 and following.]]{.source}

The radars detected the UFOs and an USAF fighter was sent from a base in the east of the state of Washington. A radar and radio contact was maintained with the pilot of the fighter while he was guided towards the UFOs, themselves followed by radar. As he flew at 16000 feet (about 4800 m), the pilot claimed to have 2 of the UFOs in sight. Shortly afterwards, he and his plane simply disappeared!
