-   **May:** Start of a wave of observations, mainly in Scandinavia, but also in the rest of Europe, and even in North Africa.

- **June**


-   **June 9, Night:** In Helsinki (Finland), a bright multicolored light is observed above the city, with a trail of smoke and the sound of thunder. Its luminous trail persists for 10 minutes.


-   **June 10th, night:** Same phenomenon as the day before, but newspapers indicate that the object turned around to return in the direction it came from.


-   **June 12:** The Swedish General Staff requests the army to report their observations through official channels, admitting to be aware of the phenomenon since May.

- **July**


-   **July 9:** Over 200 sighting reports are received by the Swedish military, many of which describe tubular objects or objects shaped like a low-flying, slow-moving axis, with or without very little sound. First sightings of unusual flying objects brought to the attention of US intelligence services.


-   Sweden forms a "ghost rockets committee" to study the problem.


-   **July 19th, just before noon:** Knut Lindback and Beda Persson
    were working by the side of Lake Kolmjarv (northern Sweden) when
    they heard a buzzing in the sky. They saw a gray object,
    resembling an airplane or a rocket, rushing towards the lake. The
    object touched the water about 1 km away from them, creating a
    huge geyser. Later, Lindback would declare: I'm sure it was a
    solid object. It measured 2 m long and had a snub nose while the
    back was pointed. I thought I saw 2 protrusions on the sides,
    like wings, but I can't swear to it because everything happened
    very quickly. After this incident which had another witness by the
    lake's shore, soldiers undertook a two-week search, without
    finding any trace of what the three individuals had seen.


-   **July 8th, 11:55 PM:** At Vuoremijoki (Norway), 2 loud
    detonations were heard by 2 people, followed by a very loud
    hissing, as if it came from a welding machine. An oblong cloud
    of "steam and heat" then rose from behind a hill called
    Kivitunturi. Out of this cloud emerged an object that looked
    like a projectile. It maintained an ascending trajectory of 30
    to 40°, in the direction of the Southwest. The distance of the
    phenomenon was estimated between 5 and 8 km. The visibility
    was good, and the Sun was up. The length of the projectile was
    estimated between 10 and 15 m

-   **July 9** : First reports received by the Swedish army.


-   **July 11, 2:30 PM:** At Andebu (Norway), work was being done at the Berg farm when a deafening impact was heard. A large splash of water was created in a pond, as if a body had been thrown into it. A blue-gray smoke appeared on the lake, and it was this smoke that drew the attention of the witnesses to the lake.

-   **20 h 55 :** In Oslo (Norway), a luminous object passes over the city. It comes from the North-East and disappears towards the South, at the speed of a jet plane. The witnesses refute the possibility of a shooting star. The light is bigger and more intense than that of a usual star, and it leaves behind a trail of smoke. The altitude is estimated to be that of a normal aircraft, and the object maintains a straight trajectory during the entire observation [\[Aftenposten, 15 July 1946, 1\]]{.source}.

-   **11 PM:** In Stavanger (Norway), a yellow-red luminous object approaches from the Southeast. It looks like a projectile, flying at high speed and high altitude. It disappears towards the Northwest, always maintaining the same altitude. There are 4 witnesses, who all reject the possibility of a [meteor](Meteore.html).

-   **23 h 35 :** A Son (Norway), an object with wings emitting light, sound and smoke was observed.

- **From 12:00 to 12:30:** At Mjøsa (Norway), several witnesses see objects resembling V1s coming from the West at low altitude (about 50 m). The witnesses first hear a loud whistling, not exactly that of an aircraft. The objects fly so low that they make the trees sway. They all fall into Lake Mjøsa, about 2 km from the West coast and about 7 km from Minnesund. They have the shape of cigars, measure 2.5 m long, with long wings of about 1 m behind the nose. The front and back parts shine like metal, but the middle section where the wings are is black. The wings seem to beat lightly. No fire or light is seen. The objects are close to each other, one in front of the other, and their trajectory is like that of a stone thrown. When they reach Lake Mjøsa, the water splashes several meters into the air. No explosion is heard. The sky is clear and the water is calm.

-   **July 30:** The Swedish army has collected over 600 reports (over 1000 according to other sources) concerning objects nicknamed "ghost rockets" (*[ghost rockets](GhostRockets.html)*). These are generally described as having the general shape of cigars, with orange flames appearing to come out of the back. The observations are generally nocturnal. The General Staff declares the situation to be extremely serious; indeed, the observed objects, real, are detected by military radars. American officials share the concern of their Swedish counterparts, as the nearby Peenemünde base fell into Russian hands at the end of the war. This test center was used for the development of secret German weapons and may still shelter unusual devices.

-   **20 h :** A Russeviksodden (Norway) a witness observed a light
    ball rising from the horizon, between Holmengråvika and
    Rødberget. It then descended and fell halfway between the sea and
    the horizon, between Holmengråvika and Rødberget. The witness was
    on board the d/s *Hekkingen*. After the impact nothing was seen
    for 30 s, then a fire appeared with a red color, and continued
    for about 3 min. The position of the d/s *Hekkingen* was 3/4 of a
    nautical mile Northeast of Russeviksodden in the direction
    (South-half-West) of Kirkenes. The trajectory of the light ball is
    assumed from North to West. It can be seen from the port,
    traveling very fast, about 5 seconds. The witness estimated its
    altitude to be about 400 m, and to be about 2 nautical miles from
    the object. It was lightly raining and beginning to get dark at
    this time, but the witness could still see the outlines of the
    surrounding mountains. The cloud cover was at 1000 m. Another
    witness on the d/s *Hekkingen* also saw the fire, with binoculars.

The object was visible for 3 minutes, until it was above Årsteinfjellet, where it disintegrated into 2 parts, with the front part being the smallest.

-   **October 9th, the Night**: In San Diego (California), 16 people are gathered on a roof to observe a meteor shower when a winged object of white-blue color appears in the sky. It looks like an extremely long plane, with 2 red lights, leaving a luminous trail. One of the witnesses, Harold T. Wilkins, recounts: This strange object was certainly not an airplane. But the wings, which moved, were much too large to belong to a bird. In fact, it looked more like butterfly wings. The object emitted a red glow. The object becomes clearly visible when it passes in front of the [Moon](Moon.html). Some of the witnesses will say that it looked like a giant bat [\[Harold T.

-   **December 30th, at dawn:** Near Morrow Bay (California), the
    American writer Ella Young describes her observation: Cut out on the
    golden sky, it was very black. It came straight towards us and,
    given the curvature of its wings, it looked like a bat. I'm not
    quite sure if there was any movement at the ends of the wings; but
    this strange machine seemed to remain motionless for several minutes
    and its shape was very precise. Suddenly, either it descended or the
    banks of fog rose - perhaps both at the same time - but the machine
    passed behind the clouds never to reappear. Immediately after, a
    flood of color ran across the surface of the sea [\[Keel 1975\]]{.source}.
