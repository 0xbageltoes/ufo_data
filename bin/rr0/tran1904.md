-   **February 28:** Off the coast of Northern California, part of the crew of the *USS Supply*, a Pacific Fleet replenishment vessel commanded by [Frank Schofield](SchofieldFrankH.html), can follow the movements of objects resembling [meteors](Meteore.html) and rushing in small tight groups towards their ship. The trajectories of the bright red objects are unpredictable, diving and then suddenly bouncing towards the clouds before disappearing to the Northwest-Northwest. [Frank Schofield](SchofieldFrankH.html) tried to describe them: one, egg-shaped, seemed to lead the squadron, was 6 times larger than the Sun. Others were the size of the Sun [\[Lieutenant Frank M. Schofield's Report\]]{.source} [\[*Monthly Western Review*\]]{.source}.


-   **Night**: Late at night. In Transylvania (Romania), a farmer is in
    the fields (\...). Suddenly he sees a wheel of fire above the
    Muntii Apuseni mountains. The wheel is coming towards him at great
    speed. The farmer looks, powerless. When the wheel is near him, it
    transforms into a living being that stares at him for a long time
    without saying anything. [\[Article by Lucian Belaga in *Hronicul si
