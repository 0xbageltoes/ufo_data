-   **March 16:** In Chamonix, J. Payot observed the slow horizontal progression of a bolide from the north to the east. The object was magnificent, conical, as big as the Moon, orange in front and round, with red flames at the back. Drawing [\[BSAF, 1938\]]{.source}.


-   **Summer, on a hot night:** In Herne (Norway), Sverre Brevik, 21,
    couldn't sleep. He went out to relax and appreciate the view of
    nature. Suddenly he noticed a sound, like a generator increasing its
    speed. The whole area then became illuminated, the sound gaining in
    strength, making his head hurt. About 20 m away from him, a
    bluish object rose up. It had a reddish halo around it, and what
    seemed to be openings around it that blew out a blue-white exhaust.
    The smell was horrible, reminding him of burnt rubber. His eyes and
    throat stung. The object rose without any sound, then fell like a
    feather (falling leaf motion). It measured between 20 and 25 m in
    diameter, and 2 to 3 m high. The witness felt like he was being
    observed by the object. It rose again and circled the area, again
    illuminated by the things resembling exhaust, as it disappeared
    without a sound in the direction of the North. 10 years later he
    would observe an identical object [\[HJEMMET\] \[UFO-NYT, 4/1970,

- In the mountainous region of Bayan-Khara Uula (on the border of China and Tibet), Chinese archaeologist Tschi Pu-tei discovers a number of mysterious tombs. Their walls are decorated with engravings of beings wearing round helmets and they contain skeletons of small size (about 1.30 m) with an unusually large skull. Even better, the Chinese researcher finds 716 "discs" thick 2 cm and the size of a 33 rpm vinyl, pierced in the center and covered with a thin layer of cobalt. These discs present double track spirals starting from the center to the outside, spirals inside which are engraved some kind of hieroglyphs forming a narrative. The mysterious text will remain untranslatable for about 20 years before yielding to the determination of a certain Professor Tsum Um-nui, from the Beijing Prehistory Academy, and 4 of his colleagues. Its publication will only be authorized in 1963, relating the landing of extraterrestrials in -10000. The description of the discs strangely resembles that of a Nepalese plate dating from -2000 (see this date).


-   **November 20, 5 PM:** In Pont-Saint-Vincent, J. Bessemoulin, head of the Nancy-Essey ONM station, observed an ovoid object, with a brightness and diameter comparable to that of the Moon, slowly progressing while leaving behind a luminous trail for 1'15". The object emitted a faint whistle, had mauve stripes in front of its round front, and pale blue flames at its conical back. Drawing identical to that of Chamonix, on March 16 [\[BSAF 1938\]]{.source}.


-   **December**: The disk recovered by the Germans in July/August 1937 is brought into the hands of the highest German scientists north of Munich. In the surrounding mountains an old salt mine is converted into a facility to study and reproduce, as much as possible, the device. It quickly becomes apparent that this vessel is not a top secret apparatus of any other nation on Earth. The Nazi scientists have incredible success in dissecting and understanding the vessel and its contents. No other nation is aware.

-   (Or 1939) In Juminda, Estonia, an object 1 m long and brown-greenish was followed by 2 observers until it suddenly disappeared [\[Vallée, Passport to Magonia, page 189\]]{.source}.
