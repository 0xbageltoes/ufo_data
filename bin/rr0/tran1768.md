-   **September:** Goethe, then a young man of 16, travels to the
    University of Leipzig with two passengers from Frankfurt. Most of
    the journey takes place in the rain and the carriage sometimes has
    difficulty climbing hills. As the travelers left their seats to walk
    behind the horses, the young man noticed a strange and luminous
    object on the ground: Suddenly, in a ravine to the right of the
    road, I saw a kind of amphitheater wonderfully illuminated. In a
    tubular space shone an incalculable number of small lights placed
    one on top of the other; and they shone so brightly that the eye
    was dazzled. But what troubled most in this vision was that the
    lights were not fixed, they jumped here and there, went up and down
    and vice versa, in all directions. The largest number of them,
    however, remained stable and radiated. It was with the greatest
    secrecy that I agreed, when I was called, to move away from this
    spectacle that I would have liked to examine more closely\... It
    remains to be seen whether this was a pandemonium of goblins or an
    assembly of luminous creatures; I cannot decide. [\[6th book of his
    autobiography according to Kenneth Anger, film director and occult
    scholar\]]{.source}
