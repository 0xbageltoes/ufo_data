    stayed there all night. Nobody knew what it was. Until it started
    to descend\... But finally, when it descended from the mountain,
    slowly, it appeared to us as 2 lights. One after the other. Very
    close\... The corporal approaches the light asking it to identify
    itself. He advances and gradually disappears entering a kind of
    mist. 15 minutes later he reappears asking for help. When he is
    found, his beard has grown several mm and his watch shows the date
    of April 30th [\[VSD 2007 H, Interview of the corporal on

A few seconds later, they rise and disappear into the night.

-   **September 18/19:** In Tehran (Iran), alerted by several calls from civilians reporting a large, very bright star, and two airport controllers detecting an unidentified object, the US army dispatched an [F-4](appareils.html#F4) Phantom to meet it. The pilot confirmed the existence of the UFO, round in shape. When he approached, it accelerated several times the speed of sound, then, making a sudden turn, it began to pursue his fighter for a few minutes. When the pilot wanted to fire, the controls did not respond: all instruments, including the radio, refused to work within a radius of 5 km around the object. He had to return to base. A second F-4 was sent on reconnaissance. Upon arriving in view of the target, an object resembling a missile dived on the plane. The pilot had to dive to escape the fire. The object stopped abruptly and immediately returned to "merge" into the UFO.

- **September 30**

-   **9 PM:** In the Yonne, gendarmes observe the ballet of several
    luminous devices. Their report describes: We observe from our
    observation point that luminous sets are evolving in the terrestrial
    atmosphere at vertiginous speeds... The investigators count 7 of
    them. These unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are, for some, in
    the shape of diamonds whose angles are lit by several lights
    emitting a whitish incandescent light. Some of them have a strong
    orange-red light in the middle, clearly visible, sending out
    flashes. Others, circular, give the impression of being adorned on
    their periphery with a concentric ramp with a good number of
    lights: these are white or yellowish. They get lost in the
    infinite. None of them change shape or color. These UFOs move
    making very disordered movements, ascending or descending,
    rotary or spiroid, at lightning speeds. They stabilize, restart
    abruptly... They disappear or reappear suddenly during their
    evolutions. During the entire observation made by the military of
    the [gendarmerie](Gendarmerie.html), no sound of engine or
    reactor is heard from these UFOs and we do not notice any trace of
    their passage. These UFOs do not come from any particular
    direction, in the same way that they disappear towards any point.


- **9:30 PM:** A UFO approaches the observers: A large glowing reddish ball appears. It stops, then moves again at a reduced speed and horizontally over a distance of about 600 m. At this moment, its altitude is estimated at 60 m. A witness observes it with binoculars. He only notices an orange-red sphere, surrounded by a bright and narrow halo, without noticing any activity on or around it. The mysterious craft stops at the horn of a poplar grove and fades into the darkness... Its slow maneuver lasted a few minutes.


-   **21 h 45 :** UFO activity gradually subsides and the last one is seen at 21 h 45, after which the sky regained its tranquility.

-   **December 21**: In his response to Frank Press's letter of July 21, Robert Frosch, administrator of [NASA](NASA.html), refuses to mount a research effort or convene a symposium, considering the absence of physical evidence that can be analyzed in the laboratory. However, he adds, if, in the future, some material evidence is brought to our attention, it would be fully justified for the [NASA](NASA.html) laboratory to study any unexplained organic or inorganic sample and publish the results; we are ready to bona fide examine physical evidence from credible sources. We leave the door wide open to such a possibility [\[Sturrock 2001\]]{.source}.
