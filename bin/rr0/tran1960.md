- Along the coasts of Argentina, two unknown submerged vessels are noticed. In the Nuevo Gulf, detectors of the Argentine navy reveal the presence of a submarine quietly settled in the mud at the bottom, motionless. After making the usual warnings, not getting any reaction, the sailors send bombs in its direction. Two other vessels then appear on the sonars. A few hours later, when all the passages leading to the open sea are watched, it is noticed that they have all 3 disappeared. The Argentines believe they have won the game when, after the absence of any manifestation and the publication of triumphant communiqués, the "ghosts" come back to the charge. A fantastic pursuit begins and lasts several weeks, during which 6 unknown submarines are detected.

-   **April 11th, 6am:** As part of his [OZMA](projets.html#OZMA) project, [Frank Drake](DrakeFrankD.html) pointed the newly-equipped 29.5m diameter receiver of the [NRAO](NRAO.html) at two stars 11 light-years away, listening intently on the 1420 megahertz frequency suggested as ideal by Cocconi and Morrison's paper the previous year. On the first day, [Drake](DrakeFrankD.html) thought he had hit the jackpot. Aiming at *Epsilon Eridani*, he immediately recorded a pulsing signal of clearly artificial origin that lasted only 5 minutes. It is now thought to have been an aircraft flying at very high altitude.

- A photograph was taken of a squadron of UFOs in the shape of a "V" above Albuquerque (New Mexico).

-   **2 h :** In Canada, an astronomer goes with his brother to chase
    a strange sphere that was reported to him: We got within 100 m of
    the object. It hovered above a large tree, which was about 35 m
    tall. The object [\[\...\]]{.source} appeared to be circular in
    shape and was therefore generally a spheroid. It was intensely
    bright against the dark sky and it went through all the colors of
    the spectrum with a period of about 2 s (period quite irregular).
    [\[\...\]]{.source} The object seemed to examine the tree quite
    closely. It described circles around the top, staying between 15 and
    30 m from the ground, passing in front of the tree, then being
    clearly visible through the branches when it passed behind again.
    The witnesses get closer but the craft disappears: It left almost
    due south and disappeared over the horizon.

- The red alert announcing the launch of an attack against the USSR alarms the bombers from the Travis Air Force Base (USA) after the radar detection of "targets" flying over the North Pole towards the United States. The "targets" disappear from the screens. They will later be explained as reflections of the Moon. The disaster is narrowly avoided.

- The press widely takes up a collision that takes place in the port of New York between the tanker *Alkaïd* and an unknown half-submerged object of which no trace was found.

-   **Summer, 2 h**: In Walkerton (Ontario), 5 policemen observe and
    pursue for 1 hour in 2 cars a small object of about 1 m in
    diameter. The policemen in radio liaison try to follow a nocturnal
    light that moves at low altitude, along various country roads, then
    the light stops near a large tree, in the middle of a cultivated
    field, and the policemen's cars arrive at a distance of less than
    100 m from this tree. The witnesses observe for a long time with
    caution then try to approach on foot: It hovered above a large
    tree, which rose alone in the middle of a cultivated field. We were
    about 100 m from the tree, which was about 35 m high. The object,
    which subtended an angle of about 1/4 °, which implies a real
    diameter less than 0.90 m, appeared circular in shape and was
    therefore probably a spheroid. It was intensely bright against the
    dark background of the sky and it passed through all the colors of
    the spectrum with a fairly irregular period of about 2 s. Given its
    brightness, I may have slightly overestimated its angular
    dimension and 1/4 ° should perhaps be considered a maximum. The
    minimum estimate would certainly be 1/8 °. The object seemed to
    examine the tree quite closely. It described circles around the
    top, standing between 15 and 30 m from the ground, passing in
    front of the tree, then clearly visible through the branches when
    it passed behind. We watched it continue this apparent
    "reconnaissance" of the tree for several minutes. It moved
    deliberately and intentionally in its inspection of the tree,
    making short stops at points of interest and giving a distinct
    impression of intelligent behavior. Then, as we absolutely wanted
    to photograph it, we crossed the fence and slowly approached the
    tree, on the side facing West. We had barely gone 3 m when it
    "noticed" us and, with a powerful and silent acceleration, it left
    almost due south and disappeared over the horizon, with a slightly
    ascending trajectory, and 2.5 s approximately, without any noise.
    I believe that one can rely on my evaluation of distances and
    times because at the time I did a lot of athletics and was therefore
    well trained in this respect. Even taking into account the
    exceptional circumstances, these figures are probably accurate to
    within 20% [\[Poher 2003\].]{.source}
