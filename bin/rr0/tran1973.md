-   **On a Friday, 7 PM:** Mike Shea is driving his car when suddenly, a beam of light illuminates a barn located about 50 m from the road. Silent and surrounded by flashing lights, a large UFO appears. Anxiety begins for Mike Shea once the beam turns off as he believes he can feel something approaching behind him. As the UFO flies over him, he feels an electric shock along his spine. He eventually reaches Olney, his destination, but discovers with astonishment that he took 2 hours more than expected. After a decade of nightmares and diffuse malaise, Mike Shea decides to call [Budd Hopkins](HopkinsBudd.html), the famous specialist in abduction cases. Hypnotic regression sessions allow him to remember the abduction he suffered after being flown over by the UFO. He suddenly saw on the side of the road 4 strange entities: 3 of large size (about 1.80 m) and one smaller. They looked like large elongated insects, as if wrapped in a dark plastic armor, and stood upright on their rather arched hind legs. Their two pairs of front legs were used to grasp. Their head was rounded and their eyes globular. He was taken inside the UFO where he underwent various more or less traumatic examinations.

- **October**

- In the October issue of *Pursuit*, Hubert Malthaner, after a long investigation into the metal cube discovered in 1885, indicates that the famous "cube" had never actually disappeared from the Salzburg museum (as was believed in 1910), since it had in fact always been in the Vöcklabrück regional museum (Austria). He supports his claims with a photograph of the cube, showing that it is far from being as artificially-appearing as it had been proclaimed. He finally indicates that an analysis carried out in 1986 (1886?) at the Vienna Natural History Museum had established that the object was simply a mass of cast iron. Finally, it also seems that the cube was not found in a mine but by a worker from a foundry who was breaking coal blocks [[Nolane 1998, pages 15-16]]{.source}

-   **18 h 45** : [Observation of Cocoyoc](1973-11-03_Cocoyoc.html) (Mexico).


-   **7:30 PM**: In New Hampshire, the witness's neighbor calls him to look through his telescope at a silver, saucer-shaped craft with 4 glowing red windows at one end, which he thinks is hovering over a radio tower 1 mile away. The witness eventually goes back home and goes to bed. Shortly after 0 h, the witness's dog seems agitated and he gets up to let it out. Going into the kitchen, he distinguishes 1 light coming from outside. He looks out the door and sees that the light is a diffuse glow coming from 2 silver-clad creatures with large pointed ears, big noses, and dark egg-shaped eyes that look like holes. Their boots are heel-less, with the ends curved up. They are picking things up from the ground and gathering them in a bag. The witness goes to his room to alert his wife, who doesn't want anything to do with it, takes a 0.38 caliber automatic pistol and returns to the kitchen, inserting more cartridges. On his master's order, the raging German shepherd jumps into attack. Approaching the intruders, he stops in his tracks and returns whimpering into the house. The humanoids continue their collection. At this moment the witness trembles and can no longer hold his weapon, let alone use it effectively, but he shouts that he will shoot if the beings come any closer. At the same time, the man was telling his wife what was happening. She didn't want to answer until she heard that the creatures were leaving. She then reached the kitchen, only seeing their glow disappear into the woods. At 0 h 30, the police called arrive. No trace is found on the hard ground, covered with pine cones.

- Launch of *Mariner 10* towards Mercury.

-   **November 30th, 7 PM:** Two pilots and a technician spot an
    unknown glowing ball above Turin airport. The commander of a *piper*
    attempts to pursue it. He describes: "I saw in front of me an
    object that looked like a sphere of intense and very white
    brightness. This light decreased and increased: it never went out.
    Only its intensity varied. The object was a bit higher than my
    plane and so I started to climb to its height to approach it.
    While climbing, I had the clear impression (my control devices
    confirmed it) that the object was going up or down in front of me.
    Taking advantage of a moment when the object was below, I went
    down, I accelerated to exceed 400 km/h. But I did not manage to
    reach the object, because it moved away from my plane more and
    more, increasing its speed compared to mine. The craft moved away
    towards the south (\...) The UFO was spotted by the airport's
    radars. Several people will testify to having seen, that evening,
    a very large light above the city of Turin. The case has a great
    media impact.
