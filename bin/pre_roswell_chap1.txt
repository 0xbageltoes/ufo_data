Nov. 18, 1896               Sacramento CA. On November 18, a peculiar aerial phenomenon was observed in Sacramento, where an 
18:00                       electric arc lamp-like object moved through the sky in an erratic manner, seemingly propelled by an 
                            unknown force. Witnesses claimed to hear human voices emanating from the object, giving directions to 
                            avoid collisions with structures, and guiding its ascent when it neared the ground. The incident left 
                            citizens astonished by the unusual sight and audible interactions in the sky. (Chapter 1, Ref 1)

Nov. 26, 1896               San Francisco Bay Area, CA. An enigmatic craft appeared over San Francisco Bay. Described as a large, black 
                            cigar-shaped object with a fish-like tail, the approximately 100-foot-long airship exhibited high-speed movement 
                            and maneuverability that far surpassed known technologies of the time, like dirigibles. The witnesses were 
                            astonished by the object's unprecedented features, as it defied the technological norms of 1896 and foreshadowed 
                            a series of subsequent mysterious airship sightings across California, setting the stage for a broader national 
                            phenomenon in the following year. (Chapter 1, Ref 2)
3                           
Jan. 30, 1897               Hastings, Nebraska. A mysterious airship was repeatedly spotted near Hastings, a farming community in Nebraska, in 
                            January 1897. Witnesses observed the object hovering at varying altitudes, displaying powerful artificial lights and 
                            performing maneuvers at remarkable speeds before vanishing as mysteriously as it had appeared. (Chapter 1, Ref 3)
4                           
Jan. 1897                   40 miles south of Hastings, near Kansas border. A prayer group south of Hastings reported a sighting of a conical-shaped 
                            object with a bright headlight, six smaller lights, and two sets of wings on each side, along with a large fan-shaped rudder. 
                            (Chapter 1, Ref 4)

Apr. 1897                   Kansas City, Kansas. Residents observed a bright light with changing colors, emitting a beam of light akin 
                            to a searchlight, exhibiting controlled movement rather than comet-like motion, and alternating between northwest and opposite 
                            directions. (Chapter 1, Ref 5)
6
Jan. 1897                   Everest, Kansas. The town of Everest had a detailed sighting of an airborne craft that hovered over the area for 80 minutes. The 
                            craft was described as having a 25-to-30-foot-long car resembling an Indian canoe with light wings, including two triangular ones. 
                            It appeared to be powered by the same source that provided light, with the brightness changing as the craft's altitude varied, and 
                            observers noted variations in the color of the light. (Chapter 1, Ref 6)
7
Jan. 1897                   Iowa. A farmer in Iowa had a close encounter with a mystery airship equipped with incandescent lamps on its sides. As the craft 
                            maneuvered overhead, a grappling rope from the car hooked onto the farmer's trousers, but he managed to grab a tree and avoid being 
                            taken away. Despite skepticism from neighbors, the farmer stood by his account due to his reputation for honesty. (Chapter 1, Ref 7)
8.
Jan. 1897                   Western Iowa. A dairy farmer encountered a dark, lighted aerial object resembling a long car with a cigar-shaped bag floating above it. 
                            The sighting was interrupted when the witness' team of horses panicked, causing him to be thrown into a ditch. Upon recovering, he 
                            saw the object ascend and vanish into the night. (Chapter 1, Ref 8)
9
Apr. 13, 1897               Battle Creek, Michigan. Michigan became a focal point for mysterious airship sightings in mid-April, with around 50 witnesses in Battle Creek 
20:55                       reporting a strange aerial object resembling an airship. The object emitted sparks and buzzed as it descended, then ascended in a 
                            perpendicular manner before vanishing, leaving reputable citizens puzzled about its nature and identity. (Chapter 1, Ref 9)
10
Apr. 16, 1897               Hudson, Michigan. A group of around 25 credible witnesses observed a cigar-shaped airship with yellow lights at the bow and stern. The object 
                            exhibited a mechanical arrangement for propulsion, moving from the west in a northerly direction at varying altitudes and becoming a topic 
                            of discussion in the city due to the reliability of the observers. (Chapter 1, Ref 10)
11
Apr. 14, 1897               Bay City, Michigan. Residents witnessed a sizable, conical-shaped airship with red lights at both ends, gradually descending from the sky 
00:30                       around 12:30 AM. The object was described as being around 50 to 75 feet long, one-third as wide, and emitted a dull red glow, although no 
                            visible means of propulsion could be identified. (Chapter 1, Ref 11)
12
Apr. 14, 1897               Saginaw Michigan. Two policemen in Saginaw, Michigan, encountered a similar cigar-shaped object around 30 feet long with a red and yellow 
02:30                       light shining through canvas, moving at approximately 25 miles per hour in a southerly direction. The officers were drawn to the scene by a 
                            drum-like noise, and the object had a distinct feature hanging about 10 feet below its main body. (Chapter 1, Ref 12)
13
Apr. 14, 1897               Casstown, Ohio. A farmer spotted a bird-shaped object resembling an enormous flying creature, with wings and a substantial tail or rudder, 
evening                     flying at around 150 feet above the ground. The witness heard what seemed like distant music and a human voice from the object before it 
                            disappeared into the evening twilight. (Chapter 1, Ref 13)
14                      
Apr. 15, 1897               Dunkirk Ohio. A flying object with wings, propellers, and lights was observed by two witnesses in a railroad tower, who reported hearing voices 
                            from it due to its proximity to the ground. Described as the size of a wagon bed, the object had a red light in the front and a greenish-yellow 
                            light at the back. (Chapter 1, Ref 14)
15
Apr. 15, 1897               Fairfield County, Ohio. On the same night, farmers in Fairfield County, Ohio, witnessed a cigar-shaped object with two pairs of canvas wings 
                            attached to it. The object appeared to be at an angle of around 45 degrees, as if it had recently landed and was ascending to avoid 
                            lower wind currents. (Chapter 1, Ref 15)
16
Apr. 16, 1897               Logan, Ohio. Continuing the pattern of anomalous events, a group in Logan, Ohio, witnessed a sudden flash of light followed by a large, dark, 
                            slow-flying shape over the town. The object was close enough to be heard, prompting three members of the group to pursue it in a buggy. They 
                            managed to get within 50 feet of the object, which was described as a black, boat-shaped airship about 40 feet long, before it swiftly 
                            rose and vanished into the night, with the witnesses reporting hearing voices from inside it. (Chapter 1, Ref 16)
17
Apr. 16, 1897               Upper Sandusky, Ohio. A distinct airship was spotted, described as being "40 feet in length, shaped like an auger, and having large windmill-like 
                            wings." The object, equipped with purple, yellow, and green lights, was seen diving towards the ground before ascending again and flying northward.
                            (Chapter 1, Ref 17)
18
Apr. 18, 1897               Sistersville, West Virginia. A mysterious airship caused excitement in Sistersville, West Virginia, by hovering over the town and casting bright 
                            searchlights down. Described as cigar-shaped with large wings, the object featured flashing red, white, and green lights on its sides and ends. 
                            Those viewing it from a hill estimated its size to be around 180 feet in length and approximately 50 feet in diameter at the widest point. (Chapter 1, Ref 18)
19
May. 1897                   Marble, Washington. In northeast Washington, the town of Marble experienced an air of excitement in May 1897 when an airship was spotted over the 
                            mountains in the southern part of town. The airship, recognized by its fans and a rotating front apparatus, moved rapidly in a northeasterly direction 
                            before disappearing from view, leaving the mill crew and townspeople stirred by the sight. (Chapter 1, Ref 19)
20
Apr. 11, 1897               Lock Mills, Indiana. During April 1897, amidst the airship sightings, some witnesses reported observing low-flying airships with visible occupants. 
                            In Lock Mills, Indiana, a man claimed to have been visited by an airship operator who projected "magic lantern" pictures on the side of his barn. 
                            (Chapter 1, Ref 20)
21
Apr. 19, 1897               Greenfield, Illinois. The postmaster of Greenfield, Illinois, witnessed an airship flying about 150 feet above him in the woods. He reported seeing 
                            a woman on a deck at the front of the craft, using a net to catch pigeons. (Chapter 1, Ref 21)
22
Apr. 19, 1897               9 miles from Greenfield, Illinois. A piece of paper with a message was found about nine miles from the April 19, 1897 Greenfield, Illinois sighting. 
                            The message was written on a letterhead from "Airship Co., Oakland, Cal.," describing a successful scheme of catching birds with a net and indicating 
                            the incredible speed of the airship, which had traveled between St. Louis, Chicago, and Kansas City in remarkably short periods of time. If 
                            accurate, this would indicate a speed of over 200 miles per hour, far beyond 19th-century norms. (Chapter 1, Ref 22)
23
Apr. 24, 1897               Louisville, Kentucky. A man observed a buzzing sound and spotted a cigar-shaped airship at an altitude of around 200 feet. The witness noticed 
evening                     a man standing at the stern of the craft, and two other men sitting in the helm, before the airship departed toward the south. (Chapter 1, Ref 23)
24                            
Apr. 25, 1897               Merkel, Texas. Witnesses returning from church observed a heavy object being dragged along by a rope, which eventually caught on a railroad rail. 
                            Upon looking up, they believed they saw an airship with lights in several windows, including a bright front light resembling a locomotive headlight. 
                            A man was seen descending the rope and cutting it when he noticed people nearby, before sailing off in a northeast direction, leaving the anchor 
                            on display at a local blacksmith shop. (Chapter 1, Ref 24)
25
Apr. 27, 1897               Elkton, Kentucky. A family was startled by their barking watchdog and saw a large cigar-shaped object with white wings in the sky. The object had 
19:00                       visible guy ropes and rods, and three men were seen aboard, waving their hands as the machine flew a zig-zag course, suggesting it might have 
                            been malfunctioning. (Chapter 1, Ref 25)
26
Apr. 27, 1897               Pennsylvania. A flying machine resembling a large cigar was observed by reputable witnesses, who noted three visible men aboard the craft. 
19:00                       The airship flew at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet and appeared to be under the complete control of its operators, as reported by a 
                            local newspaper. (Chapter 1, Ref 26)
27
Dec. 7, 1896                Camptonville, California. Residents were alerted by cries when a large airship was flying over their town. The craft appeared to land nearby, and 
evening                     a group of five men investigated, finding a bearded man on board who communicated using an "alphabet." The man indicated he lived in the 
                            Montezuma Mountains with his family but declined further questioning. The airship was observed flying off the next day. (Chapter 1, Ref 27)
28
Apr. 13, 1897               Girard, Illinois. A telegraph operator received a message that an airship was approaching. A craft around 100 feet long and 25 feet wide, with 
                            a large letter "M" on its side, landed nearby. Witnesses observed several occupants in the "control car" before the airship rapidly ascended 
                            and flew northward. (Chapter 1, Ref 28)
29
Apr. 15, 1897               Outside Springfield, Illinois. Two farm workers claimed to have witnessed an airship landing, with a bearded man emerging from it and inquiring 
                            about the place. Another man and a woman were inside the car. The bearded occupant mentioned that the crew rested on the ground during the 
                            day and had just flown from Quincy to Springfield in 30 minutes. He pointed to the letter "M" on the car and stated his intention to report 
                            to the government when Cuba became free. After their conversation, the man reentered the craft, pressed a button, and the airship departed. (Chapter 1, Ref 29)
30
Apr. 14, 1897               Lake Erie near Cleveland. Two men on a fishing boat encountered a 40-foot-long object with a canopy that initially appeared to be another ship. 
                            A young man was seen fishing from the deck, accompanied by a woman and a child. As the fishing boat approached, the other craft released a 
                            large colored "balloon," ascended to around 500 feet, circled briefly, and then flew away. (Chapter 1, Ref 30)
31
Apr. 15, 1897               Lynn Grove, Iowa. An airship flew over Lynn Grove, Iowa, and seemed to land just outside town on the 15th. Local residents investigated, but

                            and interactions in great detail, including their gestures and the inside of the airship. His account was supported by his employer and 
                            family members who vouched for his reliability. (Chapter 1, Refs 32, 33, 34)
33
Apr. 16, 1897               Elburn Illinois. Farmers encountered a landed airship with two occupants who claimed to be traveling from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast 
                            along the Northwestern railway. The machine was described as lightweight and made of aluminum-like material. (Chapter 1, Ref 35)
34
Apr. 17, 1897               Texas. A prison official witnessed a landed airship resembling a large "whaleback ship" with wings and fins. The craft displayed colored 
                            banners and dazzling lights before rapidly ascending and disappearing. (Chapter 1, Ref 36)
35
Apr. 17, 1897               Conroe Texas. Three strangers who claimed to have landed their airship in Conroe, Texas, interacted with locals at a restaurant, stating they 
                            were flying from San Francisco to Cuba. After their departure, a brightly-lit airship was seen flying over the town. (Chapter 1, Ref 37)

                            consisting of a man with a long beard, a young man, and a woman. The bearded man explained that they were traveling in the airship, and they 
                            invited the officers to take a ride. The witnesses left and returned later, but the airship had departed. (Chapter 1, Ref 41)
40
Apr. 19, 1897               near Norway, Wisconsin. A boy claimed to witness an airship landing on a farm. He reported seeing several occupants leaving the craft to 
                            gather water, which they poured into a container that resembled a boiler on the ship. (Chapter 1, Ref 42)
41
Apr. 17, 1897               Lexington, Kentucky. Three men witnessed an airship landing. They saw a man around 40 years old from the craft collecting water from a 
evening                     stream. Despite their attempts to converse, the man remained silent and soon departed in the airship. (Chapter 1, Ref 43)
42
Apr. 17, 1897               Upland, Indiana. An airship landed at a feed mill near Upland, Indiana. A heavyset man with long whiskers emerged, bought cattle feed, 
evening                     and upon returning to the ship, he pressed a button that caused the airship to take off and depart. (Chapter 1, Ref 44)
43
Apr. 17, 1897               Muncie, Indiana. an airship landed near Muncie, and one of the occupants requested milk from a farmer. After receiving the milk, the 
                            man pulled on a cord, and the airship took off and flew away. (Chapter 1, Ref 45)
44
Apr. 21, 1897               Harrisburg, Arkansas. An ex-senator encountered an airship crew who revealed their craft's anti-gravity operation. The crew consisted 
                            of an elderly man with a long beard, two younger men, and a woman. The crew shared their ability to suspend gravity using a wire, 
                            and after a polite conversation, they flew off in their airship. (Chapter 1, Ref 46)
45
Apr. 22, 1897               Texas. A farmer encountered an airship with bright lights and wings that landed on his property. The occupant of the airship requested 
                            lubricating oil and tools, offering money in exchange. The occupant declined to allow the farmer to approach the airship but 
                            promised to reciprocate the kindness by taking him on a future trip. The farmer managed to gather some items, and upon his return, 
                            the aeronaut thanked him, shook his hand, and mentioned flying to Greece in a matter of days before taking off at high speed. (Chapter 1, Ref 47)

1896                        San Luis, California. In the 1896 California incidents preceding the 1897 airship wave, a sailor in San Luis Obispo claimed to have 
                            been taken on an airship ride by a Spanish-speaking pilot and a female companion. This adventurous exception involved a flight 
                            experience in an airship. (Chapter 1, Ref 48)
47
Apr. 16, 1897               Bluffton, Indiana. A cigar-shaped airship descended in the village with two men and a boy on board. The villagers interacted with them, 
                            and some members of the fire department were taken on a short ride. The airship eventually departed with lanterns lit, heading 
                            towards Camden. (Chapter 1, Ref 49)

May. 4, 1897                Jenny Lind, Arkansas. Three bicyclists encountered a landed airship with two occupants named George Autzerlitz and Joseph Eddleman. 
                            They conversed with the pilots, who claimed to have dined on birds caught in flight. One of the bicyclists was offered and accepted 
                            a ride in the airship, flying to the nearby town of Huntington. (Chapter 1, Ref 50)
49
Apr. 6, 1897                Peru, Nebraska. A man encountered an airship on a small island in the Missouri River. The airship's crew explained that they had 
                            landed for repairs on a searchlight. The ship was described as cigar-shaped, about 200 feet long, and operated by large 
                            gasoline engines connected to steel snail shell-shaped devices for propulsion. (Chapter 1, Ref 51)
50
Apr. 15, 1897               Cisco, Texas. A man encountered a landed airship approximately 200 feet long with crewmen repairing a searchlight. Similar to a 
                            previous incident, the witness was informed that the airship was heading to Cuba with a cargo of dynamite. (Chapter 1, Ref 52)
51
Apr. 15, 1897               Pine Lake, Michigan. An airship crew stopped at Pine Lake, Michigan, for repairs and provisions. A witness reported being 
                            awakened by a tap on his window and a bright light, and the crew requested egg sandwiches and coffee, which they hoisted on 
                            board in exchange for payment. The witness observed the ship with a brilliant searchlight and red lights at each end, noting 
                            its departure towards the city just before daylight. (Chapter 1, Ref 53)
52
Apr. 15, 1897               Chattanooga, Tennessee. Local citizens in Chattanooga, Tennessee encountered an airship that had landed on a mountain spur for 
                            repairs. The crew explained that their machinery was out of order and one of the men identified himself as Professor Charles 
                            Davidson, claiming the ship had been traveling across the country after leaving Sacramento a month earlier. (Chapter 1, Ref 54)
53
Apr. 1897                   Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Nora, Illinois. An electrician in Chillicothe, Missouri, was summoned to recharge an airship's 
                            fuel supply during the night, and a railway worker assisted in repairing a faulty steering mechanism for an airship 
                            near Nora, Illinois. (Chapter 1, Ref 55)
54
Apr. 12, 1897               Kalamazoo, Michigan. Witnesses claimed to have observed an illuminated airship that suddenly exploded with a loud noise, 
                            leaving behind evidence like a coil of heavy wire and partially-fused propeller blades. The witnesses described the object's 
                            rapid movement and subsequent explosion. (Chapter 1, Ref 56)
55
Apr. 13, 1897               Battle Creek, Michigan. A bright object seen near Battle Creek, Michigan, was described as a meteor-like airship that 
                            dropped a part resembling a large aluminum wheel with a turbine shape. The wheel was discovered by witnesses in a field and 
                            kept as a memento on a local farm. (Chapter 1, Ref 57)
56
Apr. 7, 1897                Bethany, Missouri. In a letter to a Missouri newspaper, a witness reported witnessing an airship crash near Bethany. The two 
                            occupants were fatally injured, and the letters found on them indicated a possible origin from San Francisco or Omaha. (Chapter 1, Ref 58)
57
Apr. 10, 1897               Lanark, Illinois. A farmer reported an airship crash during a blizzard near Lanark. Two occupants were killed, and a third, dressed in 
                            a unique manner, survived and claimed to be from Mars. The farmer charged people to view the "Martian" until he recovered 
                            and repaired his craft. (Chapter 1, Ref 59)
58
Nov. 17, 1897               Sacramento, California. Despite theories of an alien origin, the prevailing belief surrounding the mystery airships of the late 
                            19th century pointed to an earthly source. The prevailing notion was that an unknown inventor or inventors within the 
                            United States had achieved breakthroughs in flight technology. Reports of airship inventors date back to the earliest days of the 
                            phenomenon, as exemplified by a telegram from a New York entrepreneur in 1896 claiming plans to fly his invention to California. (Chapter 1, Ref 60)
59
Nov. 22, 1897               San Francisco, California. A San Francisco lawyer initially claimed to know the inventor behind the mystery airship, describing it as a 
                            metal machine with wings and a rudder, capable of ascending and descending gracefully. The inventor was identified as E. H. Benjamin, 
                            a former dentist from Maine. However, the story took confusing turns as the lawyer's statements were retracted, replaced by another 
                            lawyer's claims of multiple airships under development, with details of their potential capabilities. Eventually, all pronouncements 
                            ceased, and no airship was publicly presented for inspection. (Chapter 1, Ref 61)
60
Nov. 22, 1897               San Francisco, California. An individual claimed to have encountered an airship in the Tamalpais range of mountains near San Francisco. 
                            The witness described meeting six men working on the ship, which was said to be the source of the mysterious lights seen in the sky. 
                            The ship was reported to make trial trips at night and return before daylight as it continued its development. (Chapter 1, Ref 62)
61
Dec. 2, 1897                San Francisco, California. Two fishermen near San Francisco claimed to have witnessed an airship descending and landing on the ocean 
                            surface. They observed the crew guiding the craft to shore, and despite being initially ordered to leave, they were later allowed to 
                            observe the crew making repairs and share a meal from the airship's provisions. (Chapter 1, Ref 63)
62
Dec. 7, 1897                Fresno, California. A letter in a Fresno newspaper claimed that the airship was present in Fresno County and mentioned details about 
                            its construction and functionality. The letter indicated that the airship's inventor had faced involuntary challenges during its 
                            flight and was planning to bring the airship to Fresno for public viewing pending favorable news from Washington. (Chapter 1, Ref 64)
63
Dec. 6, 1897                Watertown, CA. Residents of Watertown reported seeing a large airship with a bright light narrowly avoiding collision with the town's 
                            post office, providing potential corroboration for a letter writer's account of the airship's presence in the area. (See Dec. 7, 1897.) (Chapter 1, Ref 65)
64
Apr. 19, 1897               Beaumont, Texas. Approximate date. A rabbi in Texas encountered an airship that had landed on a farm near Beaumont. He spoke briefly with one of the 
                            occupants who mentioned traveling and testing the machine but couldn't recall specific details about the inventor or the place of origin. (Chapter 1, Ref 66)
65
Apr. 1897                   Appleton, Wisconsin. A letter found near Appleton, Wisconsin, claimed to be from the occupants of an airship named "Pegasus." The letter 
                            described their successful aerial navigation experiments, achieving speeds of 150 miles per hour and reaching a height of 2,500 feet. 
                            They stated the airship was propelled by steam, lit by electricity, and had a carrying capacity of 1,000 pounds. (Chapter 1, Ref 67)
66
Apr. 1897                   Newport, Kentucky. A message reportedly dropped from an airship named "Pegasus" was found by Miss L. Remme in her yard. The note claimed 
                            the airship had traveled 200 miles at 40 miles an hour since 4:30 Friday afternoon and intended to reach Nashville by Sunday at 3:30. (Chapter 1, Ref 68)
67
Apr. 22, 1897               Lorain, Ohio. A note allegedly dropped from an airship named "Airoia" was found by a prominent townsman. The note claimed the airship 
                            had traveled across various states, fished in the Great Lakes, and was piloted by William R. Harris, along with his wife and child. 
                            The writer mentioned plans to return to New Mexico and construct a larger boat to cross the sea. (Chapter 1, Ref 69)
68
Apr. 10, 1897               Omaha, Nebraska. In Nebraska, especially near Hastings, rumors of an airship inventor circulated in 1897. The individual was said to be 
                            working on an airship and keeping their identity hidden to prevent theft of their invention by unscrupulous individuals. (Chapter 1, Ref 70)
69
1897                        Omaha, Nebraska. In Omaha, John O. Preast was speculated to be the inventor behind the mysterious airship sightings. Known for his experiments 
                            with airships over the past decade, Preast was suspected of working on a functioning model. The airship's sightings near his residence 
                            further fueled these speculations. (Chapter 1, Ref 71)
70
1897                        Nebraska. An individual named Anton Pallardy claimed that the airship sightings in Nebraska were real and not a myth. He suggested that 
                            the airship was constructed in the remote Mauvais Terres region and described its appearance as resembling a large umbrella with a 
                            transparent covering. (Chapter 1, Ref 72)
71 
1890                        Mt. Carmel, Illinois} Edward J. Pennington, a successful manufacturer, claimed to be an airship inventor and intended to create a large 
                            aluminum airship propelled by hydrogen gas and a gasoline engine-powered propeller, capable of speeds up to 250 miles per hour. (Chapter 1, Refs 73, 74)
72
1891                        Chicago. Edward J. Pennington demonstrated a 30-foot unmanned model of his airship inside a Chicago exhibition hall, which circled at 
                            25 feet and achieved a speed of six miles per hour. Despite public enthusiasm, his attempt to scale up the model for a full-sized airship 
                            faced challenges, leading to the failure of the Mt. Carmel Aeronautic Navigation Company. (Chapter 1, Ref 75, 76, 77)
73
1850's                      Sonora, California. Charles A. Dellschau and a group known as the Aero Club, comprised of inventive individuals, reportedly secretly built 
                            and flew revolutionary aircraft in the 1850s. Dellschau's illustrated notebooks detail their activities, claiming the aircraft used a 
                            substance called "supe" or "NB" with anti-gravity properties for propulsion and lights, but disbanded after the substance's inventor 
                            died, with mention of a possible larger secret organization called NYMZA. (Chapter 1, Ref 78)
74
1897                        Texas. Amidst the airship mystery, an 1897 report suggested a potential connection between the mysterious airship sightings and 
                            government experiments. It was speculated that the U.S. government, employing a high-salary aeronaut, might be working on airship-related 
                            experiments at Fort Logan near Denver, leading to theories about government involvement in the phenomenon. (Chapter 1, Ref 79)
75
Dec. 1, 1896                Sandy Beach, CA. During the late 19th Century airship mystery, an electrician named John A. Horen claimed to have witnessed a functioning 
                            airship in California. He recounted an encounter with an inventor aboard the airship, describing its noiseless and swift flight, and 
                            claimed it could travel to places like Honolulu and back within about 48 hours at a speed of around 100 miles per hour. (Chapter 1, Ref 80)
76
Apr. 16, 1897               Greenville, Texas. A man encountered a landed airship near Greenville Texas, described as a large cigar-shaped vessel with wings, a wheel 
                            at the front, and a fish-like tail at the rear. The crew claimed to be experimenting with the vessel and planning to revolutionize 
                            travel and transportation using electrical machines for propulsion and lights. (Chapter 1, Ref 81)
77
Apr. 16, 1897               Decatur, Illinois. During the late 19th century, a newspaper reporter from Decatur, Illinois, claimed to have been taken on an airship 
                            ride by inventor C. Devonbaugh. The airship featured a cabin suspended beneath gas-filled cylinders, powered by a new electricity-based 
                            process. The reporter described a high-speed nighttime trip to Chicago with colorful electric lights and mentioned the inventor's offer 
                            to assist Cuban rebels with the airship's capabilities. (Chapter 1, Ref 82)
78
Apr. 22, 1897               Josserand, Trinity County, Texas. A Texas farmer observed a large, brightly lit vessel in his cornfield and spoke with a crew of six or 
                            eight individuals. The crew claimed the aerial navigation problem had been solved using a newly discovered self-sustaining material 
                            and highly condensed electricity for propulsion. They mentioned building five such ships in Iowa and forming a stock company for 
                            the invention's public release. (Chapter 1, Ref 83)
79
Apr. 25, 1897               Lancaster, Ohio. A prominent individual claimed to have encountered a massive airship with two occupants. The craft had brilliant 
                            lights and unique features, including tubular wires that were both strong and lightweight. The inventor, referring to the craft 
                            as an "aeribarque," demonstrated its anti-gravity capabilities, advanced temperature control, and colorful lights before 
                            ascending and departing rapidly. (Chapter 1, Ref 84)
80
May. 13, 1897               Savannah, Ohio. A wealthy recluse residing near Savannah, Ohio, who had recently returned from Nebraska, was suspected by his neighbors 
                            of experimenting with an airship, potentially linking him to the local airship sightings. (Chapter 1, Ref 85)
81
May. 1, 1897                Shiloh, Ohio. Residents of Shiloh, Ohio, reported witnessing a well-lit, cylindrical airship with sails and propellers, apparently 
                            created by an unnamed inventor. The airship was described as rising into the air and moving swiftly against the wind. (Chapter 1, Ref 86)
82
Apr. 19, 1897               near the Texas-Louisiana border. In 1897, a man named Wilson frequently appeared in connection with occupants of landed airships. Near the 
                            Texas-Louisiana border, an airship landed, and two occupants introduced themselves as Mr. Wilson and Scott Warren. The witness was 
                            invited aboard the airship, where he saw an 8-by-14-foot cabin with reclining chairs, incandescent lamps, and a unique propulsion 
                            system powered by a secret gas. Wilson explained navigation techniques involving magnetic wheels and propellers. The airship was 
                            around 75 by 25 feet and had a top speed of approximately 160 miles per hour. (Chapter 1, Ref 87)
83
Apr. 19, 1897               Beaumont, Texas. In another incident in 1897, a farmer and his son discovered a landed airship near Beaumont, Texas. The 
                            airship, measuring around 130 feet long and 20 feet wide, had four men outside, including one named Wilson. Wilson explained that the 
                            ship used water ballast for landing and described its propulsion system involving large wings and propellers powered by electricity. 
                            He mentioned that the airship was made of steel and contained compartments for compressed air, and it was on its way from a flight 
                            over the Gulf of Mexico to Iowa. (Chapter 1, Ref 88)
84
Apr. 20, 1897               Uvalde, Texas. A Texas sheriff encountered a landed airship on his property near Uvalde. The airship's occupants, including one 
                            named Wilson, requested water for their craft. Wilson mentioned being from Goshen, New York, and inquired about an acquaintance 
                            named Sheriff Akers. This incident brought to mind previous interactions with a man named Wilson who had been working on aerial 
                            navigation and inventions related to airships, leading to suspicions that this might be the same person. After loading water, 
                            the airship's wings and fins were set in motion, and it departed northward toward San Angelo. (Chapter 1, Ref 89)
85
Apr. 23, 1897               Kountze, Texas. Two individuals claimed to have found a landed airship near Kountze, Texas. The airship had a cigar-shaped 
                            appearance, measuring about 50 feet in length and 20 feet in width. The occupants of the craft, introduced as Jackson and 
                            Wilson, were in the process of repairing a punctured "air compartment." Interestingly, there was also a member named Wilson 
                            mentioned among the California Aero Club members identified by Charles Dellschau in his notebooks, although this might 
                            be a mere coincidence. (Chapter 1, Refs 90, 91)
