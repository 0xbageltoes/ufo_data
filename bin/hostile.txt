Hall saw six petrol tank-shaped UFOs land on his ranch in North Queensland, Australia. His chickens, cattle, and even the jackrabbits on his farm were affected by oddly colored exhaust fumes from the UFOs, which he believed brought about a change in the genes of animal life on his ranch due to atomic radiation, as various

Sturdevant of the Herbert Elkins Construction Firm of Trenton, New Jersey reported while on duty he saw a red-lighted cigar-shaped UFO near the Delaware River. The smell of the object made him nauseated and he couldn't swallow. He collapsed in pain, but managed to crawl to his parked car. Six weeks later his sense of taste and touch were impaired and he had only been able to work a few days. Leonard B. Willits, a New Jersey State Workmen’s Compensation referee rewarded Medical Compensation to the nightwatchman, who had encountered a UFO, which made him ill and affected his senses of

O’Keefe, Acting Inspector General, recently warned that UFO sightings would increase. The IG brief was headed “UFOs - SERIOUS BUSINESS.” The AF, he said, was chiefly concerned with defense and technical aspects of the phenomena. Air Force Investigators should use binoculars, cameras, Geiger counters, magnifying glasses, and containers for any “fragments or ground samples” recovered. This order came as the Air Force was again telling the public that the “flying saucers"

The NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA in Washington, D.C. announced that the “UFOs or FLYING SAUCERS" are unknown devices, which have been reported by scores of reliable observers, are intelligently controlled machines from outer space.” Vice Admiral R. H. Hillenkoetter, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency, stated that the “unknown objects are operating under intelligent control.” He added, “I know that neither Russia nor this country has anything even approaching such high speeds and maneuvers.” Speaking as a NICAP Board Member, Admiral Hillenkoetter said it was high time
