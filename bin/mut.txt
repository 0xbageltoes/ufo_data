                    the Federal Aviation Administration
                    conducted an investigation in
                    July and August. The Air Force denied
                    having any helicopter activity in the
                    area and, according to the FAA: "The
                    Army was operating some helicopters in
                    (the) area earlier this ye~r, but without
                    more definite information on dates,
                    times, etc., they cannot confirm any
                    specific flights. They stated it is not
                    their policy to fly at night with their
                    lights off. Two military reservations
                    are located to the south of the area in
                    question: The Army's Fort Hood in Coryell
                    County and Gray Air Force Base in

                    seen a similar craft in the same
                    area remarked that "once you see

                    thought to be a helicopter, seen from
                    east of Cripple Creek westward into
                    Park County. The craft alternately
                    flew with and without lights. It appeared
                    to land near Guffey and
                    ground lights were seen approaching
                    the landing site. The craft was seen
                    back in the Cripple Creek area before

                    which flew off when a man on
                    horseback approached. The chopper in
                    this incident was allegedly photographed
                    and tentatively identified as

                    Nebraska. This last action would
                    turn out to be a precursor of
                    similar activity over military
                    installations in Montana, Maine
                    and Michigan in the following

                    multi-colored, shapechanging
                    object high in the sky.
                    Also seen, with the naked eye and
                    with binoculars, was one, then 2,
                    helicopters which seemed to fly
                    in a cautious surveillance pattern
                    below the object. Watched off
                    & on for 3 hours before object &
                    1 chopper vanished together to the
                    west. All the witnesses eyes hurt
                    following the incident. Writer &

                    It was a clear night but Sand could
                    see nothing even when the craft

                    owned by Richard & Dwight Boom and
                    Don Beckett. One other cow seemed
                    to be ailing. When they tried to
                    catch and attend to her, she collapsed
                    and died; 4 other cows also
                    seemed to be ill. Wisconsin Dept.
                    of Agriculture diagnostician Dr.
                    A.F. Krohn verified the mutilation
                    of the 3 animals with "a very sharp

                    Military Reservation, killing 5 men
                    and injuring five. Speculation was
                    that high winds in the area may
                    have caused the crash, but Public Information
                    Officer Major Arne Anderson
                    refused to speculate on the cause
                    or to release any information on the
                    investigation. However, Lt. Col. S.K.
                    Fisk told the DENVER POST that the
                    cause of the crash was considered to
                    be "unknown". (Refs. 87, 88)

Oct. 7, 1975        Weston County, WYOMING. On Sept. 29th, a mutilated cow was found
PM                  near Upton. Near Newcastle, on the early
                    morning of Friday, October 3rd, around
                    3:00 AM, Raymond "Spud" Jones was
                    awakened by a "high-pitched whine, like
                    a jet turbine starting". Neighbors
                    heard it, too. Other neighbors reported
                    to Jones later that day that they had
                    noticed a cow of his lying in a pasture.
                    On Monday, Oct.6th, Jones found the carcass,
                    which had been mutilated. He notified
                    Sheriff Willis Larson. Then, on
                    the night of Tuesday, October 7th, Larson
                    had just returned from delivering
                    specimens from the cow to a crime lab in
                    Cheyenne when, at 8:45 PM, a woman
                    called to report an object that looked
                    like and sounded like a helicopter was
                    hovering over a ridge NE of Newcastle.
                    The sheriff knew the local airport mgr.,
                    John Bockman, had a helicopter. But a
                    phone call to Bockman was answered by
                    him; he said he would go out to look
                    for the craft. Larson drove to the top
                    of an adjacent ridge. He told the Univ.
                    of Wyoming BRANDING IRON (10-14-75):
                    "I reached the top of the ridge and saw an object to the
                    west, near Highway 85 North," the sheriff said. "It was an
                    orange, wedge-shaped object, resembling a helicopter in
                    appearance. The tapered end had a bright red light. I was
                    confused and looked at it through the binoculars," he said.
                    "It was making sudden, jerky 'Z' movements, very fast, I
                    thought. I called my wife and asked her to call Bockman to
                    look at it." Bockman was already looking at the object,
                    however. He reported it in the same position as the sheriff.
                    The object descended and Larson lost sight of it. Bockman
                    continued to observe it and saw it go down and its lights go
                    out. "I called for a special deputy to take my position and
                    dispatched another deputy to the south so we could bracket
                    the object in a triangle," said the sheriff. "I then went to
                    the airport. The mail plane was landing at the airport just
                    as I arrived. Bockman pointed the object out to me. Thirty
                    seconds later it went up and disappeared, just like shutting
                    out a light. Later, as we were returning to town, a sudden
                    bright flash lit the sky, like a flashbulb." An hour and a
                    half later, the same lady called and reported the object in
                    the same location. "I went out to check on it again, and the
                    sky was split by five sudden flashes, in very quick
                    succession, centered in the northeast," said the sheriff.
                    Later, a glowing light would appear in the eastern sky, and
                    would be viewed by many residents. Lights rising over trees
                    were reported by campers, brilliant flashes were reported by
                    a motorist, and home owners saw strange lights. Obviously,
                    something strange was happening in the sky around Newcastle
                    on the night of October 7. (Ref. 138)"

                    craft with regulation
                    lights were seen as well as
                    others flying low without
                    lights. Helicopters were sometimes
                    reported with bright searchlights
                    here and in adjoining
                    Costilla County. This light was

                    were reporting mystery helicopters,
                    one rancher had 4 cattle mutilated.
                    One night, the rancher's
                    daughter was in the house alone.
                    She saw a helicopter fly over a
                    field about 100 yards away. It
                    flew down below a building on the
                    property, then flew to within 100
                    feet of the house. The sound
                    seemed "muffled". The rancher was
                    convinced that at least one of his
                    mutilated cows had been dropped
                    (into a pool of water) from above. (Ref. 140)

                    helicopters. (Ref. 114)
154
Oct. 30, 1975       Union, Quay Counties, NEW MEXICO. Between October 30 & November 13.
                    At least 30 unidentified helicopter
                    and/or UFO sightings occurred during
                    this period, while at least 4 cattle
                    mutilations were reported. The FAA
                    announced an investigation into the
                    sightings of the unknown aircraft.
                    Despite that announcement, the FAA
                    has since denied having any knowledge
                    or information about such an investigation.

night               Unidentified helicopters were seen
                    over a wide area. Included were overflights
                    over missile installations.
                    Some objects seen were reported as
                    helicopters, others simply nocturnal
                    lights. At least two helicopters were
                    involved as there were simultaneous
                    sightings in widely separated areas. (Ref. 119)

Nov. 3, 1975        Cascade, Teton, Pondera and Chouteau Counties, MONTANA. The previous night's helicopter/UFO
night               wave was repeated. At least 2 helicopters
                    were reported at once over a
                    missile site. Malmstrom Air Force
                    Base verified that unidentified helicopters
                    were in the area. (Ref. 120)
157
Nov. 4, 1975        Cascade County, MONTANA. On the southeast edge of Great
night               Falls, a law officer observed an
                    unidentified helicopter which lifted
                    off the ground and flew away. (Ref. 121)

Nov. 7, 1975        Fergus, Wheatland Counties, MONTANA. Nov 7th & 8th (Fri. and Sat. nights)
night               UFOs were reported over missile installations.
                    In a reply to press
                    queries, the Strategic Air Command
                    stated that "the craft were suspected
                    to have been helicopters
                    due to hovering ability of the
                    craft, witness interpretations of
                    the sound produced and placement of
                    lights on the craft". Positive identification
                    of the UFOs as helicopters
                    was "precluded" due to
                    darkness. (Ref. ll7)
159
Mid Nov. 1975       Guadalupe County, TEXAS. A mutilated calf was found on the
                    10th. There were unconfirmed reports
                    of "silent helicopters" in the area
                    at about that time. (118)

Aug. 1975           Cascade County and surrounding counties, MONTANA. Between Aug 1975 & May 1976
                    Approximately 130 reports of unidentified
                    helicopters and/or UFOs
                    were logged during this period. It
                    should be noted that this Montana
                    flap (during a period in which
                    livestock mutilations were being
                    consistently reported), which involved
                    craft over military installations,
                    occurred at about the same
                    time as similar "overflight" phenomena
                    over military bases in Michigan
                    and Maine. (Ref. 122)

Late 1975           MAINE, MASSACHUSETTS, NEW HAMPSHIRE. Late 1975-through early 1976.
                    Though cattle mutilations have occurred
                    in New England, none were
                    known during this period. However,
                    there were disappearances of smaller
                    animals and the mutilation of fowl
                    such as geese. Some of the animal owners
                    had seen low-flying, suspiciously-
                    behaving unmarked helicopters.
                    Ufologist and well-known abductee
                    Betty Hill investigated
                    these events and compiled a report
                    on the New England mystery choppers
                    in 1976. (Ref. 116)

Early Dec. 1975     Franklin County, KANSAS. Three troop-carrier size helicopters
                    were seen flying and landing
                    near Lane - one of many mystery
                    chopper reports during several weeks
                    in this area. (Ref. 123)
163
May. 31, 1976       Elbert County, COLORADO. When the sheriff and the complaintant
                    reached the mutilation site, the victim's
                    son and a hired hand were at
                    the scene. They said the helicopter
                    had circled over them, flying very
                    low. It was so low and so clo_se that
                    the witnesses could read a number on
                    the craft: N9143F, which was apparently
                    found to be registered to "City
                    Car Terminal Company" of Detroit,
                    Michigan. (Ref. 19)
164
Jun. 24, 1976       Huerfano County, COLORADO. Approx. the 24th. A rancher complained to the sheriff
                    that, while he was on horseback, he
                    saw a "military chopper" harassing
                    his cattle. (Ref. 7)
165
Jul. 8, 1976        Colfax County, NEW MEXICO. A white helicopter was seen in the
morning             area of the Philmont Scout Ranch. A
                    buffalo calf was found mutilated along
                    an aircraft runway on the Scout Ranch
                    on July 10th. (Ref. 8)

Aug. 27, 1976       Cascade County, MONTANA. Investigators from the Society for
early AM            the Investigation of the Unexplained
                    (SITU), looking into mutilations in
                    Montana, see & photograph a black
                    helicopter over their campsite. "No
                    one at any of the airports, military
                    installations or local agencies would
                    claim it as theirs". (Ref. 9)
167
Sep. 16, 1976       Pawnee County, KANSAS. A helicopter was heard flying low over
night               a pasture after dark. One mutilated
                    cow was found in the area on Monday
                    and another on Tuesday. It was
                    thought that both mutilations were done
                    on the 26th. (Ref. 10)
168
Oct. 10, 1976       Wadena County, MINNESOTA. When a helicopter touched down on a
19:00               farm, a group of children ran toward
                    it; and it took off. There were other
                    sightings in the area around this
                    time. It was described at least once
                    as being silver and blue. A classically mutilated
                    calf was found on the same
                    farm (on Oct. 1st) upon which the
                    helicopter had landed. (Ref. 11)

Early Oct. 1976     Las Animas County, COLORADO. Early Oct., late Sept., 1976.
                    Four ranches reported 4 almost soundless
                    helicopters, and one
                    was observed as it harrassed and
                    broke up a cattle herd (see Introduction). (Ref. 12)
170
Early Nov. 1976     La Salle County, ILLINOIS. Sightings of a helicopter manned
                    by a crew wearing red suits were
                    verified by multiple independent
                    witnesses. One classic mutilation
                    occurred in the county in October.
                    There were rumors of continued mutilations
                    in November; but by then
                    the authorities had clamped a firm
                    lid on the matter. (Refs. 13, 14)
171
Oct. 20, 1975       Logan County, COLORADO. Oct. 20th, 21st (Saturday & Sunday)
                    There were sightings of strange
                    lights over several communities.
                    They were thought to be helicopters
                    but officers could not get
                    close enough to make positive
                    identification possible. (Ref. 15)
172
Dec. 4, 1976        Marshall County, ILLINOIS. A helicopter with two occupants
21:30               was heard and seen flying low
                    over farmland, while a second
                    chopper was heard but not seen. (Ref. 16)
173
Dec. 1976           Warren County, ILLINOIS. A few nights before a classically mutilated
                    cow was discovered, 3
                    objects identified as helicopters
                    were seen flying low, and slowly.
                    Two troopers were closing in when
                    the objects rapidly gained altitude
                    and vanished. One had a
                    bright light on the bottom, running
                    lengthwise "like a lighted
                    rod". (Ref. 17)
174
Mid Dec. 1976       Logan County, COLORADO. A helicopter was seen flying out
                    of the South Platte River bottoms
                    and flying to the east, low over
                    the river. A mutilated cow was
                    discovered in the area on 12-17-76
                    and a calf turned up missing. (Ref. 18)
175
Jan. 17, 1977       Cochise County, ARIZONA. Albert Thomas saw a helicopter lift
night               up & fly around his property. Thomas
                    discovered the carcass of one of
                    his cows, mutilated, the next day,
                    January 18th. Other mutilations
                    were reported in Cochise County
                    during early 1977. (Ref. 1)
176
Jul. 17, 1977       Johnson County, TEXAS. Mrs. C.D. Kirkham heard a helicopter
early AM            go over. A mutilated cow was found
                    on the property at 7:00 AM, Sunday.
                    A fixed-wing aircraft was seen flying
                    low over the same pasture the
                    previous evening. (Ref. 2)
177
Nov. 30, 1977       Costilla County, COLORADO. Three witnesses heard a helicopter
04:00               flying over an area where 3 mutilations
                    were reported during the week.
                    One witness saw "bright, revolving
                    lights". (Ref. 3)
178
Early Jan. 1978     Perkins County, NEBRASKA. Two helicopters flew low over a
                    ranch where a bull was found mutilated
                    the next day. (Ref. 1)
179
Early Jun. 1978     Las Animas County, COLORADO. On two occasions a cowboy "ran off"
                    a low-flying black helicopter. At
                    least two mutilations occurred in
                    June in Huerfano County, adjoining
                    Las Animas County (and the area of
                    the sightings) on the north. (Ref. 2)
180
Mid Oct. 1978       Sublette County, WYOMING. On a ranch 17 miles NW of Daniel
                    Junction, several witnesses watched
                    a white helicopter with a blue bubble
                    fly over the ranch house. The
                    chopper was so low that children
                    were throwing things at it. "Shortly
                    after that" a mutilated cow was discovered
                    on the ranch. (Ref. 7)
181
Oct. 1978           Yankton County, SOUTH DAKOTA. A lady in a farmhouse was awakened
                    by a barking dog and looked out to
                    see a "stock truck" backed up to a
                    gate. The truck left when she turned
                    on an outside light. The witness then
                    heard the "distinct sound of a helicopter"
                    nearby, and she could hear
                    her cattle running around in the
                    pasture. (Ref. 3)
182
Nov. 9, 1978        Benton County, ARKANSAS. Nov. 9th,10th (10:00 PM each date)
22:00               a mystery helicopter sighting at same
                    time each night by sheriff's investigator
                    Don Rystrom, who had a calf of
                    his mutilated (see Introduction). (Ref. 4)
183
Nov. 13, 1978       Los Alamos, Santa Fe and Rio Arriba Counties, NEW MEXICO. On the Santa Clara Indian Reservation,
early AM            two cows were mutilated
                    within a day or two of each other,
                    including one done on the
                    night of November 12-13 during
                    bad, rainy weather. A Santa
                    Clara Pueblo resident reported
                    hearing a helicopter early on
                    the morning of the 13th. (Ref. 5,6)
184
Jan. 1979           Eddy County, NEW MEXICO. Five horses were killed and mutilated
                    in January in the Malaga
                    area, south and east of Carlsbad.
                    There were two or more helicopter
                    sightings in the area of
                    the mute sites, mostly during a
                    period a day or two after a mutilation
                    had occurred. Helicopters
                    are not uncommonly seen in
                    the area, though, and it is unclear
                    whether these were marked
                    or identified. (Ref. 1)
185
Apr. 8, 1979        Rio Arriba County, NEW MEXICO. Between 2:00-3:00 AM.
02:00               Near consistently-mutilation-plagued Dulce, NM. Police observed
                    an object which might have
                    been a helicopter - with green &
                    red (like infra-red) lights hovering
                    a directing a spotlight on
                    the area of a mixing plant on
                    land owned by rancher Manuel Gomez,
                    who has had many cattle mutilated.
                    The noiseless object rose
                    and flew over the mountains NW
                    of Dulce. As it passed over the
                    mountains, State Policeman Gabe
                    Valdez said he could faintly make
                    out a form much like that of a
                    hot-air balloon (There had been
                    speculation that sophisticated
                    balloon-type craft had been designed
                    for the CIA and they were
                    employed in mutilation events.
                    Implicated in this scenario were
                    famed balloonists from New Mexico.
                    Also, 2 psychics in New Jersey
                    stated their impressions around
                    this time (Mar-Apr. 1979) that
                    lighter-than-air craft were somehow
                    involved in the mutilations.). (Ref. 9, 10)

May. 1979           El Paso County, COLORADO. May and June 1979.
                    During a period in which 4 or 5 mutilations
                    occurred, "dark" helicopters
                    were reported flying around
                    ranches and homes. (Ref. 2)
187
Jul. 8, 1979        Faulkner County, ARKANSAS. Dairyman Charles.Reynolds found a mutilated
                    calf on July 10th, but estimated
                    it died on the 8th. On that day
                    he saw a helicopter hovering over his
                    pasture. Reynolds heard the motor,
                    went out for a look, and the craft
                    flew away. Reynolds cited a helicopter/mutilation incident which had
                    occurred in previous weeks near
                    Martindale, Arkansas. (Ref. 3)
188
Jul. 21, 1979       Conway County, ARKANSAS. A helicopter flew over an area
AM                  shortly before a cow turned up missing.
                    The same cow was found mutilated
                    on July 23rd. There were no
                    tracks or ground markings, but limbs
                    on trees just above the site were
                    broken. (Ref. 4)
189
Aug. 12, 1979       Conway County, ARKANSAS. A blue helicopter without markings
afternoon           was seen near a site where, on Aug.
                    14th, a mutilated cow was found. (Ref. 5)
190
Aug. 1979           Faulkner, Conway Counties, ARKANSAS. Several cattle mutilations, as well
                    as unidentified (low-flying) helicopter
                    sightings, were reported. In
                    order to service an array of missile
                    silos north of Little Rock Air
                    Force Base regularly flew across
                    this area, but at altitudes much
                    greater than 500 feet. (Ref. 6)
191
Aug. 26th, 1979     Perkins County, NEBRASKA. Two helicopters flew over the day
                    before a mutilated cow was discovered.
                    A slow, low-flying, white
                    fixed-wing airplane flew over on
                    Saturday, the 25th. (Ref. 7)

Aug. 1, 1979        ALBERTA, CANADA. First week of August.
                    Near Blackie - About a week before
                    the well-publicized mutilation of
                    a valuable 2500-lb. Simmental bull,
                    a helicopter hovered 'over the ranch
                    on which the bull was found. The
                    chopper hovered "for quite a while",
                    according to the landowner's wife,
                    who added: "We're in the path of
                    the airport, and lots of planes fly
                    overhead, but this helicopter was
                    different. It stayed over our land
                    for a long time". (Ref. 8)
193
Sep. 23, 1980       Arapahoe County, COLORADO. Littleton resident John Cumby watched
19:00               [text cut off]
                    was watching from his house. He
                    called to his mother-in-law, who
                    ran into the back yard. After the
                    object had ascended out of Cumby's
                    view, she could still see it. She
                    watched the "ball" shape assume a
                    "square" shape, with an appendage
                    hanging out of it and "fluttering".
                    The object vanished, then re-appeared
                    a second or two later and
                    a considerably distance to the
                    (viewer's) right. It finally shot
                    straight up and was lost from
                    sight. No direct mutilation connection.
                    However, in the autumn of
                    1980, a substantial number of classic
                    livestock mutilations were reported
                    in Colorado. (Ref. 1)
194
Oct. 27, 1980       Apace County, ARIZONA. A mutilated bull was found, with
                    the carcass burned on several areas
                    as though "partially cooked in an
                    oven". An unaccounted-for beam of
                    light had swept over this valley
                    near Springerville on the 24th or
                    25th. On the 29th1 Wednesday, a helicopter
                    flew directly over the mutilation
                    site. (Ref. 2)
195
Sep. 28, 1981       Near Balzac, ALBERTA, CANADA.
                    A bull was found mutilated on the
                    Stan Jones farm north of Calgary.
                    Three triangular patches were worn
                    into the nearby grass. A helicopter
                    had been heard the night before
                    (Sept. 27-28). A helicopter was seen
                    nearby on the 28th, as the Jones
                    family examined the bull at the
                    site. (Ref. 1)
196
Sep. 30, 1981       Carroll County, NEW HAMPSHIRE. Night of Wed., Sept.30/Thurs. Oct. l.
night               A 7-year-old Hereford cow was
                    found dead & mutilated on the Charles
                    Whitten property, under mysterious
                    circumstances (see referenced
                    source). That next day, Oct. 1, the
                    Whittens heard a helicopter but
                    could not see it. Then a low-flying
                    airplane circled the pasture.
                    There had been "talk" in a nearby
                    town of "black helicopters" in the
                    area. (Ref. 2)
197
End May. 1982       San Juan County, NEW MEXICO. A mutilated cow was found near
                    MAY 1982 & JUNE 1982, end of May, first of June.
                    Bloomfield on Fri., May 28. The
                    owner's wife reported seeing a helicopter
                    on the night of Mon., May
                    31. Then, around 6:00 PM on Tues.,
                    June 1, a witness saw a small green
                    helicopter hovering over the mutilation [text cut off]

Sep. 29, 1982       El Paso County, COLORADO. A cow was mutilated on September 16
03:00               on the Bill Dzuris ranch near Calhan
                    - a most interesting case (see
                    reference plus the book AN ALIEN
                    HARVEST by Linda Moulton Howe). Mr.
                    Dzuris's sister, a Mrs. Kobilan,
                    lives on a ranch nearby. Several
                    times earlier in September, she
                    could hear a helicopter but she was
                    unable to see it. Then, at 3:00 AM
                    on the 29th, she could both see and
                    hear a chopper, flying low over the
                    nearby Larry Mikita ranch. Later on
                    the morning of the 29th, Mikita
                    found a 6-year-old cow (like the
                    Dzurises') dead and mutilated on
                    his property. (Ref. 2)

Oct. 1982           Sweetwater County, WYOMING. (late September-early November) Several livestock mutilations were
                    reported here (and in adjoining
                    Daggett County, Utah) during this
                    period. According to Sweetwater
                    County Deputy Sheriff Theron Wilde,
                    helicopters were also being reported.
                    On Sunday, the 10th of October, Wilde,
                    whose own ranch is in the area of the
                    mutilations, saw a small two-seater
                    helicopter, with a glass bubble and
                    a silver tail with red at the end of
                    the tail. It was circling over the
                    pasture lands. On November 7, the same
                    or a similar chopper flew over in the
                    same circling pattern. This area was
                    the scene of a "shootout" of sorts
                    between a reserve lawman and a mystery
                    helicopter in 1977. (Ref. 3) (Also, see INTRODUCTION)

May. 21, 1983       Washington County, COLORADO. A ranching couple near Lindon discovered
                    a mutilated cow (their 3rd).
                    A neighbor reported having seen a
                    helicopter over the same pasture
                    within one or two days of the discovery
                    of the mutilated animal. (Ref. 1)

Jun. 3, 1984        King County, WASHINGTON. No mutilation connection in this
daytime             particular incident (although animal
                    mutilations have been reported consistently
                    for well over a decade in
                    the area of Snohomish, King & Pierce
                    Counties) - but it is of interest because
                    of the description of the helicopter.
                    Michael D. Hart and three
                    other witnesses were camping near
                    a river in Central King County.
                    They heard a helicopter, then they
                    finally saw it circling low over a
                    dairy farm near North Bend. Through
                    binoculars, the craft was seen to
                    be all black, with no discernible
                    markings whatsoever. The windows
                    appeared tinted to prevent viewing
                    into the cockpit. The witnesses
                    said the chopper was a "Huey". (Ref. l)

Late Nov. 1985      El Paso County, COLORADO. Late November or early December.
                    A mutilated Hereford cow was found
                    on the Eldon Butler ranch. The night
                    before, Butler had heard a helicopter
                    hovering about 300 yards from his
                    house. Initially - although it was
                    hovering and was "real loud" - he
                    thought little of it, as military
                    helicopters often flew over his
                    property. (Ref. l)

Apr. 21, 1986       Marshall County, ALABAMA.
                    A female bovine was found with the
                    heart and vagina missing and one teat
                    missing from the udder. There was a
                    small amount of blood on the animal's
                    carcass, but none on the ground. Investigator
                    Ed Teal of the Sheriff's
                    office said the parts were "not just
                    ripped out. They're specifically cut
                    out. It's very weird." The site of the
                    mutilation was on the Vandervoort farm,
                    which adjoins the Tidmore farm, where
                    a cow carcass was found with just the
                    genitals missing approximately a year
                    previously - around April 21, 1985.
                    Both the Tidmore and Vandervoort farm
                    adjoin yet another property - that of
                    school principal Les Click. The night
                    after the Vandervoort mutilation,
                    Click heard a helicopter flying low
                    over his farm. (Ref. 1)
