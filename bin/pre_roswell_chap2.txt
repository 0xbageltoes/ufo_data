1888                        Northern California. Reports of anomalous Victorian-era airships, including streamlined metallic vehicles with no apparent 
                            propulsion and otherworldly occupants, have perplexed observers. These occurrences, some predating the 1896 California airship wave, 
                            feature instances where futuristic craft landed and discharged large, hairy, man-like creatures known to local tribes as "Crazy Bear." 
                            These creatures allegedly arrived in small moon-like craft alongside beings resembling Indians, wearing shiny clothing, creating a 
                            mysterious connection between UFOs, Bigfoot-like entities, and native folklore. (Chapter 2, Ref 92)
87
1880's                      American West. In the 1880s, an incident in the American West involved a man who encountered a ball-shaped UFO landing on a mountain. 
                            Despite his fear, he approached the craft and observed a large silver hall with a retractable lid. From inside emerged two shorter, 
                            attractive beings—identified as a man and a woman—who attempted to communicate with him but failed due to language barriers. The 
                            beings returned to the craft, closed the lid, and the UFO ascended into the sky and disappeared. (Chapter 2, Ref 93)

1892                        Waters near Jamaica. In 1892 in the Caribbean waters, witnesses aboard the ship "The Green" observed two large, glowing, house-sized 
                            objects emerging from the ocean next to the ship. The ship's crew, including the captain, was unable to explain this phenomenon, and 
                            the objects remained alongside the ship for a time before descending into the water. This incident introduces the concept of 
                            Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) alongside the traditional UFO sightings. (Chapter 2, Ref 94)
89
1893                        Australia. In 1893, an Australian farmer had a lasting encounter with a saucer-shaped UFO. After approaching the landed craft, a 
                            being in unusual attire emerged and directed a light beam at him, rendering him stunned and eventually leading to a permanent 
                            paralysis in his hand. The incident left a lasting impact on his life. (Chapter 2, Ref 95)
90
1896                        Missouri. In 1896, a saucer-shaped UFO visited a Missouri farm, appearing as a circle of flashing lights that descended and hovered 
                            over their barn. The family observed the blinding lights before taking shelter in their house out of fear. The next day, they 
                            discovered three dead steers in the pasture, drained of blood with puncture wounds on their throats. This incident, paralleled by 
                            similar reports in the area that night, left behind burned grass and an enduring mystery that resonates with cattle mutilation cases. (Chapter 2, Ref 96)
91
Apr. 11, 1897               Benton Harbor, Michigan. During the 1897 mystery airship wave, witnesses in Benton Harbor, Michigan, reported a non-dirigible-shaped UFO 
19:45                       on April 11th. Described as a massive ball of fire, the object emitted various colored lights that transformed when observed through opera 
                            glasses, as reported in a local newspaper on the following day. (Chapter 2, Ref 97)
92
Apr. 12, 1897               Lincoln, Illinois. The night after the Benton Harbor incident, over 50 people in Lincoln, Illinois, witnessed a brightly-lit V-shaped 
night                       object flying over the town. (Chapter 2, Ref 98)
93
Apr. 1897                   Fort Wayne, Indiana. During the same period, an object described as "pear-shaped with the apex downward" was witnessed flying rapidly 
                            over Fort Wayne, Indiana. Another observer noted a slightly different configuration, describing it as round with a V-shaped tail 
                            emitting bright yellow rays of light from the main body. (Chapter 2, Ref 99)
94
May. 4, 1897                Cincinnati, Ohio. On the evening of May 4th, several citizens in Cincinnati, Ohio, reported an egg-shaped, red object emitting rays. 
evening                     The object appeared to have a curtain-like covering, with rays escaping from the center and both ends, and it moved in a zigzag 
                            course, alternating between upward and downward motions. (Chapter 2, Ref 100)
95
May. 3, 1897                Cassville, Indiana. During the 1896-1897 mystery airship sightings, most occupants were described as regular-looking humans, but there 
                            were exceptions. In a specific incident near Cassville, Indiana, on May 3, 1897, a man encountered a cigar-shaped craft in a 
                            gravel pit, occupied by a crew of smaller-than-average individuals who spoke an unfamiliar language. (Chapter 2, Ref 101)
96
Nov. 1896                   Between Lodi and Stockton, California. Two men near Lodi and Stockton, California, witnessed three unusually tall, 
                            seven-foot beings with slender bodies. The beings appeared graceful and otherworldly, covered in a soft and unique growth. 
                            They carried egg-sized objects emitting intense light and attempted to communicate with guttural chants. Later, these beings 
                            approached a massive airship resting above the Woodbridge Canal, which they entered and departed with a swaying motion, 
                            leaving the witnesses awestruck. (Chapter 2, Ref 102)
97
Apr. 17, 1897               Near Williamston, Michigan. An unidentified flying object landed near Williamston, Michigan, as reported by local newspapers. 
                            The craft was seen by multiple farmers before landing, piloted by a peculiar figure described as almost 9.5 feet tall and almost 
                            naked. The being emitted a musical, bellowing-like sound and attempted to communicate. An attempt to approach the being resulted 
                            in injury, further adding to the mysterious nature of the event. (Chapter 2, Ref 103)
98
Apr. 21, 1897               Near Ogdin, West Virginia. A witness reported an encounter with remarkably tall occupants of a well-lit object that landed near 
                            Ogdin, West Virginia. The witness described the eight beings as being between 11 and 12 feet tall, with oversized heads. They 
                            claimed to be exploring Earth, consumed small pills, and "drank air" before departing in their craft after an hour. (Chapter 2, Ref 104)
99
1865                        Cadotte Pass, 75-100 miles from the Great Falls of the Upper Missouri. There are pre-1900 reports of crashed UFOs resembling spaceships 
                            rather than dirigibles. In an incident from 1865 in western Montana, a mountain man witnessed a bright, luminous body in the sky that 
                            exploded, followed by a heavy explosion and rushing sounds. The next day, he discovered a path of destruction with uprooted trees, 
                            and he found a large stone with compartments and hieroglyphics, suggesting a possible interaction with advanced beings. (Chapter 2, Ref 105)
100
Jun. 6, 1884                About 35 miles northwest of Benkelman, Dundy County, Nebraska. In 1884, a reported UFO crash in Nebraska was documented in a local 
                            newspaper, describing a blazing object falling from the sky. Witnesses encountered scorching heat and dazzling light around the debris. 
                            However, later reports indicated that the debris dissolved into a gelatinous mass after a heavy rain, suggesting the incident may 
                            have been a hoax. (Chapter 2, Refs 106, 107)
101
1888                        Near Grundy, Texas. A teenager near Grundy, Texas, allegedly witnessed the crash of an aerial object, leading to the discovery of an 
                            injured man amid debris. The man, who spoke an unintelligible language, consumed water and food but died within hours. Neighbors 
                            gathered to see the fallen "man from the sky," and the debris included lightweight, unscratchable metal pieces of two types—silver-gray 
                            and dark blue—which remained heat-resistant even when placed on a hot stove. (Chapter 2, Refs 108)
102
1893                        Chicago World's Fair. In the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, outside the Columbian Exposition, an attraction named "Men from Outer Space" 
                            displayed the bodies of four purported occupants recovered from a crashed aerial object. Accounts of this display are based on 
                            recollections from visitors at the time, describing the bodies as about three feet tall, hairless, and with six fingers on each hand 
                            and six toes on each foot, all preserved in glass containers filled with formaldehyde. (Chapter 2, Refs 109)
103
Apr. 17, 1897               Aurora, Texas. During the 1897 airship wave, in the small town of Aurora, north Texas, a mysterious airship collided with a windmill 
morning                     tower and exploded on April 17. Witnesses reported that the pilot, the presumed sole occupant, was not from Earth and was disfigured 
                            in the crash. Papers found on the pilot were written in indecipherable hieroglyphics, sparking speculation about extraterrestrial 
                            origin, and the town gathered to view the wreckage and debris. (Chapter 2, Refs 110)
104
1897                        3 miles south of Aurora, Texas. The Aurora UFO incident of 1897, involving the crash of an alleged airship from another world, has 
04:00                       faced skepticism due to inconclusive metal fragment analysis and denied access to the cemetery for potential remains. However, recent 
                            testimony from individuals who lived in the Aurora area at the time adds some corroboration to the story, describing a low-flying 
                            cigar-shaped airship with a white light that crashed and caused an explosion on Judge J. S. Proctor's farm. (Chapter 2, Refs 111)
105
1897                        Lewisville, Texas. In the aftermath of the Aurora UFO incident, eyewitnesses from the Lewisville area recounted that an airship 
night                       was seen approaching from Dallas, crashing near Judge Proctor's well and exploding. The airship was destroyed, and the pilot's 
                            body was badly torn up, leaving the crowd of sightseers unable to identify the unknown metal the craft was made of or provide a 
                            detailed description of the pilot's body. (Chapter 2, Refs 112)
106
1897                        Aurora, Texas. In the wake of the crash in Aurora, witnesses recall the explosion of the airship, with the pilot being torn up and 
                            killed in the incident. The townspeople who gathered his remains noted he was a "small man," and the event generated fear and 
                            excitement among the locals who were unfamiliar with regular airplanes or airships at the time. (Chapter 2, Refs 113)
107
Sep. 1899                   Mountains of northern Mexico south of Tucson, Arizona. A young Mexican boy claimed to have encountered a small humanoid in 
                            silver-colored clothing while searching for stolen cattle in the mountains. Feeling threatened, he shot at the creature, which 
                            disappeared. Later, a lawman from the group investigating the incident disappeared after approaching a UFO. Despite searching, 
                            no trace of the lawman was found, leaving behind an intriguing and unexplained story. (Chapter 2 Refs 114)
