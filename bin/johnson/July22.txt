| 1952 - A triangular-shaped flying object, the size of C-47 transport  |
| plane, flew across the sky over Rockville, Indiana. It stopped to     |
| hover about half a minute, then resumed its flight, disappearing in   |
| the distance. (Source: Kevin Randle, Invasion Washington: UFOs over   |

| 1954 - At 7:15 p.m. five metallic spheres or ovoid shaped objects     |
| flew toward the west in a V formation in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  |
| They were in sight for 30 seconds, and they reportedly looked like    |
| "Christmas tree ornaments." (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. |

| 1955 - At eleven o'clock at night a formation of several bright       |
| silver balls was sighted that changed positions as they flew over     |
| Leicester, England. There were widely reported sightings of these     |
| objects as they flew off toward the northeast. (Source: Richard F.    |

| 1955 - At 2:30 p.m. several witnesses including one name Estes saw a  |
| UFO land in the Atlantic Ocean. It was seen on the surface of the     |
| ocean near Santa Maria Island in the Azores. Project Blue Book's      |
| explanation of this sighting was that it might have been an aircraft. |

| 1955 - At 5:30 p.m. Mr. E. Mootz was gardening in his yard in         |
| Cincinnati, Ohio when he was pelted with a dark reddish colored       |
| liquid from a pear-shaped object flying slowly at 1,000 feet          |
| altitude. The liquid caused his bare skin to feel like someone had    |
| poured kerosine on a wound. When he washed the substance off he felt  |
| better. The next day his peach tree was dead. (Source: Leonard H.     |

| 1956 - A married couple named McMullins driving between Bakersfield   |
| and Pixley, California reporeted seeing a bluish green light at 5:30  |
| a.m. that appeared to be burning as it flew rapidly toward the west.  |
| It exploded in the air and fell in two pieces. At the same time a     |
| Mrs. Brown, driving near Highway City between Fresno and Pixley,      |
| California saw an egg-shaped object that flew south, emitting a green |
| light like a flame from the back. It made no sound when it exploded   |
| in the air and crashed to the ground. (Sources: (1) Alexander Mebane, |

| 1959 - At 7:45 p.m. in Porayebayebera, Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea    |
| the son of a paramount chief sighted a domed disc-shaped object with  |
| a dark base and an illuminted dome on the top at a low altitude. It   |
| flew out to sea. The witness had been known to the author, Norman     |
| Cruttwell, for over eight years. (Source: Norman E. G. Cruttwell,     |

| 1960 - At ten o'clock in the evening a disc-shaped object with a fin  |
| or rudder-like proturberance was seen hovering over Martin, Tennessee |
| by a 13-year-old girl. After it left large oily circles were found on |
| the ground. (Source: George D. Fawcett, Flying Saucers, March 1972,   |

| 1963 - A 38-year-old man named Gray sighted a 300-foot long flying    |
| craft with lighted windows while driving between Northfield and       |
| Yatala, South Australia at 6:35 p.m. The UFO was seen below the       |
| clouds for five minutes. (Source: Waveney Girvan, Flying Saucer       |

| 1963 - At 8:30 p.m. three people watched a low flying bell-shaped     |
| object pass into a cloud in Parr, Merseyside, England. It failed to   |
| reappear. (Sources: Thomas M. Olsen, The Reference for Outstanding    |
| UFO Sighting Reports, case 141, citing Flying Saucer Review, May-June |
| 1964, p. 24; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of        |

| 1968 - At 1:20 a.m. in Mendoza, Argentina Ms. Adela Casalvieri, night |
| nurse at the Neuropsychiatry Hospital, heard a loud penetrating       |
| humming noise outside in the hospital courtyard. Going out to see     |
| what it was, she observed a saucer-shaped landed object only 20       |
| meters away. It was brightly luminous and sitting in the middle of    |
| the courtyard. A luminous red beam came from the object and struck    |
| her, and she found that her legs were paralyzed. Putting her hands up |
| to her face for protection she now found she was completely unable to |
| move. She remained immobilized for a number of minutes until the red  |
| beam was extinguished. At this time the object ascended vertically,   |
| then flew off rapidly to the south barely clearing the wall that      |
| surrounded the courtyard. Before it disappeared she was able to       |
| observe several human-looking figures through square portholes that   |
| encircled the craft. These beings moved back and forth, passing each  |
| other, and were visible from the waist up only. Landing gear imprints |
| were found at the landing site and several small potted trees had     |
| been burned. Mrs Casalvieri had first-degree burns on her face and    |
| hands, and parts of her nurse's cap and clothing were singed. In      |
| addition, her watch, which had stopped at 1:30 a.m., was found to be  |
| radioactive, as was her ring. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,  |
| HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1968-89, citing G. J.     |
| Gianza Paz & A. M. Baragiola).                                        |
| 1968 - In the evening six young girls, ages 7 to 13, reported they    |
| saw a figure they described as "The Virgin Mary" in St. Bruno,        |
| Quebec. The apparition appeared before them hovering in the air. Four |
| of the girls just saw the figure, but two also heard a voice they     |
| described as "soft and slow." It advised them to pray and promised to |
| return on October 7. That same evening in St. Basile, Quebec a boy    |
| reported seeing a man like figure that was apparently airborne and    |
| "seemed to be walking in the sky, without any visible means of        |
| propulsion." (Source: John A. Keel, UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse).    |
|                                                                       |
| 1974 - At 12:15 a.m. a circular-shaped UFO with an antenna "like a    |
| church steeple on its top" flashed blue lights and gave off a white   |
| vapor trail when it maneuvered over Lexington, Missouri. There were   |
| nine witnesses. (Sources: George D. Fawcett, Flying Saucers, December |
| 1974, p. 39; FSR, January 1975, p. 31).                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1975 - On Wyfla Hill in Machynlleth, Powys, Wales a young man saw a   |
| domed disc-shaped object that blended into its surroundings. It was   |
| estimated to be 40 feet in diameter with large round lights five feet |
| in diameter around its base. It was near the ground only fifty feet   |
| away from him, and he could see inside the UFO that there were what   |
| looked like non-humanoid, jelly like entities. The light on top of    |
| the object and those inside the base began to glow and pulsate in a   |
| strange mixture of colors, that exactly matched the background        |
| scenery. The object went into the background like a chaleleon, and in |
| a few moments was no longer visible. The witness suffered from        |
| psychosomatic blindness and other personality changes. Gelatinous     |

| 1976 - In Germantown, Wisconsin a hexagonal object with a flat bottom |
| hovered over the highway at 10:50 p.m. No color was noted, but it had |
| 4-5 lights in front, with a green light on one end and a red on the   |
| other. It hovered for five minutes, and had a red flame coming from   |
| the bottom the entire time. (Source: CUFOS News Bulletin, September   |
| 1976, p. 6).                                                          |

| 1977 - An 18 meter in diameter domed, bowl-shaped disc hovered 50     |
| meters over a house in Croix-en-Plaine, France at 10:30 p.m. Rays     |
| from the UFO converged on the roof of the house. (Source: Lumieres    |

| 1982 - At around 11:00 p.m. three women were sitting outside talking  |
| by their apartment complex in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England when |
| they noticed a bright light above an empty piece of property. The     |
| light moved to the north and became a little elongated, then became   |
| top shaped and reddish in color, and then finally disappeared above   |
| Winter Hill. Later a dog that was with them began barking, then ran   |
| inside. The women next heard a peculiar sucking or croaking noise     |
| that was repeated four times, then a figure appeared suddenly in the  |
| empty field. It was normal height and wore a one-piece uniform that   |
| had a round helmet with visor. There was also a hose-like protrusion  |
| that came out of the visor. In one hand it held a square box that     |
| seemed connected to the hose. The women became frightened and ran     |
| inside. The police were called and searched the area but failed to    |
| find anything. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database  |
| 1982, case # 690, citing DIGAP Report, Northern UFO News, issue #     |
| 100).                                                                 |

| 1983 - At 9:30 p.m. a huge silent, stationary, boomerang shaped UFO   |
| with two large orange lights and many smaller lights in the middle of |
| the V was sighted hovering over the suburbs in Houston, Texas. It     |
| then moved away past many witnesses. There was a wind sound but no    |
| jet noise, and was lost from sight in the distance. (Source: Richard  |
| Hall, MUFON UFO Journal, November 1982, p. 14, citing John            |

| 1989 - Trenton, Maine over Blue Hill Bay -- At 3:30 p.m. Randy Rhodes, |
| a police dispatcher for the City of Ellsworth, and Bill Reiff, an     |
| attorney, took off in a Beechcraft Bonanza from the Bar               |
| Harbor-Trenton airport. At around 3:45 p.m. they spotted a huge       |
| metallic disc, shining like polished aluminum, at the 9 o'clock       |
| position. It was at the same altitude as their plane--approximately   |
| 5100-5200 feet. The object suddenly moved dead ahead to the 12        |
| o'clock position and it took on a reddish or rose color. Not very     |
| enthusiastic about continuing on with this thing in front of them,    |
| they turned back for the Bar Harbor-Trenton airport. The Aerial       |
| Direction Finder was working at the time but the DME (Distance        |
| Measuring Equipment) was not receiving. It had never before given     |
| them a problem, and 3-4 minutes after the object disappeared the DME  |
| came back on. When they landed they discovered that there had been    |
| power surges and outages on the ground, and they recalled that when   |
| they last observed the object it was headed in the direction of the   |
| Maine Yankee Nuclear Power plant in Wiscasset. However, a spokesman   |
| for the Bangor HydroElectric Company later reported that three limbs  |
| falling over a transmission line when a resident cut down a tree      |
| caused the outage. (Source: Leland Bechtel, MUFON UFO Journal,        |
| November 1989, p. 19).                                                |

| 1996 - In Vicenza, Italy at 10:30 p.m. two local youngsters reported  |
| that they first noticed a total lack of animal noises while camping   |
| outside on the grassy slopes of Monte Berici, then everything became  |
| abnormally quiet. Soon they heard a kind of modulated, scraping       |
| metallic sound. Next they heard the sound of something moving in the  |
| forest, and when they looked in the direction of the sound they       |
| noticed two dark gleaming eyes staring at them. The girl became       |
| frightened and covered herself with a blanket, while the boy saw what |
| appeared to be a large form, like a white-silvery blanket approach    |
| from the nearby hill. It was a meter in height and approached to      |
| within half a meter of the girl, looking down on her with two big red |
| metallic eyes. In an attempt to protect her, the boy jumped up in     |
| front of the girl. At that point the robot-like creature seemed to    |
| shrink in upon itself then vanished into the woods. Others in the     |
| area reported hearing loud noises resembling a helicopter coming from |

| including Tal Igur, a 23-year-old student, reported seeing a flying   |
| silvery figure in the sky over Arad, Israel. The figure appeared to   |
| have a frozen, silver face with torso and arms. Other witnesses saw   |
| an object that was emitting flashes of light towards the ground.      |
