| 1949 - Two prospectors in Death Valley, California allegedly         |
| observed a disc-shaped object land. Two dwarfs emerged but were lost  |
| in the sand dunes when pursued. The object disappeared. (Sources:     |

| 1952 - At 2:38 p.m. in Red Bluff, California Ground Observer Corps    |
| observer Albert Lathrop sighted two objects shaped like fat bullets   |
| that flew straight and level, very fast for 25 seconds. (Source: Don  |

| 1952 - On this evening Ronny Desvergers saw a large, round, dark      |
| object above him in a clearing in West Palm Beach, Florida. It had a  |
| turret on top. Red balls of light were emitted by the object and      |
| burned him. He also observed a "hideous" short creature aboard the    |
| craft. The roots of grass growing at the site were scorched.          |

| 1955 - At 11:30 p.m. about 700 meters away from the site of another   |
| humanoid encounter only three days before in Bradford, England, Mr.   |
| Wood, a warehouseman, saw a bright, silvery, bullet-shaped object     |
| behind a hillock. It measured about four meters in height and 1.5     |
| meters in diameter. It had a highly polished chrome-like surface and  |
| made a high-pitched buzzing sound. (Sources: Arthur Constance, The    |
| Inexplicable Sky, p. 222; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A      |
| Century of Landings , p. 251)                                         |

| 1965 - At 8:20 p.m. in Cherry Creek, New York Mrs. William Butcher,   |
| her son Harold, age 17, and other children saw a large elliptical     |
| object, with reddish vapor underneath, that came close to the ground, |
| then shot straight up into the clouds a few seconds later. Their      |
| radio was drowned out by static, and a tractor engine stopped. When   |
| the object was on the ground, a steady beeping sound could be heard.  |
| Afterwards, a strange odor was noticed, and the next day, a purplish  |
| liquid, 2"x2" marks and patches of singed grass were found at the     |
| site. A bull bellowed and tried to break its bonds. (Source: Don      |
| Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).                             |

| 1966 - At 4:50 p.m. in Donnybrook, North Dakota U.S. Border Patrolman |
| Don Flickenger sighted a bright white, shiny thirty-foot diameter     |
| round disc made of a silvery or aluminum material. It was ten meters  |
| meters in diameter, five meters high, and floated down the side of a  |
| hill, wobbling from side to side about three meters above the ground. |
| The object moved across the valley from the southeast, climbed to     |
| about 30 meters altitude, and hovered for one minute over a small     |
| reservoir where it assumed a horizontal position. A dome then became  |
| visible on top of the disc. It next appeared to almost land in a      |
| small field less than 80 meters away, but titled back on edge, then   |
| rose up vertically into the clouds at high speed. (Source: Don        |

| 1969 - Luis Renato Matos, a schoolteacher, was driving his sister in  |
| law and her two children from Ararauma to Campos, Brazil. At 2:50     |
| a.m. near Macae, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil he saw a blue |
| light which, when seen again some 200 meters ahead, now appeared as a |
| bright blue inverted plate about 20 meters in diameter. It floated at |
| an inclined angle 3 to 4 meters above the ground. His passengers were |
| all sleeping at the time. As he came around a bend in the road, Sr.   |
| Renato saw five or six small human like figures less than a meter     |
| tall, all scurrying rapidly about. Each one carried an illuminated    |
| pear-shaped implement, held by a small rod; these glowed like red-hot |
| irons. Renato sped up the car and just after he passed through Macae  |
| his headlights failed and the motor quit. He sat there for a long     |
| while not knowing what to do until, finally, he was again able to     |
| start the car and proceed. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,     |
| HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1969-40, citing Richard   |
| Heiden).                                                              |

| 1970 - A ten year old student in Bukit Mertajam, Penang, Malaysia     |
| reported seeing about 25 landed small objects among the bushes just   |
| outside school grounds. From each of the objects emerged a three inch |
| tall humanoid. As he approached the UFOs the school bell rang and he  |
| returned to class and did not see the objects depart. After school    |
| six school boys in the same village reported seeing a very small      |
| disc-shaped object, blue in color, land in some bushes near their     |
| school. Five little men described as merely three inches tall emerged |
| from the object. One was dressed in a yellow suit and the other four  |
| wore blue uniforms. They were seen installing some type of aerial on  |
| a tree branch that apparently sent out signals. The boys became       |
| frightened and ran away. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |
| Database 1970, case # 812, citing Ahmad Jamaluddin, FSR, Vol. 28, #   |
| 5).                                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1970 - On this same night Mr. And Mrs. Olaf Mohlinder were riding in  |
| a car near Narken, Sweden in a rainstorm with their friend, Assar     |
| Sandberg, who was driving. They saw in the headlights a little man on |
| the roadway, no more than three feet tall, who raised both arms to    |
| cover his face as the car approached. There was a blinding flash and  |
| a sound like a gunshot. Sandberg slammed on the brakes. The little    |
| man was still there. They drove on by and had a brief glimpse of his  |
| apparel: he wore a grayish rain cape and a helmet like a western hat. |

| Humanoid Reports, case 1970-15, citing Axel Franzen, FSR Case         |
| Histories # 14).                                                      |

| 1971 - Security guard Pietro Bongiorni was standing guard at the      |
| local thermal baths in Bobbio, Italy at 7 p.m. when he saw an         |
| "object" descend from the sky. As the object approached he noticed    |
| that it was a man-shaped figure that rapidly changed direction and    |
| headed towards him. Concerned he called for other witnesses and       |
| noticed that the being flew in a crouched position resembling that of |
| someone riding on an "invisible" motorcycle. He described the figure  |
| as human with rosy skin, long black hair, and a beard and was very    |
| tall. It hovered near the witness, staring at him with penetrating    |
| black eyes. As other witnesses approached the figure disappeared in   |
| the direction of a nearby river at a low altitude. (Source: Albert S. |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1971, citing Archivio SUF).        |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - At eight p.m. residents of Buffalo Mills, Pennsylvania spotted |
| an eight-foot tall humanoid walking casually down Main Street. The    |
| humanoid had human features with a dark penetrating gaze and wore a   |
| shimmering shiny outfit cut in an odd way. He took extremely long     |
| strides and barely seemed to touch the pavement. (Source: Albert S.   |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database, case # 2080, citing John A. Keel, |
| The Eighth Tower).                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1979 - On this evening a woman and her two children were picking wild |
| flowers on the river bank in East Didsbury, England besides some open |
| land when they noticed a flash of light with shades of pink, orange,  |
| and silver above a nearby golf course. Soon they saw a curious        |
| looking object descend towards the ground in an apparent crash        |
| landing. They ran up the embankment to get a better view of the       |
| object, which they described as resembling a gondola with a curved    |
| base and a girder-like structure, with a reddish glow on top. The     |
| witnesses felt attracted towards the object and began walking towards |
| it. The next thing they knew they were running away, and the grass    |
| around them was swaying as if in a strong wind. The UFO could be seen |
| flying silently away. After the incident the mother and daughter      |
| developed strange lesions on their legs, and her young son had        |
| nightmares. Under hypnosis the mother was able to recall several      |
| strange beings with elongated heads and "puppet like" faces. She      |
| remembered being examined on a table by some sort of light            |
| beam.(Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1979, case |
| # 1583, citing Peter Hough & Jenny Randles, Mysteries Of The Mersey   |
| Valley).                                                              |
