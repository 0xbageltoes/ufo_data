| 1954 - At 7:45 p.m. in Greenwich, Connecticut a low-flying luminous   |
| disc-shaped object turned north and followed the local river          |
| upstream. It glowed from the inside, and scared the two boys named    |
| Morrell and Moshier who observed it. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A |

| 1955 - At 11:15 a.m. Dario Celis and his co-pilot Cortes were flying  |
| 25 miles southwest of Barquisimento, Venezuela when their radio cut   |
| out. Their aircraft was then buzzed by a multicolored Saturn or       |
| top-shaped object that was rotating counterclockwise. The body of the |
| craft was green, but around the center of the object was a red ring   |
| or band that emitted flashes of brilliant light. Above and below this |
| band were lighted portholes.  The UFO leveled off and raced away.     |

| 1955 - At the Miramar Naval Air Station, California at 11:50 a.m. USN |
| Cmdr. J. L. Ingersoll sighted a highly polished sphere with           |
| reddish-brown coloring. The object appeared to be falling in the sky, |
| then it instantly accelerated to between 1,000-1,500 m.p.h. (Sources: |

| 1958 - At 3:30 p.m. farmer Yasukichi Nakaguchi and his son, and       |
| Kametaro Takuma, saw an egg-shaped object that landed silently in     |
| Hokkaido, Japan. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A      |

| 1958 - At 8:15 p.m. a UFO with a cone-shaped orange flame at its tail |
| moved southwest to northeast over Seacombe Gardens, Adelaide, South   |
| Australia. It made a droning noise like a motor, and flew at an       |
| estimated altitude of 20,000 feet. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs Over |

| 1966 - Mr. and Mrs. L. J. Wise of Salisbury, North Carolina saw a     |
| silver colored, diamond-shaped object in the sky at 11:15 p.m.. It    |
| had several smaller balls of light constantly circling it in very     |
| fast motion around it in a dazzling light show. The UFO hovered over  |
| some trees for 3-4 minutes while a dog barked, and then zipped out of |
| sight. The sighting lasted for an hour. (Sources: Project Blue Book   |

| 1967 - At 12:30 a.m. pilot Sanvitti and co-pilot Calderon were        |
| onboard a Fawcett Airlines DC-4 airliner flying between Chiclayo and  |
| Lima, Peru when their plane was paced by a cone-shaped object. The    |
| aircraft's magnetic compass oscillated 15 degrees left, then 20       |
| degrees right, the cabin lights dimmed, and their radio went out. The |
| bright luminous UFO first came toward them, then stopped above them   |
| giving off a blue beam of light; it went away, then came at then      |
| again joined by a second object flying behind. Finally, both UFOs     |
| sped away. The close encounter lasted for more than six minutes, and  |
| was witnessed by a total of 58 passengers and crew. (Sources: Richard |

| 1968 - On this night Serafin Vieria Sebastiao, a military sentry at   |
| Criaco do Cabrito on the Azores Islands noticed interference on his   |
| transistor radio and then saw a UFO so close to the ground that he    |
| could see four of its occupants. The UFO was oval shaped and          |
| metallic, and was topped by a transparent "tower" with a small        |
| balustrade. Two beings were leaning against the railing, the other    |
| two could be seen as silhouettes inside the transparent tower. After  |
| phoning another sentry he approached the craft and shone his          |
| flashlight on it. Immediately he was enveloped in a fog or smoke      |
| emitted by the UFO, and he fell to the ground in a faint. The second  |
| sentry found him a few minutes later. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted |

| 1969 - On this night near near Nuble, Chile--close to the "Los        |
| Francos" thermal springs--a strange sphere was seen passing overhead. |
| Two car engines started by themselves even though their batteries     |
| were disconnected. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving     |

| 1971 - Two women, Mrs. Sinikka Kuittinen and Mrs. Manninen were       |
| driving from Kuusamo, Finland towards Oulu at 8 p.m. when in the town |
| of Kiiminki they observed a light behind the car on the right hand    |
| side of the road. After some time the light passed over to the left   |
| side of the road, during which the ears of Mrs. Kuittinen plugged up. |
| When they came to a field the light disappeared. Suddenly Mrs.        |
| Kuittinen, who was driving, saw a one meter tall creature with a      |
| helmet on its head. It was clad in a brown-green coverall suit and    |
| crossed the road using small jumps, disappearing on the other side of |
| the road. There were no houses or other buildings in the area. The    |
| women were very scared and did not stop to investigate if it had left |
| tracks, but drove straight to Oulu. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit,  |

| 1977 - A 21-year-old man reported to police in Concord, California    |
| that on leaving a restaurant at 4:10 a.m. he was confronted by two    |
| short, gray-skinned men with large skulls, no hair, and eyes with     |
| black pupils. The next thing he knew he was in a school playing field |
| and facing a circular craft. The craft had landed on the ground there |
| and had a ladder extending toward him. Next he found himself inside   |
| the object with no recollection as to how he got there. He was        |
| examined by the beings, and told telepathically that they were on "a  |
| mission to study life habits" on Earth. They also told him that their |
| craft was from a larger ship located outside the Earth's atmosphere.  |
| While on board he stuck his hand into a chamber, which cause "all     |
| sorts of lights to go off." Finally, he found himself outside an      |
| apartment complex in Concord, where for 15 minutes he was paralyzed   |
| and unable to move. He called the police at 5:33 a.m. (Source: David  |

| 1980 - Two aliens briefly paralyzed a female witness in Araguari,     |
| Brazil. The beings were described as being a little bit over one      |
| meter in height and having large heads. They used a small object that |
| emitted a luminous beam. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |
| Database 1980, citing Revista Brasileira de Ufologia).                |

| 1995 - A woman woke up at three a.m. in her home near Dallas, Texas   |
| and found herself staring at a short thin white being in her bedroom. |
| She was lying on her right side and its face was only slightly above  |
| hers. It was about 3 or 4 feet tall. Next she saw movement out of the |
| corner of her left eye and saw its hand lift slowly off her shoulder. |
| The hand had three very long, white, slender fingers with rather      |
| bulbous tips on the ends. The creature was very white and frail       |
| looking. Its abdomen was sunken and hollow looking which made its     |
| chest seem to protrude. The being moved slowly toward the top of her  |
| head. She had the feeling that the being was scanning her mind. A     |
| cold paralysis or electric sensation spread throughout her body as    |
| she heard the being whisper something. Her next memory was of seeing  |
| the being standing by the hallway staring at her. She then went back  |
| to sleep. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1995, |
| case # 2978, citing Amy Lynn).                                        |

| 2000 - Several people in Priolo, Siracusa, Sicily, Italy saw a        |
| humanoid figure suspended high in the sky over the sea at eight       |
| o'clock in the morning. Others claimed the object resembled a silver  |
| bullet. (Source: UFO Magazine (UK), May 2000, p. 10; Albert S.        |
