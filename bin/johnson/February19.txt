| 1951 - Twelve witnesses flying in an airliner, including two men name |
| Bicknell and Merrifield, while flying near Mount Kilimanjaro in       |
| Tanzania sighted a 200 foot long bullet shaped UFO at 7:20 a.m. At    |
| one end of the object was a square-cut, vertical fin. The body of the |
| craft was a dull silver cover, but at intervals along the fuselage    |
| were dark vertical bands. The object hovered over Mount Kilimanjaro   |
| for several minutes, then moved away fast towards the east at an      |
| estimated speed of 1,000 km per hour. They took a photograph of it.   |

| 1952 - A reddish-orange fireball zig-zagged for 15 minutes over       |
| Corona, California shortly after 6:00 p.m. In addition to zigzagging  |
| the ball of light swooped up and down. There were three witnesses.    |

| three or more green balls of light stopped in midair in Richmond,     |
| California. They then shot away to the south-southwest toward San     |
| Francisco. (Sources: (1) Project Blue Book files counted in official  |

| 1962 - Three commercial fishermen driving south on the Dauphin Island |
| Toll Bridge Causeway in Alabama saw a reddish-orange object to the    |
| south at about 10° elevation at 6:00 p.m. It changed shape from a     |
| round spherical object to an ellipsoidal, football shape, and then    |
| became covered with a (possibly artificially produced) fog.The object |
| was estimated to be about one-third the apparent diameter of the sun. |
| They stopped the car to call Dauphin Island AFS radar site (693rd     |
| Radar Squadron), which by coincidence happened to have two airmen     |
| driving north on the causeway in the opposite direction, and who also |
| saw the object to the west. It was therefore possible to triangulate  |
| the object's location at about 30°16' N, 88° 10' W, and between 2-5   |
| miles away from the civilian observers; the object's actual size was  |
| computed to be at least 30 feet in length. No radar contact was       |
| reported. Venus had set 30 minutes earlier. (Sources: Robert D. Boyd, |

| 1968 - Mrs. Martha Heggs of Bengough, Saskatchewan, Canada had a      |
| close encounter with a metallic disc-shaped object with large windows |
| around the domed top. It circled around her farm making a             |

| her VW car--the engine and lights failed completely. The object gave  |

| North Bergen, New Jersey, at two o'clock in the morning a Mr.         |
| Daliz noticed a human figure in Hudson Park with a light attached to  |
| his head, bent over and apparently picking things up from the ground  |
| and putting them into a little bag. The witness thought the man was   |
| wearing a one-piece uniform, and seemed to be dragging his feet as he |
| walked. He continued doing this activity for 20 minutes. No UFO was   |
| seen at the time. (Sources: Ted Bloecher, FSR, October 1976, p. 6;    |

| object the size of a house. It hovered over some trees giving off     |

| light underneath. It made a deep, low-pitched sound like a            |
| hydroelectric plant. (Source: Joe Graziano, APRO Bulletin, January    |

| along a secondary road in Allen, Rio Negro Province, Argentina when   |
| his engine suddenly cut out. He coasted to a stop and pulled over to  |
| the side of the road. He next heard a loud buzzing sound coming       |
| somewhere from his left and in close proximity. When he looked he     |
| saw a small silvery mushroom-shaped disc hovering a meter over the    |
| ground about 10 meters away. It appeared to be balancing itself with  |
| short ascending and descending movements. At that moment his eyesight |
| began to become blurry. He next heard a deep "electronic" voice       |
| coming from the object, which sounded somewhat threatening in nature. |
| It told him to step out of the truck. Frightened, he refused to move, |
| thinking he would be robbed. When he attempted to restart the truck   |
| he felt a painful, tingling sensation in his neck and blacked out. He |
| experienced at least 20 minutes of missing time. When he woke up he   |
| was unable to see clearly, with a buzzing sound in his ears and still |
| feeling some pain in his neck. He had some unexplained burns on       |
| his skin. A passing motorist picked him up, and he was hospitalized   |
| in a state of confusion, shock, and disorientation. (Sources: La      |
