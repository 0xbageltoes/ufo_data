| gave him the message that humans should desist with H-bomb testing.   |
| They left in a UFO shaped like a spinning top, about 80 feet in       |
| diameter. The object hovered with a ten-foot wide cylindrical section |
| that connected with the ground. (Sources: Hulvio Brant Aleixo, FSR,   |

| object touched down briefly at 9:00 p.m. It stood on a kind of        |

| Mr. Dagota, got a blured glimpse of two figures moving about.         |

| small person, 3.5 to four feet tall, dressed in white tight-fitting   |
| clothing, enter his son's bedroom. About ten minutes later he saw     |
| something like "a bar of light, which appeared to crumble." The boys  |
| and their mother had not seen anyone enter the bedroom, but they had  |
| seen the bar of light. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,        |

| 1973 - Ms. Brown, age 52, saw a silvery metallic sphere at 20 degrees |
| elevation in the sky while driving between Snyder and Big Springs,    |
| Texas during a rainstorm at around four p.m. It was the apparent size |
| of the full moon, and had a band around the middle with diamond       |
| shapes that did not appear to be windows. It was doing a slow yo-yo,  |
| up-and-down motion, and it made no sound that could be heard.         |

| 1976 - Three men saw a four foot tall dwarf at a former Army building |
| in La Spezia near Mount Parodi, Italy on this day. The being wore a   |
| black coverall uniform, with part of it covering its head. It had two |
| oblique slits for eyes. It walked in a clumsy way, "as if sliding on  |
| the ground." It vanished leaving no footprints. (Source: David F.     |

| 1976 - On this night in a shopyard in Vargem Grande, Minas Gerais     |
| province, Brazil 39-year-old Mr. Coelho de Silva was a five-meter in  |
| diameter yellow glowing dome with a blue violet band around its base, |
| and a hole at its center. As the witness ran away he felt a blow and  |
| was knocked down. He then saw a being slide down on a hook from the   |
| hole. He wore a dark metallic uniform with an opaque helmet.          |

| 1979 - At 10:45 a.m. a large, football-shaped object with a brilliant |
| metallic sheen was seen by five witnesses near a lake two miles east  |
| of Dresser, Wisconsin. It closed to within 200 meters of their car,   |
| moved over the lake, and was seen again later over a gravel pit; it   |
| ascended at an 85 degree angle. Total duration was five minutes.      |

| 1981 - A 50 meter wide, bell-shaped domed disc was seen on the ground |
| by three witnesses in a forest in Mansigne, Sarthe, France. It        |
| emitted two beams of light. Ground traces and a powder residue were   |
| found at the landing site. (Source: Larry Hatch,U computer database,  |

| 1991 - At 11:30 p.m. a man in Margut, Ardennes, France reported       |
| sighting three luminous points traveling through the sky in a         |
| triangle, with the point towards the rear. It had two red points      |
| towards the front and a white point towards the rear, according to    |
| the direction of travel. Speed was slow and quiet. It was seen twice. |

| 1993 - At 11:33 p.m. in Depoe Bay, Lincoln County, Oregon a ball of   |
| red-orange light, pulsating, travelled north to south just 150-300    |
| feet off the ground. It moved at 20-30 mph, and was the size of a     |
| car. The light emitted a small light, that fell leaf-like to the      |
| ground. (Source: Li F. Wong, MUFON field investigation case files,    |

| 1995 - On this night a police officer in Campo Rico, Puerto Rico shot |
| at and hit a creature with a .357 pistol while the monster was        |
| attempting to grab a dog. The creature ran away. (Source: Larry       |

| 1997 - Following an encounter with a strange looking humanoid the     |
| evening before, the next morning the same two boys in Cordenons,      |
| Italy along with two other friends went into the woods where they     |
| last saw the creature. About 50 meters away, among some bushes, the   |
| boys saw a round hairless head that was whitish and extremely         |
| wrinkled in appearance. Terrified, the boys fled the area, but soon   |
| returned armed with a camera and a pair of binoculars. They were soon |
| overcome with a strange malaise and headache. They saw the humanoid   |
| again, who they described as about 90 cm in height, dirty-white in    |
| color, and with very long arms. It had three-digit hands that ended   |
| in ball-shaped tips. Its head was oval shaped and devoid of any       |
| facial expressions. The head seemed pointed on top and had a very     |
| pointed chin. Its most prominent feature was its huge black,          |
| oval-shaped eyes. Its mouth was but a thin line and its nose was just |
| two small round holes. Its skin appeared gelatinous and corrugated or |
| wrinkled. They didn't see any sexual organs. The boys left quickly.   |
| The creature was seen briefly next day in the same woods, but it      |
| scurried away into the bushes when the witness approached. (Source:   |

| 2002 - In Fallon, Nevada a witness reported sighting a dark, very     |
| large craft at 11:13 p.m. that he thought at first was a B-52. It was |
| a huge flying triangle with no running lights, but it did have some 7 |
| to 9 dimly lit nodes. It flew at 20 mph making no noise. It was       |
| astonishingly close and so large! Total event time was 8 seconds. The |
| witness had a clear view of the side and bottom of the ship, but      |
| could not make out the leading edge or rear of the craft. (Source:    |

| 2003 - At 10:00 p.m. in Calaveras Big Trees, California a ball of     |
| light followed witnesses out of a pitch black forest, and then        |
| hovered in the bed of their pickup truck for 10 seconds. (Source:     |

| 2004 - On this evening around 10:00 p.m. a couple again watched a set |
| of brilliant strobing lights through binoculars from Linton, Oregon.  |
| They had previously seen the same lights from the same location on    |
| September 3rd, two nights previously. The lights were hovering in the |
| sky across the Willamette River. They distinctly saw four colors of   |
| lights: red, white, green, and blue. They flashed and rotated around  |
| the edges. They would shift position, tilting from horizontal to      |
| vertical, then rotating slowly so that they could see the underside   |
| of a single multicolored object, and then flatten out. The witnesses  |
| also reported that they thought airliners taking off from Portland    |
| International Airport must have seen this object. (Source: George A.  |

| 2009 - At 5:22 p.m. a married couple and their 7-year-old son were    |
| parked next to the Coronda River in Puerto Gaboto, Santa Fe State,    |
| Argentina when they noticed something strange in the sky over a       |
| nearby field. They saw something white flying through the air, and    |
| when they looked at it through the telephoto lens of their camera's   |
| zoom lens they were startled to see that what it was was a cow        |
| suspended beneath a hovering, metallic disc-shaped craft some 30      |
| meters above it. It became clear that the cow was being "absorbed" or |
| levitated up into the UFO. Suddenly and inexplicably, both the cow    |
| and the ufo vanished in plain sight, but they managed to photograph   |
| the bizarre series of events. According to them the cow was not       |
| moving, but appeared to be either asleep or paralyzed. Locals         |
| reported that cattle mutilations had been found in the region in the  |
| past. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2009 Humanoid Sighting Reports      |
