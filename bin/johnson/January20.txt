| 1951 - At 8:26 p.m. the control tower in Sioux City, Iowa warned the  |
| Mid-Continental Airlines DC-3 flight to watch for an approaching      |
| unidentified aircraft. The crew saw a bright light that quickly       |
| closed with them. They saw that it was cigar-shaped with no wings,    |
| and it paced their aircraft for a short while before shooting out of  |
| sight. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official          |

| Flying Objects, p. 118; Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence (Volume I), p. |

| 1966 - At 12:30 a.m. a blindingly bright oval-shaped UFO hovered over |
| a car eleven miles west of Katanning, New South Wales, Australia. It  |
| made a buzzing sound like swarming bees and caused a temporary        |
| paralysis of the four witnesses inside the vehicle. (Sources: Charles |

| 1967 - In 1967 in Methuen, Massachusetts three teenaged girls saw a string   |
| of red lights moving low to the ground about 500 feet away. As they   |
| drove nearer, the object connected with the lights swung around to    |
| reveal a trapezoid shape with two red and two white lights and a      |
| metallic body. The object was now hovering at 100-300 feet altitude   |
| and as it moved to the side of the road, the engine, radio and        |
| headlights of the girls' car suddenly failed. The generator light     |
| continued to pulse, however. The object abruptly shot away to the     |
| southwest at 6:45 p.m. and everything in the car worked normally      |
| again. Later that evening another group of three witness observed the |
| same object 15 minutes later. (Sources: Raymond Fowler, UFOs:         |

| 1969 - In 1969, at Weymouth, Massachusetts near an abandoned ammunition      |
| depot, an object was sighted which looked like a white dish inverted  |
| upon a dish with a dark ring around its perimeter. It had a dome on   |
| top and one red and two amber lights on its leading edge. It moved up |
| and down a few times before moving out of sight around 10:30 p.m.     |

| 1988 - The four member Knowles family was driving on the Nullabor     |
| Plain west of Mundrabilla in Western Australia at around 4:30 a.m.    |
| when their car started being paced by a mysterious light. It followed |
| them for nearly 90 minutes. The close encounter took a dramatic turn  |
| when the UFO buzzed the car from behind and somehow lifted it from    |
| the road. The car was airborne a few feet above the ground for a      |
| short period, then was dropped back onto the highway surface, causing |
| the tires to pop. The UFO had a bright yellow light in the center and |
| looked like the sketch below. The "egg-cup" shaped object then flew   |
| off. The car had dents and scratches on the roof, and their luggage   |
| that had been strapped to the roof was gone. An ash residue was also  |
| found inside the car. (Sources: Pat Delgado, FSR, June 1988, p. 1;    |

| 1993 - At two a.m. a witness in McLarenvale, South Australia reported |
| waking up to a loud humming sound in the house and bright lights.     |
| Then he saw a white humanoid figure standing in his bedroom. (Source: |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1993, case # 1689,       |
| citing Tasmanian UFO Report 1994).                                    |

| 1996 - Hildo Lucio Galindo of Jardim Andere, Varginha, Brazil opened  |
| his bathroom window at eight o'clock in the morning and caught sight  |
| of a short creature with oily brown skin, crouched in a nearby        |
| alleyway. It had very small hands with three exceptionally long       |
| fingers. It ran away when Hildo cried out. The creature had no hair   |
| or clothing and was between four and five feet tall. Later that       |
| morning several calls came into the local fire department about a     |
| "wild animal" on the loose on the north side of the park. When the    |
| fire department arrived they found the military was already on the    |
| scene. According to some witnesses a group of children had thrown     |
| stones at the strange creature and it made a soft buzzing sound, like |
| a bee. The creature was reported to have been captured by the         |
| military and put in a wooden box with a white plastic or canvas       |
| cover, and driven away in an Army truck.                              |
|                                                                       |
| Around the same time local residents heard three shots and saw        |
| soldiers come out of the woods carrying two campaign sacks. One sack  |
| held something motionless, and the other contained something living.  |
| Sources said that the soldiers had shot a creature in the chest,      |
| killing it instantly. Others saw Army trucks near the woods while     |
| still others saw two F-5 jet aircraft fly over the area at low        |
| altitude.                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| Reportedly, a total of eight creatures were reported to have been     |
| captured that day. One was dead, two were injured, and five were      |
| supposedly taken alive and unhurt. Earlier that same morning, at 1:30 |
| a.m., two farm workers in the same general area had spotted a group   |
| of agitated animals running from the area. Upon investigating they    |
| saw a metallic gray submarine-shaped object hovering some five meters |
| above the ground. It looked to be trembling like a curtain, and was   |
| emitting a smoke or fog. Military witnesses later admitted that this  |
| was the object that had later crashed.                                |
|                                                                       |
| Cont: In the afternoon at around one p.m. three girls were walking past a   |
| plot of vacant land when they spotted another bizarre looking         |
| creature. It was only about 80 cm tall, and had brown skin, bulging   |
| red eyes, bulging veins, enormous feet, and three protruding lumps on |
| its head. The being was unclothed and its body seemed covered with an |
| oily substance. The girls panicked and ran away to tell others. Soon  |
| units of the local fire department arrived and apparently took the    |
| creature away. The residents learned of the rumor that a similar      |
| creature had been captured earlier. The small creature emitted a      |
| strange buzzing like sound. Others saw strange cigar-shaped objects   |
| flying low over a field. It was rumored that the military later took  |
| the creature to the nearby city of Campinas, Brazil. (Source: Albert  |
