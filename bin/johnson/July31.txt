| 1909 - In Greenvale, New Zealand a farmhand saw an "airship" about    |
| 150-feet long at dawn. It had a light at each end, and made a strange |
| whirring noise that frightened the horses. A flying fuselage-shaped   |
| airship flew over Dunedin, New Zealand later that morning. A          |
| brilliant light shone from atop a mast antenna. That afternoon a      |
| dark, fat, cigar-shaped object flew over the hills around Fairfax,    |
| New Zealand. It had a box-shaped cabin on the bottom, center, and it  |
| flew on towards the west. (Sources: Richard Hall, From Airships to    |

| Swigert sighted a UFO shaped like a cymbal, or domed disc; about 20   |

| It flew straight and level from horizon to horizon in about 10        |
| seconds, shimmering in the sun as if spinning. (Sources: NICAP UFO    |

| 1948 - On that evening a 30-foot in diameter disc-shaped object with  |
| a transparent center flew slowly and silently over Columbus, Ohio.    |
| There were separate, independent witnesses, including one named       |
| Geshorn. (Source: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers on the Attack, p.    |

| 1960 - At 5:00 p.m.  in Nashville, Ohio a very bright cigar-shaped    |
| object passed by slowly. Its light was so intense it caused eye       |
| irritation for the two witnesses. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, July       |

| 1965 - In Wynnewood, Oklahoma a UFO was tracked on U.S. Air Force and |
| Weather Bureau radar shortly after 1:00 a.m. There were numerous      |

| 8:25 p.m. EDT Douglas Tibbetts, age 16, Betty Klem, 16, Anita         |
| Haifley, 22, and Gerald Labelle, 29 were enjoying the evening at the  |
| swimming beach on Lake Erie when they saw a square or hexagonal       |
| object with lit edges come tumbling down out of the sky from right to |
| left. It stopped 5-10 feet above the beach, and then came down        |
| heavily onto the sand. It had a circle of spotlights at the top that  |
| were visible when it was on the ground. A strange being, 1.80 meters  |
| tall, was briefly seen. The sighting lasted five minutes. Ground      |
| marks were found in the sand. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project         |

| 1967 - At 10:15 p.m. a guard, Sidney Zipkin, age 50, was driving      |
| through a large parking lot in Churchville, New York when his truck   |
| headlights fell upon a cigar-shaped object, 16 meters long, with      |
| green lights under it, landed on the pavement. He stopped his truck   |
| within 30 meters of the object with the truck's headlights aimed at   |
| it. The craft had a spherical central body with side extensions       |
| tipped with green lights, and he was surprised to see two 3-foot-tall |
| dwarf beings dressed in shiny black uniforms rush by his vehicle and  |
| enter the craft, which took off straight up with a hissing sound.     |

| 1968 - Mr. Luce Fontaine, age 31, a farmer on Reunion Island in the   |
| Indian Ocean, was picking some grass for his rabbits at around 9:00   |
| a.m. when he saw an object 5 meters in diameter like two metallic     |
| saucers put face to face, standing on a "glass foot" like a goblet.   |
| It was only 25 meters away. On its top it bore another such "foot."   |
| It was dark blue but had a large central window, through which could  |
| be seen two small individuals, only 3 feet tall, dressed from head to |
| foot in bulky coveralls, something like the Michelin "tire man." Both |
| wore helmets that partially masked their faces. They turned their     |
| backs and there was a brilliant flash of light, and a sensation of    |
| heat with a blast of wind. A few seconds later nothing was to be      |
| seen. There was a local police investigation. (Sources: David F. Webb |

| 1968 - In Grafton, West Virginia at 10:15 p.m. a man and a woman saw  |
| a silver disc-shaped UFO that hovered for 60 minutes or more, making  |
| a beeping sound. It had dark spots on the side that looked like       |

| 1975 - At 7:30 a.m. in Loxton, Northern Cape, South Aftrica Mr. Van   |
| Graan saw an aluminum or silver colored oval-shaped object on the     |

| fair haired, with slanted almond eyes and high cheekbones. They wore  |
| light coveralls with hoods. A light beam hit him in the face, causing |
| eye trouble and a nose bleed. The UFO took off with a loud whine.     |
| Five equidistant leg marks were left in ground. (Sources: Cynthia     |

| that the UFO was responsible for their odd behavior. (Source:Francis  |

| 1993 - A man riding his motorcycle near Orihuela, Alicante, Spain     |
| around midnight noticed a tall dark human figure standing next to a   |
| light pole. The figure seemed to be staring at him. The witness rode  |
| away at high speed but then noticed that the figure was now running   |
| after him at very high speed also, still staring at him. The figure   |
| then disappeared and a bright white sphere appeared and followed the  |
| witness briefly before leaving. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |

| 1995 - At 8:15 p.m. a Boeing 727 airliner narrowly missed a UFO that  |
| darted into its path, then flew along beside it as it made a landing  |
| approach to San Carlos de Bariloche airport, Rio Negro province,      |
| Argentina. The object was estimated to be the same size as the 727,   |
| and was shaped like an inverted flying saucer. (Sources: Michael D.   |

| 2000 - In Bairoa, Aguas Buenas, Puerto Rico a woman was awakened      |
| around 5:00 a.m. when she heard noises coming from her neighbor's     |
| backyard. The noise of something falling on the ground. Her dog began |
| barking inceasantly. She decided to get up and look outside, and when |
| she looked out the window she was startled to see a strange creature  |
| standing with its back to her, only 15 feet away. It was white in     |
| color with wrinkled skin and had an egg-shaped head with large        |
| elongated white eyes with black centers. It had elongated ears, arms, |
| and legs. It appeared to be unclothed. Its hands were in a praying    |
| position and its body and head jerked around as if it had no control  |
| over them. After watching for a few minutes the witness made a sudden |
| noise, causing the creature to turn around halfway and gaze at her.   |
| This caused her to involuntarily close her eyes and step back. She    |
| rubbed her eyes repeatedly and was finally able to open them again.   |
| Frightened, she called additional household members but by the time   |
| they arrived the creature was gone. Two days after later the witness  |
| noticed a green light illuminating her room. No one was able to       |
| identify the source of the light. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |
