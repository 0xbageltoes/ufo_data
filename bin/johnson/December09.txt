| 1954 - On this evening Sr. Da Costa e Rosa, a farmer living in Linha  |
| Bela Vista, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil heard a sound something like a  |
| sewing machine, and saw a cream-colored object "shaped like a         |
| tropical helmet" hovering just above the ground. A broad-shouldered   |
| man with pale skin was inside the craft. Another was outside          |
| examining a fence, while a third was closer to the farmer. Da Costa   |
| dropped his hoe, and this third man, with a smile, picked it up and   |
| gave it back to him. All three men were broad shouldered, with very   |
| pale skin, slanted eyes, and long blond hair. They wore light brown   |
| coveralls fastened to shoes without heels. After plucking a few       |
| plants, the men returned to their craft, which rose into the air      |
| slowly for 30 feet and then shot off at a high speed. The witness had |
| never previously heard about flying saucers. (Sources: Coral E.       |

| 1955 - A bluish white elongated UFO was sighted by a married couple   |
| from a terrace of an apartment building in Boonton, New Jersey at     |
| 7:00 p.m. as it slowly descended toward the ground above the Empire   |
| State Building and the New York City skyline. After several seconds   |
| it "blinked out as if lights had been turned off." At 7:30 p.m. a     |
| luminous green, bullet-shaped UFO was seen from the New Jersey        |
| Turnpike as it flew to the west. It had two round portholes that gave |
| off a white light. It was in full view before it vanished. "It was    |
| there and then it wasn't," said the witness. (Source: Alexander       |

| 1960 - At 8:30 p.m. in Carignan, France a dog was seen barking at a   |
| glowing UFO resting in a park. Three witnesses observed it from       |
| separate locations. It appeared to be an oval-shaped, self-luminous   |
| craft, four meters in diameter. Inside the glowing object vague       |
| shadows were seen moving about. It took off toward the north. A       |
| circle of yellowed grass was found at the site. (Source: Jacques      |

| 1962 - A young man named Candau in Bologna, Italy saw a circular      |
| object 18 feet in diameter land 30 feet away from him. Two men        |
| emerged from the object, speaking an unintelligible language, and     |
| gestured to him. They wore yellow coveralls with wide belts. They     |
| re-entered craft and it departed making a strange sound. (Source:     |

| 1965 - A major military operation took place on this night to recover |
| a bronze colored, bullet or acorn-shaped object, 12 feet long and 10  |
| feet in diameter, that came down in the woods near Kecksburg,         |
| Pennsylvania at 4:50 p.m. (Source: UNICAT database, case 787, citing  |

| 1973 - A 20 meter in diameter cone-shaped object with metallic        |
| antennae was seen in the sky over Mont Ste. Victoire, Bouches-Rhone,  |
| France by an aerospace worker at 10:45 a.m. It tilted at an angle,    |
| rose in the sky, then shot off toward the east. (Source: Lumieres     |

| 1978 - Police in Reggio di Calabria, Sicily, Italy watched a          |
| multi-colored object with intermittent flashing lights at 6:00 a.m.   |
| When spotlighted the UFO seemed to enlarge, then emitted a beam down  |
| onto the police car. Five lights came on aboard the object. When the  |
| police spotlight was turned off, the lights on the UFO went off as    |
| well. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A       |

| 1992 - Nocturnal lights were videotaped over a school in Sidney,      |
| Maine for three minutes at 9:30 a.m. The shape of the object or       |
| objects behind the lights was indistinct, but there was a loud hum    |
| associated with the sighting. The lights zigzagged. (Source: UFO      |

| 1993 - At 7:15 p.m., just after dark, the witness saw a UFO settle    |
| down on a snowy field just across the road from her house in Walpole, |
| New Hampshire. Several undescribed "aliens" exited the object and     |
| appeared to jump across the field with large leaps. They approached   |
| the witness house, and then looked in a window. The frightened        |
| witness hid. The beings then returned to their "ship" and apparently  |
| left. No traces were found at the landing site. (Source: Albert S.    |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1993, case # 2650, citing UFO      |
| Sightings in New Mexico and the World).                               |

| 1995 - At 7:50 p.m. a man who wishes to remain anonymous reported     |
| seeing a brilliant object descend from the sky and appear to enter a  |
| nearby man-made lake behind an apartment complex in Hialeah Gardens,  |
| Florida. Armed with his flashlight, he approached the site and saw    |
| two beings swimming in the water. They had large heads and bright     |
| luminous eyes that appeared to be blinking. The witness briefly       |
| illuminated the creatures with the flashlight, and reported that      |
| their eyes seemed to flare up. He quickly ran away and called the     |
| police. It is not known if the police found anything. (Source: Albert |
| S. Rosales, personal investigation, Humanoid Contact Database, case # |
| 2137).                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1996 - Plinio Bragatto, a 74-year old laborer, was on his way home    |
| after work in Governador Valadares, Mina Gerais, Brazil when he made  |
| a brief stop to buy some beers. He walked on from the mart and        |
| stopped to sit on a rock in order to drink one of the beers. At 6:30  |
| p.m. he heard a loud sound coming from behind him. When he turned     |
| around he saw a large metallic oval-shaped craft land in a field      |
| close to him. It landed on several leg-like protrusions.              |
|                                                                       |
| Once the object had landed a door opened, and a ladder or escalator   |
| of some sort was lowered to the ground. Next a two-meter tall         |
| humanoid figure stepped out. The being approached Bragatto and, in a  |
| peculiar language that sounded like Spanish, invited the witness to   |
| come inside. The witness agreed and was escorted inside. Once inside  |
| he noticed that the interior had a metallic bluish sheen to it. Still |
| speaking in the peculiar language that the witness was somehow able   |
| to understand, the humanoid told Bragatto that they were going to     |
| take him to their "native planet." He was given the impression that   |
| the planet was Mars. There was a total of three humanoids aboard, two |
| men and a woman. He described them as closely resembling humans. They |
| wore loose fitting gray outfits with several golden medallions        |
| hanging from around their necks. The hair on their heads grew from    |
| the middle of their heads back, and they had large ears and mouths    |
| that made them somewhat ugly.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| Before leaving, Bragatto was given a medical examination by the       |
| beings. His stomach area was probed with several needle-like          |
| instruments. On the way to the being's home planet he was given a     |
| fruit resembling a "Mamey" and something resembling an empanada. He   |
| was also given a bitter-tasting beverage. In turn he offered the      |
| humanoids a beer, which they accepted. Arriving on the surface of the |
| other world, the witness was greeted by several similarly appearing   |
| beings. The "planet" was beautiful in appearance and he saw numerous  |
| buildings that appeared to be made of a nylon-like material. One      |
| being now approached him and told him it was time to go, that eight   |
| hours had already passed. On his was back to the craft the witness    |
| saw a huge television screen that showed strange holographic like     |
| images, including dinosaur like animals.                              |
|                                                                       |
| When he asked them when they would be returning to Earth, he was then |
| told "We will return when the storms are less intense, since we have  |
| already lost five of our aircraft as a result of lighting." Around    |
| four o'clock in the morning he was returned to Brazil, but he found   |
| himself in an unfamiliar field. He followed a nearby path and reached |
| a village that was more than 800 kilometers from his home town. He    |
| went to the police and told them what had happened. A police officer  |
| conducted an investigation and reportedly found a circular ground     |
| mark at the field where Bragatto was supposedly dropped off by the    |
| aliens. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database, case # |
