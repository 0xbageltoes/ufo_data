| 1950 - Mr. Quintana of Denver, Colorado saw a silvery green ovoid     |
| object hovering about 15 meters above a slope on South Table          |
| Mountain. It landed slowly in a small ravine. Then it shot upward at  |
| very high speed. Its diameter was about 20 meters, and it had a       |
| revolving middle band. A greenish light flashed under it, and the     |
| witness felt a rush of air and a pungent smell. (Source: Jacques      |

| 1952 - Several bright discs, each estimated to be three feet in       |
| diameter, followed a B-29 Superfortress flying 30 miles               |
| west-southwest of Wonsan, Korea at 11:20 p.m. A second sighting       |
| occurred at 11:24 p.m. with a different squadron of B-29s flying near |
| Sunchon, Korea. (Sources: Kenneth Arnold & Ray Palmer, The Coming of  |

| 1953 - Hearing a commotion in his barn, a farmer in Conway, South     |
| Carolina observed an object about seven meters long and four meters   |
| wide at treetop level. It was light gray in color and lit up inside.  |
| It resembled an egg sliced in half lengthwise. The witness fired his  |
| gun at the object. Numerous livestock died "mysteriously" in the area |
| after the sighting. At 2:00 p.m. four huge metallic discs, each the   |
| size of a B-36 bomber, flew over Malibu Beach, California at a speed  |
| in excess of 1,000 mph. At five minutes before midnight an F-94 jet   |
| interceptor and two other fighter aircraft reported seeing a dark     |
| gray, oval-shaped UFO flying over Presque Isle, Maine. (Sources:      |

| 1962 - A Royal Dutch Air Force F-86 jet interceptor was chased by a   |
| UFO over the eastern Netherlands. The event was witnessed by six      |
| members of the military and the UFO was detected by ground and        |
| airborne radar. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, September 1962,     |

| 1967 - At around 10:00 p.m. Mrs. Enid Campbell saw from her window in |
| her home near Knox City, Missouri what at first looked like the full  |
| moon, but as it got closer she could see that it was a                |
| Saturn-shaped object, with the main body white in color like a        |
| frosted light bulb and a shiny gold horizontal ring around the        |
| center which had numerous round holes. The object came up to within   |
| several feet of her window before stopping, and through its           |
| semi-transparent material she could see a control panel with a lever  |
| on top, and two occupants, one seated at the panel, the other         |
| standing. They wore "shiny, silvery wetsuits." She called her sons    |
| Gene, age 18, and George, age 14, who came to the window in time to   |
| see the object as it rose and moved away. While it hovered nearby two |
| smaller white luminous spheres approached and entered the craft       |
| through an opening, after which the holes in the central ring jetted  |
| out red fire. Then the object ascended vertically and disappeared.    |
| The snow on the ground under the spot where it had been hovering was  |
| melted, and the ground over which the object first approached the     |
| house failed to grow plants, while plants elsewhere grew              |
| normally. (Sources: Skylook, April 1971, p. 12 and November 1972,     |

| 1968 - A woman living alone in an isolated cabin on Keats Island,     |
| British Columbia had for several days witnessed mysterious lights and |
| unknown objects maneuvering over some nearby hills and a nearby lake. |
| On this afternoon two men dressed in neatly pressed, apparently new   |
| dark coveralls, and claiming to be from the public water company,     |
| visited her. The men acted nervous and seemed surprised that she      |
| lived there alone. They finally left disappearing down a nearby       |
| footpath. They seemed to have no obvious means for getting on or off  |
| the island, and she completely disbelieved their story that they were |
| from the public utility. (Sources: Peter Guttilla, Saga UFO Report,   |

| 1969 - At ten o'clock in the morning an 80-year-old woman in          |
| Matadepera, Barcelona, Spain witnessed a pear-shaped UFO with a       |
| horizontal axis that landed very close (within 11 m), making a        |
| "revving" noise. It was estimated to be three meters long and had a   |
| 2.5 meter diameter, and was wider in the front. It gave off bright    |
| colors, green and yellow mostly, and was described as "very pretty."  |
| After landing it made an abrupt turn to pass under some high tension  |
| (5 Kv) power lines. (Sources: Jose Maria Casas-Huguet, FSR Case       |

| 1970 - A man and woman in their mid-twenties had a close encounter    |
| with a disc-shaped object while driving on U.S. Highway 44 in Cassia, |
| Lake County, Florida. The object made a whirring sound, and emitted a |
| variety of flashing multicolored lights. There was an independent     |
| witness. (Sources: George D. Fawcett, Flying Saucers, September 1970, |

| 1972 - At 7:30 p.m. in Chatsworth, Ventura County, California a       |
| slowly rotating disc-shaped object with lights around the rim was     |
| seen for a minute by a mail carrier. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer |

| 1974 - A flight instructor and his student were flying over the       |
| Pacific Ocean off the coast of Santa Ana, Orange County, California   |
| in the middle of the day when they were buzzed by five glowing red    |
| UFOs, which circled their plane for the next hour. (Sources:          |

| 1976 - Mr. Carrasco, a 29-year-old farmer, was walking home at 12:30  |
| a.m. in Benacazon, Sevilla province, Spain when he heard a noise      |
| “like a jet.” Turning around, he saw a brilliant light hovering in    |
| the sky; it approached and landed 18 feet away. It was dark green,    |
| rectangular, and taller than a telephone booth, and it stood on three |
| legs. From this landed object emerged two men 6’6” or more in height, |
| who came to within 12 or 15 ft of the witness. They were clad in dark |
| but luminous tight fitting clothing resembling rubber or plastic,     |
| with wide belts whose buckles emitted blindingly bright and hot       |
| flashes of red and white light; he could not see their faces, but     |
| noticed that they had shoulder-length blondish-white hair. The        |
| witness put his hands over his face, but could not stir from the      |
| spot. He heard the men talking in a language he could not understand; |
| then he began to run. The UFO rose and flew over him, emitting        |
| something that burned him; he lost consciousness until at 0230A he    |
| found himself at the door of his house in Benacazon. He had to be     |
| hospitalized for shock. In the hospital he was found to have strange  |
| sooty black marks on his right cheek, on the palms of both hands, on  |
| his shoulders and on his right arm; these began to disappear after    |
| 7-8 hours. (Sources: Joaquin M. Nogales, MUFON UFO Journal, August    |

| 1976 - At around 10:15 p.m., while driving near Pahrump,              |
| Nevada southwest of Las Vegas, Country & Western singer Johnny Sands  |
| saw a rusty orange cigar-shaped object descend from the sky. The      |
| object was at least 60 feet long, and had flashing red and white      |
| lights on one end and a dark ring around the middle section, which    |
| also had portholes. His car stopped running, and he got out to check  |
| the engine. He next saw two men, about 200 feet away, walking toward  |
| him. They wore silver sparkling one-piece uniforms with a diagonal    |
| black stripe, and a round white central emblem. He wanted to get back |
| into his car but felt paralyzed and unable to move. As the men        |
| approached, he saw that they were bald and had close set squinting    |
| eyes, a grayish white complexion, and something that lookede like     |
| folds or gills under their ears. Their mouths were very small and     |
| their noses “puggish.” One of them questioned Sands in English, but   |
| he did not hear the words coming from the being's mouth. It spoke in  |
| a slow, “robot-like” voice. The voice asked him, “What are you doing  |
| here?” and he replied, “I am an entertainer.” The next question was   |
| “What are your means of communication,” which he was at a loss to     |
| answer. Four or five other questions were asked, which he has chosen  |
| not to reveal. They said that they would see him again. Turning to    |
| go, the leader brushed his fingertips over Mr. Sands hand, which      |
| seemed to release him from the paralysis. They walked away, and the   |
| car started again. Many observers reported seeing rust-colored cigar  |
| shaped objects over the Las Vegas Valley that night. (Sources: APRO   |

| 1979 - In the early morning hours a married couple in Bissoe Truro,   |
| Cornwall County, England were awakened at around two a.m. to find     |
| their bedroom lit up brightly. One of the witnesses looked out the    |
| window and was amazed to see a bright hovering oval-shaped craft.     |
| Inside could be seen two human-looking men with long wavy blond hair. |
| The UFO glided silently away and then shot away at high speed.        |

| 1980 - At ten p.m. three National Telephone Company officials, Gomez, |
| Polar, and Aguilar, on the highway between the towns of Desaguadero   |
| and Pomata, Peru saw a bright circular UFO with red and white lights  |
| on the bottom hover stationary at 1000 meters altitude. It went       |
| behind a cloud for three minutes, then was observed for five more     |
| minutes as it flew over Lake Titicaca. (Sources: Richard Heiden, UFO  |

| 1982 - At two o'clock in the morning a student in Bankstown, a suburb |
| of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia had a low level close encounter |
| with a five-meter thick rectangular object with a glassy              |
| metallic surface. The object was only 100 meters away. It had bluish  |
| yellow bottom lights, and green lights on the side. The UFO caused    |
| nearby trees to sway, TV static interference, and streetlights in the |
| area to turn off. The object took off with a vertical ascent. After   |
| the object left the streetlights came back on 20 minutes later.       |

| 1986 - In Dal'negorsk, Vladivostok, Russia in eastern Asia a red      |
| fireball flew parallel to the ground with an estimated speed of 15    |
| meters per second, leaving no wake or trail. At 7:55 p.m. it dove     |
| silently into the slope ofHill 611 (a mountain 611 meters in height), |
| then jumped up-and-down six times. A very bright light, like flames   |
| from a welding torch, was observed coming from the mountain for an    |
| hour, then the red ball of light took off. Traces at the site         |
| included a fine, glassy metallic fabric debris, lead and iron         |
| pellets, and magnetic anomalies. Temperature at the crash site was    |
| estimated to have been as high as 25,000 deg C. (Sources: Paul        |

| that stopped moving across the sky at 9:30 p.m. and then backtracked. |
| At 10:15 p.m. five bright lights in a triangle formation changed to a |
| straight line, looking like balls of fire, giving off what seemed to  |
| be smoke. These five bright lights were also observed by a married    |
| couple from Glenmore. They reported that after about eight minutes    |
| the first light disappeared, then the third one. The object or        |
| objects were just below the cloud cover. There were also sightings in |
| Adelaide, South Australia this night. Single and multiple bright      |
| orange orbs were seen flying over the city, and they were seen to     |
| disappear in vicinity of the Blue Mountains. (Sources: Karen Burden & |

| 2001 - At 12:15 p.m. a resident of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil      |
| reported that first everything froze on the street. Then a UFO        |
| appeared overhead with multicolored lights--white, blue and           |
| red--spinning on the underside. A door in the object opened, and a    |
| tall being with long skinny arms, a skinny body, and a large head     |
| appeared in view. The door quickly shut, and the object shot away.    |
