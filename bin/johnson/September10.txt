| 1951 - U.S. Air Force pilots Lt. Wilbert Rogers and Major Ezra        |
| Ballard were flying in a T-33 at 20,000 feet from Dover AFB when at   |
| 11:35 a.m. EDT they saw a silvery metallic disc-shaped object to      |
| their 11 o'clock position and below their aircraft, three miles       |
| northeast of Sandy Hook, New Jersey. It was silhouetted against the   |
| ground. Rogers immediately turned left and descended to intercept the |
| craft, which then banked revealing its flat round profile, with no    |
| appendages. The UFO curved in a tight turn, covering an estimated 30  |
| nautical miles in two minutes at a speed estimated between            |
| 1,000-1,500 mph. The object passed within about 8,000 feet distance   |
| of the T-33, descending from about 12,000 feet to 5000 feet and       |
| heading out to sea at high speed near Point Pleasant. The aerial      |
| sighting lasted two minutes and was rated a high reliability unknown  |
| by Project Blue Book and Dr. James McDonald. (Sources: Edward J.      |

| 1954 - Mourieras, France. A farmer, Mr. Mazaud, age 50, was walking   |
| home when he was suddenly confronted with a helmeted being of average |
| height who made friendly gestures, then went back into the brush,     |
| entered a cigar-shaped object about four meters long, which took off  |
| toward Limoges. A few minutes later witnesses in Limoges reported a   |
| disc-shaped, red object leaving a bluish trail. (Sources: Le          |

| 1954 - A metal worker, Marius Dewilde, age 34, came out of his house  |
| in Quarouble, France at 10:30 p.m. when his dog was barking and saw a |
| dark object sitting on the railroad tracks. He then observed two      |
| dwarfs walking toward it. When he tried to stop them, he found        |
| himself blinded and paralyzed by a strong orange beam of light that   |
| was projected at him. The beings were under 1 meter (3.3 feet) tall,  |
| bulky, and wore dark diving suits with diver's helmets. No faces or   |
| arms were visible. Imprints were made by an object, that an engineer  |
| estimated must have weighed 30 tons. French police and the French Air |
| Force investigated the case. (Sources: Le Parisien, September 13,     |

| 1965 - Antonio Pau Ferro, a farmer, was working in his cornfield in   |
| Sao Joao, Pernambuco State, Brazil at 8:30 in the morning when he     |
| heard a rushing noise and saw two luminous discs five feet wide and   |
| two feet thick, come down nearby. They discharged two small beings,   |
| 27-31” tall, and then rose to hover at 15 feet. The entities had      |
| reddish brown, wax-like complexions and wore tight fitting one        |
| piece-outfits. They spoke an unknown language, smiled at the witness, |
| and picked a tomato; then the two discs came down and picked them up, |
| rising vertically with a whistling sound. The farmer said that they   |
| appeared quite human, except for their strange skin color and their   |
| size. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of    |

| 1965 - On this night a hovering object was seen from a street in      |
| Jalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. It discharged yellow, blue, and orange      |
| lights from slits around its circumference. Four people--a local      |
| reporter, a bullfighter, and two taxi drivers--saw a creature with    |
| glowing catlike eyes dressed in black, walking down the street. The   |
| entity was holding a metallic tube. When they pursued the being       |
| it vanished suddenly. (Sources: Chicago Tribune, October 14, 1965;    |

| 1965 - On or about this date three women in Mexico City, Mexico were  |
| said to have observed a group of giant beings, three meters tall,     |
| without noses or mouths but with bright red eyes, wearing gray        |
| uniforms and boots. No object was described. (Source: Jacques Vallee, |

| 1967 - At 6:03 p.m. flying over the Pyrenees Mountains in a DC-6 at   |
| 16,000 feet altitude, 65 miles north of Reus, Tarragona, Spain three  |
| men, Underhill, Hope and Dunlop, sighted an inverted flying cone,     |
| silver on top, with a curved base, that looked metallic and solid.    |
| Its minimum distance was estimated to be 1/2 mile, and it was moving  |
| opposite to the plane. It was initially higher, then half a           |
| mile below. The sighting lasted more than two minutes. (Sources: APRO |

| 1968 - On this night in Pergamino, Buenos Aires, Argentina J.         |
| Bautista Perazzo allegedly had contact with extraterrestrial beings.  |
| He said he was going along National Highway # 8 when he caught sight  |
| of “the only UFO which has molested the earth in these past years.”   |
| The alien crew contacted him and communicated with him orally in      |
| perfect Castilian Spanish about his technical resources and their     |

| 1975 - On this evening two children in Moulin Sous Fleron, Liege,     |
| Belgium were frightened by a being dressed entirely in black that     |
| moved like an ape and jumped from the bushes in front of them. They   |
| ran to a neighbor's house. Twenty minutes later the same being was    |
| seen again by another witness, who reported that the being had thrown |
| rocks at him. No UFO was reported. (Sources: Awareness, April 1975,   |

| 1976 - Colusa, California. At 12:45 a.m. mechanic Bill Pecha and      |
| other household members noticed a complete electrical system failure  |
| in their mobile home. Next, stepping outside to check the circuit     |
| breakers, he felt static electricity and spotted a brightly lit, 150  |
| foot domed disc-shaped object with a clockwise rotating rim hovering  |
| almost overhead, just 50-60 feet away. The object had a red light in  |
| front and other lights on either end, and the bright light that came  |
| from the bottom of the object dimmed when hovering. On the underside  |
| it had 6-8 dangling cables, and on each were two arms with hooks      |
| which retracted when Pecha stepped toward the object. The object      |
| retreated, moving slowly out over a field, with the cables still      |
| retracting. The white light underneath intensified and a cone of      |
| light was projected downward, but initially the beam was truncated    |
| before reaching the ground. The object maneuvered above a neighbor's  |
| house illuminating the ground with beams of light. Two other similar  |
| UFOs were seen in the distance casting blue light beams down onto     |
| power lines, and an arc of light was extending upward from the power  |
| lines to the objects. When the object shot away at high speed to the  |
| west, it lit up the foothills, then it rushed back over the           |
| neighbor's property again as the other two, more distant object sped  |
| away in different directions, and were gone in 30 seconds. The power  |
| came back on in Mr. Pecha's mobile home; the entire elapsed time of   |
| the close encounter was 9 minutes. (Sources: Colusa (CA) Sun-Herald,  |

| 1977 - A beam of red light penetrated the roof of 32-year-old Beatriz |
| Almada da Costa's house in the village of Santo Antonio do Ubintuba,  |
| Para State, Brazil at 7:30 p.m. As the beam struck her body,          |
| paralysis spread throughout her body accompanied by chills            |
| and shaking. (Source: Bob Pratt, Operacao Prato, p. 11).              |

| 1978 - At 4:40 p.m. two men were sitting at home watching             |
| television in Las Salinas, San Miguel de Tucuman, Tucuman State,      |
| Argentina when they starting having TV interference. They next        |
| attempted to use a stereo player, and then the radio, but these did   |
| not function properly either. They then heard some noises coming from |
| an adjoining shop that was connected to their house. When they went   |
| to investigate, they found some broken bottles on the floor and some  |
| other damage. Moments later, they became aware of presence of two     |
| short beings standing nearby. These beings were dressed in bright     |
| blue, one-piece suits, dark blue helmets, and high boots also bright  |
| blue in color; on their arms they wore shiny black gauntlets that     |
| went above the elbow. Their faces were brown and their complexion     |
| seemed pockmarked, their eyes looked normal and their noses were      |
| flat. One of the figures was holding an object that looked like a     |
| "hair dryer", and was pointing it at the witnesses. Both men then     |
| received a telepathic message warning them not to scream. At this     |
| point one of the men ran for the door, and in response both           |
| figures put their fingers up their noses and vanished instantly,      |
| reappearing in a different location in the shop. They did             |
| this several more times as the first witness, armed with a knife, ran |
| around trying to get out of the shop. Some empty crates were thrown   |
| at the witnesses during the melee. They finally managed to            |
| escape, and summoned the police who searched the premises but found   |
| nothing. Neighbors had reported seeing strange lights in the area.    |

| went below his tail, then to the 3 o'clock position, and then finally |
| ascended above 25,000 feet. Another second light flew around          |
| erratically. (Sources: Allan Hendry, International UFO Reporter, July |

| formation of red lights at a 45 degree elevation in the sky, that     |
| blinked on-and-off 3-5 times in 15 minutes. They grew dimmer over     |
| time, then disappeared. (Sources: Allan Hendry, International UFO     |

| 1981 - At around 11:00 p.m. Denise Bishop, age 23, of Weston Mill,    |
| Plymouth, Devonshire, England had a time distortion while in contact  |
| with a pencil thin, green beam of light from a 125 foot wide,         |
| metallic appearing UFO. It felt "as though a film had been stopped    |
| and started again." The huge UFO was the "same shape as the body of a |
| crab", and it hovered over a hill of residential houses, emitting 6   |
| to 7 pink, purple and white light beams. The green beam of light from |
| the UFO hit her left hand, and she was unable to move. Some congealed |
| matter formed on her hand, causing a burn. She still had a burn on    |
| her hand three months later that looked like a "pale birth mark."     |

| 2001 - A bread delivery man and a salesman had separate pre-dawn      |
| highway encounters with two bright oncoming lights in Kanturk, County |
| Cork, Ireland; one reported it looked like a figure-8 on its side.    |

| 2002 - An airline captain of Aer Lingus flight EIN 566, taking off    |
| from Dublin, Ireland at 2:20 p.m., reported a "paraglider" two miles  |
| north of runway 10, at an estimated altitude of 1200 feet. A "very    |
| slight radar echo" was also detected from the object. There were      |
| ground witnesses as well. (Source: Dermot Butler, Conspiracy of       |

| 2002 - At dusk a black flying triangle with three white lights in a   |
| triangle formation, and a faint steady red light in the center was    |
| sighted in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada. It made a flat, 45-degree  |
| left hand turn without banking. Later that same evening, a            |
| disc-shaped UFO changing colors from purple to green to blue, then    |
| with a solid blue with red glow on the trailing edge was seen at      |
| 10:50 p.m. on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It moved overhead   |
| to the west, then disappeared. It was fast but slower than a meteor.  |

| 2004 - At about 10:10 p.m. a witness saw a bright moving object in    |
| the clear sky over Mount Cobb, Pennsylvania and called his mother and |
| two sones to come see. It was moving near the Big Dipper and changing |
| colors from green to red to dark orange to white, as though it were   |
| spinning. Looking at it through binoculars it was a rounded triangle. |
| They could see the colors very clearly. On top of the object was a    |
| very bright white light. It was hovering, then it moved from the left |
| to the right. The main color of the object was yellow. A military     |
| aircraft was flying to the northwest, but this object flew southeast. |
| The strange object was much brighter, much bigger, and much higher    |
| than the military planes. That same night many witnesses in Los       |
| Angeles, California also saw a triangle UFO that came back the next   |
| night as well. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell, Filer's  |
