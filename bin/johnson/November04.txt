| 1867 - In the middle of the afternoon a large number of black discs   |
| in groups and separately passed rapidly through the sky over Chatham, |
| England. The procession continued for more than 20 minutes. Several   |
| groups passed silently overhead, then vanished leaving a brown,       |
| smoke-like vapor. (Source: Jerome Clark, International UFO Reporter,  |
| Spring 2003, p. 20).                                                  |

| 1952 - At six o'clock in the morning, over a hospital in Laval,       |
| Mayenne department, France a brilliant cigar-shaped UFO changed color |
| and then change shape into a disc-shaped object, then back into a     |
| cigar shape, and then faded away. The sighting lasted five minutes.   |

| 1954 - At 6:30 a.m. a six-meter wide diameter disc was seen spinning  |
| in the sky over a farm in Le Sourn, Morbihan department, France. It   |
| flew toward the south, making multiple landings and emitting beams of |
| light. The farm animals were frightened by it. The incident lasted 30 |
| minutes. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 4129, citing |

| 1954 - At quarter past three in the afternoon on the island of        |
| Sardinia a domed disc-shaped UFO, estimated to be 15 meters in        |
| diameter, was observed on the roadside in Nuoro, Italy near Monte     |
| Ortobene. It had grates on the bottom. After eight minutes it took    |
| off vertically making a noise. (Sources: Alberto Perego, FSR Case     |

| 1954 - On this evening Jose Alves was fishing on the river in Pontal, |
| Sao Paulo state, Brazil when he saw a luminous object come "wobbling" |
| down from the sky. It was 3-4 meters (10-15 feet) in diameter, and it |
| looked like "two washbowls joined together." It came down and hovered |
| six feet above the ground and only a few feet away from the witness.  |
| Three small dwarfish men with dark skin and wearing white uniforms    |
| with "skull caps" emerged from the disc. They collected foliage and a |
| sample of the river water in a metal tube. They then jumped back in   |
| the craft. The UFO rose vertically, making no sound. (Sources: Larry  |

| 1954 - On or about this date, at night in the Amacuro Delta,          |
| Venezuela Fernando de Moya, age 39, was hunting from his launch, when |
| he saw a luminous sphere hovering six feet above the ground. The two  |
| Indians with him fled in terror, but he approached and saw two        |
| three-foot tall figures with round heads andlarge eyes running back   |
| and forth to the sphere. They ran making little jumps, and picking up |
| various things. They entered through one of two windows in the UFO.   |
| When they saw De Moya, they jumped into the object, which ascended    |
| vertically. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |

| 1971 - In Austin, Texas Trudy Van Riper was awakened by her cats      |
| growling at four o'clock in the morning. Outside a pasture was        |
| illuminated by a UFO that looked like an "elliptical moon." In her    |
| front yard a vehicle had landed on the lawn, looking like a VW Beetle |
| without fenders. Three small men emerged, and communicated with her   |
| telepathically, "Any pigs in that field? We are hungry." (Source:     |

| evening between nine o'clock and eleven o'clock. (Source: Lumieres    |

| 1999 - A triangular shaped flying object was photographed over Col de |
