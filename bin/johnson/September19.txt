| 1947 - A Humble Oil geophysicist in Grand Isle, Louisiana was testing |
| radar to detect bad weather at 5:30 p.m. when his radar detected a    |
| UFO shooting to the southwest at a speed greater than 1,000 mph for   |
| less than a minute. (Source: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947: A Preliminary |

| 1952 - Five men in a RAF Meteor aircraft, including John W. Kilburn,  |
| were flying at 5,000 feet altitude over Dishforth, North York,        |
| England when they sighted a UFO at 1,000 feet above their plane at    |
| 10:53 a.m. They described it as round and silvery, and it changed     |
| shape to something more elliptical. It was solid looking, and         |
| it swung like a pendulum as it lost altitude. Ten British officers    |
| had just deplaned from Operation Mainbrace at Dishforth Aerodrome     |
| when they spotted the same UFO. It appeared as a white, round,        |
| glimmering circular object, followed by the RAF Meteor jet aircraft   |
| two miles back. The UFO lost altitude, and then fluttered like a leaf |
| in a pendulum-like motion. (Sources: Aime Michel, The Truth About     |

| 1954 - At 4:30 p.m. five women in Col du Beal, Puy-de-Dome, France    |
| saw a flat gray, metallic disc-shaped object that hovered for 30      |
| seconds, then accelerated rapidly and flew away to the northwest.     |

| 1954 - At 9:15 p.m. a policeman, Louis Moll, saw a bright light land  |
| on the heights in Oberdoff, Moselle department, France, then darken.  |
| The object was the size of a small bus. The light from the object     |
| became reddish, and he could see a black silhouetted figure moving    |
| around in front of it. After 40 seconds the object then rose up into  |
| the air again, and took on the appearance of a red ball. It flew off  |
| to the southeast. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the       |

| 1961 - In perhaps the most famous UFO abduction story ever reported,  |
| Betty and Barney Hill, a biracial married couple active in the Civil  |
| Rights movement, were driving home from Montreal to their home in     |
| Portsmouth, New Hampshire late on this evening. When they reached     |
| Colebrook they noticed a bright lighted object in the sky that seemed |
| to be pacing their car, and they continued to observe it as the drove |
| along a desolate section of U.S. Route 3 through the White Mountains. |
| Around Indian Head, New Hamsphire they stopped by the side of the     |
| road to take a closer look, and saw through binoculars a lenticular   |
| object with a double row of portholes and half a dozen dark figures   |
| working at control panels inside. One of the occupants seemed to      |
| stare directly at them. They became frightened and drove away. A      |
| "beeping sound" enveloped their car, and they felt a prickling        |
| sensation before losing consciousness.                                |
|                                                                       |
| When they came to, they were driving near Ashland, New Hampshire.     |
| They arrived home in Portsmouth unable to account for about two       |
| hours. A series of nightmares and then a series of hypnosis sessions  |
| performed by a psychiatrist in Boston brought back memories of their  |
| abduction experience by the occupants of the UFO. They encountered    |
| six five-foot-tall entities with large eyes and heads. One acted as   |
| their guide or interpreter, and he communicated with them by          |
| telepathy. They were separated, stripped for a medical exam during    |
| which a needle was inserted in Betty Hill's navel and Barney's        |
| dentures were removed and examined. There was also a map of the stars |
| seen at one point, and Betty asked to take an artifact as evidence of |
| their experience, but was refused. (Sources: John Fuller, The         |

| 1963 - Four children in Saskatoon, Saskachewan, Canada saw a bright   |
| oval object hover in a field and drop something. Approaching the      |
| site, they were confronted by a three meter tall man dressed in a     |
| white monk's suit, who held out his hands and made unintelligible     |
| sounds. The giant entity was semi-transparent and had no visible      |
| face. The children fled in panic. One girl was admitted to the        |
| hospital in shock. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A   |

| 1967 - At 7:30 p.m. Aeroflot IL-14 airliner flying over Volgograd,    |
| Russia was buzzed by a UFO. The aircraft engines quit temporarily,    |
| but then restarted as the object shot off toward the east. Ten        |
| minutes later, a luminous crescent-shaped object was seen high in the |
| sky by a group of scientists in Belgogradskaya District, Russia at    |
| 7:40 p.m. The object then began making a rapid descent. It had        |
| a cone-shaped tail. For 40 seconds it engaged in a falling leaf       |
| motion, turned red, then assumed a drop shape, and finally dissolved  |
| away and vanished. (Sources: Felix Zigel, unpublished manuscript, pp. |

| 1968 - At 6:10 p.m. in the city of Bistrita, Romania a group of       |
| observers including a man named Rusu watched a disc-shaped object     |
| with three small lights hovering for five minutes. The object stayed  |
| in one place during heavy winds, and caused electromagnetic           |
| interference effects at a nearby radio station and also blocked TV    |
| reception. It flew off rapidly to the south. (Source: Ion Hobana &    |

| 1968 - At 8:00 p.m. Mr. Tsekhanovich, a high trained observer,        |
| watched as a  bright pulsating orange ball descended over the ocean   |
| as it was being circled by four smaller balls of light near Gagra,    |
| Georgia. The large UFO became elongated and then vanished. One minute |
| later there was a flash of light and all the remaining objects were   |
| gone as well. (Sources: Xenolog, August 1976, p. 13; Jacques Vallee,  |

| 1970 - At 10:30 p.m. a two-meter in diameter halo of light hovered    |
| over a 22-year-old woman on a farm near Villalba del Alcores,         |
| Valladolid, Spain making a buzzing sound. Dogs on the farm acted      |
| stunned and disoriented. (Sources: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos,      |

| 1971 - On this evening in Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires province,        |
| Argentina 19-year-old Osvaldo D'Annunzio had a close encounter of the |
| second kind with a UFO that involved landing traces and physiological |
| effects. (Source: UFO Nachtrichten, March 1972, citing an unnamed     |

| 1972 - Mr. Jamieson took photographs as a brilliant disc-shaped       |
| object flipped 6-8 times in the sky over Broadmeadows North, a suburb |
| of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia at 10:10 p.m. The object flew at    |

| 1973 - After midnight two successive F-4 jet interceptors flying      |
| above Tehran, Iran attempted to catch a radar-visual UFO that had     |
| been widely reported by civilians. Every time visual contact was made |
| and the crews attempted to arm a missile and prepare to fire at it,   |
| the weapons systems electronics failed. (Source: Fund for UFO         |

| 1973 - At 7:30 p.m. a shiny salad-bowl shaped domed disc hovered at   |
| low altitude over Dunkerque, Nord, France. It made no sound, and      |
| there were many witnesses at the border post. (Source: Larry Hatch, U |

| 1974 - At 12:45 a.m. Younic Le Bihan, age 20, was awakened by his     |
| parents to observe a UFO hovering outside their house in Riec sur     |
| Belon, France. The family was using binoculars to view it. The object |
| resembled a boat; it had lights like portholes that emitted a very    |
| bright light that changed from orange to green, and on each side of   |
| the base was a red light. The object was estimated to be 30 feet wide |
| and 22 feet high, and it hovered just two feet above the ground. Then |
| the lights were extinguished, and the family saw a star-like light    |
| that quickly disappeared. Younic then observed three heavy set        |
| humanoid figures, about 5 1/2 foot tall, "waddling" toward them. The  |
| beings were dressed in metallic suits and appeared to be              |
| floating above the ground, and their faces were not visible. The      |
| family fled from their house in fear. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted    |

| 1975 - In Les Mureaux, France at 10:30 p.m. a 22-meter long           |
| reddish-orange cigar-shaped object zig-zagged up the Seine River at   |
| only 5 meters altitude. The size and distance of the object was       |
| calculated by triangulation. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, January  |
| 1977).                                                                |

| 1976 - Two Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantom jets with AIM-9 missiles     |
| were scrambled to intercept a UFO, 40 nautical miles north of Tehran, |
| Iran at 1:30 a.m. local time. They were vectored in by ground radar,  |
| and the UFO was described as a brightly luminous domed disc the size  |
| of a Boeing 707. A small object was shot by the larger disc toward    |
| the plane. First, the aircrafts' inertial navigation systems          |
| fluctuated and their radio communications were lost. When the pilot   |
| of the first aircraft, Houssain Perouzi, tried to fire one of his     |
| missiles at the UFO, their jet lost control of all its instruments.   |
| The second jet just lost weapons control. The disc was changing       |
| colors and shape when first detected; it next engaged in a series of  |
| sharp maneuvers. A third object descended vertically and landed in a  |
| desert area. The entire incident lasted two hours. (Sources: APRO     |

| 1976 - At 1:10 a.m. four crew members on a Boeing 707 airliner,       |
| Duarte, Alexio, Graca, and Santos, flying over the Atlantic Ocean     |
| between the Azores and Lisbon, Portugal at 35,000 feet altitude       |
| encountered an intense bluish light, which suddenly turned off, then  |
| became many less intense lights. There were three or four on top of   |
| the object, three smaller yellow lights below that, and two at the    |
| bottom of the object that looked like portholes. The minimum distance |
| to the object was one mile. The duration of the sighting was five     |
| minutes. (Source: UNICAT, case # 790, citing Joaquim Fernandes, p.    |

| at 4000 feet altitude and at a speed of 240 km/hour were five minutes |
| after takeoff from Portela Airport in Lisbon, Portugal when they      |
| spotted a bluish white light in front of them. They immediately       |
| contacted the control tower because the UFO was hovering in front of  |
| them, but it then moved in another direction. The minimum distance to |
| the object was only 200 meters. The white light (reported to be blue  |
| by the tower) accelerated fast to the north. The close encounter      |
| lasted 45 seconds. (Sources: Phenomenes Spatiaux, December 1976,      |

| 1979 - The witness, a military man, awoke in the middle of the night  |
| in his home in Barrio La Gloria, Mendoza province, Argentina unable   |
| to sleep, so he lit a cigarette and walked to the kitchen, leaving    |
| his family still sleeping. He leaned on the kitchen window ledge, and |
| when he pulled the curtain aside he was surprised to see a circular   |
| gray metallic object on the ground near his house. A short,           |
| human-like figure appeared next to the craft. He wore a very white    |
| outfit with what appeared to be a bright green visor over the eyes.   |
| The witness sensed some type of telepathic message, but could not     |
| recall its contents, and does not remember how the figure and the     |
| object left. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |

| 1979 - At 7:00 p.m. four witnesses, including two 11-year-old boys    |
| with the surnames Lara and Moron, had a close encounter with a        |
| hovering, flashing, round red light in an empty lot in the            |
| neighborhood of Lujan de Cuyo, the city of Santa Ines, Mendoza        |
| province, Argentina. The object, which was emitting the flashing red  |
| light from the top of the craft, was 20 meters above ground at the    |
| time. After touching down on the ground, the object rose two meters   |
| into the air, and then landed again. Its color changed from red to    |
| white to blue. The UFO landed with a shrill sound, giving off rays of |
| blue and white light. At the landing site were found five holes,      |
| three centimeters in diameter and two cm deep, with one of the holes  |
| in the center. These imprint marks were within a 50 cm circle marked  |

| out hunting for firewood, and were using a disused track into the     |
| bush, when the boy noticed a movement nearby and told his father.     |
| They then saw the tall, jet-black figure watching them from behind    |
| some trees. The figure ducked down, then bounded away into the bush   |
| in two great strides. The entity had no arms and on either side of    |
| its head it had two white patches where the eyes might have been. It  |
| did not have a neck and was estimated to have been 3 ½ meters tall,   |
| or almost nine feet. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, 1992 Humanoid       |
