|                                                                       |
| 1953 - On this evening in 1953, at 6:10 p.m., 5 silent orbs flew over        |
| Corona, California in a V Formation. Flying at an estimated 2,000     |
| feet altitude, they changed into a row formation, then back again     |
| into a V formation. Speed was estimated at 150 mph. They flew from    |
| the southeast to the northwest. Later that same evening, over the     |
| Naval Air Station at Point Mugu on the California coast, US Marine    |
| Corps jet fighters pursued a red disc-shaped UFO. The UFO out         |
| accelerated the jets and moved away at high speed. Project Blue Book  |
| listed this later case as an official "unknown". (Sources: Loren      |
| Gross, UFOs: A History 1953, p. 067; Project Blue Book files, case    |
| #2361).                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1955 - On this night in 1955, a blue nocturnal light followed a snowplow in  |
| the Blue Mountains in Oregon. It moved away when the snowplow         |
| stopped, but came back when plowing resumed. (Source: APRO Bulletin,  |
| March 1955).                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 1:45 p.m. a group of school boys encountered a "little     |
| blue man" about three feet tall, wearing a helmet, on Studham Common  |
| in England. The humanoid said something unintelligible, and           |
| disappeared and re-appeared four times, leaving behind a cloud of     |
| smoke. (Source: Flying Saucer Review, July 1967, p. 3).               |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - By this date things were more or less back to normal at the    |
| Kushner household in Pittsfield, Pennsylvania following a frightening |
| close encounter experience with a brilliant pink triangular UFO three |
| nights earlier (on January 25th). However, shortly after dinner two   |
| strange men arrived at the door. They identified themselves as        |
| military investigators and flashed what appeared to be USAF           |
| identification. Mrs. Kushner described the ID card as having black    |
| printing on a durable white stock. Both men wore tan trench coats     |
| which they kept buttoned from knee to collar. The taller of the two,  |
| who did all the talking, was described as thin and deeply tanned, and |
| having blond hair and green eyes. The other gentleman was heavy set   |
| with dark hair, piercing blue eyes and was also deeply tanned. The    |
| men were polite but very insistent about one thing: they wanted every |
| shred of information about the girl's experience. Neither parent      |
| could explain why they allowed their children to be so intensely      |
| grilled by these "government agents." The men moved about the house   |
| with apparently total knowledge of the contents of the rooms, the     |
| placement of furniture and other objects. Their clothing looked as if |
| it had been newly purchased and the bottoms of their shoes were       |
| unscuffed. When the mystery men left they backed their vehicle out    |
| onto the roadway, turned off their headlights, and powered away down  |
| the road. At one point one man was seen writing strange symbols in    |
| vertical columns, starting from the left, going down one column, up   |
| the next, and down the third. This was in a small booklet. (Source:   |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1967, citing Robert A.   |
| Goerman).                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| 1968 - On this evening over Keats Island, British Columbia in 1968, a dark   |
| UFO with red and yellow lights at both ends was seen weaving from     |
| side to side. It stopped in place two or three times, and when it did |
| the lights dimmed. (Source: John Magor, Our UFO Visitors, p. 44).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1969 - In 1969 at 10 p.m., a guard in San Lucar de Barrame, Spain watched a  |
| "pot" fly silently over trees at a low altitude, from north to south. |
| The UFO illuminated the area like daytime. (Source: Jacques Vallee,   |
| Computerized Catalogue; Larry Hatch "U" database).                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - In 1973 a domed, semi-circular object hovered over a pond in          |
| Winsford, England at 6:35 p.m. (Source: Newspaper clipping dated      |
| February 8, 1973).                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1975 - In 1975 an ovoid-shaped UFO hovered over a football field in          |
| Dolianova, Italy. Only 10 meters above the ground, the object rose    |
| slowly into the sky at an angle when a car approached. (Source:       |
| ITACAT computer catalogue).                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1976 - In 1976 two physiological effects cases occurred on the same night,   |
| the first in Benacazon, Spain and the second in Dargo, Victoria,      |
| Australia. The first occurred at 12:30 a.m. in the European time      |
| zone, while the second occurred several hours later at 11:30 p.m.     |
| local time. (Sources: FSR, May 1976, p. 21; FSR, October 1976, p.     |
| 30).                                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1979 - On this evening in 1979 a 1.5-meter long ovoid hovered over a house   |
| in Vannes, France. The UFO zipped over above an empty lot. It beamed  |
| white beams of light down onto the ground and up into the clouds, at  |
| around 5:15 p.m. A UFO witness to repeated UFO encounters experienced |
| lasting physiological effects due to the close approach of 2          |
| disc-shaped UFOs. The observer also heard a mechanical voice in his   |
| head that said, "We mean you no harm." Also on this day, a            |
| disc-shaped UFO shot dazzling beams of light onto a road in Taining   |
| County, China. (Sources: MUFON UFO Journal, September 1979, p. 3;     |
| Paul Dong, UFO over modern China, p. 126).                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1980 - Three UFO encounters were reported in France on this day in 1980. The |
| first occurred in La Racine at 4:20 a.m. An orange, glowing, lima     |
| bean shaped UFO flew up highway D34 for several kilometers in a       |
| northwesterly direction, closely following the terrain. At 7:10 p.m.  |
| near Grandrieux, a four-meter diameter cylinder-shaped disc followed  |
| a car up and down route N377. Several square windows ringed the UFO.  |
| Later, at Aurillac around 9:10 p.m. a luminous orange sphere flew by  |
| closely while shining down a beam of light. Meanwhile, several        |
| nocturnal lights hovered high overhead. (Source: Lumieres dans la     |
| Nuit, April 1981, July 1981, and issue #214.)                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1981 - In 1981 at 5:30 in the morning, a disc was sighted maneuvering over   |
| some woods and landing behind some trees in Colle Maddalena, Italy. A |
| burnt circle of grass and some charred tree branches were found at    |
| the landing site. (Source: ITACAT Italian UFO Catalogue).             |
|                                                                       |
| 1984 - In 1984, an orange sphere was seen to land on a ridge in Flemington,  |
| New Jersey. Two witnesses saw the UFO descend and land at 6:30 p.m.,  |
| while many others saw a bigger object rise from the same spot 20      |
| minutes later. (Source: International UFO Reporter, March 1984, p.    |
| 7).                                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1990 - In 1990 a super large craft with bright blue lights around its        |
| perimeter was reported in Stockbridge, Michigan. In Gulf Breeze,      |
| Florida that afternoon, a MUFON UFO investigator and three others     |
| videotaped a round orange UFO that emitted white flashes of light     |
| from the top and bottom of the object. (Sources: Paul Ferrughelli,    |
| Computer Catalogue of UFO Reports, 1988-1994; MUFON UFO Journal, May  |
| 1990).                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1993 - In 1993 several UFO reports occurred over Alabama and Pennsylvania.   |
| At 5 a.m. noise attracted a witness to the window of her home in Dog  |
| Town, Alabama where she saw a UFO with several lights. In Adamsburg,  |
| Alabama at UFO was sighted at 6:30 p.m. that was described as fat in  |
| the middle, and tapered at the ends. A photo was taken of a           |
| stealth-aircraft like UFO in Gadsden, Alabama. The US Air Force       |
| denied that it was one of their aircraft. At 10:15 p.m. a yellow ball |
| of light with a green flashing light was seen in Uniontown,           |
| Pennsylvania. (Source: Paul Ferrughelli, Computer Catalogue of UFO    |
| Reports, 1988-1994).                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1994 - On this day in 1994 a huge, dark, disc-shaped object, reddish-brown   |
| in color, vanished suddenly in the skies over Coulommiers, France at  |
| 1:14 p.m. European time. The UFO was sighted by the crew of an Air    |
| France A320 airliner, and reported to air traffic control. Ground     |
| military radar tracked the UFO for 50 seconds at a speed of 100       |
| knots. About one hour later, at 8:20 a.m. local time in Lancaster,    |
| New Hampshire a diamond-shaped UFO with blunt points paused in the    |
| sky, then vanished. (Source: Paul Ferrughelli, Computer Catalogue of  |
| UFO Reports, 1988-1994).                                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1996 - In 1996 at 11 p.m. in Bridgeton, Missouri three nocturnal lights were |
| seen maneuvering in the sky. The objects were seen to join together   |
| and separate repeatedly. They flew in a general southwest direction.  |
| About a half-hour later in Union, Missouri five nocturnal lights were |
| videotaped flying slowly toward the southwest. They made a faint      |
| humming sound. (Source: Larry Hatch, "U" computer database).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1996 - A woman in Chandler, Arizona reported a visitation by "aliens" |
| in her bedroom late at night. They reportedly gave her a medical      |
| examination. The next morning she awoke with some scars and other     |
| anomalies on her body. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact   |
| Database, case #2342, citing Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting  |
| Center, Seattle).                                                     |

| 1997 - In 1997 a witness going to bed at 10:30 p.m. in Colebrook, New        |
| Hampshire shut off the bedroom light and then saw a large object,     |
| like sunlight reflecting off metal, rise up to clear a ridgeline. The |
| light then went out, but the witness could still perceive that the    |
| silhouette of the UFO was still visible in the sky. It flew over the  |
| ridge and was gone. (Source: MUFON investigation files, case          |
| 970128E)                                                             |

| 2000 - At 5:30 p.m. on this date in 2000 a driver and passenger were driving |
| westbound on the New Jersey Turnpike between East Rutherford and      |
| Secaucus, New Jersey when they spotted a triangle-shaped object       |
| flying in the northern sky. Two large, bright cylindrical UFOs were   |
| sighted in the southwestern morning sky in Beaverton, Oregon at 7:30  |
| a.m. The UFOs were the apparent size of a lentil held at arm's        |
| length. Four other reports occurred that evening in British Columbia, |
| Oregon, California, and Arizona. (Sources: Peter Davenport, National  |
| UFO Reporting Center; UFO Research Manitoba, 2000 Canadian UFO        |
