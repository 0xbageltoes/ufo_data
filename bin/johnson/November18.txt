| 1951 - near Washington, D.C. The crew of a Capital Airlines DC-4,     |
| Flight 610, and Andrews AFB Senior air traffic controller Tom Selby   |
| witnessed an unidentified object with several lights at 3:20 a.m. It  |
| followed the DC-4 for about 20 minutes and then turned back. (Source: |

| 1952 - Nello Ferrari, 41, a farmer from Castelfranco, Italy found     |
| himself flooded with a reddish light on this morning when a large     |
| plate-shaped object flew ten meters above him. The 20-meter diameter  |
| disc was golden to copper in color. At the center of the bottom       |
| surface was a cylindrical section, about five meters wide, made up of |
| a rapidly rotating part that produced a noise similar to an electric  |
| motor. On the upper surface was a transparent turret inside which     |
| three occupants were visible. The beings looked directly at him. They |
| looked to be normal humans in appearance, and wore rubber coveralls   |
| and transparent facemasks. They spoke a few words, which were not     |
| understood. A loud metallic noise was heard; and the top part of the  |
| object lowered itself toward the lower plate. The sound gained        |
| intensity, and the craft flew up vertically at very high speed.       |

| 1954 - At six o'clock in the morning a 12-year old girl in St.        |
| Maudan, Cotes-Nord, France saw a UFO looking like "a glowing boat"    |
| land in a nearby field. Three hairy dwarf humanoids emerged from the  |
| object and began to gather apples from the nearby orchard. (Sources:  |

| 1957 - In Maracaja, Brazil Farmers Joao Ernani and Pedro Zilli heard  |
| a strange humming sound at 10:30 a.m., then saw two aluminum-colored  |
| discs 200 meters away. Near them were six men of average height and   |
| slim build, dressed in "dark gray suits glued to their bodies." The   |
| discs were only about 3.5 meters wide, and hovered one meter above    |
| the ground. They rose with a sharp whistling sound, while coconut     |
| trees below them bent over double. Three more discs rose from behind  |
| the trees, and then all five flew away toward the Atlantic Ocean.     |

| 1957 - An hour and a half later Mrs. Cynthia Appleton, age 27 and     |
| mother of two, saw the figure of a man appear near her fireplace in   |
| Aston, England at three o'clock in the afternoon at the same time     |
| that a whistling sound became audible. He was tall and fair, wore a   |
| tight-fitting plastic garment, and seemed to communicate with her     |
| through telepathy, indicating he was looking for titanium and was     |
| coming from a world of peace and harmony. He suddenly disappeared.    |
| Mrs. Appleton had subsequent contacts with similar entities. (Source: |

| 1959 - At 6:25 a.m. in Crystal Springs, Mississippi Mr. J. M. Porter  |
| witnessed a row of red lights that flew slowly through the sky, and   |
| then sped up incredibly fast. His sighting lasted from 5-6 minutes.   |

| 1961 - A strange flying object streaked across the skies above the    |
| Theodore Goff farm on the afternoon of the 18th and left behind it a  |
| mysterious substance that defied explanation. The strange, seemingly  |
| metallic substance, came off the UFO in thin fibers and settled to    |
| earth, draping itself like a finely-knit shroud over Goff's fields,   |
| trees, machinery, and power lines. The farm is located near Chadron,  |
| Nebraska.                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| "It was about three o'clock," Goff related, "and I had been working   |
| in my shed. I came outside and happened to look up and see this       |
| strange ball flying through the air. It was kind of rough and seemed  |
| to be rolling as it sped through the air. It was going faster than    |
| any airplane I ever saw and it just disappeared from sight when it    |
| got out of the sunlight. It made absolutely no noise."                |
|                                                                       |
| "Big chunks of it broke off and these fibers began settling down on   |
| everything. The ball was about as big around as a tractor tire, four  |
| feet in diameter or so and it came out of the southwest going         |
| northeast. At first I thought it was an airplane but when I really    |
| looked, I just didn't know what to think. It's hard to say how high   |
| up it was, maybe a thousand feet or more. The fibers cannot be seen   |
| with the naked eye except when they are in direct sunlight. Then, and |
| only then, can you see them glistening ghostlike in the sun. They can |
| be felt on the skin like spider webs, but they are much smaller in    |
| diameter than a spider web. A human hair seems like a rope compared   |
| to the fibers."                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| "I didn't really notice the fibers much that day, but the next        |
| morning my fields and trees just glowed with the stuff when the sun   |
| hit them. You can pick one up, but you can't really tell if you have  |
| one unless the sun hits it just right. It's the strangest stuff I     |
| ever saw."                                                            |
| Attempts to break the weird strings were to no avail. They seemingly  |
| could not be broken apart, but, when a hot cigarette was applied to   |
| one of the strings, it did break. The string did not, however, burst  |
| into flame or seem to burn. "They're so fine you just can't tell when |
| you've got one," Goff said. "You can feel it, but you can't see it."  |

| 1966 - On this night in Point Pleasant, West Virginia police captain  |
| Paul Yoder and B. Enochs saw a huge bird-like creature, with big red  |
| eyes, in the "TNT" dump area. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,  |

| 1973 - On the previous evening Enrique Castillo of Fulanos de Tal,    |
| Colombia was again summoned telepathically to go to an isolated area  |
| for possible contact with "extraterrestrials." Hours went by, when at |
| around three o'clock in the morning numerous illuminated objects      |
| appeared, one of which detached itself from the rest and slowly       |
| approached him in a zigzag fashion. It performed an astonishing       |
| series of maneuvers before landing on three supports about 60 meters  |
| away. The other lights disappeared. This craft was quite different    |
| from the one he had previous encountered, of a rather peculiar shape. |
| A metallic ladder emerged, leaving a narrow, illuminated opening from |
| which a human shaped silhouette could be seen. Castillo started to    |
| approach the craft but a deep voice ordered him to stop, and then     |
| beckoned him to approach slowly. Soon a human looking alien named     |
| Cyril, whom he had met on a previous occasion, met him at the         |
| doorway. He invited Castillo to walk up the six steps of the ladder.  |
| When Castillo extended his hand to greet him, he stepped back and     |
| motioned him to stop between the last step and the door. A very       |
| bright blue flash of light shone briefly, bathing Castillo's body. He |
| understood that the blue light was part of a sterilization system.    |
|                                                                       |
| On board were two other very different beings with "avocado-shaped    |
| heads", dressed in one-piece, ample overalls. They smiled constantly. |
| He went to greet them, but they just bowed without extending their    |
| hands. The little men were bald, with pale skin, seemingly completed  |
| coated with a film of oil. They were about 1.5 meters (4 feet) tall,  |
| well proportioned, with large normal eyes and normal ears, a large    |
| "Greek" nose, and prominent jaws. Cyril declared that these creatures |
| came from Mercury. Castillo was incredulous because he knew there     |
| were immense temperatures contrasts on that planet. But he was told,  |
| "you would be astonished by the civilizations that have flourished    |
| there." Via a spiral stairway Castillo was taken to the second level, |
| which he found rather cramped. Cyril announced that the craft was on  |
| its way to the "mother ship." One of the other beings took Castillo   |
| to a closet on the first floor and gestured to him to put on a        |
| uniform, which stretched to fit him perfectly.                        |
|                                                                       |
| A gigantic craft came into view. A hatch opened, from which came an   |
| intense light. Inside the mother ship Castillo was led through        |
| several passageways and in one area he noticed an emblem, in high     |
| relief, of a winged serpent holding what looked like an egg. Inside   |
| this object Castillo also encountered toilet facilities. In the hall  |
| Castillo claims to have encountered yet another thoroughly            |
| unbelievable being, a giant man no less than three meters tall. His   |
| features were remarkably similar to those of a common terrestrial.    |
| His skin was grayish, his hands hairy with normal fingers, shaped at  |
| the tips like spatulas. He was dressed in a dull gray uniform. At one |
| point Castillo boarded a smaller craft accompanied by Cyril and the   |
| two smaller humanoids. It took them on a ride to different places     |
| apparently on earth. Later back aboard the mother ship Castillo       |
| claims to have seen a robot, with some human features, and for the    |
| first time, women who wore tight-fitting suits and had decidedly      |
| feminine features. "Their golden hair framed the most beautiful faces |
| I had ever seen," Castillo enthused. They were as tall as the men,    |
| perhaps 1.75 meters. Eventually Castillo was returned to an area not  |
| farm from Bogota, Columbia. He had been away for about 26 hours.      |

| 1973 - On this evening four girls between the ages of 14 and 24 years |
| old were accompanied as they drove from Tracy, Quebec toward Montreal |
| by a luminous white flying ball of light. It was perhaps the size of  |
| a watermelon. It sometimes flew ahead of them and sometimes behind    |
| them, at a considerable distance. They passed through a cloud of red  |
| dust that obscured their vision, and shortly after emerging from the  |
| cloud they had to swerve to avoid a little man wearing dark clothing  |
| and a lappet helmet, who was standing on the white line in the middle |
| of the road. He appeared to be sweeping with push-broom. He was short |
| in stature and they could not see his face. After passing the         |
| "sweeper" they saw a car and three dark clad people beside the road.  |
| There were several other UFO sightings in this part of Quebec the     |
| same evening. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:        |

| 1982 - Late at night Andreas Schneider sighted a maneuvering          |
| disc-shaped object over Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary Islands. |
| He lost consciousness and had an out-of-body experience, feeling that |
| his "astral" body was taken into the object. Inside he encountered    |
| several short beings with wrinkly rough gray skin and huge heads. The |
| beings communicated by using telepathy and told Schneider they were   |
| from the planet "Humo." (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact  |

| 1993 - At 1:00 a.m. Ms. Kimmy Martin awoke with a start in Baca       |
| Chalets in the San Luis Valley of Colorado. She looked out into the   |
| gloomy night and felt somebody was watching her. Then something moved |
| on her porch outside, and a group of Grey alien looking creatures     |
| peered in the window at her. She was not sure if they were really     |
| physically there or some form of apparition. Not frightened by their  |
| presence, she watched them for almost an hour, while they watched     |
| her. Finally she told the beings to go away and let her sleep, and    |
| the 20 or so visitors then trooped away obediently. (Source: Albert   |
