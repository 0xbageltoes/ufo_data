| 1947 - On this morning a prospector named Johnson in the Hood River   |
| region of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon sighted five or six discs   |
| flying silently overhead, heading toward the southeast. He noticed    |
| that his compass began spinning when the discs passed over. His watch |
| also stopped running. (Sources: Phoenix Arizona Republic, June 26,    |

| 1947 - At 2:58 p.m. Kenneth Arnold, flying his private plane near     |
| Mount Rainier, Washington was attracted by reflected sunlight from    |
| nine distant metallic flying objects. He watched as they flashed      |
| across the sky, one behind the other, "skipping as saucers upon       |
| water." They tilted back and forth as they flew. One object was       |
| definitely crescent shaped, the others may have been disc shaped or   |
| crescent shaped with a 10 to 1 width to thickness ratio. He clocked   |
| them as they flew past Mount Adams, and calculated that they were     |
| flying at a speed of 1,500 miles per hour and at an altitude of 9,500 |
| feet. When he landed in Pendleton, Oregon he was interviewed at the   |
| local radio station where the term "flying saucer" was first coined,  |
| despite the fact that the objects he sighted may not have been discs. |

| 1953 - A woman in Hampton Bay, New York saw something like "a large   |
| aircraft" about 30 meters wide flying very slowly and low at 6:30     |
| p.m. It had a lighted red band around the middle and was coming       |
| straight toward her house with an oscillating motion. She still       |
| thought it was an aircraft of some new design when it stopped near    |
| her, only 25 meters above the ground. Then it flew backward over the  |
| water and hovered, making the same noise as a swarm of bees. The top  |
| section supported a series of red lights and a cabin with four        |
| portholes through which a control panel was visible. No occupants     |
| were seen. The cabin section rose above the object, rotated, then     |
| glided back. The object tilted toward the west and rose toward the    |
| southeast, disappearing within three seconds at an 80-degree angle of |
| climb after the three minute long sighting. Two days later a          |
| yellowish moss was observed at the site. (Sources: Project Blue Book  |

| 1964 - Fifteen or more disc-shaped objects paced a truck driver and   |
| his wife in Vero Beach, Florida in the predawn hours. The discs flew  |
| along, tipping back and forth. They formed a V formation, then a      |
| circular formation; finally the objects split the formation and       |
| passed on either side of a group of trees. (Source: NICAP UFO         |

| 1965 - A saucer-shaped object with a conical top, and rows of lights  |
| across the front and along the side flew over Nebo, Queensland,       |
| Australia. It glowed bluish-white and had a red tail. At 10:00 p.m.   |
| in Mundilla, South Australia a round object with red, green, and      |
| white lights flew away over the horizon. (Sources: (1) Michael        |

| 1966 - Police officer William L. Stevens had a close encounter with a |
| dirigible-shaped object 100 feet long and 30 feet thick at 3:30 a.m.  |
| He was driving on the Henrico Turnpike in Richmond, Virginia when the |
| UFO approached. It had alternating white and greenish-yellow lights   |
| around its perimeter, and it was surrounded by a mist. It began to    |
| play a game of cat and mouse with his police cruiser. "It seemed to   |
| be playing with me," he said. It moved away when the officer turned   |
| on its flashing lights, maintaining a distance of a few hundred feet. |
| After several minutes it departed, accelerating suddenly and making a |
| high speed vertical climb. (Sources: Richard Hall, Uninvited Guests,  |

| 1967, Trenton, Maine - Two people sighted a silver-gray, hat-shaped   |
| object hovering about 500 feet from the shoreline in Trenton, Maine   |
| at around 10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. It emitted a vapor at its    |
| base. The object ascended into a fog bank and descended again at a    |
| greater distance before moving away. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs |

| 1967 - A man walking alone at night along a bridal path in Bovington, |
| England came upon a strange figure bent down by the side of the path. |
| The figure was short and was wearing what looked like a black,        |
| one-piece leather suit. He had a trowel in his hand and appeared to   |
| be digging in the earth. When he noticed the witness approaching the  |
| figure made a strange, high-pitched sound and was lost from sight.    |

| 1968 - A young woman named Torres was awakened at 1:10 a.m. in Laguna |
| Raiva, Santa Fe, Argentina by an intense humming sound. She then      |
| noticed an oval-shaped light in the corner of her bedroom and inside  |
| the light stood two strangely dressed beings. They both wore metallic |
| diving suits and helmets with visors. One was taller than the other   |
| and luminous white beams of light emanated from the tips of the       |
| fingers of both entities and from their visors and lower abdomens.    |
| Both beings vanished suddenly. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid   |

| 1971 - At 11:00 p.m. in Mulhouse, Haut-Rhine, France a disc-shaped    |
| object was seen tilting in the sky at 15 meters altitude above a      |
| residential neighborhood. It leveled off, then lights were seen upon  |
| the ground. At the site a depressed circle and ground marks were      |
| found. (Source: Ted R. Phillips, Physical Traces Associated with UFO  |

| 1977 - At one o'clock in the morning a UFO was sighted hovering over  |
| the sea from the coastal town of La Caleta, in the Dominican          |
| Republic. Sr. Cruz watched as the object extended a tube from its     |
| bottom, and then sucked up water. Two occupants could be seen inside  |
| the object, viewed through windows in the craft. Sr. Cruz's car       |
| engine failed, and he felt a numbing sensation in his arms and legs.  |

| 1995 - A small disc-shaped object hovered over a truck in             |
| Farmingdale, New York at 11:30 p.m. at night. The driver could tell   |
| the UFO was close because it hovered below the low, overcast sky, so  |
| he got out of his vehicle and attempted to chase the UFO on foot, to  |
| no avail. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,    |
