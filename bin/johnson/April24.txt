| 1897 - A man in Louisville, Kentucky heard a buzzing noise, looked    |
| up, and saw a cigar-shaped craft 200 feet up. He could see the form   |
| of a man standing at the stern. "He looked at me, and I waved my hat. |
| Two other men were sitting in the helm." (Source: Louisville Courier  |
| Journal, April 25, 1897).                                             |

| 1909 - At 9:20 in the morning a white ovoid shaped flying object was  |
| seen in the skies over Florence, Italy. Two men dressed in white      |
| suits were seen inside. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database,    |

| 1949 - A high speed, maneuvering object was tracked with a theodolite |
| by five government contractors from General Mills as it sped through  |
| the sky. They were at a missile range near Arrey, New Mexico at 10:20 |
| a.m. It looked like a featureless, whitish featureless ellipse, and   |
| its length was 2.5 times its width. After 60 seconds it disappeared   |
| in a sharp vertical climb. (Source: Richard Hall, Uninvited Guests,   |
| p. 238).                                                              |

| 1950 - At 12:30 a.m. three men watched a crescent-shaped object       |
| maneuver through the sky over Ansonia, Connecticut. The object looked |
| like a half-moon with a squared off end, and was sighted by two       |
| policemen and a restaurant proprietor. It moved unevenly thru the     |
| sky. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. 1950: April-July, p.   |

| 1950 - Later, at 10 p.m. in Abbiate Guazzone, Italy, Sr. Bruno        |
| Facchini heard and saw sparks coming from a dark, hovering object.    |
| Nearby stood a man dressed in tight fitting clothes and wearing a     |
| helmet who seemed to be making repairs. Three other men were seen     |
| near the craft. When the work was finished, a trapdoor through which  |
| light had been shining was closed and the thing took off. The witness |
| time to note many details about the craft and its occupants.          |

| 1964 - Dairy farmer Gary T. Wilcox saw a shiny, egg-shaped object,    |
| about eight meters long and six meters wide, in his pasture in Tioga  |
| City, New York at around ten o'clock in the morning. He spoke in      |
| English to two short male occupants, 1.2 meters tall, wearing         |
| seamless clothing and hoods, and carrying trays. (Source: Jacques     |

| 1964 - Police officer Lonnie Zamora was parked watching for speeders  |
| on the main highway south of Socorro, New Mexico at 5:45 in the       |
| afternoon when he saw an whitish metallic ovoid object land in the    |
| desert behind a rise. He drove his police cruiser over the rise and   |
| saw an ovoid object with four legs resting in a gully. Two four-foot  |
| tall beings in white spacesuits stood next to the landed UFO. They    |
| turned in his direction and then went inside the UFO. A loud roar was |
| heard during a vertical takeoff as the object emitted a flame from    |
| the bottom. The foliage in the area was scorched black, and there     |
| were four holes in the ground surrounding the burned area. The case   |
| was personally investigated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek for Project Blue    |
| Book. Everyone, except UFO debunker Phillip Klass who visited Socorro |
| four years later, regards the testimony of Mr. Zamora as highly       |
| credible. A married couple saw the object north of the city at 5:30   |
| p.m. before it landed, and seven other witnesses saw it flying south  |
| of Socorro shortly before 6:00 p.m. (Sources: Project Blue Book, case |

| 1966 - At 3:30 a.m. Mr. Tom M. Lasseter, an architect, was camping    |
| near the Pedernales River in Texas when he was awakened by a          |
| fluttering sound and observed a glowing white disc that was at        |
| treetop level 60 meters away. It was seven meters in diameter and had |
| a row of lights. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A      |

| 1966 - Thirty minutes later, at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time, Mrs. Kalnicki |
| saw a multicolored domed disc with blinking red lights on its rim     |
| move between two apartment buildings in Dorchester, Massachusetts. It |
| had a yellow light on top, and emitted a humming noise.There were a   |
| total of five witnesses, and the sighting lasted 12 minutes. (Source: |

| 1966 - At 6:10 p.m. two men in Ashby, Massachusetts saw an object     |
| dive within 30 meters of their car. It was silent, had a bright blue  |
| light on top, suddenly accelerated, and was lost to sight toward Mt.  |
| Watatic. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of   |

| 1969 - On this night there were several reports of an 18-foot-tall    |
| phantom either walking or floating along at 20 mph in Nova Scotia.    |
| The tall shadowy figure consisted of a very dark humanoid form. A     |
| large numbers of cars had assembled at Berwick, Nova Scotia to        |
| observe the monster. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: |

| 1970 - A Soviet supersonic bomber allegedly disappeared without a     |
| trace in the area of Olekminsk, Russia on April 24, provoking a       |
| widescale search involving 150 aircraft. Many of the pilots reported  |
| seeing large unidentified craft hanging high in the sky, far out of   |
| missile range. Soviet reconnaissance planes were sent up, scouring    |
| and photographing every square kilometer of the terrain in a          |
| fruitless search for the bomber's wreckage. (Source: Albert S.        |

| 1971 - Mrs. F, a woman from Greenacre, New South Wales, Australia and |
| her 13-year-old daughter were going home by taxi at 7:30 p.m. On      |
| passing Roberts Park they saw an object hovering over the lighted     |
| field where youths were playing football. The field lights formed a   |
| king of "ceiling" over the field and is unlikely that had they looked |
| up, the players could have seen anything. The object was "football    |
| shaped," the interior light being "the brightest blue imaginable."    |
| The top portion of the UFO was transparent and the bottom was a       |
| greenish metallic "like gun metal" color with three large transparent |
| portholes. The object was tilted downward at an angle revealing three |
| tall humanoid figures, over six feet tall, in the transparent upper   |
| half of the UFO. One of the occupants pointed down at the witness and |
| then turned toward a rectangular, lighted area. Mrs F. asked the      |
| cabbie, a Greek immigrant, to stop the taxi, but he accelerated away  |
| and drove them straight to her home without stopping. He left in a    |
| frightened state without collecting his fare. (Source: David F. Webb  |

| 1972 - At two o'clock in the morning Mrs. Taylor, an elderly woman    |
| suffering from insomnia, was up late in her apartment in Manchester,  |
| England when she saw out her window, above a tall factory chimney, a  |
| glowing yellowish white ball-shaped UFO. A figure wearing boots       |
| emerged from the sphere. The object eventually seemed to dissolve     |
| "within itself." She watched the humanoid for a period of two hours,  |
| and it gave her the impression of an "astronaut landing on the moon." |

| 1977 - At around one o'clock in the morning Mrs. Pauline Coombs, age  |
| 31, and her husband Billy, age 36, were watching television at their  |
| Ripperston farm near Dale, Pembrokeshire, Wales when they saw a       |
| silver suited figure at their window. Pauline saw it first, but said  |
| nothing to her husband until he saw it himself. "It must have been    |
| over seven feet tall," because it was too tall to see its face." It   |
| was quite wide--about three feet--and surrounded by a luminous glow.  |
| It was wearing a box-shaped helmet that framed a dark squarish area   |
| in which no face was visible. They called Randall Jones Pugh, the     |
| BUFORA investigator, and the police immediately, but the figure had   |
| gone before either arrived. Mrs. Coombs and her family had been       |
| involved in several other close encounter incidents prior and after   |
| this encounter. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:        |

| 1980 - Two roofers working in the late evening at 9:00 p.m. sighted a |
| bright yellow disc-shaped UFO rise vertically from Lake Norman        |
| Reservoir, not far from a nuclear power plant in Rutherford County,   |
| North Carolina. It made a loop in the sky and flew away. (Sources:    |

| 1984 - Radar visual confirmation. At 7:10 p.m. a 1000 foot long       |
| cigar-shaped object followed a KC-135 USAF tanker aircraft through a  |
| U-turn over the mountains of Chimayo, New Mexico while separate       |
| nocturnal lights cavorted about in the sky. Radar blips were tracked  |
| at the time. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, November 1984).              |

| 1989 - At 10:45 p.m. several witnesses, including 53-year-old A. D.   |
| Golovatskaya, watched a fiery green elongated craft fly low over the  |
| rooftops of Kharovsk, Russia. It had a blunt nose and a fish-shaped   |
| tail. The craft was silent and appeared to be made of crystal. Four   |
| figures wearing silvery, tight-fitting uniforms were seen inside the  |
| object, two in the rear and two at the front apparently operating     |
| some controls. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database  |
