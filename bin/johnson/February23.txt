| 1952 - Over North Korea. At 11:15 p.m. the navigator of a USAF B-29   |
| sighted a bluish cylindrical UFO, three times longer than it was      |
| wide, with a tail. It flew with rapid pulsations, came in high and    |
| fast, and made several turns before leveling out under the B-29. The  |
| bomber was evading mild anti-aircraft fire at the time, and the UFO   |
| seemed to be maneuvering to avoid the flack as well. The sighting     |
| lasted an estimated 45 seconds. (Sources: Project Blue Book files     |

| 1955 - A 30-foot diameter top-shaped object with portholes was seen   |
| hovering over a field on the Lord Montbatten estate in Broadlands,    |
| near Romsey, Hampshire, England by a cyclist at 8:30 in the morning.  |
| A shaft of light came from the center of the silver top. There was a  |
| man on a platform on the object, who wore dark colored overalls and a |
| helmet. When a blue flash shot from one of the portholes the witness  |
| fell to the ground, paralyzed. The shaft of energy was then           |
| retracted, and the UFO rose silently away. When it was gone the       |
| witness could move again, but was still dizzy. (Sources: Albert S.    |

| 1956 - In the middle of the afternoon, a blue luminous disc-shaped    |
| object was watched by an Army Sergeant for 15 minutes in the Bushwick |
| neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. It made a loud rumbling noise,    |
| and left behind a white trail of smoke. That evening several French   |
| soldiers near Lamoriciere, Algeria watched a huge UFO hover and flash |
| for three hours. It had a ring of portholes. (Sources: (1) Loren E.   |

| 1967 - At 10:30 a.m. Mrs. Rice and Mrs. Weston were talking on the    |
| phone in Linstead, Maryland when they were surprised to hear a very   |
| loud noise and saw a low flying object pass over their area. A third  |
| person also saw the object and many others heard it. The falling snow |
| was swirling underneath it. The object was mushroom-shaped and it     |
| supported a dome on top and also a fin. It was green in color, and    |
| left in the direction of the Severn River. (Source: Jacques Vallee,   |

| 1967 - At 8:00 p.m. MST a luminous orange object paced a car in       |
| Boneta, Utah for ten minutes, and then shot straight up on departure. |

| 1967 - At 9:30 p.m. CST a red oval object hovered first over a truck, |
| then over the witness's car in Marion, Illinois. A glowing halo       |
| surrounded the object. It sped away after a few minutes. The city has |
| industries that manufacture explosives and batteries, and has several |
| coal mines. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A |

| 1968 - Several independent witnesses, including two named Hendrickson |
| and Sinclair, watched a nocturnal UFO engage in zigzag maneuvers over |
| the suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia at 8:30 p.m. There was also  |
| a high pitched sound associated with the object. (Source: Michael     |

| 1969 - On this day two boys claimed they saw an emormous flying       |
| object while bathing in a waterfall in the mountains near Edmundo     |
| Soares in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. From a vertical door two      |
| small men emerged. They had human features and their faces had a      |
| greenish tint. Their chests were luminous, and from the waists down   |
| they wore ashen-gray trousers. The boys fled down the mountain. They  |
| returned later that day with two guards, but there was no longer      |
| anything to be found at the site. (Sources: Walter Buhler, FSR Case   |

| 1975 - At sometime between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. two seven-year-old boys  |
| named Kono and Yamahata watched a luminous orange UFO approach Kofu,  |
| Japan while making a "ticking" sound. It landed on three ball-shaped  |
| legs in a nearby vineyard. The object was a domed disc, five meters   |
| in diameter and six feet high. The boys got very close to it, and     |
| discovered the surface of the object was silver colored and had       |
| strange words embossed on its surface. A ladder extended out of the   |
| craft down to the ground, and a humanoid creature slightly over four  |
| feet tall disembarked. He wore a silver uniform and carried something |
| that looked like a gun. His skin was dark brown and he had large      |
| pointed ears, but his large head had no facial features: no eyes,     |
| nose or mouth. It merely had wrinkles on the "face" and three silvery |
| two-inch long "fangs" where the mouth should be. Both boys could see  |
| one more smaller humanoid in the cockpit holding a control lever. The |
| being that had emerged reached out and touched one of the boys,       |
| patting him twice on the shoulder and uttering words "like a tape     |
| recorder running backwards." The boy who had been touched sat down,   |
| paralyzed either by the touch or fear, but his companion took him on  |
| his back and carried him from the vineyard. They then ran to one of   |
| the boy's homes and informed their parents, who could at first see    |
| the orange light pulsating in the vineyard. Then it disappeared as    |
| they watched. Two concrete posts were found pushed over at the        |
| landing site. (Sources: CUFOS files, report dated July 14, 1975; APRO |

| 1978 - Mr. & Mrs. Morello were sitting in their car in Sesto          |
| Fiorentino, Toscana, Italy listening to their car's stereo when they  |
| began getting heavy interference on the radio. Mr. Morello got out of |
| the car to investigate and found himself engulfed in a warm, violet   |
| cloud of light. He saw four humanoid "shapes" and other lights around |
| him. He got back into his car where he found his wife crying. They    |
| had a twenty minute lapse of missing time they couldn't account for.  |

| 1995 - In the town of Rivas, near Managua, Nicaragua four boys        |
| including 6-year-old Royllin Reyes Martinez were watching television  |
| around 9:00 p.m. when they heard a noise like an engine and a saw a   |
| strong light coming from outside. They all went outdoors and spotted  |
| what looked like a helicopter land at the nearby "Gaspar Cracia       |
| Laviana Town Sports Center." They all rode their bicycles to the      |
| sports center to better see what was going on. As they got near they  |
| could all see a very bright craft on the ground. Royllin attempted to |
| approach closer but could not due to the intense heat. Three of the   |
| children then briefly saw two short, "robot like creatures" standing  |
| next to the object. The beings were "talking with a sound similar to  |
| insects" and had what appeared to be antennas and were very strange   |
| in appearance. Finally, the craft and beings left, leaving the young  |
| witnesses in a state of near shock. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,       |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1995, case # 2134, citing Aubrey Lewallen,  |
| National UFO News, May-June 1995).                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1996 - At ten o'clock in the evening Irasema Margarita Cuevas and     |
| others in her household in Nuevo Centro, Abasolo, Tamaulipas, Mexico  |
| heard their dogs barking outside and went to investigate. Outside     |
| they saw a red-orange dome-shaped craft floating a few feet from the  |
| ground, near some nearby trees about 50 meters away. Soon a small     |
| humanoid emerged from the craft, about one meter in height. It began  |
| floating up and down in peculiar movements. From a belt around its    |
| waist a bluish beam of light emerged. The being appeared robotic in   |
| nature, somewhat resembling a "Power Ranger." After a few minutes the |
| being re-entered the object, which rose up to join a similar craft.   |
| They both then flew towards the nearby swamps. Several witnesses then |
| followed the objects and were able to see a brilliant light emerge    |
| from behind some trees and a huge column of gray smoke. Upon seeing   |
| this, the head of the household, Guillermo Serna Marquez, told his    |
| family to return to the house and went into the woods to investigate  |
| alone, on the way there he ran into a farmhand who accompanied him    |
| into the woods. They saw a luminous craft fly over the trees in the   |
| direction of the swamp, then a two meter tall humanoid appeared,      |
| floating above the trees and accompanied by the small robotic entity. |
| They watched the beings float around and then enter the dome shaped   |
| object. After awhile they grew tired of watching and went home. The   |
| next day a large section of the ground was scorched in three enormous |
| circles. Strange purplish-white, foam-like substance was also found   |
| at the site. Numerous other strange incidents were reported in        |
| subsequent days: small flying red spheres, more animal mutilations,   |
| and a large orange sphere that followed some of the UFO field         |
| investigators late one night. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |

| 2000 - Two cylindrical UFOs circled the Agnano housing development in |
| Naples, Italy during the day, then ascended to a high altitude in a   |
| zigzag motion, one faster than the other. (Source: UFO Magazine       |

| 2001 - On this day a metallic disc made numerous zig-zags, wobbles,   |
| and sawtooth maneuvers over a farm in Santena, Piemonte, Italy. It    |
| made no sound as it flew. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database,  |
