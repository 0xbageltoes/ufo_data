| 1672 - A dark "flying ship" hovered in place over the ocean near      |
| Cherbourg, France during a wind. It had no sails, and eventually flew |
| off to the south after 33 minutes. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,    |
| issue # 186).                                                         |

| 1951 - A four engine Super-Constellation R5D Navy transport, flying   |
| at a speed of 200 knots at 10,000 feet between Iceland and            |
| Newfoundland, saw a UFO ascend from the surface of the Atlantic Ocean |
| in the pre-dawn hours. They watched it on the surface for 8-10        |
| minutes while approaching it, and it was so bright that they thought  |
| at first that perhaps the auto-pilot had gone off course and it was   |
| the lights from a city. It moved at 1,500 mph with a white flow       |
| and with a reddish-purple fiery ring around the rim. It shot up and   |
| at the aircraft, and due to the object's high speed, its size and     |
| direction of travel it looked like it would collide. The pilot        |
| quickly disengaged the auto-pilot and stood by to push the nose of    |
| the plane over in hopes that they could pass underneath. Everyone     |
| onboard began ducking, including the relief crew. "It stopped its     |
| movement toward us and began moving along with us about 45 degrees    |
| off the bow to the right, about 100 feet or so below us and about 200 |
| to 300 feet in front of us. It was not in a level position; it was    |
| tilted about 25 degrees. It stayed in this position for a minute or   |
| so. It appeared to be from 200 to 300 feet in diameter, translucent   |
| or metallic, shaped like a saucer." When it moved away it made no     |
| turns, and was out of sight in only a few seconds.Gander radar did    |
| track the object in excess of 1,800 mph. (Sources: NICAP UFO          |

| 1967 - In Newbury, Massachusetts at two o'clock in the afternoon two  |
| silvery cigar shaped objects moved in a straight line, then           |
| separately shot straight up vertically and were gone. (Source: NICAP  |
| investigation files, report dated February 14, 1967).                 |

| 1969 - Waking from sleep at 1:30 a.m. witness Douglas Fay looked out  |
| his window in Glen Rock, New Jersey and saw a bright red, star-like   |
| object flying toward the north in jerky, stop and start movements.    |
| Before it disappeared from view three smaller red dots were released  |
| from the larger object and flew off in various directions. (Source:   |
| NICAP investigation files, report dated February 8, 1969).            |
|                                                                       |
| 1974 - On this evening at Wadi Jawlan in Yemen east of Al-Makalla,    |
| three Arab men saw three large white disc-shaped objects glide toward |
| ground and land in the nearby desert. When on the ground a bright     |
| light and three beams of light were directed upward into the sky. The |
| objects stayed on the ground for several hours. Later at the landing  |
| site investigators found three imprints, each 85 cm wide, arranged in |
| a triangle with sides 5.3 meters in length. The vegetation was also   |
| burnt. On the same evening at 7:30 p.m. a glowing domed disc was      |
| sighted in Douvrin, France just 15 meters above the ground. It        |
| vanished, then reappeared. (Sources: (1) Gordon Creighton, FSR,       |

| 1976 - At 10:30 p.m. a silvery white disc-shaped object flew over     |
| Kissimmee, Florida at less than 300 meters altitude, making a         |
| whistling noise. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, May 1976).          |

| 1979 - At six o'clock in the evening an oval-shaped flying object     |
| approached a car driving between Broad Hinton and Clyffe Pypard in    |
| Wiltshire, England. It came to within 150 to 300 feet at its closest  |
| approach. It had a cluster of very bright strobe-like lights that lit |
| up ground. The UFO made a V-turn, then stopped over a water tower     |
| before departing. It made no noise. (Source: UFO Newsclipping         |

| 1982 - Starting at 3:11 a.m. a large, multicolored flying object      |
| paced a commercial aircraft for 82 minutes. VASP flight #169 was      |
| paced by the UFO from Pernambuco state near Petrolina to Rio de       |
| Janeiro, Brazil. It was disc shaped and had flashing red, blue,       |
| orange, yellow and white lights. The airline crews of two more planes |
| also witnessed the UFO. (Sources: Irene Granchi, International UFO    |

| 1982 - That evening in Bakersfield, Vermont a delta-shaped object     |
| followed a car home, then flew overhead. The witness ran inside his   |
| house to hide. The UFO made no sound. (Source: Larry Hatch, U         |

| 1985 - A 19-year-old man named Thomas was abducted in the early       |
| morning hours in Pwllheli, Wales. He was seized by the arm and        |
| floated into a 25-foot diameter domed, disc-shaped craft by beings    |
| wearing gray uniforms and octagon-shaped helmets. They communicated   |
| with him using telepathy and gave him a physical exam. He was also    |
| taken on an off-world journey. He returned in a state of shock, with  |
| a sunburn on his body. (Source: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence,    |

| 1986 - While driving on State Route 117 in Lima, Ohio at 7:00 p.m. a  |
| young couple spotted a dark triangular UFO with three bright lights,  |
| hovering over some trees near a farm. The object was estimated to be  |

| minutes. (Source: John P. Timmerman, International UFO Reporter,      |

| 1988 - In Gulf Breeze, Florida at around eight o'clock in the         |
| evening, Ed Walters and his wife witnessed a small bright orange ring |
| in the sky. Mr. Walters snapped a Polaroid photograph of it, then     |
| experienced two hours of missing time. He claims he has no memory of  |
| taking the photo. (Source: Edward Walters, UFOs are Real: Here's the  |
| Proof, p. 20).                                                        |

| 1989 - A man in Gulf Breeze, Florida was awakened by his dogs, and    |
| saw a UFO descend making a sizzling sound and land in a vacant lot    |
| only 80 feet away from his house. He awoke his wife and son. They saw |
| three small discs land. When the man shone a flashlight at one of the |
| objects it flashed back and then they all disappeared. (Sources: Ed   |

| 2004 - At 6:25 p.m. EST a silent UFO with one light, no running       |
| lights or tail light, and no vapor trail passed over a home in        |
| Chester County, South Carolina. As it flew over dogs in the           |
| neighborhood were barking loudly. At 5:45 p.m. CST or about 20        |
| minutes later, a small reddish spherical object, that flashed red at  |
| varying intensities and intervals, was sighted over Houston, Texas.   |
| It seemed to wobble laterally as it flew. (Source: Peter Davenport,   |
