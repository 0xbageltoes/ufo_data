| 1953 - On this day in Johannesburg, South Africa a disc-shaped object |
| followed a car on a road into an outlying town. On the same day a     |
| blue disc-shaped object flew over Bentwaters RAF Airbase in Suffolk   |
| County, England. It made crackling sounds, flashed and hissed as it   |
| went over. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, cases # 3236 &  |

| 1954 - A man was walking along a path near a local church in          |
| Sommaprado, Italy at 6:30 a.m. when he heard a sound like a motor. He |
| looked around but did not see anything, but moments later he heard    |
| the noise again. This time he saw a shiny brass colored cigar-shaped  |
| object hovering nearby. It had a "bump"  or dome in the middle and    |
| six rotor blades, three in front and three in the rear. The rear of   |
| the object was transparent and inside he could see two short beings   |
| dressed in black and wearing large helmets. The beings looked human   |
| with olive colored skin and black hair. They looked at the witness    |
| and smiled at him. The frightened witness fell to the ground and      |
| watched as the object departed at high speed. (Sources: Maurizio      |

| 1957 - On this night George Chowanski, an auto mechanic living in     |
| Drakestown, New Jersey was alerted by the barking of his dog and      |
| heard a whirring sound similar to that of an electric shaver. A       |
| lighted object was observed by Mr. Chowanski and his wife as it came  |
| to within 60 cm of the ground. Two figures got out of the bottom of   |
| the object, walked around a clearing, and one of them picked up       |
| something before returning to the craft, which then took off. The     |
| encounter lasted two minutes. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to   |

| 1966 -  At 3:03 a.m. two luminous objects paced a Canadian Pacific    |
| Airlines plane at 35,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean for seven        |
| minutes while flying from Lima, Peru to Mexico City, Mexico. It       |
| emitted light beams up, then down, and then climbed and shot away.    |
| There were five witnesses on board the aircraft. (Sources: Frank      |

| 1966 -  Driving through Emerson, Arkansas on a foggy night, Dr.       |
| Galloway and his wife saw a UFO at 8:15 p.m. ahead of their car and   |
| to the left. It was seen through trees, and was pulsating regularly   |
| from dull red to bright orange every two seconds. It gave off no      |
| flame and made no discernable sound. At a distance of one mile the    |
| UFO brightened to blinding white and woke up their two children.      |

| 1972 - Ventura Maceiras, a 73-year-old gaucho, was sitting near his   |
| shack in Tres Arroyos, Buenos Aires, Argentina with his dog and his   |
| cat when his transistor radio failed. He then heard a loud humming    |
| noise, "like angry bees," and looked up to see an object 70 to 80     |
| feet in diameter hovering overhead. It was some 10-12 meters over a   |
| grove of eucalyptus trees, and it was emitting a powerful light. An   |
| enormous "wheel" was spinning around this object, which at first was  |
| reddish orange in color and then became purple. In its upper portion  |
| he could see a spherical cabin with two windows, and in one window    |
| was visible from the waist upwards a figure wearing dark gray         |
| clothing made of inflated "rolls," joined together, similar to our    |
| astronaut's space suits. On this being's head was a helmet with a     |
| transparent visor and a tube that ran to a box on his back.           |
|                                                                       |
| With a shower of sparks, the UFO tilted toward Sr. Maceiras, and he   |
| could now see a second occupant with identical features and clothing. |
| Their eyes were slanted and their mouths were mere slits, and their   |
| faces were very flat. Behind them he could see a small flag or        |
| insignia showing a crowned seahorse followed by symbols resembling "S |
| C Y" against a blue background. There was also a long instrument      |
| panel bearing "a lot of instruments and clocks."                      |
|                                                                       |
| A powerful flash of light came from the underpart and completely      |
| enveloped the cat while temporarily blinding the witness. The humming |
| grew louder, and the UFO changed color again to a blue-green, then    |
| moved away, sinking to a height of only 12-20 feet above the ground.  |
| It moved off toward the main road, leaving a strong odor like         |
| "sulphur or arnica." Maceiras was not frightened---in fact he called  |
| out to the occupants of the object to come down and share his mate.   |
| After the encounter, his cat disappeared, to return only after 48     |
| hours, her back still showing burn marks. She now shunned the site of |
| her misfortune. The tops of the eucalyptus trees at the site were     |
| scorched. Maceiras himself experienced severe physiological           |
| aftereffects: diarrhea, nausea, hair loss, and severe headaches, all  |
| lasting about two weeks. He also had some trouble speaking, and his   |
| eyes watered for a few days. Six weeks after the event he was feeling |
| better and in fact felt rejuvenated, and he began cutting a new set   |
| of teeth in his upper gums. These effects were to continue. (Sources: |

| 1977 - near Keith, South Australia - A white, oval light about 27 feet |
| in diameter paced a car 30 meters away. The two witnesses, a brother  |
| and sister, reported that as they slowed their car to 8-15 km/h, the  |
| engine began misfiring. They then stopped and the light continued on  |
| its course. After it was gone, the car could be started again and     |
| driven with no difficulties. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports     |

| 1978 - A man was walking through the Plaza Garibaldi in Viareggio,    |
| Italy on this night when suddenly he heard a whistling sound and saw  |
| an object land close by. The craft seemed metallic and was shaped     |
| like a missile. A being described as a metallic robot briefly stepped |
| out, and its body gave off an intense heat. Moments later the         |
| creature re-entered the UFO, which disappeared at high speed towards  |
| the sea. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978,  |

| 1979 - At 1:30 a.m. laborer Sebastiano Pannitteri suddenly woke up in |
| his bedroom in Catania, Sicily, Italy and observed a strange          |
| phenomenon. The electrical power seemed to be out and he heard his    |
| brother-in-law's dog growling outside. Looking out the window, he saw |
| a luminous white mass approaching, and within the light he could see  |
| a human like figure. Stunned, he went to the window and saw the back  |
| of a very tall figure wearing a very tight-fitting luminous white     |
| coverall that accentuated its musculature. The head was round and was |
| either bald or covered with a white helmet. The being's shoulders and |
| chest area appeared wider than normal. He had what looked like        |
| several black dots on his upper back. His arms were at his sides. The |
| figure seemed to move slowly at first, but after five minutes it      |
| appeared to glide quickly, disappearing over a nearby wall. (Source:  |

| CUN).                                                                 |

| 1982 -  A green beam of light shone into a house on this night in     |
| Mirassol, Brazil and a noise was heard coming from the bedroom by the |
| young man who lived there. He next saw three humanoid beings emerge   |
| from the room: two wore white coveralls and helmets, while the third  |
| had no helmet and had red hair and dark skin. They asked him if he    |
| was afraid as they walked by, and he said no. (Source: Albert S.      |

| 1984 -  At about 10:00 p.m. a 30 foot long X-shaped object paced a    |
| car for 20 minutes along a highway in Martinsburg, West Virginia.     |
| There were five lights on the bottom of the craft and it made a       |
| humming noise. (Source: Robert Gribble, National UFO Reporting        |

| 1994 -  A police officer and others sighted a large glowing ovoid     |
| hovering over Buckhannon Mountain in Upshur County, West Virginia at  |
| 9:20 p.m. Small nocturnal lights exited and returned from the object. |

| 1995 -  A huge cigar-shaped object hovered over the ocean off         |
| Gosford, New South Wales, Australia on this night. Beams of light     |
| came down from the object into the water, causing the surface of the  |
| sea to roil. (Source: Bill Chalker, The Oz Files, p. 207).            |

| 2003 -  A hovering object with a circle of lights was seen in a field |
| in Tatum, New Mexico at around 9:30 p.m. It shot straight up and      |
| stopped twice in the sky, then the lights went out and the object     |
| vanished. The sighting lasted 45 seconds. (Source: Peter Davenport,   |
