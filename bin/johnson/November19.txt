| 1954 - P. J. Gunn, an assistant professor of art at Oregon State      |
| University and an ex-U.S. Navy aviation cadet, sighted a bright white |
| light hovering over Corvallis, Oregon at 4:15 p.m. It remained        |
| stationary for 8.5 to nine minutes, then crossed 20 degrees of sky in |
| 3-3.5 minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns). |

| 1964 - Approximately 1,400 miles east of Tokyo, Japan over the        |
| Pacific Ocean (34.92 N, 164.08 E) several military personnel sighted  |
| a bright white, unidentified flashing light. The light traveled from  |
| horizon to horizon in 20 seconds. (Source: Don Berliner, Project      |
| Bluebook UFO Unknowns).                                               |

| 1967 - In 1967, a brightly lit object hovered over a field, and then landed  |
| at Gull Lake, near Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada. A large       |
| circular burned area was found at the landing site. At the same time  |
| John Keel saw a nocturnal light hovering over the "TNT" area north of |
| Point Pleasant, West Virginia. (Sources: (1) Gene Duplantier,         |

|                                                                       |
| 1968 - In 1968, shortly after five p.m., a disc, red and bluish in color,    |
| hovered in the sky southwest of Meriden, Connecticut. The five        |
| witnesses viewed the object thru a telescope, and it moved slowly     |
| from side to side as it hovered. (Source: Meriden (CT) Morning        |
| Record, November 20, 1968). Later that evening a UFO was detected on  |
| radar at the Cumbica AFB in Brazil at 8:45 p.m. At 11:00 p.m. four    |
| college students in Pirassununga, Brazil saw a blue disc approach     |
| within 30 meters of the car, at which point their car engine failed.  |
| After ten minutes the UFO moved off down the road in front of the car |
| and they were able to restart it and continue. However, their car     |
| nearly ran down three tall figures standing in the road who were      |
| dressed in pale-blue spacesuits. (Sources: Walter Buhler, FSR Case    |
| Histories, April 1971, p. 13; David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |
| Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case A1005).                           |

| 1973 - A truck engine stalled in Sidrolandia, Brazil on this night in |
| 1973. Farmer Joao Rodrigues Terra and his farmhand Djalma Da Silva    |
| Faques were driving to the farmer's house when they observed a a      |
| bright orange oval-shaped object 12 meters in diameter emerge from a  |
| strange, low white cloud. It flew at only one meter above the ground  |
| and came to within 30 meters. It had a dome on top and bottom. The    |
| surface was shiny and metallic with a luminous fan-shaped beam        |
| directed from the top, upwards. The UFO continually changed colors.   |
| They had trouble starting their pickup truck, and then could only     |
| creep along as the UFO paced them only 30 meters away for the next    |
| ten minutes. Faques, the passenger, observed the UFO closely and      |
| could clearly see a small human figure inside. The truck functioned   |
| normally after the object sped away, but its new battery failed three |
| days later and could not be recharged. (Sources: David Webb, 1973 -   |
| Year of the Humanoids, case 73-46D; David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,     |
| HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1973-76; Richard Hall,    |
| The UFO Evidence, Volume 2: A Thirty Year Report, p. 255).            |
| On this night in 1975 in Oak Brook, Illinois, a boy saw a domed disc  |
| hovering near his home. The UFO had a red light on top and two clear  |
| lights on the side. That same night a red oval-shaped UFO followed a  |
| car in Saint Thomas, Pennsylvania. It hovered, and then disappeared.  |

| 1978 - In 1978 a group of oil company technicians made a motion picture of a |
| UFO in Kuwait, but the film came out blank when developed. (Source:   |
| Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II, p. 154, citing The         |
| Guardian, November 24, 1978).                                         |

| 1980 - In 1980 an attorney in Sedalia, Missouri observed a cigar-shaped      |
| object in the early morning hours. The description was the same as an |
| object seen in Huntsville earlier that night. That night, driving     |
| near Longmont, Colorado, an art teacher and his wife encountered an   |
| intense blue beam of light and felt the rear wheels of their car      |
| lifted off the pavement. They then experienced an hour of missing     |
| time. Under hypnosis they recounted being abducted and submitting to  |
| a medical exam. The wife, who was two months pregnant, discovered a   |
| rectangular mark on her lower abdomen immediately after the           |
| experience. (Sources: Joe Graziano, APRO Bulletin, May 1981, p. 6;    |
| Richard Sigismonde, FSR, December 1983, p. 21).                       |
| 1982 - At 11:10 p.m. a 36-year-old nurse on her way to work noticed a |
| green light over a field directly ahead of her, south of              |
| Temperanceville, Virginia and not far from the NASA facility at       |
| Wallops Island. She stopped her car and looked in the direction of    |
| the light, and noticed that it was on a circular silvery grayish      |
| object that was shining a bright shaft of light onto the field. In    |
| the center of the object she could see a large bubble like window     |
| illuminated by a soft white light. Inside the window she could see    |
| three dark human-like figures moving around, visible from the waist   |
| up. The object then moved slowly towards her car flying over it,      |
| making a humming sound like a generator. It flew towards the bay and  |
| disappeared. (Source: Bob Grattan, MUFON UFO Journal, October 1983,   |
| p. 16; Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1982; case #222). |

| 1992 - In Moscow, Maine at 6:20 in the morning on this date, a       |
| 25-30-foot diameter saucer hovered three feet above the ground, only  |
| twelve feet away from the witness. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, June   |
| 1993).                                                                |

| 2001 - A V-shaped bank of lights flew from north to south over       |
| Augusta, Tennessee at 5:30 a.m. It made no sound, and the rear lights |
| where offset a little from a straight line. That night, at 11:45      |
| p.m., five bronze lights, each elliptical in shape and all the same   |
| size, flew over Maplewood, Minnesota in a V-formation. They made no   |
| sound. The witness was aware of the Leonid meteor shower, and said    |
| these lights could not have been meteors. (Source: George Filer,      |
