| 1945 - On this day Leonard H. Stringfield was flying to Iwo Jima      |
| island onboard a U.S. Army Air Force C-46 shortly after the end of    |
| the war with Japan. Three luminous lights began to follow his C-46    |
| transport plane as they approached the island in the Pacific. The     |
| plane's engines faltered, its magnetic compass failed, and its        |
| engines temporarily stopped. There were thirteen military witnesses   |
| on board. Len Stringfield became a life long UFO investigator as a    |
| result of this encounter. (Sources: Leonard H. Stringfield, Inside    |

| 1945 - At five o'clock in the morning two women in Langelmayesi,      |
| Finland noticed a dark cylindrical object. Inside the prow of object  |
| stood a slender man in green coveralls, and another man who was       |
| apparently steering the craft inside a glass dome. Their Black        |
| Labrador dog reacted in terror. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer      |

| 1947 - In Fukuoka, Japan at the U.S. Air Force Mew Radar Station      |
| there was a target picked up (radar only) in orbit at a range of      |
| 26-30 nautical miles and a bearing of 20-30 degrees. The target       |
| changed to a heading of 23 degrees and was tracked to a range of 54   |
| nautical miles where it faded. The UFO was climbing on an outbound    |
| course. (Source: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947 Research Notes from        |

| 1952 - At 9:30 p.m. USAF control tower operators at Chickasaw and     |
| Brookley AFB, Alabama, an officer from the USAF Office of Special     |
| Investigations, and others watched six UFOs hover and fly erratically |
| for 75 minutes. They varied in color and intensity from fiery red to  |
| sparkling diamond white in appearance. They flew erratically up and   |
| down, and were tracked on radar. (Sources: Project Blue Book files    |

| 1953 - Fourteen oval flying objects were sighted by a Ground Observer |
| Corps watcher in San Rafael, California at 2:25 a.m. They flew        |
| silently and were in view for three minutes. A report on the          |
| encounter was sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA, and the     |
| NSA. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official            |

| 1957 - A teenage couple on the beach in Nazare, Portugal saw an       |
| ellipsoidal UFO low over the shore, just five meters from the ground, |
| and 100 meters away. Its circular main body had a curved window and   |
| was surmounted by a small tower. The craft shot a greenish-yellow     |
| beam at the ground. Plants and stones vanished from a four-meter      |
| square area. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Catalogue of 200  |

| 1957 - A silent crescent-shaped object followed three people driving  |
| in a car in Glenelg, South Australia at 8:15 p.m. When the car        |
| stopped, the object hovered for 20 seconds, then shot away.           |

| 1962 - Three people, including a man named Bellantoni in Dolores,     |
| Buenos Aires province, Argentina encountered a bright object on the   |
| ground at night, 300 meters from National Highway 2. The object was   |
| 30 feet long, 15 feet high, and had "human-like figures moving about  |
| inside the machine." Three witnesses in a car and two in a truck      |
| encountered a disc-shaped UFO between Metan and Salta, Argentina. The |
| disc was 150 meters in diameter, and flew just 50 meters above the    |
| truck. The truck engine caught on fire. (Sources: (1) John Keel,      |

| 1963 - A transparent illuminated sphere ten feet in diameter          |
| descended into a garden of the Gualberto family in Familia Sagrada,   |
| Minas Gerais State, Brazil at 7:15 p.m. There were four seated        |
| figures inside, who wore divers suits with transparent fishbowl       |
| helmets. One entity, a Cyclops being over eight-feet tall with a      |
| single eye, floated down to the ground on two vertical beams of       |
| light. He walked with a strange, swinging motion, then sat down. He   |
| wore high boots that left a triangular imprint, and carried a box     |
| emitting flashes. It spoke in an unintelligible language, and made a  |
| threatening gesture at the two boys, aged 9 and 11, and then flew up  |
| to the sphere, which left. The chlldren somehow became convinced that |
| the being was "good" and would return. The encounter lasted ten       |
| minutes, with ground traces from the footprints left behind.          |

| 1965 - At 6:40 p.m. three women in rural East Derry, New Hampshire    |
| sighted nine UFOs flying at treetop level over a field. The objects   |
| flew in three groups of three, and passed about 400 feet away from    |

| 1967 - Joseph Purcell, age 19, sighted a cigar-shaped object over     |
| Dublin, Ireland. It was very bright at one end, and gave off an       |
| orange hue at the other. (Source: Butler Dermot, Conspiracy of        |

| 1968 - At 7:30 p.m. Pedro Aylagas Galvez saw a lighted object in his  |
| field in Ucero, Soria, Spain that descended 500 meters away and       |
| emitted a beam of light directed upward. It then made a strange,      |
| abrupt maneuver, and then shone its light at him, hitting him in the  |
| face and blinding him and also making his hair stand on end. The      |
| object descended in a spinning motion, stabilized, and displayed four |
| large windows on top with four smaller ones underneath. As he         |
| watched, he saw four “small dark objects” ejected from its central    |
| part, which landed on the ground. After about a minute these arose    |
| and re-entered the hovering UFO, which then ascended and disappeared  |
| in seconds. The entire incident lasted about seven minutes. Others    |
| independently reported seeing the object depart. (Source:             |

| 1972 - At around 3:00 a.m. Eduardo Dedeu was driving home between     |
| Medanos and Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina when he stopped to  |
| pick up a very tall hitchhiker wearing a coat with the collar turned  |
| up. His chin was much longer than normal. To Dedeu's remarks the      |
| stranger made unintelligible replies. After several miles, his car's  |
| lights went out and Dedeu was obliged to stop. Ahead of him on the    |
| road was what he first took to be an overturned bus, with a large     |
| blue light in the middle and smaller white lights on the sides. When  |
| he got out of the car he was dazzled by a brilliant flash of white    |
| light, accompanied by intense heat; when he could look again he saw   |
| the object, with white lights in its windows, moving leftward. The    |
| hitchhiker was gone, and the passenger door handle was detached,      |
| laying on the floor of the car. (Sources: Jane Thomas, FSR,           |

| 1975 - In a scrub pine forest near Truro, Massachusetts on Cape Cod,  |
| Lloyd Costa saw two people near a round dome like "tent" in the early |
| evening. The dome was 20 feet in diameter and only 35 feet away. A    |
| fluorescent blue light came from inside it. He walked away, but then  |
| heard a humming noise and looked back to see that the "tent" was      |
| encircled by multicolored rings. It began to rise and fall, and       |
| luminous portholes were now visible on the craft. A car stopped and   |
| Mr. Elfe, a friend, came through the woods calling for him. He also   |
| saw the UFO. The people near the object were described as resembling  |
| small "puppets," and were surrounded by something gauzy. There was an |
| almond smell in the air that made Mr. Costa sick. His friend helped   |
| him back to his car. The next day he returned to the spot and found a |
| circle of approximately 20 6-inch holes. There were also some pieces  |

| 1977 - A major UFO incident involving 17 police occurred in the       |
| Windermere area of the Cumbria Lake District, England at 12:10 a.m. A |
| diamond or "kite"-shaped UFO was seen for 20 minutes; it had two      |
| extremely bright lights, and made a faint "purring" sound. There were |
| multiple independent witnesses. The UFO eventually flew out to sea.   |

| and hovered over Mount Otero for the next two hours, turning its      |
| lights on and off, with a pulsating white halo. Traces were found: a  |
| two-meter wide circle, and several holes in the ground 8 cm diameter, |
| and 5 cm deep. (Source: UNICAT, case 444, citing Vicente-Juan         |

| 1977 - Francis Lloyd, age 24, was driving a large truck from          |
| Haverfordwest, Wales; with him was John Dwyer, age 16. Two miles      |
| outside of Carmarthern, on the A48 Highway, they had descended the    |
| Nanticaws Hill grade at 2:30 a.m. and were about to begin to climb    |
| the next hill when, at the bottom of the dip, they saw two tall       |
| humanoid figures standing on the right hand verge near the highway.   |
| The figures were at least seven feet tall, and were reddish orange in |
| color, as if wearing celluloid suits; they had huge heads that        |
| reminded the witnesses of Guardsmen's Busbies. The figures stood      |
| motionless, facing each other slightly, and appeared to be holding    |
| some sort of object between them. They had chrome or silver-colored   |
| antennae that appeared to come out of their chests and stood as high  |
| as the tops of their heads. The two men drove right on past without   |
| stopping, and although the figures were in view for no more than six  |
| of seven seconds, they were fully lit by the eight headlights of      |
| their large rig. No craft was seen by either man. Three months later, |
| there was a fatal car accident at the same site, killing four men.    |

| 1980 - At 1:15 p.m. a three foot long, football-shaped UFO was seen   |
| by two men, John F. Clark and Lloyd List, from a Cessna 172 over Red  |
| Bluff, California. It was solid, smooth, and metallic. It maintained  |
| its distance ahead of their plane for 5-6 seconds, then was           |
| overtaken. Its axis was parallel to the horizon, and it did not       |
| bobble in the plane's turbulence as would a balloon. (Source: UNICAT, |

| gear, portholes, and a blindingly bright 1 meter wide searchlight.    |
| The close encounter lasted five minutes. (Source: Larry Hatch, U      |

|                                                                       |
| 1991 - At 4:42 a.m. a huge, dirigible-shaped object first attracted   |
| the attention of the military when it appeared on their radar screens |
| over the Mangishlak Peninsula, Shaitan Mazar, Kyrgizstan. It was      |
| flying from west to east at 960 km per hour, and at an altitude of    |
| 6600 meters. Thinking that the object might have been launched from   |
| Kapustin Yar, Mangishlak military personnel contacted the Cosmodrome. |
| Kapustin denied any knowledge of the object, although they confirmed  |
| its appearance on radar. The object failed to respond to attempts at  |
| communication on any frequency, and since it was flying near a        |
| restricted area, two MIG-29 fighter jets already on patrol were       |
| directed to intercept it. In addition, a third jet was scrambled from |
| Air Station 7.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| The MIG pilots were directed to intercept the object, to identify it  |
| if possible, to try to make contact with it, and to force it to land  |
| at the nearest Air station. If the object failed to cooperate, they   |
| were directed to shoot it down. The MIGs intercepted the object over  |
| the western shore of the Aral Sea at 5:12 a.m. The pilots observed    |
| the object both visually and on their radar screens, and they         |
| described it as dirigible-shaped, 600 meters long by 110 meters wide, |
| with very little surface detail except for two round "portholes" near |
| the front, and some sort of strange green markings near the rear. The |
| object did not make any hostile moves or react in any way to the      |
| presence of the jets. When all attempts at contacting the object      |
| failed, the squadron leader proposed positioning the jets on either   |
| side of the object at a distance of about 800 meters, and gently but  |
| firmly directing it to the Air Station. If necessary the jets would   |
| fire warning shots to encourage the object to cooperate.              |
|                                                                       |
| When the jets were in position around the object and within 800       |
| meters of it the weapons systems of the MIGs shut down for no         |
| apparent reason. Worse yet, their engines began to malfunction. The   |
| object also began to make evasive zigzag maneuvers, and increased its |
| speed from 960 km/hour to 6800 km/hour. These maneuvers were verified |
| by radar at Baikonur, Alma-Alta, and Bishkek. The jets had no         |
| alternative but to back off, and the object proceeded east through    |
| Alma-Alta airspace at the slightly lower altitude of 4500 meters.     |
| Radar dispatchers in Alma-Alta, fearing a collision with conventional |
| aircraft, issued a general alert for air traffic to avoid the         |
| area. At 5:27 a.m. the object disappeared from radar in the area of   |
| Lake Issyk-Kul near the border of Kazakhstan.                         |
|                                                                       |
| A month later reports began to trickle back to Bishkek that a huge    |
| UFO had been seen to crash into the Tien Shan Mountains, 100          |
| kilometers east of Przhevalsk near a peak known as Pik Pobeda (Peak   |
| of Victory). The actual site lay in a gorge known as "Shaitan Mazar"  |
| or "Grave of the Devil", near the Saris Dzas River. A search party    |
| led by Michael Eltchin was dispatched, but were unable to reach the   |
| site due to heavy snowfall. In June 1992 a second expedition was      |
| mounted, consisting of three groups of volunteers with                |
| both scientific backgrounds and mountain climbing experience. The     |
| expedition arrived at the actual crash site on June 12, 1992, and set |
| up a base camp 2.5 km away to the northwest. It was evident that the  |
| object had slid 1700 meters after hitting the ground. It then         |
| exploded from within its center, blasting it into almost two equal    |
| parts and bending its internal structure outwards from the center of  |
| the explosion. Decks and interior features were visible inside the    |
| object through a gap made by the blast. The expedition then noticed   |
| several unusual effects when they began to examine the object. They   |
| were unable to photograph the object because some sort of radiation   |
| exposed all their film and ruined all videotape. Whenever a member of |
| the party got closer than 800 meters to the object, he began to feel  |
| unusual anxiety, depression, and exhaustion. Within 800 meters, the   |
| men's hair stood on end. Instruments showed an unusually high level   |
| of static electricity in the air, and compasses and magnetometers     |
| failed to function properly in the vicinity of the object.            |
| Measurement devices registered no magnetic fields at all within an    |
| elliptically shaped area centered on the object, and measuring 2230   |
| meters long and 1700 meters wide. Even naturally occurring magnetic   |
| rocks displayed no magnetic field within this ellipse. All clocks and |
| wristwatches stopped working at a distance of 600 meters from the     |
| object. Furthermore, anyone who approached within 500 meters of the   |
| object began to suffer from some sort of radiation burns. The         |
| expedition soon had to abandon the site, but planned to return at     |
| some indefinite time in the future. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1991  |

| her room through her window. She saw a short Grey humanoid, with a    |
| huge hairless head and large almond-shaped eyes, peering in the       |
| window at her. The creature had no lips and only a small slit for a   |
| mouth, it also had a very thin neck. She estimated it to be the same  |
| height as her four-year-old brother. When the figure became aware     |
