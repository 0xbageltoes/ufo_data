| sightings. |

| 1954 - Andre Garcia and Andre Darzais were driving a truck between    |
| Lagrasse and Villemagne and were near the village of Lezignan, France |
| when they saw a luminous object coming slowly to the ground. It       |
| measured about 10 meters in diameter and took off with a burst of     |
| light. (Sources: France-Soir, October 7, 1954; Jacques Vallee,        |

| 1954 - Mr. Garreau, a farmer in Chaleix, France saw an object the     |
| size of a carriage land in his field. Two men of normal height        |
| emerged through a sliding door. They wore khaki overalls and were of  |
| European type. They shook hands with the witness and said some thing  |
| like: "Paris? Nord?" (According to another version they spoke         |
| indistinct words.) They gave a pat on the back to Mr. Garreau's dog   |
| and took off at an amazing speed. (Sources: Liberation, October 7,    |

| 1954 - At 8:10 a.m. Mr. Lacambre, a forester, saw a little man or     |
| dwarf in a streambed 200 meters from his house in St-Perdoux, Lot,    |
| France. The being wore a wide leather belt or girdle, boots, and a    |
| tunic. He put water in a bottle, and some pebbles in a belt pouch; he |
| then rose up into air and vanished. The creature had two pear-shaped  |
| boxes under his arms that may have assisted his ascent. Footprints    |
| were found at the site. (Source: Michel Figuet and Jean-Louis Ruchon, |

| 1954 - Several people noticed an object hovering near a hilltop in    |
| the evening in Tregon, France. They drove to the site, but it flew    |
| away. What seemed to have been the same object was seen at Megrit, 25 |
| km to the southwest, hovering over a farm. It was described as        |
| metallic, flat, and emitting light. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying     |

| 1954 - Montceau-les-Mines, France. At 6:30 p.m. about 20 people,      |
| among them Remy Gaudicourt of Sanvignes, saw a circular, luminous     |
| object rise vertically from the vicinity of the railroad tracks.      |
| There were no traces found. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and |

| 1954 - On a road in Lessard-le-National, France at 7:20 p.m., a       |

| 1954 - At 7:30 p.m. a six-meter in diameter red, round, domed object, |
| hovered 10-12 meters above the ground in Taupignac, France. Four      |
| little men, one meter tall (3.3 feet) exited. As the three male       |
| witnesses approached they quickly entered the object. The domed disc  |
| changed color from blue to orange and then to red, and made no noise  |
| as it took off. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight |
| Line Mystery, p. 159).                                                |

| 1954 - Mrs. Fourneret, a housewife, ran away as an orange, circular   |
| object 3 meters in diameter that swung in midair and landed near her  |
| farm in Poncey-sur-Lignon, France. When Messrs. Girardot and Vincent  |
| arrived with rifles, they found that the earth had been "sucked up"   |
| over a quadrilateral area. Francois Bouiller confirmed he had seen a  |
| luminous object in flight. Extensive investigation by French Air      |
| Force and police. (Sources: Liberation, October 7, 1954; Aime Michel, |

| Armed Services Committee, was on a high-level diplomatic mission to   |
| the Soviet Union and was traveling on the trans-Caucasus railway      |
| outside of Baku, Azerbaijan on this day in 1955. While on the train   |
| at 7:10 p.m. he and his aide saw a disc-shaped UFO slowly ascend to   |
| 6000 feet and then shoot to the North. A second disc appeared and     |
| maneuvered about the sky. (Source: Michael David Hall, UFOs: A        |

| 1960 - Reverend and Mrs. Browning in Cressy, Tasmania observed a      |
| cigar-shaped object fly toward the west. Five 30' diameter domed      |
| discs joined the larger object, and all flew away rapidly to the east |
| at 6:10 p.m. (Sources: James E. McDonald case investigation files;    |
| APRO Bulletin, September-October 1960, p. 4).                         |

| 1967 - At 11:20 p.m. Atlantic Daylight Time at least one and most     |
| likely two separate UFOs dove or crashed into the ocean near Bon      |
| Portage Island, in the area of Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada.     |
| There were at least a dozen independent witnesses to the event.       |
| Canadian Navy divers searched the area for three days but found       |
| nothing. This followed a series of six UFO sightings across Quebec    |
| and Nova Scotia beginning at 7:19 p.m., when Air Canada Captain       |
| Pierre Guy Charbonneau, flying between Sherbrooke and St. Jean,       |
| sighted an orange rectangular object followed by a series of smaller  |
| lights, followed by a sizeable explosion near the large object that   |
| turned into a big white ball-shaped cloud. The cloud turned red, then |
| violet, and then blue. Two minutes later there was another explosion  |
| that turned into a second sphere which was orange in color. Like the  |
| first one it too eventually faded to blue. The smaller lights on the  |
| "kite tail" broke formation with the rectangular object and began to  |
| dance around the spheres like fireflies. (Sources: Yarmouth Light     |

| 1973 - A man was driving on the Simi Freeway in Simi Valley,          |
| California during the afternoon when he saw a 30 by 350 foot          |
| triangular object in a dust cloud near the road. It was 80-100 feet   |
| away and was swaying back and forth 10 feet above the ground. An      |
| eight-foot hose dangled from the bottom of the object. A clear bubble |
| three feet in diameter swiveled atop the UFO. As he watched a being   |
| crawled around from behind the machine, looked at the witness, and    |
| then scrambled out of sight. The humanoid was of normal stature but   |
| wore a silvery type of wet suit. The bubble began rotating faster and |
| disappeared inside the object, which emitted a whirring noise. A fog  |
| enveloped the craft, which then disappeared. An unidentified woman    |
| witness had reported a similar sighting the week before. (Sources:    |

| 1979 - Garbage collector Aldo Natoli was on his way to work in Viggiu |
| Varese, Italy at 3:20 a.m. when he spotted two strange figures        |
| suspended about 20 cm from the ground, and gesticulating animatedly   |
| among themselves without making a sound. Natoli stopped his Vespa     |
| motorscooter and continued observing the scene. The figures were thin |
| and human-like, wearing dark blue, loose fitting coveralls. Their     |
| eyes were fluorescent and they had black hair. When the witness       |
| restarted his scooter, the figures disappeared into the darkness. The |
| scooter then malfunctioned but moments later it started again. He     |
| then drove away from the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid   |

| 1979 - In the early evening a seven-year old boy in Handsworth,       |
| Sheffield, England watched a seven-foot-tall silvery figure that was  |
| apparently drilling a hole in the ground with a tube. The boy watched |
| the figure until it suddenly spotted him. The figure then disappeared |
| in a puff of pink smoke. Four non-human looking footprints were found |
| at the site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |
