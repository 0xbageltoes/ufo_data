| 1916 - In Superior, Wisconsin at 4:30 a.m. several dock workers       |
| observed the passage of a large flying machine in which three men     |
| were clearly visible. (Source: Jerome Clark, Anomalist, April 2000,   |

| 1956 - At 6:00 a.m. two witnesses in Donelson, Tennessee (a           |
| neighborhood of Nashville) watched in astonishment as a 12 inch wide  |
| metallic disc flew past their window, banged into a garage, and then  |
| flew away. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case # 4936;    |

| 1964 - Two 10-year-old boys named Mathlin and Jensen saw a glowing    |
| disc with landing gear land in a nearby paddock in Plympton, South    |
| Australia at two o'clock in the afternoon. The craft had windows and  |
| a dome. A door on the craft opened and a seven foot tall occupant     |
| with copper skin emerged and walked around. The humanoid wore a tight |
| fitting bluish-black tunic, a purple cape, and a leather-like helmet. |
| He also wore a box in the front attached to his belt. A second        |
| occupant was seen through the windows inside the craft. (Sources:     |

| 1968 - On this night in Pulham Market, Norfolk County, England a tall |
| luminous shape or figure glided from an entrance in a nearby hedge;   |
| it traveled slowly along the road and then disappeared. There was a   |
| single witness, named Webb. (Source: John Keel, Operation Trojan      |

| 1984 - On the campus of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio at    |
| 3:30 p.m. witnesses observed a black sphere half a meter in diameter  |
| that hovered just over a University building, then shot off very fast |
| toward the southeast. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, May 1986).          |

| 1984 - At 9:00 p.m. a man and his dog in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania  |
| witnessed a 40 foot wide diamond-shaped object wobbling in the        |
| southeast sky at an estimated 50 feet altitude. He also reported      |
| interference on his TV set. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, April 1984).  |
|                                                                       |
| 1996 - On March 2nd at 6:30 a.m. police in Cuscatancingo, El Salvador |
| found a 17-year-old boy wandering confused along the shore of         |
| Ilopango Lake. Under interrogation he related a bizarre story of      |
| being abducted around 10 p.m. on February 29th. During the night he   |
| had been walking towards his home during a local power black-out.     |
| Suddenly there was a bright flash of blue light behind him. Thinking  |
| that it was the police he turned around slowly. His next memory was   |
| of being inside a completely white room, where he could not           |
| distinguish any walls or furniture of any kind. He realized he was    |
| lying prone and unable to move, in some sort of bed. He noticed       |
| numerous "cables" that appeared to be connected to his chest area,    |
| and on his right arm he had attached what resembled an IV machine. He |
| then saw several humanoids about 1.2 meters (four feet) in height.    |
| They had very large heads, huge eyes and in the forehead he could see |
| what appeared to be another "protuberance" resembling a third eye.    |
| They also had sparse beards around the mouth and chin. In a state of  |
| confusion he noticed other humans in the room but could not tell if   |
| they were also prisoners. He remembered seeing a horrifying scene in  |
| which he saw several of the humanoids were operating on a woman,      |
| seemingly cutting her in half. Then they took the upper torso of the  |
| human female and somehow attached it to a "hump-like" area of a       |
| female humanoid that had been prepared on another bed. The humanoids  |
| wore white tunics which they had a strange insignia over the right    |
| breast. He was later taken to the shores of Lake Ilopango where the   |
| beings told him that their race "was in a state of war and could not  |
| reproduce in their original normal manner." He then had the sensation |
| of falling towards the lake. This part was very confusing and could   |
| not be remembered in detail. Several unusual scars were found on the  |
| witness's body. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database |
| 1996, citing Dr. Luis E. Lopez, Y Files).                             |

| 2004 - At 9:00 p.m. in Brooklyn, Maryland an oval-shaped, very bright |
| light came down into a backyard, very close to the house and          |
| residents. The close encounter reportedly lasted ten minutes.         |
