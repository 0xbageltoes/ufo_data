| 1952 - At a U.S. Air Force radar site in Yaak, Montana at 4:45 a.m.   |
| two Air Force enlisted men sighted lights in the sky at the same time |
| radar tracked two blips on an AN/FPS-3 radar set monitored by three   |
| radar operators. The two small, multi-colored lights became black     |
| silhouettes at dawn and flew around erratically for an hour. (Source: |

| 1952 - At 9:43 p.m. in Atlanta, Georgia Mrs. William Davis and nine   |
| other witnesses saw a light, similar to the evening star, move up and |
| down for a long period of time. (Source: Don Berliner, Project        |

| 1952 - At 10:30 p.m. in nearby Marietta, Georgia an unidentified      |
| witness using binoculars viewed two large objects shaped like         |
| spinning tops and displaying red, blue and green colors. They flew    |
| side-by-side leaving a trail of sparks for 30 minutes. At the same    |
| time Mr. Bowman, an ex-artillery officer, and 24 others saw a red,    |
| white, and bluish-green object spinning and throwing off sparks for   |
| 15 minutes. Twenty minutes later an ex-AAF B-25 gunner saw two large  |
| white disc-shaped objects with green vapor trails flying in trail     |
| formation. They merged together and flew away very fast. (Source: Don |
| Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).                             |
|                                                                       |
| 1958 - At 12:15 a.m. A. M. Slaton, a Philco technical representative  |
| working as a government contractor, sighted a round, bluish-white     |
| object at Wheelus AFB, Libya. It was flying at varying speeds. His    |
| first sighting lasted two minutes and the second lasted 1.5 minutes.  |

|                                                                       |
| 1958 - At 9:30 p.m., about 11 km before reaching Laval, France a      |
| businessman driving from Paris suddenly saw a motionless object, 10   |
| meters above ground to the left of the road. It was about 150 meters  |
| away. It was shaped like two cones with a common base and had two     |
| rows of about ten openings in the middle section. It seemed about 20  |
| meters wide, metallic, with a light similar to a red traffic light    |
| shining through the windows. The witness had time to stop and         |
| maneuver his car to get the object in his headlight beams. Throughout |
| the observation a whistling sound such as that of a jet aircraft was  |
| heard. The object rose very slowly, and then flew off faster climbing |
| out of sight. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century |
| of Landings, case 470).                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1962 - Mr. R. Leeming, an engineer, stopped by a lake for a picnic    |
| while on a business trip around noon. He noticed a metallic UFO with  |
| windows hidden behind some trees, sitting on three telescopic legs    |
| and shaped like a top. It was 30 feet in diameter. He saw that it had |
| a ladder and an open doorway, so he climbed the ladder and went       |
| inside. The interior had a control panel but no occupants, but when   |
| he turned around he was surprised to see that two human looking       |
| individuals, about 5.7 feet tall, wearing white suits with helmets,   |
| had returned. They looked surprised to see him and not sure what to   |
| do. He asked them, in French, why if they were obviously spacemen     |
| they looked like us. One of them replied, speaking in French, saying  |
| that the reason was we had a common ancestor. (Sources: Flying        |
| Saucers, June 1976, p. 19; David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:      |
| Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case A0547, citing Wido Hoville and    |
| UFO Quebec).                                                          |

| 1965 - An oval-shaped object landed on an estate near the Huanaco,    |
| Peru airport at 5:00 a.m. A being with a big head emerged, gestured,  |
| and then re-entered the craft. The UFO shot straight up at high       |
| speed. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of    |
| Landings, case 691; Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume 2: A       |
| Thirty Year Report, p. 472, citing Charles Bowen, The Humanoids, p.   |

| 1966 - In Willsboro, New York at 2:45 p.m. T. H. Ridman sighted an    |
| oval object with lights that flashed red and white and occasionally   |
| blue, traveled west, and then disappeared downward. It returned       |
| several minutes later, at which time a loud noise was heard. The      |
| entire sighting lasted 30 minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project     |

| 1966 - At 10:30 p.m. six men, including Mr. C. Murdock, sighted an    |
| orange-reddish domed disc with multicolored lights around the rim     |
| moving around the sky in Fort Duchesne, Utah. There were several      |
| occasions when it went slowly up in the sky and then came back down   |
| again.                                                                |

| Fort Duchesne, Utah - 1 September 1966 10:30 p.m.                     |
|                                                                       |
| []                                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1968 - In Mendoza, Argentina two casino workers, Juan Carlos          |
| Peccinetti and Fernando Jose Villegas, were driving home after work   |
| at 3:30 a.m. when the engine of their car quit and the lights went    |
| out. Peccinetti had just started getting out of the car when both men |
| found themselves paralyzed. They were soon face to face with three    |
| strange, five-foot tall beings with unusually large bald heads,       |
| wearing coveralls. Behind them was a circular or oval UFO 12 feet     |
| across and five feet high that was hovering four feet above the       |
| ground and directing a bright beam of light downward. When the        |
| entities came closer the witnesses heard a foreign-sounding voice     |
| repeat, "Do not fear." Then they were told, "we have just made three  |
| journeys around the sun, studying customs and languages of the        |
| inhabitants of the system...mathematics is the universal language."   |
| Meanwhile, another one of the entities, using a tool that looked like |
| a soldering iron, was making inscriptions on the doors, windshield,   |
| and running boards of their car. The witnesses next saw a circular    |
| TV-like screen, on which there appeared first a waterfall, then a     |
| mushroom cloud, and then the waterfall again, this time with no       |
| water. Finally the beings took hold of the witnesses' left hands and  |
| pricked their fingers three times, taking blood samples, after which  |
| they ascended to their machine along the light beam. There was an     |
| "explosive effect" and the object rose and disappeared. The men ran   |
| to a nearby military college to report their experience. They later   |
| retracted their story, but there are indications that they were       |
| coerced into doing so. In fact, authorities in Mendoza quickly made   |
| the "spreading of UFO rumors" a criminal offense to discourage        |
| widespread rumors on this and other cases that occurred about the     |
| same time. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue   |
| of Humanoid Reports, case 1968-64).                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - Shortly after 8:00 p.m. in Llanerchymedd, Anglesey, Wales      |
| several villagers including a man hunting rabbits watched a bright    |
| white light descend slowly behind a new housing estate. Other         |
| independent witnesses saw a large silvery sphere above a field, and   |
| watched the cows panic and neighborhood dogs start barking furiously. |
| A woman and her young daughter looked out and saw three tall men in   |
| gray uniforms with caps or helmets attached to their suits walk       |
| across a field. She ran to the village to find some other witnesses.  |

| 1993 - A woman was at a cabin in the woods at Dorothy Lake, Manitoba, |
| Canada awoke around 3:30 a.m. to go to the bathroom. Not wanting to   |
| disturb the other cabin occupants she left the bathroom door open. As |
| she sat there she was looking down the hall towards a window, and she |
| saw a face appear in the window as it went by. This shocked her       |
| because the cabin window is about eight feet above the ground. The    |
| face was a classic Grey alien, with an egg-shaped head with large     |
| almond-shaped eyes. She also saw a blue light flashing outside. The   |
| woman screamed and the face went away. No tracks were found outside.  |
| Investigators rated the reliability of the witness as high. (Sources: |
