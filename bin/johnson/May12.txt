| 1909 -  A cigar-shaped airship with a searchlight was seen flying     |
| over Terrington Marsh, Norfolk, England at 9:45 p.m. It made a        |
| rattling motor sound and flew off to the north. It was back again at  |
| 10:30 p.m.  (Source:  Carl Grove, FSR, November-December 1970,        |

| 1952 - A restricted military document shows that a UFO was sighted at |
| 2145 hours UST 40 miles west of Roswell, New Mexico. The object was   |
| blue-green in color and its estimated altitude was 30,000-40,000      |
| feet. The object traveled three times over approximately the same     |
| triangular course. The rate of speed could not be estimated           |
| precisely, but was faster than a jet aircraft. The intensity of its   |
| color brightness varied with the object's altitude (Source: Fran      |

| 1954 - In 1954 a UFO shaped like a red dinner plate hung in the sky on edge  |
| for 15 minutes over Dayton, Ohio at around 7 p.m. It tipped, changed  |
| shaped, and then sped off. (Source: Leonard H. Stringfield, CRIFO     |

| 1956 - At 3:30 a.m. in Lakewood, Los Angeles County, California       |
| several witnesses had a close encounter with a silent, brilliant      |
| saucer-shaped object with wires around its edge. It made four turns,  |
| then shot away extremely fast. There were at least two independent    |
| witnesses, and there were physiological effects reported. (Source:    |

| 1962 - At 4:10 a.m. V. and G. Tomasini and H. Zenobi, while driving   |
| on Route 35 at Kilometer 72 near La Pampa, La Pampa province,         |
| Argentina saw a rectangular object shaped like an illuminated         |
| railroad boxcar. As they came close to it, the object took off,       |
| crossed the road at low altitude, rose with a flame, and separated    |
| into two sections that flew away in different directions. It made a   |
| humming sound and was seen on the ground for one minute. The grass on |
| the ground was burnt in a 60m radius circle at the landing site,      |
| insects were carbonized, and the ground was "petrified." Sample       |
| analysis was done by the Puerto Belgrano Naval Base. At 4:30 p.m.     |
| another close encounter occurred northwest of Bahia Blanca, Buenos    |
| Aires province, Argentina that involved several witnesses and         |
| reportedly had lasting physiological effects. (Sources: La Nacion,    |

| 1967 - At 11:10 p.m. a glowing yellow elliptical object with three    |
| round spots on the underside passed below the clouds and was observed |
| through binoculars in Putney, England. (Source: Flying Saucer Review, |

| 1967 - Miss N. Parshall, a sixteen-year-old girl in California,       |
| reported sighting a cigar-shaped object with a dull aluminum          |
| finish"shoot around in sky" at around four o'clock in the afternoon.  |
| It came to within 60 feet of the aircraft and then veered away. It    |
| seemed ready to ram the plane from behind, but instead shot away very |
| fast. The sighting lasted an estimated 90 seconds. (Sources: NICAP    |

| 1967 - At 8:00 p.m. a silver ellipse-shaped UFO rapidly approached    |
| two people driving in a vehicle, five miles south of Neola, Utah. It  |
| slowed its speed and descended level with the road. It then tilted    |
| and flew over the crest of a nearby hill and was gone from sight.     |

| 1967 - That same night a disc-shaped object swooped down to just 25   |
| feet above the ground in Galion, Ohio. It projected a circle of light |
| down around a paperboy with the last name Prim, who found himself     |
| unable to move and with a gap in his memory of what happened next.    |

| 1969 - At 9:45 p.m. a brilliant circular object hovered at a low      |
| altitude near some railroad tracks in Casino, New South Wales,        |
| Australia. A married couple, Mr. and Mrs. Hinitt, watched beams of    |
| light pulse upwards from the ground toward the UFO. Burnt patches of  |
| vegetation were found at the sight in a heavy rainstorm. (Sources:    |

| 1969 - At 9:30 p.m. CDT a helmet-shaped disc estimated to be 15       |
| meters in diameter was seen widely over the Lake Zurich suburbs in    |
| Illinois. It was reportedly seen over a two hour period. It made a    |
| buzzing sound, and dogs reacted to its presence by barking. (Sources: |
| Chicago Tribune, May 25, 1969; FSR, September-October 1971, p. 27).   |
|                                                                       |
| 1971 - At 10:30 p.m. a 25 foot long ovoid UFO was seen near a house   |
| in Elizabeth, New Jersey for two minutes. It made no sound. It made a |
| weaving motion through the sky as it flew away. (Source: Larry Hatch, |
| U computer database, case 9276).                                      |

| 1973 - A UFO gyrated in the sky over the harbor of Lourenco Marques,  |
| Mozambique for more than an hour in the pre-dawn hours. (Source: Rand |
| (South Africa) Daily Mail, May 15, 1973).                             |

| 1973 - At 9:20 p.m. a man driving west on Route 76, near Kent, Ohio   |
| observed a group of flashing lights overhead almost directly above    |
| his car. They moved with him until he stopped out of curiosity, and   |
| so did the lights. Looking up through the windshield he could see a   |
| football shaped object that flashed from red to blue to white in a    |
| repeating cycle. He then saw a human figure materialize 10 feet below |
| the object. The figure was clad all in silver, and descended rapidly  |
| to the roadway directly in front of the car. When it reached the      |
| pavement the figure stood looking to the right, then to look directly |
| at the witness. After a half a minute the figure ascended rapidly,    |
| "like a helium balloon," towards the object. It vanished before       |
| reaching it.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| The figure was entirely silver in color and seemed to lack hair and   |
| ears. A narrow mouth with a small pointed chin were also observed. He |
| was uncertain whether the silvery body was a close fitting garment or |
| the actual skin color, because he saw what appeared to be the faint   |
| outline of a vein running down the inside of one of the arms. The     |
| feet were clad with boots or shoes, with a heavy, distinct line       |
| between the sole and the boot itself. The height of the figure was    |
| not much more than 2.5 feet. When it descended it was approximately   |
| ten feet in front of the car. The UFO shot up in a rapid vertical     |
| ascent, rocking the car "as if a semi was passing." (Source: David F. |
| Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case      |
| 1973-010, citing Larry Moyers and Marc Candusso).                     |

| 1974 - A UFO covered with over 30 orange and white lights that were   |
| each as bright as a welder's torch flew over Maxton, North Carolina.  |
| It hovered over a mobile home park shortly after midnight. It was     |
| pursued by two men, a police officer and a farmer, in their cars. The |
| UFO made a remote landing but no traces were found on the ground.     |

| 1975 - At 4:10 p.m. a solid looking flying object, trailing exhaust,  |
| flew northeast through the sky over Howrah, Tasmania. The UFO changed |
| shape and then made a ninety-degree turn. It then executed a 180      |
| degree turn, and then swooped down and away. A movie film was made of |
| the UFO. (Source: Richard Hall, Skylook, December 1975, p. 15).       |

| 1975 - That same night at 11:30 p.m. a green light was seen hovering  |
| over an area two miles east of Peesane, Saskatchewan for 12 minutes.  |
| It then flew away to the east. A perfect circle was found in the      |
| grass at the site, two days later. (Source: Ted R. Phillips, Skylook, |

| 1979 - At 1:30 p.m. three observers in Atwater, Los Angeles County,   |
| California watched a 3' x 7' disc hovering over power line poles. It  |
| made a humming sound that seemed to attract birds that followed it as |
| it flew away. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case #       |

| 1980 - A brilliant blue disc hovered at a low altitude for ten        |
| minutes over Bulawayo, Zimbabwe at six p.m. It shot straight up,      |
| stopped, then shot up again and was gone. (Source: Cynthia Hind, UFO  |

| 1981 - A man and a woman, a truck driver and a cashier, were driving  |
| near Clatskanie, Oregon at around five o'clock in the morning. A      |
| large delta-shaped UFO surrounded by a turbulent fog or mist "like    |
| smoke from a chimney" followed their truck for 15 miles. It had a     |
| white light and two orange lights. As it directed a beam of light at  |
| their vehicle the truck lost power, and they smelled an odor like     |
| antifreeze. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, January 1982, p. 15).         |

| 1982 - A large, disc-shaped UFO was seen by the roadside in Turis,    |
| Spain. It perimeter was revolving and it appeared to be searching the |
| area with beams of light. It rose up and flew away. (Source: Larry    |
| Hatch, U computer database, case 13877, citing APRO Bulletin).        |

| 1989 - A huge disc-shaped UFO was seen in Hubei Province, China. It   |
| illuminated the surrounding landscape a red color, and hung silently  |
| low in the sky for 20 minutes. It then rose to an estimated 100       |
| meters and shot off. (Source: Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1991, p.   |

| 1993 - Several witnesses from San Marcos, Tula, Mexico including      |
| Maria de Lourdes Uribe, age 34, heard bizarre noises and saw          |
| mysterious lights coming from a nearby field at around one o'clock in |
| the morning. A local youth approached the field and saw a huge        |
| glowing object hovering low over the ground. Five humanoid figures    |
| descended from the object and stood around it as if standing guard.   |
| They soon went back inside. Large circular ground traces and what     |
| appeared to be dug out trenches were found at the site. A dog         |
| belonging to one of the witnesses reportedly went missing soon after  |
| the incident. Several days before this incident a huge dark object    |

| 2004 - A man and a woman were walking their dog at around 11:00 p.m.  |
| in Sequin, Texas when they spotted a huge, disc-shaped craft coming   |
| down from the sky. The woman became agitated and began yelling that   |
| there was a loud ringing in her head and she believeed she could hear |
| voices trying to talk to her. The dog also became disturbed and ran   |
| off. Two more discs appeared in the sky, and the man began to cry.    |
|  He later described the UFOs as charcoal gray in color, and ringed    |
| with black lights. All three of the craft appeared to have strange    |
| writing or symbols on their hulls, which the witnesses thought        |
| resembled ancient writing. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |

| 2010 - At 1:24 a.m. in Bedlington, Northumberland, England a 40-foot  |
| across black boomerang shaped object with five green lights           |
| underneath flew overhead at approximately 50 feet. It was a very      |
| close and terrifying encounter, according to the witness. (Source:    |
