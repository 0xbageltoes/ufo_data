| 1954 - On this afternoon two sisters in Norway met the pilot of a     |
| UFO. While picking blueberries in fields around Ceydalen, near        |
| Mosjoen, Norway 24-year-old Edith Jacobsen and her sister, Asta       |
| Solvang, were approached by a man with a tanned complexion and long   |
| hair who smiled and made friendly hand gestures. Curious, they        |
| decided not to run away. The stranger wore a greenish one-piece       |
| coverall, which covered him all the way up to his neck, and they      |
| could not see any buttons or seams. He also wore a very wide belt     |
| around his waist. But what really grabbed their attention was the     |
| man’s long, light brown hair. His eyes were light blue and somewhat   |
| slanted, and his skin was a bronze color. After waving back to the    |
| visitor, they asked who he was. The man extended his hand towards the |
| women but instead of shaking hands he slightly brushed their palms,   |
| and then spoke in a "sing song type manner” and in a language they    |
| could not comprehend, even though both women were fluent in English,  |
| German, and Russian and were knowledgeable in Spanish and French.     |
| “His hands were beautiful,” said one of the women, “with long well    |
| manicured fingers like that of an artist”. The stranger took          |
| something out of his coverall that resembled a pencil and what        |
| appeared to be a piece of paper, when he then proceeded to draw a     |
| central point surrounded by several circles, which seemed to          |
| represent the orbits of the planets within our solar system. After    |
| pointing out the Earth and the moon, the stranger pointed at a        |
| ‘planet’ which the women were unable to distinguish due to their      |
| state of excitement. Moments later he put both items back into his    |
| tunic through a seam that neither woman was able to see. At this      |
| point both women were starting to feel a little concerned, but the    |
| smiling man motioned for them to follow him. Both women obeyed and    |
| soon arrived in a small clearing in which rested a metallic           |
| lenticular-shaped object with a small dome on top. The object         |
| measured some 4 to 5 meters in diameter and was about 1.30 meters in  |
| height, and was grayish-blue in color. As they started to approach    |
| the craft the man motioned for them to step back. He then opened a    |
| hatch at the base of the object and climbed in, and then closed the   |
| hatch. The women then heard a slight whistling sound, and moments     |
| later the object began to rise up into air with a rotating motion.    |
| Once the craft had climbed to about 45 meters it stopped momentarily, |
| and then it increased its rotation, quickly rising up into the sky in |
| a diagonal trajectory and disappearing from sight. The women notified |
| the police after the encounter and according to police officials both |
| women were of sound mind and well respected in the community.         |

| 1955 - At 10:45 p.m. two men on a lake in Kenora, Ontario, Canada saw |
| a saucer-shaped UFO come in front of them, hovering just 40 feet over |
| the water. It was silver white in color, four or five feet across,    |
| and at a distance of less than 75 meters. It slid sideways, hovered   |
| again, tilted on its side, straightened out, then shot away. It       |
| was gone in three seconds, covering 40 degrees of arc in the sky.     |

| 1957 - In Venezuela at 10:30 a.m. ten small discs orbited one huge    |
| disc southwest of Carora, Lara province, and one landed. The rest     |
| engaged in zig-zag maneuvers. (Source: Loren E. Gross, The Fifth      |

| 1957 - In the evening in Quilino, Cordoba, Argentina an Air Force man |
| inside a tent heard a loud, shrill sound and then saw a disc that     |
| descended while grass and plants fluttered wildly underneath it. He   |
| found himself unable to draw his gun, which "seemed to be glued in    |
| its holster." A voice came from inside the craft, telling him in      |
| Spanish that UFOs had a base in the Salta area and would soon show    |
| themselves to warn all people about the dangers of a nuclear          |
| catastrophe.  (Sources: Gordon Creighton, FSR Special Edition #1: The |

| 1959 - The witness and three young girls were sleeping in a station   |
| wagon at Lake Bonita, New Mexico. At around three a.m. they were      |
| awake to see a bright fireball descend and land on the side of the    |
| nearby mountain. Several figures carrying what looked like bright     |
| flashlights emerged from the object and approached their location,    |
| shining beams of light inside their car and illuminating the area     |
| like daylight. The figures then left the area and the witnesses ran   |
| from their vehicle and crawled to the relative safety of a nearby     |
| cabin. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1959,    |

| 1962 - Raimundo Mafra da Silva testified before the police that while |
| working in a field in Duas Pontes, Minas Gerais State, Brazil he saw  |
| two spherical objects hovering just two meters above the ground, only |
| a few meters from his house. One was black with an antenna-like       |
| protrusion and a small tail, and the other was black and white. Both  |
| emitted a humming sound and a flickering flame through an opening.    |
| The boy's father warned him to stay away as his father Rivalino       |
| walked toward the objects, praying. When he was two meters away, the  |
| two spheres merged into one, raising dust from the ground and         |
| spreading a yellow mist that enveloped the man. The boy ran after his |
| father, noting that the cloud had "an acrid smell." As it dissolved,  |
| everything had vanished including his father. The police              |
| investigation, headed by Lieutenant Lisboa, failed to reveal any      |
| clue. Many terrified neighbors left the area at the time because of   |
| this incident. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, September 1962, p. 1; Coral E |

| 1963 - In a wooded area near Rome, Italy a man in a car observed at   |
| 9:32 p.m. an object resembling a plate turned upside down, with a     |
| central turret, flying low over his vehicle. (Source: Jacques Vallee, |

| 1965 - At 3:00 a.m. EDT Mrs. T. E. Schumaker of Mount Airy, North     |
| Carolina was awakened by a loud humming sound and found she could not |
| speak or move for awhile. When she finally was able to reach her      |
| window and look out, she saw a vertical, cigar- shaped, luminous      |
| object. It moved right and left, then back and forth, etc. Ultimately |
| it disappeared behind some trees. The next morning a circle of        |
| crushed grass, four meters in diameter, was found in her yard.        |

| 1965 - At 11:50 a.m. several tourists in Cuzco, Peru, including       |
| Alberto Ugarte and Elwin Voter, observed a strange craft land near    |
| the Inca ruins that they were visiting. The object was a small        |
| silvery disc, only five feet in diameter, and it landed on a terrace  |
| of the Sacsahuaman Inca site. Two luminous dwarfish beings, “of       |
| strange shape and dazzling brightness,” briefly emerged from it. They |
| were also described as having "vertical mouths." They quickly got     |
| back inside into their craft, which then flew off. (Sources: David F. |

| Teresa Ernestina Acuna, were returning to their home in Mar del       |
| Plata, Buenos Aires province, Argentina when they heard a loud        |
| humming sound and saw a reddish glowing, oval-shaped object pass      |
| overhead and land 200 meters away. The object, which was flashing and |
| rotating, brushed the tops of nearby trees in its passage overhead    |
| and, after landing, the Yacobis could see luminous red or violet      |
| figures moving about and examining the craft, as if in some type of   |
| repair activity. After a short while these figures re-entered the     |
| machine, which took off and disappeared within a few seconds. Others  |
| in the neighborhood had seen the object’s passage overhead, and still |
| others had heard the humming noise. Total duration of incident was 30 |
| minutes. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of |

| 1966 - Early in the morning Otto Becker, his son, and daughter-in-law |
| woke up to find their entire house in Heraldsburg, California bathed  |
| in bright light. They next observed a "six-story" tall object at      |
| treetop level sixty meters away. It gave off rainbow colors that      |
| appeared to pour off its edges "like water" in a fantastic display. A |
| distinct engine noise was heard before it took off vertically.        |
| Domestic animals had been greatly disturbed, and the witness had      |
| inflamed eyes for several days. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to  |

| 1966 - Later that day outside of Bozeman, Montana Dan Duggleby was up |
| in the hills with a .22 caliber rifle when he heard a "whooshing"     |
| noise and looked up to see a large rocket-shaped object about 60 feet |
| in diameter and 300 feet tall, which landed close by. An opening      |
| appeared in the side of the cylinder and a ramp slid out, and five    |
| robotic metal "boxes" with small wheels on the bottoms and four       |
| "arms" on the sides came down the ramp. One took ground samples,      |
| while three of the others took air, grass, and flower samples and the |
| last one "just stood there." When finished they rolled back up the    |
| ramp, the ramp slid in, and the ship took off straight up and         |
| vanished in the fog. The witness had seen disc-like UFOs on many      |
| previous occasions. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:    |

| 1966 - In Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil a woman called the police   |
| to report a luminous object rising and descending on top of a high    |
| hill. When policemen climbed to the site they found the bodies of two |
| men, electronic technicians Pereira da Cruz and Viana. The bodies     |

| 1970 - At 6:30 a.m. several young boys in Bukit Mertajam, Penang      |
| province, Malaysia encountered a round blue object on the ground, and |
| several three inch tall ugly humanoids stood around the object. One   |
| of the humanoids took out an object resembling a gun and shot one of  |
| the boys on his hand when the boy attempted to grab him. The boys ran |
| to get their teachers but upon returning to the site the object and   |
| the creatures were gone. Later that same day the same young witness   |
| from the previous day encountered a small UFO on the ground near the  |
| school compound. Five three-inch tall humanoids emerged from the      |
| object. One of them, who appeared to be the leader, wore a yellow     |
| uniform and had two horn-like protrusions on his head. The other four |
| wore blue uniforms. The leader pointed a weapon at the witness and    |
| shot at him. The witness blacked out and was found later lying in the |
| bushes. He regained consciousness later, and a small red dot appeared |
| on his leg where he had been shot by the creature. Two other boys in  |
| the same village went out looking for the reported small UFO and      |
| spotted two tiny men among some bushes. One was on a rock and the     |
| other on a tree branch. Both figures were dressed in yellow suits,    |
| and one had only one arm and appeared to be holding a small gun. The  |
| boys attempted to capture the entities but they got away. That        |
| evening the young son of a local high-ranking police official was     |
| returning from school when he saw two tiny figures hiding in the      |
| bushes near the school compound. As he tried to capture them he was   |
| shot in the hand and received a small cut. (Source: Albert S.         |

| 1974 - Driving on Route 43 near Derry, New Hampshire at 9:30 p.m. Joe |
| Recupero saw an object through his windshield that was moving from    |
| east to west, approximately 300 yards distant, and as "big as a       |
| house." It was white in color, fuzzy and bright as the sun, and was   |
| followed by several smaller objects. It moved into some trees along   |
| the highway between Exits 4 and 5, so he pulled off the road, got     |
| out, and began looking for it. After searching for several            |
| minutes, he suddenly spotted two small "mummy like" figures in the    |
| woods, some 40 yards distant. Alarmed, he got back into his car and   |
| drove off. The entire incident lasted one hour, although the mummy    |
| figures were only seen briefly. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted          |

| 1992 - A sequence of multi-witness sightings occurred in Pittsford,   |
| Monroe County, New York that lasted for an hour and a half, beginning |
| at 10:00 p.m. The first sighting was of a band of arcade-like rolling |
| front lights and three distinctly large lights, with small red lights |
| at the center rear. The object was estimated to be at 1,200 feet      |
| altitude, larger than a Boeing-747, and moving slowly at about 60     |
| mph. Several witnesses called MUFON field investigator George Hoenig, |
| who took photographs of a "stack of dishes" rotating and tumbling,    |
| with streaks of light darting about. Two women had a close encounter  |
| with two boomerang-shaped objects with a fat center. The              |
| objects stayed the same distance apart and had ten lights each. At    |
| first they moved at a steady, slow pace, but then they accelerated as |
| they went over. They made no sound. (Sources: Donald M. Ware, MUFON   |

| 1993 - A woman in Baca Chalets, Saguache County in the San Luis       |
| Valley, Colorado had been watching late night television around one   |
| o'clock in the morning and had just turned off the light when she     |
| heard noises coming from the kitchen. She called out but got no       |
| response. Puzzled, she went to bed and turned off the light. Just as  |
| her eyes were getting accustomed to the dark, ten or twelve three and |
| a half to four foot tall creatures glided into the room in a tight    |
| group, and came to stand less than three feet from where she lay. She |
| sat up in amazement, staring at them. When they first came in she     |
| thought she could see right through them, but as they got into the    |
| room they became solid. The beings clustered around the foot of her   |
| bed, looking at her. She felt the entities, were "cold, and           |
| completely indifferent, maybe a little curious." They were small and  |
| slight and had huge almond-shaped eyes. Sleeping next to her was her  |
| five-year old son. She suddenly thought of the boy and became afraid, |
| thinking, "they are here because of him!" She then forcefully told    |
| them to leave. The beings then silently glided out the wall, they way |
| they came in. That same night a neighbor reported feeling a presence  |
| and seeing peculiar shadows in his bedroom, about two hours earlier.  |

| 1996 - At 2:15 a.m. a teenage girl witnessed a metallic, disc-shaped  |
| object hovering above a group of nearby power lines in her backyard   |
| in West Manchester, Ohio. The round bottom of the craft appeared to   |
| be gold in color, and it had orange, green, and reddish-orange        |
| lights. A series of rectangular windows were around the middle        |
| portion of the craft. One window in the center appeared to be moved   |
| down by somebody inside the craft, while at the same time the girl    |
| had a strong feeling that she was being watched. After viewing the    |
| object for about five minutes, it zig-zagged and shot up into the     |
| sky. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1996, case |

| any commercial airliner. The witness viewed the object through        |
| binoculars. It had three lights with one located at each apex. The    |
| UFO tilted to the west and levelled off. The object stayed in sight   |
| for 3 minutes, and then completely vanished right in front of them in |

| 2006 - There were unexplained UFO reports from Nova Scotia, Ontario   |
| and Alberta, Canada on this day. At 1:00 a.m. in Edmonton, Alberta    |
| rotating lights were seen on a white polygon UFO, which moved rapidly |
| through the sky. In Windsor, Ontario at 2:00 a.m. there was a close   |
| encounter with a floating, silver, triangle-shaped object, moving     |
| side to side. It hovered for awhile, then moved away. The sighting    |
| lasted five minutes. At 8:00 p.m. in Sault Ste. Marie,                |
| Ontario witnesses sighted a silvery round UFO reflecting sunlight. It |
| hovered, then took off at a high rate of speed. Next, it stopped      |
| abruptly, moved back towards the witnesses, and finally moved away.   |
| At 11:30 p.m. in New Victoria, Nova Scotia multiple independent       |
| people observed large lights in the sky. They hovered and moved side  |
| to side. At one point, they seemed to follow some of the witnesses.   |
