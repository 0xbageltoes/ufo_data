| 1909 - On this night in Anderlues, Belgium a teacher sighted a        |
| 25-meter in diameter sphere glide down a road, and then turn and go   |
| down a small path. (Source: SOBEPS, case 163).                        |

| 1942 - At around 2:30 a.m. on this night in Los Angeles County,       |
| California a formation of 6-9 luminous white balls of light flying in |
| a triangular formation flew in from the northwest, moving very        |
| slowly. They also appeared as steady radar blips coming in from the   |
| sea. As they flew over aircraft factories and this was shortly after  |
| the United States entry into World War II, widespread panic resulted, |
| and five people were killed by the anti-aircraft fire hitting the     |
| ground and in subsequent traffic accidents. In the evening in Santa   |
| Monica, California a white disc was sighted hovering high in the sky. |

| the Los Alamos nuclear facility. It was silver colored and was        |
| flashing, and had tapered ends. The object flew slowly and then sped  |
| up, fluttered and oscillated, and changed course. The observations by |
| the various individuals lasted from three seconds up to two minutes.  |

| walking home at 9:15 p.m. near some railroad tracks when they spotted |
| a 9-12-foot diameter disc hovering over their road. The UFO had two   |
| headlights. Three little men, who wore large headgear and one-piece   |
| coverall suits that had a luminous band across the chest, were seen   |
| nearby. There was also a tall being about six feet in height. The     |
| women ran and the UFO gave chase. Traces were found at the sight.     |

| 1967 - At 7:02 p.m. in Minneapolis, Minnesota seven people sighted    |
| three "brushed aluminum" disc-shaped objects with a row of lights or  |
| ports around the center of each. The objects banked into a turn,      |
| whereupon the lead disc glowed red one time, appearing like molten    |
| iron, then the glow diminished. The three objects banked into         |
| the turn in unison. (Sources: NICAP case files; APRO Bulletin,        |

| 1967 - In Sioux City, Iowa at 5:25 p.m., Fargo, North Dakota at 7:50  |
| p.m., and Syracuse, New York at 6:05 p.m. UFO photographs were taken  |
| of nocturnal lights. In Fargo two teenagers took two Polaroid photos  |
| of a round, possibly disc-shaped UFOs, entirely lit with a plain      |
| bright light. The UFOs flew up from a low altitude at a 30-degree     |
| angle, sped up, and then flew off quickly toward the northeast.       |

| for 5 minutes. Its pointed bottom descended and extended what looked  |
| like a wire. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, November 1974).          |

| 1976 - The first humanoid report on this day occurred in Kettering,   |
| Tasmania. A glowing, domed object landed on the beach at 1:00 a.m.,   |
| making a humming noise. Beings were seen through the windows in the   |
| craft. The domed disc made a louder noise as it took off, and flew    |
| away toward the east. Later that night numerous witnesses in Maydena, |
| Tasmania, sighted two orange lights. They flew toward the southwest   |
| at a speed less than 100 mph. (Sources: Bill Chalker, The Oz Files,   |

| 1976 - In Maneru, Spain at 4:00 p.m. five school children saw a UFO   |
| descend and land in a nearby field. The UFO was 8-10 meters wide, and |
| had a transparent dome. A two-meter tall being emerged dressed in a   |
| black coverall suit. The figure took a few steps through the field of |
| barley, and then returned to the craft, and took off. There were      |

| same evening, while driving by on the highway a woman caught sight of |
| two eight-foot tall beings standing about fifteen feet from the       |

| flashed across her face. She drove away in fear, and she continued to |

| 23-year old man, R. Pennington, heard an explosion mixed with a       |
| whining noise, and then saw a 20-foot wide disc with a transparent    |
| dome on top out of his truck window. The trajectory of the UFO        |

| 1981 - An Aeroflot YAK-40 airliner flying northwest of Tallinn,       |
| Estonia was paced by two orange, elongated objects at 9:24 p.m. The   |
| UFOs flew parallel to the plane and then approached from 70 degrees   |
| to the right. The crew saw four orange lights on the first object and |
| 3 lights on the other one. After three minutes the first object       |
| executed a turn to the right, then to the left. The second object     |
| repeated the maneuver and followed after the first some six to eight  |
| minutes later. (Source: Richard F. Haines, Project Delta: A Study of  |
