| 1959 - Three Adelaide, South Australia children reported having seen  |
| strange objects moving about in the sky. Neil Abercrombie, his        |
| mother, brother, and some other friends, all saw a strange object at  |
| 6:05 p.m. He described it as an "elongated circle with indistinct     |
| edges" and said it had been flying quite high. Two other nearby       |
| residents saw a round object with red flashing lights at about 7:50   |
| p.m. They said the object circled and disappeared in the west,        |
| appearing to be smaller than a plane. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the |
| Southern Hemisphere, London: Robert Hale, 1975, p. 165).              |

| 1959 - Later that same evening the Adelaide Weather Bureau received a |
| report of a UFO at about eight p.m. from Goolwa, near Port Elliott,   |
| South Australia. And at 11:30 p.m. a young man spotted a              |
| reddish-orange oval-shaped object on the ground about 100 meters from |
| the rural road he was driving on. Barry Neale, age 15, was driving    |
| home between Goolwa and Port Elliot, South Australia when he saw the  |
| glowing, reddish-orange object on the ground. It had a row of 8 or 9  |
| portholes, was about five meters (16 feet) wide, and it illuminated   |
| the trees. He drove around the wooded area in time to see it take     |
| off. "It climbed at an angle of 45 degrees towards Hindmarsh Island   |
| and soon disappeared." No radioactivity was found at the spot.        |

| 1965 - An aerial explosion, perhaps similar to the Tunguska blast of  |
| 1909, affected an area of nearly a million square kilometers,         |
| centered over Ashcroft, Canada and was observed some distance away by |
| an airborne airliner pilot, according to John Colombo. (Source: John  |

| 1966 - At 2:00 a.m. a cluster of lights ahead over the road in        |
| Vicksburg, Michigan resolved itself into a lighted disc-shaped object |
| when the witnesses' car got closer. Mr. Udvardy, age 32, heard a low  |
| hum like a swarm of bees, and his car engine stalled. The UFO also    |
| had a brilliant white searchlight. (Sources: NICAP case investigation |

| 1966 - In San Francisco, California two women observed a large object |
| with a pulsating bluish light on top, an orange light below, windows, |
| and antennae, resting in a construction area at 6:00 a.m. Silhouettes |
| could be seen moving about inside, one of them gesturing as the craft |
| took off. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of  |

| 1966 - Charles Kozens, age 13, saw two objects land near Hamilton,    |
| Ontario, Canada at 9:15 p.m. They were each 2.5 meters long, 1.2      |
| meters high, and had flashing lights. When he approached and tried to |
| touch an antenna on one of the objects, he received an electric       |
| shock. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of     |

| 1967 - Three strange objects--a bright, orange light emitting a       |
| shower of green sparks, and two smaller sources--were seen in a field |
| in Hanley, England. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A   |
| Century of Landings, case 830).                                       |

| 1967 - Carol Watts had the first of a number of alleged contacts with |
| aliens at 10:30 p.m. in Wellington, Texas. He saw a 100 foot long     |
| cigar-shaped UFO on the ground. A door opened and Watts was invited   |
| to come inside by the occupants and he agreed to go. They gave him a  |
| physical exam and took him on a flight into space. He recalled seeing |
| an unidentified map on the wall inside the craft. The encounter with  |
| journey lasted no more than 20 minutes. (Sources: NICAP case          |

| 1969 - As many as two hundred residents of of the Coenze neighborhood |
| in Nova Iguaca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil witnessed the descent of a     |
| "mystery airplane" on Maxambona Hill in the middle of the afternoon.  |
| It fell from the sky, falling in an unusually slow manner, in an      |
| apparent controlled descent. Among the many witnesses was an elderly  |
| man and his children. He told the children to go immediately to the   |
| landing site to assist any possible survivors. As he watched hundreds |
| of townspeople converging on the hill, he saw two beings come out of  |
| the craft. The craft itself seemed to be slowly "moving like a wing"  |
| that was shifting slightly in the wind. When the first people neared  |
| the site the object and its occupants vanished abruptly, and nothing  |
| was to be found at the "crash" site. No one heard any engine noise as |
| the craft descended, and investigations at the site by the military   |
| police found no wreckage. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,    |

| 1974 - On this day on the Robertson farm in Callaway, Nebraska a dead |
| mutilated cow and calf were found. The tails had been removed, the    |
| blood drained, and the cow's udder had been slit. (Source: Omaha      |

| 1974 - A small disc less than a meter in diameter hovered and spun at |
| treetop level over some trees in Tarragona, Spain at 4:00 p.m. The    |
| limbs of the trees were thrashed about by a turbulence from the       |
| object, and a big noise was heard. The disc flew off to the south.    |

| 1974 - At 8:00 p.m. a "small bus" shaped object was seen in           |
| Valensole, France. It had large wide windows and a blue-green neon    |
| glow, and figures could be seen moving around inside it. The          |
| principal witness, his wife, his son, and an 80-year-old woman all    |
| saw the craft, and above it were seven vertical red lights. The       |
| object appeared to be on the ground. From the house of the wife's     |
| parents, at 8:30 p.m. the man saw it again, and was able to approach, |
| first in his car and then on foot, to within 500 yards of it.         |
| Valensole is the site of a famous July 1965 humanoid encounter, and   |
| there have been many other close encounters from this location as     |
| well. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid    |

| 1975 - At 3:30 a.m. the furious barking of her dogs awoke a woman in  |
| St. Hilaire de Cambrai, France. Frightened, the dogs ran and jumped   |
| onto the top of the dining room table. The woman opened the curtains  |
| and saw a red glow outside and then heard strange, indistinct murmurs |
| and voices. Her son-in-law woke up and looked out a window to see an  |
| intensely red rectangular mass about 4.5 meters long and two meters   |
| high. It flew half a meter above the ground in a strange hopping      |
| motion. It continued on its trajectory, becoming round and            |
| greenish-blue in color. Two other family member joined the first two  |
| and watched the object move about 80 meters away, now becoming a      |
| green spherical form. The dogs calmed down and so the son-in-law went |
| back to bed. Soon the intensity of the sphere lessened, while the     |
| remaining witnesses remained watching out a window for the next half  |
| hour. At 4:00 a.m. the streetlights brightened and the dogs began     |
| barking again. At this point the UFO, now a green sphere, approached  |
| the house rapidly and then disappeared. One of the witnesses suffered |
| from eye irritation the next day. Ground traces and "footprints" were |
| found in the vicinity of the house. (Source: Michel Figuet &          |

| 1975 - Nine hours later, at 9:00 p.m. local time, a merchant in Japan |
| felt a strange urge to go out for a walk on the beach. Guchi Shinda,  |
| age 42, went for this walk along the beach in Kawanoe City, Shikoku   |
| Province, Japan when he started to experience a sensation of          |
| weightlessness and saw what looked like multicolored electrical       |
| discharges around him. Suddenly, about 30 meters away, a short white  |
| creature appeared. The being had red eyes and a mouth and was wearing |
| a white inflated "astronaut" suit and a round white helmet. It        |
| floated just above the sand, looking towards the witness who heard a  |
| loud sound resembling "electronic music." He apparently passed out    |
| and did not see the humanoid depart. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,      |

| 1990 - Two teenagers driving in Gulf Breeze, Florida had approached a |
| stop light at 9:30 p.m. when they saw a UFO over a nearby building.   |
| The object hovered briefly, moved slowly overhead, and then ascended  |
| out of sight. Minutes later a retired FAA air traffic controller also |
| sighted the object in the distance. (Source: MUFON case investigation |

| 1993 - Kadima, Israel - The neighbor of the UFO witness from the       |
| previous night felt her house tremble during the night. When she      |
| opened her eyes she saw "a bald giant, 7 to 8 feet tall, with round,  |
| yellow eyes and a small flat nose, dressed in gray metallic overalls" |
| standing next to her bed. "Don't be afraid. I will not harm you," she |
| heard in her mind as she saw the being gliding through the room. The  |
| next morning, two additional flattened circles were found in the      |
| field, eleven and twenty feet in diameter. (Source: Albert S.         |
