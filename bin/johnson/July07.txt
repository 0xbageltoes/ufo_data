| twenty to thirty feet long, crescent-shaped, and flying at an         |
| estimated 1,000 feet altitude. It circled in the east for about 30    |
| seconds. The photograph quality was sharp and clear, although the     |
| reproduction below is from the newspaper that first published it and  |
| suffers from deterioration in quality due to age and print technique. |

| 1967 - At 3:00 a.m. an intense light coming from their patio had      |
| awakened the daughter of the Count de Ribas on the Mediterranean      |
| island of Palma de Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. From her window  |
| she saw two small figures apparently speaking to each other. They had |
| very large heads, possibly due to the presence of helmets, and huge   |
| eyes. The witness tried turning on the lights but they did not work.  |
| She then went to get candles and when she returned both beings and    |
| the light had vanished. Two small marks on the outside of the wall    |
| were found that could only be removed by scraping the wall; after it  |
| had been painted, the marks reappeared. (Source: David F. Webb and    |

| house. The men proceeded to put on orange belts. A circular,          |
| bell-shaped shining object descended from the sky to within two feet  |
| of the ground. It was about 90 feet in diameter, and it changed       |
| rapidly in color from orange to blue to white. It put down a small    |
| staircase and the two men entered the object. It then took off and    |
| vanished into the sky "at an impressive speed." (Source: David F.     |

| 1977 - Zhang Po, China - Three thousand residents of Zhang Po, China   |
| saw two huge, orange-colored UFOs descend from the sky during the     |
| showing of an outdoor movie. Eyewitnesses heard a humming sound and   |
| felt heat emanating from the objects, which maneuvered just above the |
