| 1929 - Levis Brosseau, age 20, was riding home in Fermeneuve, Quebec  |
| on horseback at 11:00 p.m. when he saw a dark object with a yellow    |
| light landed on the ground. His horse became very nervous. The object |
| was estimated to be 15 meters in diameter and 5 meters high, and he   |
| witnessed four or five dwarfish figures running back and forth within |
| 6 meters of the object. He heard their sharp, childlike voices. The   |
| dark object then took off with a machine-like sound and rush of air.  |

| 1957 - At 7:30 p.m. in Milano, Italy Mr. G. U. Donadio, a translator  |
| for export-import firm, sighted a UFO as "big as a hen's egg" that    |
| flew very fast, zigzagged, hovered and revolved, then shot straight   |
| up and away after 17 minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook |

| 1958 - near Le Brusc, France - Three fishermen had gone to sea on the  |
| Mediterranean Sea at night to set their nets. It was a very clear,    |
| starry night, and the sea was calm. A big orange-colored ball of      |
| light descended very quickly towards the sea, and soon it became a    |
| great big globe lying on the surface of the water. "Just lightly      |
| touching the waves it remained there for several minutes, but we had  |
| the impression that it was revolving, like a wheel turning round and  |
| round on the same place." It caused a strong air disturbance for they |
| could see the water being whipped up around it. The ball came rolling |
| toward the fishermen's boat, and they were terrified that it would    |
| collide with them. It didn't in fact go over them but passed very     |
| close by, making such big waves that they nearly capsized. They felt  |
| a powerful blast of heat and a strong blast of air. As it went by it  |
| made a faint humming noise. Comparing it to their boat, it seemed to  |
| be about 4 meters in diameter. Moving along by leaps,                 |
| half-disappearing among the waves, it made a right-hand turn and      |
| disappeared on the horizon. (Sources: FSR Case Histories, April 1973, |

| 1964 - Police Chief Richard Crawford of Elmore, Ohio spotted a        |
| bright, motionless blinking object emitting multi-colored lights near |
| the intersection of Route 51 and Nissen Road at 10:15 p.m. Some kind  |
| of halo surrounded it. After about 20 minutes a spotlight was aimed   |
| at the object, and it went away. It was again seen at the local       |
| school half an hour before midnight, at an altitude of about 1000     |
| feet, flying at a good speed to the northwest, toward the town of     |
| Genoa. It made the sound of a bullet flying by one's ear. Crawford    |
| radioed another policeman and asked him to meet him at a certain      |
| point. The other officer arrived there first, and witnessed the       |
| object giving off bursts of light once per second. It took off again  |
| when Crawford arrived, changed course at high speed, and was lost to  |
| sight in a few seconds. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Challenge to         |

| 1974 - On this day a UFO with bouncing movements, or "a bobbing up    |
| and down" hovered over tree tops near Grantham, North Carolina for 20 |
| minutes. The craft had windows and a row of lights estimated to be    |
| about 15 feet long. It also made a whirring noise. (Sources: George   |

| 1975 - A diamond shaped object landed on a gravel road in a           |
| mountainous area of Big Chimney, West Virginia shortly before 10:00   |
| p.m. It was witnessed by four members of the Crichfield family. Four  |
| landing gear imprints were found at the site. (Sources: Center for    |

| 1977 - In Bardney, England this afternoon a group of boarding school  |
| boys, concealed on the opposite side of a hedge, saw a black "stick   |
| man" with a round, featureless head, "jolting" along about 150 meters |
| away. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of   |

| 1977 - A man would had just been laid off work was attending a       |
| meeting of his colleagues in Crystal Lake, Illinois to discuss the    |
| matter. During the course of the meeting he'd had half a dozen beers. |
| About 11 p.m. he left the hotel for some fresh air. Outside he        |
| immediately saw approaching him three small figures emerging from an  |
| alley adjacent to the hotel. His first thought was that they were     |
| coming for him, but he noticed a fourth being lying directly in front |
| of him on the ground, only a few yards away. It was doubled up, with  |
| its back toward him, as if injured. He also noticed a strange absence |
| of sound, in that he was unable to hear any traffic sounds coming     |
| from the street. The beings were about 4 feet 10 inches tall, with    |
| small, slender bodies and large baldheads. They were wearing glass    |
| fish bowl-type helmets, with a metallic band attached from the        |
| helmets to their uniforms. The uniforms were tight one-piece suits of |
| a dark green color, with a metallic luster. The only facial feature   |
| he could see through the helmet were two large, round, luminous eyes. |
| They lifted the prone colleague and carried him off toward the alley. |
| Throughout the encounter he felt no fear--he had the feeling, in      |
| fact, that they had somehow informed him they would not harm him. He  |
| made a report to the police, and he told his friends but was laughed  |
| at. (Source: Center for UFO Studies files, report by Douwe Goaga      |
| dated February 8, 1978).                                              |

| 1979 - Pine Ridge, South Carolina. Members of a rock band practicing  |
| in a barn stepped outside to watch an unusual form hovering low over  |
| the containment building and smokestack of the Carolina Power & Light |
| nuclear power plant one half mile away to their northeast. An ovoid   |
| shaped object, seen primarily by its lights in the clear dusk sky,    |
| had two huge bright yellowish-white beams of light. After hovering    |
| motionless for 2-5 minutes all the lights faded except a blue light.  |
| The UFO moved off and was gone in "three blinks of the eye." After    |
| about five minutes, a second sighting took place. It hovered to the   |
| right of the nuclear power plant and directed a beam of light at it   |
| while hovering for another 2-5 minutes. The second object flew off    |
| toward the northwest. No one at the power plant reported seeing       |
| anything unusual to the chief of security. (Source: International UFO |

| 1981 - Robert Gomez, a vacuum truck driver, was headed west on        |
| highway FR 665 toward Alice, Texas after finishing a job. His vehicle |
| had about 165 gallons of water in the tank and no pressure. At 2:10   |
| p.m. he saw a bright object in the sky that he first thought was an   |
| airplane. It increased in brightness and stopped in midair. The       |
| object was domed disc-shaped, brilliant white in color and with a     |
| dark ring around the rim and another dark ring around its center.     |
| Gomez felt the truck slowing down and tried to accelerate. The        |
| truck's exhaust stacks were blowing smoke, but the truck had          |
| apparently been lifted a foot off the ground. Although his AM radio   |
| quit working, his CB radio was still working, so he reported what was |
| happening to his dispatcher. Shortly later the UFO disappeared into   |
| the clouds. Smoke was discovered coming out of the water tank valve,  |
| which now showed 55 pounds of pressure on the gauge. He opened the    |
| valve to drain the remaining water, but only steam came out.          |

| 1994 - A hexagon-shaped object circled by lights had four square      |
| portholes on its bottom, was seen at 8:40 p.m. in St. Usuges, France. |
| It flew away toward the north. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue  |

| size of a football field landed in the city. Jet interceptor aircraft |
| were scrambled from Anapolis AFB in response to the reports, but did  |
| not arrive in time. At 10:30 a.m. in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts a      |
| silver, metallic object was seen hovering at approximately a mile to  |
| a mile and a half altitude, from Route 20 eastbound. At noon a gray   |
| object with a black dot in the center was seen moving very slowly     |
| across the sky in Melbourne, Victoria. In Adelaide, South Australia   |
| four men sitting outside saw a bright blue light appear from nowhere. |
| It was long and large, and moved level for 15 seconds toward the      |
| east, with a flame visible from the tail section. It vanished from    |
| view. (Sources: MUFON UFO Journal, July 1999, p. 15; UFO Magazine     |
