| 1965 - In Welshpool, Victoria, Australia a yellow zig-zagging light   |
| was seen maneuvering in the sky; it stopped for 2-3 minutes           |
| intermittently, then rose vertically and vanished. At Margaret Brock  |
| Lighthouse in South Australia a disc-shaped, brightly lit object      |
| moved slowly about the clouds. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the |

| 1965 - At 1:00 a.m. three blue discs flew from north to south very    |
| fast over the El Toreno oil field in Barinas province, Venezuela.     |

| 1967 - At 10:45 p.m. a man and his daughter in Butler, Pennsylvania   |
| saw two lights that they thought were landing lights on an aircraft,  |
| but they came to ground level and flew straight toward the car, then  |
| suddenly vanished. At the same time, five figures appeared about      |
| three meters away. They had narrow, pointed noses, mouths and eyes    |
| like slits, blond hair, rough skin, and were dressed in loose         |
| "hunterlike" clothes. Witnesses drove away as fast as they could.     |
| (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings,  |
| case 826).                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - Mrs. Vandervoort, who was living outside the village of        |
| Tarcienne, Belgium, went outdoors at 7:15 p.m. to close her shutters. |
| She saw a white light pass over the roof of the nearest house some    |
| 100 meters away. The UFO approached silently from the direction of    |
| the nearby woods and moved toward the east. In the next hour, at      |
| intervals of some minutes apart, she saw a total of 25 similar lights |
| or objects fly over at only 10 to 15 meters above the trees, moving   |
| very fast. With the aid of a telescope she observed in the front of   |
| one of these objects a "man" standing. He was handling a "board" and  |
| was just a "tiny" figure but "of great height." He held one arm       |
| straight up. The witness reportedly took photos of some of the        |
| lights. "It was impressive," she was quoted as saying, insisting they |
| were not normal aircraft. She said she was familiar with aircraft     |
| because there is a Belgian Air Force Base northeast of her locale.    |

| 1974 - At 11:10 a.m. a man saw a strange object come from the sky and |
| fall into a valley in El Campillo, Sevilla, Spain. He drove to the    |
| site and walked into the valley, where he saw a 200-meter-long,       |
| cigar-shaped object. Two smaller objects then entered it, but a third |
| object, shaped like two oval spheres with cupolas on both top and     |
| bottom, began to chase him. He got in his car and was able to escape, |
| but noticed heavy static on his car's radio as he drove away.         |

| 1974 - Becky Ingram, age 14, heard "voices" in her head several times |
| beginning on March 9th. On this afternoon she compulsively walked out |
| into the center of her school football field in Lewisburg, Tennessee  |
| instead of taking the school bus home. Although she recalls seeing    |
| nothing in the field, she next remembers finding herself inside a     |
| brightly lit room as a ramped door closed behind her. She was         |
| confronted by two small humanoid entities, shorter than her. They had |
| blond, short cropped hair and later identified themselves as "Alton"  |
| and "Tombo." Becky was instructed to lie on a hospital-like bed where |
| she was examined by a gloved implement that was passed over her. She  |
| was taken for an hour's trip "to Australia" and then returned. She    |
| felt weak and sleepy, and for several weeks after this incident she   |
| was extremely fatigued and suffered from headaches and other physical |
| symptoms. She had two more experiences over the next four months.     |

| 1977 - On this night a husband and wife were in a pair of sleeping    |
| bags by the seashore in Pebble Beach, California when they saw a      |
| bright disc-shaped object come from the ocean straight towards them.  |
| The woman had a brief recollection of seeing several tall humanoids   |
| without mouths, who communicated with her telepathically and showed   |
| her a book. She later recalled that the craft was flat, streamlined,  |
| and black in color. A beam of light was shone on the couple and       |
| apparently took them inside the UFO. The eyes of the aliens were      |
| reportedly black and shiny but rounded towards the nose and did not   |
| blink. The aliens were about six and a half to seven feet, thin, with |
| delicate bodies, and very long fingers. They wore skintight one-piece |
| diver outfits like wetsuits. Their heads were completely hairless.    |
| The inside of the craft resembled a doctor's office: it was very      |
| bright white and warm. The wife was made to lie on a very cold table, |
| where she was strapped down and observed many instruments, one of     |
| which made a buzzing sound. The woman had been involved in previous   |
| close encounter incidents. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |

| 1993 - Ziporet Carmel woke up earlier than usual and went to her      |
| kitchen in Kadima, Israel at 6:30 a.m. When she got there she noticed |
| the room was bathed in a strange light. She went to check the grounds |
| and when she walked around a storage shed she noticed what looked     |
| like a large fruit silo in a nearby field. As she took a closer look  |
| she noticed that the silver silo-like object was square in shape. It  |
| had 18 square glowing windows along its side. Five huge beams of      |
| powerful light shone from the top into the sky. Then, what appeared   |
| to be a second storey to the object materialized, doubling its size.  |
| A seven-foot tall man figure appeared near the object. Dogs in the    |
| area reacted with furious barking upon catching sight of the figure.  |
| The being wore a metallic coverall and sombrero-shaped headgear with  |
| a veil that completely covered the face. The witness and the entity   |
| stared at each other for about 30 seconds. Ms. Ziporet then quietly   |
| whispered "Why don't you take off your hat so I can see your face."   |
| She then heard a clear voice inside her head that spoke in Hebrew,    |
| telling her, "That's how things were." The witness then felt          |
| strangely compelled to go back to her kitchen. Later during a search  |
| of the field numerous ground traces were found, including an unknown  |
| smelly substance that made people nauseous. (Source: Albert S.        |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1993, case # 2003, citing Barry    |
| Chamish, UFO Universe, Spring 1995).                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1993 - At five o'clock in the morning Mr. Julio Chagala was sleeping  |
| in his home in Catemaco, Mexico when he was suddenly awakened by a    |
| bright blue light that entered his room through a window. Everything  |
| seemed to become very still and his surroundings were enveloped in    |
| that strange blue light. Looking out a window he saw a gold colored   |
| disc-shaped object, about 15 meters in diameter, land on a nearby     |
| field. The craft was totally silent when it came down. A hatch opened |
| and several very large figures exited. They were about 2.5 meters in  |
| height but human in proportions, and they wore tight-fitting silvery  |
| diver's suits. They had long arms, pale complexions, large blue       |
| slanted eyes, and long golden-blond hair.                             |
|                                                                       |
| Mr. Chagala had by this time walked outside and approached the craft. |
| The visitors saluted him with gloved hands, waving and then gesturing |
| for him to enter the craft. Once inside he noticed that the humanoids |
| had long pointed ears. He also saw numerous consoles and what         |
| appeared to be comfortable seats, he also saw a metallic table with   |
| several different instruments. One of the humanoids showed him a      |
| screen where he saw scenes of war, destruction, and ecological        |
| collapse. The craft had taken off and soon landed in an strange       |
| beautiful city, filled with humans of all ages. A large golden sun    |
| illuminated the city. He was taken to a crystalline waterfall that    |
| was surrounded by lovely colored stones. There the humanoids          |
| explained to Mr. Chagala that his destiny was to heal and care for    |
| his fellow man. He was also told that the aliens had several bases in |
| the area, including one at the Ixtamalapan Lagoon. Chagala was warned |
| of a different kind of humanoid that also visited the Earth, and      |
| these were the ones responsible for the reported animal mutilations.  |
| His hosts described them as the short, large-headed humanoids with    |
| huge black eyes, four fingered hands and protruding stomachs. They    |
| typically wore tight-fitting maroon outfits and traveled in small     |
| flying craft with ball-shaped landing gear. Mr. Chagala was           |
| eventually returned home. He experienced a drastic weight loss after  |
| the incident but recovered. Other local residents reported low-flying |
| lights over the area about same time as his encounter. Currently Mr.  |
| Chagala is a known healer that uses natural herbs and remedies.       |
