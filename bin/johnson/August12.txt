| 1975 - At 9:30 p.m. J. P. Brassen watched an oval-shaped craft rise   |
| from the sea and land on the beach in Sanary, Var department, France. |
| An oval door opened, and luminous orange beams of light shot out      |
| while at the same time he heard a loud hissing sound. Two short       |
| humanoids are seen moving around the craft on the ground. The         |
| humanoids reportedly had three legs, were very thin and were covered  |
| with what appeared to be a shell-like material. They moved around in  |
| small jumps and were only 70 cm in height. The witness fled the area. |

| humanoids resembling robots exited the object and proceeded to        |
| collect shrubs and rocks. The youths fled the area and notified some  |
| nearby military units, however they failed to find anything. Later    |
| one of the witnesses, Joao Lira, decided to return to the scene and   |
| saw the same object on the ground. When he approached it he suddenly  |
| felt dizzy and passed out. He was found three hours later next to the |
| lagoon, shirtless, sweating, and with partial amnesia. (Source:       |
