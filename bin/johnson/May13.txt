| 1909 - There were several independent witnesses of a brightly         |
| illuminated, 80 to 100 foot long, dark airship, flying over King's    |
| Lynn, Norfolk, England at 9:45 p.m. Two men were visible in some sort |
| of carriage underneath the object. The object travelled fast, made a  |
| whirring sound, and had a searchlight that lit up the road below it.  |

| 1949 - In 1949 on this day at 11:05 a.m. a U.S. Air Force Airman Smith,      |
| driving along Highway 20 west of Boise, Idaho spotted first one disc, |
| then five more silver discs flying in a V formation. The objects      |
| spiralled down, then shot out and away to the southwest at an         |
| estimated 700 kilometers per hour. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A   |

| 1952 - On this morning a cigar-shaped object flew back and forth in   |
| the sky several times over the town of Alcobaca, Portugal before      |
| "blowing up." Over the town of Santarem, Portugal a dazzingly         |
| brilliant sphere that left a vapor trail was observed for several     |
| minutes. Later that evening at 7:20 p.m. two orange balls of light    |
| were sighted over the shoreline of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. One of the  |
| object hovered while the second object darted out and back. (Sources: |

| 1952 - At 3:15 a.m PST an F9F pilot taking off from El Centro Naval   |
| Air Station, California saw what appeared to be a shooting star       |
| diving at an angle of 60 degrees. At around the same time the El      |
| Centro's Sheriff's Office received reports of five "flying saucers"   |
| as large as B-36's with a light underneath. They disappeared to the   |
| southwest at terrific speed. All together there were four separate    |
| reports of UFOs in the El Centro area on this date. (Source: Project  |

| 1952 - At 10:33 p.m. EST in Greenville, South Carolina James          |
| Richardson and three other amateur astronomers set up telescopes in a |
| dark area of Furman University, when they saw a box or diamond        |
| formation of four oval dull glowing, reddish object nearly overhead.  |
| They were the apparent size of a half dollar at arms length,          |
| one-quarter turned and wobbling in flight. They disappeared after 3   |
| seconds after moving through 12 degrees of arc. (Sources: Project     |

| 1954 - At 11:30 p.m. Navy Commander H. R. Penrose was driving         |
| homeward from Derby to Burton in Derbyshire, England when a bright    |
| light appeared ahead of his car, heading towards him. When it reached |
| him he experienced a crash and was thrown forward against the         |
| windshield. The car then seemed to be lifted from the ground, and he  |
| was moved through the air while the bright light stayed above him.    |
| The car came to rest atop some metal railings, and he was lifted from |
| it by a man in a one piece uniform, who effortlessly carried him      |
| through an entrance on the underside of a large round object that was |
| hovering overhead, giving out a bright light. He was taken inside to  |
| a room, which had some controls that were being operated by men and   |
| women with short hair in coveralls. They questioned him               |
| telepathically about his naval experiences and his work with radar.   |
| Then a woman injected some green fluid into his arm, after which he   |
| had no more conscious memories of the experience. He was found,       |
| suffering from concussion, in his car atop some iron railings it had  |
| knocked down, and was taken to hospital. After his recovery he        |
| revisited the spot and succeeded in finding a railway signalman who   |
| said he had seen a car, with an extremely bright light above it, go   |
| past his signal box. Hypnotic regression was planned at the time of   |
| the report in 1978. (Sources: Margaret & Geoffrey Westwood, FSR,      |

| 1959 - At 7:00 p.m. a domed disc was seen over the city of Colon,     |
| Uruguay. The circular bottom of the object rotated clockwise. The     |
| object itself was self-luminous, and the dome of the craft flashed.   |
| The UFO flew off to the west. (Sources: Roberto Enrique Banchs; Loren |

| 1959 - Military witnesses at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, a civilian ATC,    |
| and all onboard a Braniff airliner witnessed a fireball fly across    |
| the sky toward the SW for 15 seconds. It was sighted on a clear night |
| at 9:21 p.m. and was estimated to be traveling at the same speed as   |
| the plane. (Source: APRO Bulletin, July 1959).                        |

| 1960 - There were over 20 UFO sightings including two close           |
| encounters in Brazil recorded for this evening in 1960 between 6:00   |
| p.m. and 8:00 p.m. by Dr. Olavo T. Fontes for the Aerial Phenomena    |
| Research Organization. |
|                                                                       |
| 1960 - Brazil: At shortly before 18:30 a huge cigar-shaped object came from the  |
| west at high speed and passed over Campos Sales, Brazil. It two ends  |
| were opaque and smoky, but it had a bright light at the center. It    |
| was seen by many residents. (Source: Dr. Olavo T. Fontes for the Aerial Phenomena    |
| Research Organization, between 6-8pm)                                          |
|                                                                       |
| 1960 - At 18:30 off the coast at Paracuru, Brazil at the location marked |
| as (2) on the map, three fisherman were frightened when a luminous    |
| disc hovered 300 feet over their fishing boat in a clear sky for      |
| three minutes. It emitted a strong blue glow but made no sound. (Source: Dr. Olavo T. Fontes for the Aerial Phenomena    |
| Research Organization, between 6-8pm)      |
|                                                                       |
| 1960 - At the same time a huge round gray object followed a donkey herd  |
| between the towns of Taboleiro and Nazare, Brazil at the location     |
| marked as (3). The UFO had a light on its top, and flew low and       |
| silently. It rose vertically as it flew off. (Source: Dr. Olavo T. Fontes for the Aerial Phenomena    |
| Research Organization, between 6-8pm)      |
|                                                                       |
| 1960 - A 60-foot wide oval-shaped disc, almost circular, with a strong   |
| bluish light on top, flew noiseless and then hovered in a tilted      |
| position over Paracuru, Ceara State, Brazil (4) at 19:00. (Source: Dr. Olavo T. Fontes for the Aerial Phenomena    |
| Research Organization, between 6-8pm) |
|                                                                       |
| 1960 - At 19:45 p.m. a military jet tried to intercept at the location   |
| marked as (5) over Fortaleza, Brazil. The UFO made an evasive         |
| maneuver, and was gone in a few seconds at supersonic speeds.         |

| 1960 - At 4:00 a.m. the next day (May 14, 1960) Raimondo dos Santos   |
| saw two craft land on a hill near a farm called Capin Acu, near the   |
| ocean in Paracuru, Ceara State, Brazil. He went near them and saw     |
| several small beings, pale-looking, making friendly gestures. He ran  |
| away. The creatures wore blue uniforms and white helmets. The         |
| previous day at 7:00 p.m., over 100 witnesses observed a dark-gray,   |
| circular craft, 20 meters in diameter with a powerful light,          |
| maneuvering and hovering in the sky. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,        |
| Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case # 505, citing        |

| 1962 - Two years later it was Argentina's turn to be inundated with   |
| UFO reports. In the early morning hours between 4:00 a.m. and dawn    |
| there were 11 sightings including seven close encounters from six     |
| provinces in Argentina: Buenos Aires, La Rioja, Neuquen, La Pampa,    |
| Cordoba, and Mendoza. In Mercedes, located in Buenos Aires province,  |
| Argentina an Air Force man named Giashischa and his family            |
| encountered a mist at 4:15 a.m. while driving in their car. In a      |
| field they saw a 20-meter wide luminous mass spinning near the        |
| ground. It stood approximately 3 meters tall.                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1962 - In Rio Cuarto, Cordoba, Argentina a flight of 20 multi-colored |
| UFOs was sighted by many at 4:45 a.m. One object--a fiery ball of     |
| light 30 meters in diameter--came down to within 300 meters of a car  |
| full of witnesses. From one side of the object four small red orbs    |
| flew out, lined up behind the larger ball, then flew away in          |
| formation. (Sources: (1) Oscar A. Uriondo, FSR Case Histories, June   |

| 1964 - At 10:15 p.m. a woman in Rio Vista, Solano County, California  |
| saw two disc-shaped objects glowing in the sky. One of them landed in |
| a field. It was round and luminous. Also, there were other reports of |
| cigar-shaped objects in the area. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator,   |
| July-August 1964, p. 6; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A        |

| 1967 - At 5:45 a.m. a close encounter occurred in Lavister, near      |
| Wrexham, Wales. A 15-meter diameter metallic disc glowed blue. It     |
| shot up, stopped, and then darkened. It glowed again on exit. The     |
| witness, Mr. Williams, viewed the object for 5 minutes. (Source: APRO |
| Bulletin, March-April 1969, p. 8).                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At the Colorado Springs, Colorado airport an unidentified      |
| flying object was picked up on radar at 4:40 a.m. MDT. During this    |
| time a Braniff flight was coming in for a landing, and the track of   |
| the object behaved like a ghost echo, perhaps a ground return being   |
| reflected off the Braniff aircraft. The radar blip appeared at about  |
| twice the range of the Braniff blip. When Braniff touched down,       |
| however, the situation changed radically. The UFO pulled to the east  |
| (right) and passed over the airport at an indicated height of 200     |
| feet. The object passed within 1.5 miles of the control tower, but    |
| was not visible even through binoculars by personnel in the control   |
| tower. This case was written up in the Condon report, and it was      |
| stated there: This must remain as one of the most puzzling radar      |
| cases on record, and no conclusion is possible at this time. It seems |
| inconceivable that an anomalous propagation echo would behave in the  |
| manner described, particularly with respect to the reported altitude  |
| changes, even if AP had been likely at the time. In view of the       |
| meteorological situation, it would seem that AP was rather unlikely.  |

| 1967 - At 8:00 p.m. CDT a University of South Dakota faculty member   |
| in Vermillion, South Dakota and five others saw a lens-shaped object  |
| (disc) that passed under the clouds, turned over, and changed         |
| directions. It first moved north to south, then northeast to          |
| southwest. (Sources: NICAP files, witness report dated July 18, 1967; |

| 1972 - In Canterbury, New Hampshire at 9:50 p.m. a six-sided object   |
| with four legs with landing pads, descended from 150 feet altitude    |
| with a falling leaf motion, passed over witnesses, and landed         |
| remotely. It had a light beam and made a jet-like noise or buzzing    |
| sound. As an animal reaction, a cat owned by one of the witnesses ran |
| away. (Sources: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors, p.  |

| 1975 - Nautical UFO. At 5:20 a.m. a bright red sphere descended into  |
| a lake in Mosciano Sant' Angelo, Abruzzi, Italy. It moved underwater, |
| then emerged. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case #       |

| 1978 - At 3:32 a.m. police office Manuel Amparano was on the          |
| outskirts of Kerman, California when he saw a reddish glow ahead. He  |
| drove up to investigate. Getting closer, he observed an oval-shaped   |
| object, smaller than the apparent size of the full Moon, handing in   |
| the sky. It was a very bright crimson red. Suddenly, a blue beam was  |
| directed toward him. The object then receded and was gone. Amparano   |
| felt a tingling sensation in his body as he drove to the police       |
| station. However, six people at the station noted that he looked      |
| sunburned "as red as a lobster." His skin stayed that way for four    |
| hours before returning to normal. His skin was reddened even through  |
| his uniform. Althought the redness went away rapidly, there were      |
| areas where the skin was actually burned, on his arms, face, and      |
| neck. These burns were visible for two days, and the day following    |
| his skin blistered on his face and in places on his arms. He had the  |
| discomfort for a week. Doctors told him he could have been exposed to |
| microwave radiation. (Sources: Allan Hendry, International UFO        |

| 1988 - On this night painter Maria Adilia Germana Hohagen reported    |
| seeing numerous "extraterrestrial" craft flying over her area of Sao  |
| Paulo, Brazil. She heard a voice in her head tell her to return to    |
| her home. She did, and from the balcony observed an object with       |
| multicolored lights that emitted several metallic sphere. During a    |
| hypnotic regression session, she remembered being abducted and        |
| medically examined by several human looking, two-meter tall           |
| humanoids. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1988 Humanoid Sighting Reports |

| 1993 - During a restless, sleepless night in Kadima, Israel Danny     |
| Rotem felt compelled to get in his car and drive. At around two a.m.  |
| he drove to the nearby forest and saw a large egg-shaped object on    |
| the ground. He left his car and then a tiny being, perhaps a meter    |
| and a half tall, appeared. The being told Danny, "We were waiting for |
| you." The humanoid floated in front of him as he walked toward the    |
| craft. He does not remember how he got inside, but realized that the  |
| object's inside dimensions seemed larger, by far, that they could be  |
| judging from its outside dimensions. In the middle of the room was a  |
| pillar with an enormous pedestal. There were 13 aliens in the room.   |
| Two of them led Danny to a side chamber where he was put on a very    |
| comfortable sofa. He was told, telepathically, not to worry, "that he |
| was on a mission; you'll know what it is in time." They then made an  |
| incision on his left wrist. His next memory was of being in his car   |
| again traveling home. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |

| triangular-shaped craft hovering over the Gulf of Mexico, just        |
| offshore, south of Fort Walton Beach, Florida the same witnesses      |
| reported seeing men in frogmen suits in the water, in the same area   |
| where the lights from the object had been shining down. There was     |
| also unusual military aircraft activity in the area. (Source: Albert  |

| 2003 - At 10:00 p.m. Mrs. Lenura Azizova in Simferopol', Crimea,      |
| Ukraine saw a cigar-shaped object hovering north of the city. It had  |
| a bright, yellowish light in front that outlined the cylindrical      |
| shape of the craft. When it switched off the light, it was gone in    |
| the darkness. Its length was estimated to be 50-60 meters.            |

| 2003 - At noon in Anaheim, California cars suddenly stopped because   |
| of EM ignition interference. The main witness was driving home from   |
| his job when his new car suddenly stopped, as did the cars following  |
| him. The witness said, "Some of the people behind me got out of their |
| cars and asked me if I knew what was going on. I said, 'I have no     |
| idea. This car is new, so I'm kind of mad." Then he heard a humming   |
| sound, so he looked around and he saw two cylinder shapes just        |
| sitting there above them. They then landed, then took off into the    |
| air, and vanished. When gone, his car and the other cars could be     |
| restarted. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell, Filer's      |

| 2003 - At 8:15 p.m. a witness was sitting in his window seat in       |
| Georgetown, Ontario, Canada when she saw a light outside that caught  |
| her attention. "As I looked up, I saw a beautiful display of rotating |
| lights that slowly hovered, moving no more than 5 km/hour," she said. |
| It was no more than 100 feet from her roof top. She rushed outside to |
| gave at the UFO, almost paralyzed with fear. She got a very good look |
| at the craft. It was not as big as she thought, and it was very       |
| quiet. The outer ends were rotating with a wondrous arrangement of    |
| lights, which sped off in an instant. At 11:35 p.m. in Terrace,       |
| British Columbia a ring of colored lights with a dark round object in |
| the center was also seen. It moved slowly to the south. (Sources:     |
