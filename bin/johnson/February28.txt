| 1904 - At 35.97 N 128.60 W in the Pacific Ocean between Honolulu and  |
| San Francisco at 6:10 a.m., three large dull red bodies flew in from  |
| the northwest over the U.S.S. Navy ship Supply. The largest one was   |
| egg or pear shaped, and six times the apparent size of the sun. The   |
| objects flew in an eschelon formation, flying very fast below the     |
| clouds. They gained altitude, turned, and travelled off to the        |
| west-northwest while climbing above broken clouds. There were at      |
| least three sailors as witnesses, including the main witness named    |
| Schofield. The duration of the event was more than two minutes.       |

| when an airborne object with a powerful searchlight dipped down from  |
| the night sky and circled the trawler twice at the height of the      |
| ship's masthead, with the searchlight focused on the ship. The UFO    |
| made a whirring sound as it flew. The main witness was named Parker.  |

| 1952 - An oil company employee was driving on the highway in Lomo de  |
| Ballena, Peru at 4:30 p.m. when he allegedly encountered a 10 meter   |
| in diameter disc hovering 500 meters away. Three uniped beings with   |
| rough, towel-like skin that looked something like "mummies" glided    |
| from the hovering object toward him. They communicated a message to   |
| him, warning of the dangers of atomic energy. He was also given a     |
| short tour flight on the craft. (Source: Richard Greenwell, FSR,      |

| 1953 - Philippe Daurces and four other witnesses in Beirut, Lebanon   |
| sighted a procession of 12 disc-shaped objects with distinct contours |
| at 6:30 p.m. Each craft had a bluish leading edge and left a trail of |
| smoke. They flew across the sky one after the other, crossing the sky |
| on parallel courses within a few minutes. When viewed through         |
| binoculars, each had a crimson red light. They flew at a constant     |
| speed, and it took them three minutes to fly from zenith to the       |
| horizon. They made no sound. (Sources: Aime Michel, The Truth about   |

| 1959 - Private Gerry Irwin, a Nike missile technician, was driving    |
| from Nampa, Idaho to his barracks at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. He |
| had reached Cedar City, Utah at about 1 p.m. when he observed a       |
| glowing object cross the sky. Irwin decided it could have been an     |
| airliner on fire attempting a crash landing, so he went to            |
| investigate. Using shoe polish, he wrote "Stop" on the side of his    |
| car, and left a note on the steering wheel that read: "Have gone to   |
| investigate possible plane crash. Please call law enforcement         |
| officers." A short time later a fish and game inspector did stop and  |
| took the note to the Cedar County sheriff, Otto Pfief, who returned   |
| to the site with a group of volunteers. No trace of an airplane crash |
| was found, but Irwin was soon found unconscious and taken to a        |
| hospital. When Irwin finally woke up form a deep sleep, he was        |
| puzzled by the absence of his jacket. He was flown back to Fort Bliss |
| and placed under observation for four days, after which he returned   |
| to duty.                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| Irwin behaved strangely: he was plagued by fainting, didn't seem to   |
| be aware of the correct date, and kept asking, "were there any        |
| survivors?" He was placed in a hospital for psychiatric examination.  |
| On April 18th, the day after being discharged, Irwin felt a powerful  |
| urge to return to the site of his strange encounter. Once there he    |
| walked straight to a bush and found his missing jacket. There was a   |
| pencil in a buttonhole with a piece of paper wound tightly around it. |
| Irwin curiously took the paper and burned it. He then went to sheriff |
| Pfief, who provided him with the details of the initial incident.     |
| Shortly afterwards Irwin's case came to the attention of the          |
| inspector general, who ordered a new investigation. On July 10, Irwin |
| re-entered the hospital. On August 1, he failed to report for duty.   |
| One month later, he was listed as A.W.O.L. and was not seen again.    |

| 1959 - At 8:40 p.m. a round silver disc-shaped object hovered in the  |
| sky over the city of Cordoba, Argentina for 15 minutes. It gave off   |
| several brilliant flashes before vanishing. At 11:40 p.m. a rotorless |
| silent helicopter-shaped object directed a beam of light at some      |
| linemen workers in San Salvador de Jujuy, Argentina. Red lights were  |
| seen exiting from the object. (Source: APRO Bulletin, May 1959).      |

| 1969 - In Miajadas, Caceres, Spain at 2:45 a.m., during the same time |
| that an earthquake hit the area, a truck driver and his assistant     |
| observed a strange craft and five humanoid beings, described as tall  |
| and luminous. Seized with an irrational fear, they drove away as      |
| quickly as possible. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |

| 1974 - The witness was motorcycling to work in Hirson, France at 5:30 |
| in the morning when his motorcycle stopped suddenly in Origny en      |
| Thierache, and he found himself face to face with two beings he       |
| described as "cosmonauts" standing in the road. The two men grabbed   |
| his motorbike and and held on to it firmly. They were dressed in dark |
| coveralls with square helmets, and sleeve-length gauntlets, but it    |
| was too dark to see their features through their helmet visors. They  |
| wore sleeve-length gauntlets, and one being gestured to the other,    |
| who brought out from a bag on his back a small piece of substance     |
| resembling chocolate; this he presented to the witness, urging him by |
| gestures to eat it. The witness did so, but to his surprise it had no |
| noticeable taste. They then moved off and let him pass. About 100     |
| feet to the right side of the road he had saw a large, dark circular  |
| mass about six feet high, sitting directly on the ground. , where     |
| traces of crushed grass were later found. (Sources: Coral E.          |

| 1974 - On a mountain road at 10:30 p.m. between Liac and Gensac,      |
| France a motorcycle engine died in the vicinity of three red orbs in  |
| the sky. An ovoid and dark mass approached from the hills. (Source:   |

| 1974 - At 11:00 p.m. in Mellionec, Cotes-Nord department, France two  |
| luminous 20 cm long ovoid objects hovered only 1.5 meters above the   |
| ground, then rose silently over the rooftops of the town. A third     |
| object joined them. (Source: Jean-F. Boedec, Les OVNI en Bretagne:    |

| 1974 - In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil a man reported that he was home      |
| alone at 7:30 p.m., standing in his kitchen, when he suddenly was     |
| transported to a square room with no apparent doors or windows. A     |
| loud voice emanated from a box-like device in the corner of the room  |
| which told him to remain calm. A door then appeared in the wall       |
| across from him, then the door opened and a large dark, oval-shaped   |
| "apparatus" emerged. The apparatus came towards him and a yellow      |
| light came down from the top of it, illuminating him. From out of the |
| oval-shaped machine emerged a figure that was an exact replica of the |
| witness. This double spoke to the witness and told him that he did    |
| not intend to harm him or anybody else. This being then disappeared   |
| through one of the walls. A large TV like screen then appeared. The   |
| witness could see the actions of his double through this screen and   |
| was directed to assist him with his voice. He was finally released    |
| and the aliens apparently recalled his double. The aliens told the    |
| witness that they were here to help humanity. (Source: Albert S.      |

| 1993 - In County Wexford, Ireland a woman was taking a morning walk   |
| along a country road by herself when whe heard an odd sound coming    |
| from a nearby ditch by the edge of a field. She went over to look and |
| there she saw a little dwarfish woman, about two foot tall with long  |
| red hair, who was trying to pick up a smooth stone that was wedged in |
| the soil. The woman was wearing a purple outfit and had what appeared |
| to be two raven feathers in her hair. When the witness got closer she |
| could see that the dwarf was struggling with the stone. The little    |
| woman suddenly noticed the witness and vanished in plain sight.       |

| 1996 - Five people driving on highway 375 in Nevada down an isolated  |
| stretch of desert road watched a silent, silvery gray disc land about |
| 50 feet away from them. It was flat on the bottom and about 30 feet   |
| in diameter. Three beings described as thin, gray in color and with   |
| large heads, emerged from the craft. They shuffled around outside for |
| a short while and then went back inside the UFO, which promptly took  |
| off. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1996, case |

| 2006 - According to the witness, at 12:30 a.m. in Sabana Grande,      |
| Mayaguez, Puerto Rico he saw three or four Grey aliens standing near  |
| a landed bell-shaped object for 60 minutes. They and the object were  |
| 650 feet away. They stood 3-4 feet tall, had long fingers, almond     |
| eyes, and big heads. There was a sequence of lights from the top and  |
| sides of the bell, as well as the rim of the disc-shaped bottom.      |
| There was a probe-like arm that hovered and moved 20 feet from the    |
| ground. (Source: John Hayes, www.ufoinfo.com, Puerto Rico reports     |
