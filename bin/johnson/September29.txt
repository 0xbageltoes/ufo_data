| 1959 - An electrical power outage occurred In Mariannelund, Sweden at |
| 6:55 p.m. Going outside during the power failure, Mr. Gideon          |
| Johansson and his son saw a brilliant white light hovering over a     |
| nearby building. The object descended, breaking through the top of a  |
| maple tree, until it was 18 inches above the street and only ten feet |
| from Mr. Johansson. It was a domed, oval-shaped machine 12 feet long  |
| and 8 feet high, and light blue in color. In the front of the object  |
| was a large window surrounded by rivets. Inside, brilliantly          |
| illuminated by a white light, he could see two small, seated          |
| individuals. They had very high crowned heads, big eyes, small        |
| mouths, and pointed chins. Each had what looked like an earphone on   |
| one ear. They wore white uniforms with broad black belts crossed over |
| their shoulders and chests. One of them loosened his belt to work on  |
| something below the window level. After two minutes the craft floated |
| along the street for 25 meters then disappeared in a flash, with a    |
| gust of air. A glassy deposit was found on the power line a kilometer |
| away. Mr. Johansson suffered ill effects to his health and the maple  |
| tree eventually died. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,        |

| strange humanoids at the local "Parc de la Gaudiniere", in Nantes,    |
| Loire-Atlantique, France. He described the beings as robot-like, with |
| bumpy looking skin, and without faces. They moved about heavily       |
| swinging their arms. Fifteen minutes later, at 12:45 a.m., a          |
| 46-year-old woman named Le Bihan and two other witnesses saw three    |

| had no facial details eventhough they wore no headgear. Physiological |
| effects and post traumatic stress were reported. (Sources: (1) Albert |
