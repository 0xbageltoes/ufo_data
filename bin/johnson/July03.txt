| 1947 - There are 35 unexplained UFO, USO (unidentified submarine      |
| object), and humanoid reports for this day in UFOCAT, including the   |
| alleged discovery of the famous Roswell debris field by Mac Brazel on |
| a ranch near Corona, New Mexico and the discovery of a crashed disc   |
| by Barney Barnett in an arroyo near Magdelena, New Mexico. A cluster  |
| of three reports came from around Cincinnati, Ohio between 10:30 a.m. |
| and 5:30 p.m. A cluster of another three reports came from Prince     |
| Edward Island, Canada at 5:45 p.m. including the sighting of a black  |
| cigar-shaped object in Charlottetown. There was a third cluster of    |
| sightings from Sonoma County, California where a forest fire lookout  |
| in Fort Ross saw what looked like a burning ship sink slowly into the |
| Pacific Ocean where no ship was reported missing. There was a fourth  |
| cluster of three sightings between Baltimore, Maryland and            |
| Washington, DC. |

| 1947 - Harborside, Maine - John F. Cole, an astronomer, watched a      |
| series of objects that gave off a roaring noise at 2:30 in the        |
| afternoon from Harborside, south of Brooksville, Maine. The objects   |
| were in the north and were proceeding northwest at a high speed. He   |
| estimated their diameter at 100 feet. Calling the report an           |
| "unusually well-supported incident," the Air Force had no             |
| explanation. However, years later the Air Materiel Command publicly   |
| explained the event as "birds or insects". This sighting was also one |
| of the 1947 cases investigated by the FBI. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,  |

| 1947 - In the village of Mendon, Vermont at 9:00 p.m. Mrs. Spieski   |
| sighted a cylindrical UFO, shaped like a flashlight with a white head |
| and green body. It flew at a moderate speed over a meadow at low      |
| altitude, heading toward the southwest. (Sources: Ted Bloecher;       |

| 1949 - A blue-green fireball was sighted at dawn north of Vaughn,     |
| Montana. It lit up the sky from horizon to horizon. At 10:40 a.m. 200 |
| spectators watched three identical disc-shaped objects fly over an    |
| air show being held in Longview, Washington. Another disc-shaped      |
| flying object was sighted in Astoria, Oregon at 1:00 p.m. At 3:00     |
| p.m. in Sterling State Park on the shore of Lake Erie in Michigan,    |
| Mr. D. Swarz was watching 2 AT6 airplanes when his attention was      |
| drawn to a metallic disc high above moving rapidly in opposite        |
| direction. The object went south over the western end of Lake Erie    |
| and was gone in 11 seconds. (Sources: Edward Sullivan, CSI-Los        |

| 1955 - Mrs. Wesley Symmonds was driving near Stockton, Georgia when    |
| she saw four "bug-eyed" creatures near the road. They were small      |
| beings with thin arms, wide shoulders, large eyes, and pointed chins. |
| Two were turned away from the witness; one was bending over with      |
| something like a stick in its hand; and the fourth one was facing her |
| with its right arm raised. It had bulging eyes, a sort of cap, no     |
| visible mouth, a long pointed nose, a chin that came to a sharp       |
| point, and long thin arms with claws. (Sources: Leonard Stringfield,  |

| 1960 - An Argentinean Air Force Captain photographed a cone-shaped   |
| UFO between Yacanto and Cordoba, Argentina at 4:30 p.m. There was a   |
| mystery fall of ice from the sky in Portage, Pennsylvania. (Source:   |

| 1961 - An object resembling a hovercraft was seen at fifteen minutes  |
| after minute in Ryde, England. It had five windows through which a    |
| bright orange light was shining, and it hovered about 20 meters above |
| the trees. It left suddenly at high speed. (Source: Passport to       |

| 1965 - At their base on Deception Island in the South Shetland        |
| Islands, Antarctica two Chilean scientists, Barrera and Perisse,      |
| witnessed, tracked with a theodolite, and photographed a bluish-green |
| lighted object that zigzagged and caused strong radio frequency       |
| interference beginning at 7:14 p.m. Another electromagnetic effect    |
| was that the UFO registered on their magnetograph tapes and           |
| variometers. Photographs were taken. The blue-green lighted object    |
| was seen zig-zagging. There was a government coverup. (Sources: La    |

| 1967 - An 8-mm home movie was made at 1:00 a.m. in Buckhorn, Ontario  |
| when a family saw 15 lights darting about in the sky. Mr. Denniss     |
| shot a few feet of film in the direction of flight. On the film is a  |
| red, round luminous object, flattened slightly on the top. They next  |
| saw three lights traveling in a triangle formation. (Source: Skylook, |

| 1968 - Around midnight a man driving in a car in Colle Orlando, Italy |
| had a tall humanoid jump onto the roadway from an embankment in front |
| of him. The being wore blue overalls, had long hair, and a bright     |
| light shone from his chest. The being easily jumped over the car,     |
| laughed, then jumped to a hill where a small red disc was hovering.   |

| 1976 - Two 14-year-old girls, Ms. Chapman and Ms. Perry, in Mawman,   |
| England heard a hissing sound around 10 o'clock at night. They then   |
| saw a flying humanoid as big as a man, with glowing red eyes. It      |
| looked like "a big owl with pointed ears." (Source: David F. Webb and |
| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT, case A1641, citing Fortean Times, August 1976,  |
| p. 17).                                                               |

| 1999 - A couple driving between Oostende and Bruges, Belgium saw a    |
| triangular object hovering seven meters above a field. It was silver  |
| and black with lights in each corner, and had a pulsating red light   |
| in the center. When one of them tried to photograph it the craft      |
| approached them. They panicked and drove off. (Source: UFO Magazine   |
| (USA), November 1999, p. 29).                                         |
