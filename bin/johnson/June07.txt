| 1952 - On this day in 1952, at 4:00 a.m., security guards watched a light    |
| hover at 1,000 feet over the 5th Air Force Base near Seoul, South     |
| Korea. The light bobbed in the sky, then rose rapidly to the east,    |
| changing colors as it went. Several hours later, at 11:18 a.m. in     |
| Albuquerque, New Mexico, a rectangular-shaped, aluminum colored       |
| object followed a B-25 bomber during its flight. Both of these        |
| reports were listed by Project Blue Book as "unidentified" cases.     |
| (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official statistics,     |
| cases #1259 and #1260; (2) Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO          |

| 1954 - On this day in 1954, while driving between Indio and Brawley,         |
| California on US highway 99, a witness spotted a 12-meter diameter    |
| metallic disc hovering one mile above Mount Superstition for more     |
| than 15 minutes. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue no. 339).      |

| 1958 - A red glow appeared over the mountains in Mount Egmont, New    |
| Zealand at 9:30 p.m. A white ovoid object shot up, stopped, then shot |
| off horizontally to the northwest passing over the heads of the       |
| witnesses. (Source: Loren Gross, The fifth horseman of the            |

| 1965 - In Scoriton, England on this day in 1965 three glowing beings         |
| allegedly appeared to a witness named Bryant one day after the flying |
| saucer contactee George Adamski died. One of the beings calls himself |
| "Yamski." The witness was left with headaches, messages, and a        |
| metallic object. (Source: BUFORA Journal, June 1965, p. 10; Eileen    |

| 1967 - At 1:30 a.m. a disc-shaped object with a rectangular           |
| protuberance on its underside flew close to an ambulance being driven |
| by Geraldo Baqueiro in Itajuba, Minas Gerais state, Brazil and caused |
| the complete failure of its electrical system. Through a brightly     |
| illuminated transparent surface of the object the faces of strange    |
| beings, resembling bipedal cat-like creatures with cat-like eyes,     |
| stared intently at the stunned witness. (Source: David F. Webb and    |

| 1970 - Shortly after 12:30 a.m., three kilometers northwest of        |
| Curico, Chile a Mr. Valenzuela observed an oval-shaped object land    |
| and was shocked by the appearance of the two entities who were        |
| inside. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of |

| 1970 - Driving around a sharp curve on the road next to the Towarie   |
| Reservoir south of Ouray, Utah, E. Manning saw a triangular UFO with  |
| rounded corners coming across the lake that nearly collided with the  |
| car. It veered sharply away. It had many colors, mostly green. It     |
| moved with the apex of the triangle in front, with two exhaust jets   |
| in back. (Source: Frank Salisbury, The Utah UFO Display, Appendix     |
| case 74).                                                             |

| 1973 - At ten o'clock in the evening three people in a car near       |
| Sousas, Brazil saw a "fireball" which came toward them and stopped 50 |
| meters away. It was 15 feet in diameter and gave off a yellow light.  |
| The engine of the car failed when it was nearby and the witnesses     |
| felt "prickly." They also had intense headaches later. The object     |
| eventually left and the car could be restarted. (Source: Mark         |

| 1974 - A red luminous sphere was seen over Lake George in Goulbourn,  |
| New South Wales, Australia at 11:00 p.m. At 3:00 a.m. the next        |
| morning dogs began barking and a witness saw a landed UFO and         |
| approached to within 300 meters of it. He saw 3-4 very tall (8 feet)  |
| beings, who wore glowing silver suits and floated to the ground. They |
| had no facial features. (Source: Keith Basterfield, case              |

| 1976 - At 10:40 p.m. in Cincinnati, Ohio two men witnessed a circular |
| object with revolving white lights while dogs howled in reaction to   |
| its presence. The men took 17 photographs. The object disappeared     |
| once, then after it reappeared it circled to the west, next to the    |
| east, and left the area after ten minutes. (Source: CUFOS News        |

| 1978 - At 8:00 p.m. two flashing yellow lights flew above Amapa,      |
| Brazil at an altitude above 35,000 feet. The lights flew parallel to  |
| one another, about 100 meters apart, and flew from the south to the   |
| northwest at a medium speed. (Source: Bob Pratt, Operacao Prato,      |

| 1990 - At 11:45 p.m. in the farm community of Haymart, Pennsylvania   |
| a woman saw a bright light in the sky while driving home. When she    |
| reached her home and watched from outside, the ovoid UFO with         |
| multicolored lights approached to a close range and directed two      |
| white beams at her from the bottom of the object. Meanwhile, her dog  |
| barked continuously during the encounter. Her neighbor chased the     |
| object away in her truck. (Source: Stan Gordon, MUFON case file       |

| homes in Sheldon, Vermont at 9:15 p.m. It had two bright lights on    |
| one side. (Source: UFO Newsclipping Service, February 1994).          |

| 1994 An RCMP report stated that at 3:30 a.m. in farm country          |
| northwest of Gimli, Manitoba, Canada a 300 foot wide, donut or torus  |
| shaped object flew over the area to the east at 1500 feet altitude.   |
| It had nine to twelve flashing lights around its circumference.       |

| 1996 - An object described as a silver, on-end goose egg, hovered     |
| over the river in Franklin, Georgia on an overcast evening around     |
| 7:45 p.m. It was about 50 above the water, and the water below the    |
| object did not appear to be disturbed. It was estimated to be about   |
| the size of VW Beetle. It moved away slowly as a speed of around      |
| 10-15 mph. (Source: John C. Thompson, MUFON file investigation        |

| 2000 - North of Pine Gap, near Alice Springs, Northern Territory,     |
| Australia at 8:30 p.m. a married couple's dogs barked madly as a      |
| disc-shaped object with orange around the edge hovered close by. It   |
| lit up the area and was described as looking like "trees were on      |
| fire." It hovered, then moved out of sight. (Source: Keith Douglas,   |
| Victorian UFO Research Society website).                              |

| 2000 - On the same day a daylight disc sighting occurred in Marlette, |
| Michigan when an oval object was sighted for about 15 seconds at      |
| around 1:00 p.m. The craft was described as a very shiny silver color |
| with vertical and horizontal dividers, making square compartments all |
| around.  (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,     |
| Seattle, June 2000 archived webpage, this report posted March 6,      |

| 2002 - Another daylight disc sighting occurred at 11:45 a.m. in       |
| Chatsworth, Los Angeles County, California. It was a large, round     |
| domed disc that was seen briefly. It was also described as very shiny |
| with little black jets, and had a small dome on top. The object  was  |
| rotating at the time, and made no sound at all.(Source: Peter         |
| Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, Seattle, June 2002 archived |

| 2008 - On this night in Antioch Community, South Carolina a married   |
| couple with many years of aviation experience were returning from     |
| some friends' house where they had been watching movies. They were    |
| discussing one of the movies when the wife said, "Look at that, what  |
| in the world is that?" They saw a black triangular craft in the air   |
| with lights and several windows. There was a purple beacon in the     |
| center of the bottom, but no position lights or anti-collision lights |
| anywhere on the object. They thought for a moment that it might be a  |
| B-2 bomber, but it made no noise at all and after "zooming" up to     |
| them it stopped right over their vehicle. About this time they turned |
| onto their private road and made it up to their house. This was       |
| around 11:20 p.m. The next thing that either of them remembers was    |
| being in the car at 2:24 a.m. in the morning. The car was running but |
| the wife was in the driver’s seat and the husband in the passenger's. |
| Since he is 6’5” and she is 5’7” this meant that his knees            |
| were forced into the dashboard.Neither remembers anything whatsoever  |
| after parking the car. They do not remember what happened during the  |
| lost time, why they were in different positions in the car, or why    |
| they were still sitting outside their house with all of the car       |
| windows still down and the moon roof open. The husband woke up with a |
| headache the next morning, and his wife felt ill enough to stay in    |
| bed for most of the next day. There were other good reports of flying |
| triangles that same night in Brooklyn, Michigan and Mountain View,    |
| California. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,  |
