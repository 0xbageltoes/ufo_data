| 1957 - At 1:25 a.m. Mrs. Leita Kuhn observed a very large, lighted    |
| object 20 meters above the ground in Madison, Ohio. It was so         |
| brilliant that she had to close her eyes. It was over 10 meters wide, |
| three to four meters thick, with a dome on top. The witness had to    |
| consult a physician several days later because of serious eye and     |
| skin irritation. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A      |
| Century of Landings, case 440).                                       |

| 1966 - At 3:30 a.m. a disc-shaped object landed at the local military |
| airport in Fubara, Italy. It carried flashing police type lights on   |
| its top and bottom. From the object emerged four men or pilots (not   |
| described) who walked around the ground briefly then returned to the  |
| object. The object then circled the area and left. (Source: Maurizio  |
| Verga, ITACAT: Italian UFO catalogue).                                |

| 1982 - At 9:45 p.m. a man walking home in Vegas De Coria, Spain heard |
| a loud wailing sound as he approached his house. He looked around,    |
| and noticed a strange black lump on the ground nearby. He walked      |
| towards it and as he got near the thing began to grow larger until it |
| became a huge, dark man-like figure that approached him making a      |
| strange "swishing" sound. The frightened witness retreated and        |
| grabbed two stones from the ground. He then screamed and the figure   |
| stopped, turned, and left. He then saw a bright flash and the figure  |
| vanished. The figure was described as completely black, almost        |
| two-meters tall, and wearing a black cape. (Source: Albert S.         |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database, case # 605, citing J. J. Benitez, |
| La Quinta Columna).                                                   |
