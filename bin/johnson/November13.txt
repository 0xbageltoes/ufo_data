| 1833 - On this date in 1833 a series of incidents involving a luminous       |
| aerial object and the fall of mysterious jelly-like substances were   |
| reported in New York, New Jersey and Ohio. At dawn in West Point, New |
| York, a woman milking her cow saw a luminous object descend "with a   |
| sposh" sound. She discovered a flattened, jelly-like transparent      |
| mass. By 10:00 in the morning it had sublimed and disappeared. The    |
| same kind of jelly-like substance was found on the ground in Newark   |
| and Rahway, New Jersey. In Poland, Ohio a luminous object in the      |
| northeastern sky, at dawn, hovered for nearly an hour. It was         |
| described as very brilliant, and was shaped like a "pruning hook."    |
| Earlier, at a short time after 2:00 a.m., a luminous object was also  |
| seen in the sky at Niagara Falls, New York. It was shaped like a      |
| square table, remained stationary in the sky, and emitted rays of     |
| light. (Source: Gordon Lore, Jr. and Harold H.Dennault, Jr.,          |

| 1939 - In 1939 a building foreman drove past a deserted farm in the early    |
| morning in Brockworth, England and heard a high-pitched humming       |
| sound. He looked and saw a gray, bell-shaped object hovering over a   |
| nearby field. It had dark windows on its side, and a curtain of green |
| light underneath, which retracted upwards as if solid. (Source:       |

| 1952 - At both Opheim Army Base and Glasgow AFB in Montana in 1952, an       |
| unidentified flying object was picked up on radar between 2:20 and    |
| 2:43 a.m. There was visual confirmation of the UFO by military        |
| personnel near Opheim. According to Earl Oksendahl, a qualified and   |
| reliable weather bureau witness, at 2.43 a.m. five glowing objects in |
| formation made a 90 degree turn overhead, and then flew to the        |
| southwest. The two outside objects seemed to bank. They were oval     |
| shaped, 30-50 feet in diameter, had no trail, no exhausts, and made   |
| no noise. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official       |

| 1957 - In 1957 a UFO exploded over the State Hospital in Crownsville,        |
| Maryland at 9:10 in the morning. Fragments were recovered and sent to |
| the US Air Force for analysis. On this same date a UFO was seen high  |
| in the sky east of Port Broughton, South Australia. It drifted slowly |
| toward the northwest. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, January 1958, |

| 1960 - In the year 1960 in La Londe, France a domed disc-shaped UFO was      |
| spotted sitting on railroad tracks at 2:45 a.m. It made no sound, and |
| shafts of orange light periodically shot out from the object. It rose |
| vertically, folded its landing gear, and shot off straight up.        |
| (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings,  |
| case 512).                                                            |

| 1965 - Two odd looking craft were seen floating or hovering near the  |
| surface of the ocean at the southern tip of New Zealand. Two          |
| fisherman, Mr. R. D. Hanning, age 41, skipper of the fishing vessel   |
| Eleoneai, and Mr. W. J. Johnson made the sighting. They had set out   |
| from Bluff, the port of Invercargill, New Zealand, to tend pots in    |
| the area of Stewart Island, the southernmost part of New Zealand. At  |
| 11:30 a.m. they were about half a mile off Rugged Islands when they   |
| saw a strange craft come out of the water. Its tapered structure rose |
| about 15 feet above the water and measured 5 feet high at the top and |
| 12 feet at the water line. Then, about 30 feet away, a second         |
| box-shaped object, about 10 feet long and 5 feet high, was seen.      |
| There was no sign of any periscope or railing and nothing but the     |
| 'tower' and 'box' were visible. The water was smooth and the objects  |
| were in clear view 300 yards away. After 10 seconds there was         |
| suddenly a great surging of water and both object vanished beneath    |
| the surface. Both men were rather startled at this display and in     |
| fact were somewhat frightened by it. They hung around for a few       |
| minutes, decided not to wait any longer, and steamed off. The water   |
| at the spot where they had made the sighting was about 30 fathoms     |
| deep to a sandy bottom. (Sources: Otago Daily Times, November 18,     |

| 1965 - In the late evening in Mogi-Guacu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil Sr. |
| Dario Filho, his wife, his grandson, and a bank director saw an       |
| object land 100 meters away, flashing a beam of light towards the     |
| sky. Two policemen on the scene also observed the incident. Near the  |
| object were two dwarves. One of them wore coveralls, while the other  |
| had on a gray shirt and brown trousers. By what seemed an optical     |
| effect, a third being with a flat, squarish head, wearing something   |
| like a surgeon's apron, was also seen near them. The object and the   |
| creatures were very brightly lit. The incident lasted 30 minutes.     |

| 1967 - A man and woman were driving down a road in Winterfold Forest  |
| in Cranleigh, England at half an hour past midnight when they         |
| encountered a heavy fog and were required to stop. A face suddenly    |
| appeared in the car window, and an arm reached up to the roof of      |
| their car. As they hurriedly drove off they could see the face and    |
| arm attached to a dark, conical body, but they saw no legs. They also |
| reported the odor of burnt food at the time of their encounter with   |
| the entity. (Source: Charles Bowen, Flying Saucer Review, January     |
| 1968, p. 15). Later that evening an EM effects UFO close encounter    |
| was reported in Arnheim, The Netherlands. (Source: Flying Saucer      |

| 1971 - At 2:00 a.m. a lemon-colored sphere was seen by a railway      |
| signalman 50 feet above the ground in Saxilby, Lincolnshire, England. |
| A second identical object appeared, and the two hovered together,     |
| making no sound. The lights were estimated to be half a mile away.    |
| They vanished like a light switch being turned off. (Source: Mrs. K   |

| 1971 - In the desert of Lucerne Valley, California three men were out |
| on a hunting trip. At 5:15 p.m. they saw a large, yellowish-white     |
| light land in the distance, and a smaller light approach their        |
| campsite. In the ensuing minutes they heard twigs snap, and were      |
| startled by a loud unintelligible cry. They left their campsite in    |
| haste. Returning to the site during the daytime with UFO investigator |
| Anne Druffel, they found three 12"-14" circular imprints arranged in  |
| a triangle 12 feet apart. (Sources: Ann Druffel, NICAP UFO            |

| 1972 - Four witnesses had a close encounter of the second kind with a |
| noisy UFO three miles southeast of Anderson, Shasta County,           |
| California. The incident occurred at 6:10 p.m., lasted ten            |
| minutes, scared animals, and left physical traces. (Sources: Redding  |

| 1973 - In an apparent abduction attempt, in 1973 a UFO hovered over a car    |
| and "tall, thin, green occupants" tried to stop it on highway 1470    |
| two miles east of Poteet, Texas. Paint peeled from the car due to     |
| something dripping from the UFO. Other reports of nocturnal lights    |
| seen flying in the sky that evening came from California, Yugoslavia, |
| and Spain. (Source: Austin Evening Statesman, November 14, 1973;      |

| 1974 - In 1974, close encounters occurred in Norwalk, Connecticut, Antigo,   |
| Wisconsin, and Rockford, Illinois. A cattle mutilation case occurred  |
| south of Olney, Texas on the same day as a humanoid report from       |
| Antigo, Wisconsin. (Source: George Eberhart, A Geo-Bilbliography of   |

| 1975 - On this night in 1975 a number of multi-colored nocturnal lights were |
| reported in the midwestern and southern United States. Sparkling      |
| white, red, and yellow lights flew in formation erratically in        |
| Whitewater, Wisconsin. Red, green, and white lights were sighted in   |
| Eau Claire, Wisconsin, moving up-and-down and diagonally. In Fort     |
| Atkinson, Wisconsin bright white lights that dimmed, disappeared, and |
| then re-appeared were sighted. In Mobile, Alabama a UFO, changing     |
| colors, moved across the horizon. A round silver object was seen      |
| moving slowly in the northwest sky in Orlando, Florida. It suddenly   |
| disappeared. (Source: CUFOS News Bulletin, February 1976, p. 13.)     |

| 1977 - At eleven o'clock at night in Fox-Amphoux, Var department,     |
| France a young couple in their twenties, driving on highway D         |
| 561, observed a disc-shaped light in the sky over the hills between   |
| Fox-Amphoux and Aups. After driving several kilometers the couple     |
| again saw it, now larger and blinking, at the crossroads of Logis     |
| d'Amphoux; it seemed to be above the nearby town of Fox. They pulled  |
| their car to the side of the road and watched it for 15 minutes. Next |
| they saw, about 200 meters behind them along the road, a small point  |
| of light near the ground, as though someone were carrying a           |
| flashlight. They turned around and drove back toward the light and    |
| observed, about 30 to 50 meters away, an unstable, two-dimensional    |
| image of a human-like entity of a phosphorescent white color, with no |
| visible arms or legs and no features on its head. It was about        |
| five-foot eight inches tall, "advancing and retreating," and fading   |
| in and out. They compared the form to a TV image. The couple          |
| associated the lights seen earlier with the figure, became            |
| frightened, and drove off. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, April      |

| 1977 - At 11:35 p.m. two Air Force security police officers at        |
| Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota were checking out a report of  |
| trespassers at a restricted nuclear weapons storage site, when they   |
| noticed a bright light hovering above a nearby hill. One of the men   |
| remained in the patrol vehicle as the second investigated the source  |
| of the light. As the officer approached the area he observed a human  |
| like figure wearing a shiny green metallic uniform and a helmet with  |
| visor. The witness ordered the figure to stop, but it continued       |
| walking towards the source of the light. As the officer pointed his   |
| M-16 at the figure the being suddenly turned around and pointed an    |
| object at the officer. This was followed by a bright flash of light   |
| from the object, and then the M-16 carbine exploded causing burns to  |
| the hands of the officer. As the injured officer hid, the other       |
| officer arrived and he observed two similarly clad figures; he        |
| challenged both but they refused to stop, so he then fired his        |
| weapon, striking both. They were seen to fall, but 15 seconds later   |
| both stood up and fired several flashes of light at the officer, who  |
| was able to take cover and was unhurt. He then followed the two       |
| intruders and saw them enter a landed disc-shaped craft. The object   |
| then emitted a brilliant flash of green light, and disappeared into   |
| the sky. Later investigation revealed that several components to one  |
| of the nuclear warheads were missing. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1991 - In 1991, at about 5:30 p.m., a couple driving a car in Douglas,       |
| Georgia saw a silver, triangular-shaped UFO with rounded corners. It  |
| emitted an arc of white light. A second identical triangle then       |
| appeared, and the two UFOs circled a nearby lake. The UFOs moved      |
| erratically, sometimes at a slow speed, sometimes very fast.          |

| 1993 - A farmer in Forest Grove, Oregon a half an hour past midnight on this |
| day in 1993 was putting goats and chickens away in a barn, when he    |
| heard noises from the bushes. He found one of his goats dead with     |
| puncture wounds and with internal organs missing. He then saw a       |
| short, hairy biped run into the woods. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,    |

| 1998 - In Maybrook, New York an 11-year-old boy awoke at 1:30 a.m.    |
| and saw three bizarre figures in the shape of bowling pins standing   |
| in the hallway about five feet from his bedroom doorway. They stood   |
| there staring at the witness. The figures glowed a white color, but   |
| did not illuminate anything around them. No eyes or mouths could be   |
| seen. The witness apparently encountered similar looking creatures    |
| the year before. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |

| 1998 - At 7:10 p.m. north of the city of Helsinki, Finland two people |
| heard and saw something resembling a bolt of lighting come from the   |
| sky. Strange vibrations lasting five minutes followed, and then all   |
| became quiet. After another two minutes the witnesses heard a very    |
| loud noise with no apparent cause, and this sound diminished before   |
| ceasing entirely. Then from their first floor balcony the witnesses   |
| saw three strange beings enter their backyard. The beings moved       |
| around the yard in every direction. One of them carried a purple      |
| blinking light and another of the beings climbed up one of their      |
| trees. The witness then made some noise and the humanoid in the tree  |
| came down and then they all left. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |

| 1999 - Andre Marquetti and Jair Picerni were jogging in the local     |
| park in Cachoeira de Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil on a very sunny   |
| afternoon at around 2 p.m. As they ran near a clearing they spotted a |
| “classic” disc-shaped object with a transparent dome on top on the    |
| ground. Stunned, they stood still and watched it for awhile, and when |
| they attempted to run away they found they could not move. They then  |
| noticed a figure exit the craft, who completely ignored them and      |
| walked around the object. Five minutes later the humanoid being       |
| re-entered the object, which then rose up slowly and disappeared from |
| sight. Soon afterwards the two men were able to move again. Both      |
| suffered from headaches and nausea for a week after the incident.     |

| 2001 - Tracie and Jim Austin-Peters had a close up sighting of a      |
| massive triangle-shaped craft in Studio City, California at 6:45 p.m. |
| The sighting was made by a couple who had started a cable access      |
| UFO/paranormal TV show. The UFO was estimated to be at only 200 feet  |
| altitude, flying very low and very slow over a major, busy,           |
| metropolitan area, and was completely silent. It had white lights     |
| underneath, and at one point stopped and hovered, then turned, and    |
| was gone in 6 seconds. (Source: Preston Dennett, UFOs over            |

| 2002 - At 6:15 p.m. in Hacienda Heights, Turnball Canyon, California  |
| a huge round orange object with lots of red and white lights around   |
| it was sighted. It was round like an upside- down bowl, and was       |

| intersection in Bloomington, Indiana. It was flying in a southeast    |
| direction, and had two red lights, one on each tip of the trailing    |
| edge. There was an amber light in the center of craft that was        |
| constantly changing shape. It was too fast and low for a blimp,       |
| according to the witness. Its estimated altitude was only 20 feet.    |
