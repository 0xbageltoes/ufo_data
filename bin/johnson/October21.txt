| 1952 - Persons at the Knoxville, Tennessee airport weather station    |
| saw six white lights flying in a loose formation for one to two       |
| minutes. The unknown lights made a shallow dive at a weather balloon. |

| 1954 - An egg-shaped object, about 5.5 meters in diameter, hovered    |
| and landed near the road in Pons, France. Two dwarf humanoids, about  |
| 1.25 meters (4.1 feet) tall, emerged from it, and went back inside    |
| almost immediately. The craft took off vertically leaving a red       |
| trail. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of     |

| 1954 - A young man walking in a field in Melito, Italy heard a        |
| rustling noise and saw a strange craft land nearby. Getting closer to |
| investigate, he saw a pilot with a diving suit coming out of the      |
| craft, which emitted bronze-green rays of light, flooding the whole   |
| countryside. The witness was paralyzed. A dog barking about 100 m     |
| away caused the rapid escape of the pilot into the craft, which took  |
| off. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of       |
| Landings, p. 236).                                                    |

| 1954 - Ranton, England. Near Shrewsbury, England Jennie Roestenberg   |
| and her two children observed a disc-shaped, aluminium object         |
| hovering above their house at 4:45 p.m. Through two transparent       |
| panels they saw two men with white skin, long hair to their           |
| shoulders, and very high foreheads. They wore transparent helmets and |
| turquoise-blue clothing, resembling ski suits. The object hovered at  |
| a tilted angle while the two occupants looked at the scene "sternly,  |
| not in an unkind fashion, but almost sadly, compassionately."         |

| 4; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p.     |
| 236).                                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - Criteuil-la-Madeleine, France. The car driven by a bricklayer, |
| Mr. Fillonnau, stopped when a large fiery ball flew near it. A        |
| violent air displacement was felt. "The battery was dead and the      |
| headlights were burned out. " Thorough police investigation failed to |
| identify the cause of the phenomenon. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,       |
| Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 236; Gregory Falla,    |
| BUFORA Vehicle Interference Report).                                  |

| 1954 - Pouzou, France. Between Serifere and Paille, a man from        |
| Cherbonnieres suddenly felt painful pricklings similar to electric    |
| shocks and his 4-year-old child started crying. They felt increasing  |
| pain as the car went on, and suddenly the engine died and the lights  |
| went off. They were blinded by a strong red light, which turned       |
| orange. It came from an object hovering above the road, and           |
| everything returned to normal when it went away. (Sources: Aime       |
| Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery, p. 204; Jacques |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 236-237).      |

| 1963 - At 9:30 p.m. six strange objects were observed for the next 40 |
| minutes, causing a local panic in Trancas, Argentina. One UFO hovered |
| at ground level above some railroad tracks, while another, showing a  |
| dome and portholes, was near a house. When witnesses flashed a light  |
| at the object the house was flooded with a strong beam. The           |
| temperature rose inside the house and they could smell a strong       |
| sulphurous odor. Figures were seen in the vicinity of the first disc. |
| All six objects were about eight meters in diameter, had a white and  |
| a red light beam, and left a cloud of white smoke. (Source: Jacques   |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 584).        |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - At 2:30 a.m. Mrs. Heitfeld, a resident of the Cincinnati       |
| suburb of Covedale, Ohio awoke with a terrible thirst. A bright light |
| outside her house then attracted her. She drew the curtains and saw a |
| line of lights forming an arc. Each light was as large as an open     |
| hand. There were six of them, separated from one another by 120 cm.   |
| She also observed another light hovering above a nearby parking lot.  |
| Inside this light she observed a gray "ape like" creature. She woke   |
| her 13-year-old son who also saw the creature. The being was          |
| completely surrounded by a bell-jar shaped area of light. No facial   |
| features could be discerned, but the witness could see a snout like   |
| feature on the face. Its body was uniformly gray, and it was moving   |
| its arms in the sort of jerky way a robot would. Ground traces from   |
| the UFO were later found. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,     |
