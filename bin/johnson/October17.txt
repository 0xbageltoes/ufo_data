| 1952 - At 12:50 a.m. in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, Alpes-Maritimes, France  |
| a whitish cylinder-shaped UFO hovered at a 45 degree angle in the sky |
| with 30 other UFOs in front of it. Through binoculars the small       |
| objects were made out to be red spheres with a yellow ring around     |
| them. Angel hair filament material fell to the ground. The fibers     |
| resembled wool or nylon strands, except when balled together became   |
| gelatinous, and sublimed. (Source: Aime Michel, The Truth About       |

| 1954 - In Cabasson, France a 65-year-old man was hunting with his dog |
| at 2:30 p.m. near the junction of the Brillance Canal and the Durance |
| River. He saw a gray object, about four meters long and one meter     |
| high on the ground and 40 meters away. It had a dome from which two   |
| helmeted figures emerged. The witness fled, but his dog started       |
| toward the object. The dog soon retreated, walking awkwardly as if    |
| partially paralyzed. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A |

| 1954 - A man was returning from fishing along the canal at Reims,     |
| Marne, France in the earlty evening when he saw a brightly lit        |
| cigar-shaped object resting on the grass near the canal. As he        |
| approached he saw it was about 26 feet long and 7 feet high. From one |
| end came “phosphorescent” lights, which reflected on the metallic     |
| hull of the object. A door appeared from which emerged three hairy    |
| dwarves, about 3 feet 9 inches tall, walking “crab-wise,” or          |
| sideways. Then an even smaller being, a little more than a meter tall |
| appeared, whose lower legs appeared transparent. The witness tried to |
| get closer, but the beings rushed back inside the object at           |
| surprising speed. Just then the witness was paralyzed by a red beam   |
| of light coming from a porthole in the craft, which turned            |
| yellow. The object took off and flew rapidly towards Tinquex. The     |
| witness was then able to recover his freedom of movement. (Sources:   |

| 1954 - At 8:30 p.m. three witnesses in Dole Gray, Jura department,    |
| France reported watching a luminous object maneuver in the sky,       |
| changing colors for ten minutes. Each color lasted several minutes.   |
| It finally shot away at high speed. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying      |

| 1954 - At 7:20 p.m. a luminous orb descended over Naples, Italy. It   |
| stopped and hovered just five meters above the ground. It rose again, |
| then flew away to the north, generating a great deal of national      |
| excitement and press coverage. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer       |

| 1954 - Cape Massulo, Italy. On the Isle of Capri an artist, Raffael   |
| Castelle, saw a disc five meters in diameter land on the property of  |
| Curzio Malaparte on this night. Upon approaching it he discovered it  |
| was not a helicopter as he first thought, and he saw four dwarfs      |
| wearing coveralls emerge from it. After 30 minutes the craft made a   |
| soft whirring sound and rose vertically, leaving blue sparks.         |

| 1965 - A domed, disc-shaped object with red lights around the edge    |
| zig-zagged below the clouds in Tully, Queensland, Australia on this   |
| day. It had landing gear displayed underneath. At 7:45 p.m. a Mr.     |
| Cock witnessed a flight of seven UFOs which passed overhead, then     |
| circled the city of Cairns, Queensland. They did not keep in a        |
| perfect line, but 1-2 dropped out of place from time to time. They    |
| flew off to the west. (Source:  Michael Hervey, UFOs over the         |

| 1971 - Two boys in Leicester, England reported that they witnessed an |
| object in the sky that bobbed up-and-down starting at 6:30 p.m. It    |
| turned red in color when it ascended, then turned white when it       |
| descended. When white it was so bright it hurt their eyes. They       |
| watched for 10 minutes before it went behind a tree. (Source: Mrs. K. |

| 1973 - There are 113 cases recorded in the UFOCAT database of UFO     |
| reports and close encounters on this day and night. There was one     |
| from Sweden and two from England, and the rest were from the United   |
| States. The common perception was that the UFO wave was concentrated  |
| in the South and the Midwestern States, but there were 10 reports     |
| from California including six close encounters. The state with the    |
| most reports was Tennessee, with 16, followed by Ohio, with 15.       |

| many reports, including a landing report with traces in Uniontown,    |
| Ohio at 7 p.m. and a vehicle interference CE-II report from Midland,  |

| Memphis, Tennessee by a metallic UFO emitting a beam of light. There  |
| were also aircraft UFO close encounters over Anaheim, California at 2 |
| p.m.; Shreveport, Louisiana on this evening; and Johnson City,        |
| Tennessee at 9 p.m. |

| 1973 - Shortly after midnight Pat Roach and her children Bonnie and   |
| Debbie were abducted and taken aboard a UFO in Lehi, Utah. They       |
| experienced 45 minutes of missing time; they found they had pin-prick |
| like marks in a triangle on their arms, and recalled going through    |
| physical examinations. Debbie was ill at the time, and reportedly was |
| healed as a result of her abduction experience. (Sources: John F.     |

| humming sound, walked out onto her front porch. There she saw a red,  |
| transparent ovoid object, 15 feet long and 6-8 feet high. On top was  |
| a bubble. Inside she saw a human figure standing up. Eighteen hours   |

| 1973 - At 5:40 a.m. near Crooked Mountain, Pennsylvania a small       |
| circular object with rotating lights hovered over a car being driven  |

| 1973 - On this evening a silver colored, oval-shaped object landed on |
| US Route 29 near Danielsville, Georgia about 300 feet ahead of Paul   |
| Brown's car, forcing him to make an immediate stop. Two small 4 1/2   |
| foot tall beings clad in silver suits and white gloves appeared       |
| underneath the UFO. They had reddish faces and white hair. When Mr.   |
| Brown stepped halfway out of his car with a gun in his hand the       |
| beings turned and re-entered the craft, which took off with a         |
| whooshing sound. Brown fired several shots at it with no apparent     |

| 1973 - A 50 foot wide UFO hovered two to three feet above Highway 82  |
| near Eupora, Mississippi at twilight, seemingly suspended on a "beam  |
| of light." The primary witness's car lights and engine died when it   |
| was 100 yards from the craft. Another car stopped just behind him. A  |
| second UFO hovered about 60 feet above the first, illuminating it     |
| with a light. Both craft were similar in appearance, like inverted    |
| cups, and had greenish blue flashing lights. A catfish like creature  |
| came out from the top of the lower UFO, holding onto a handrail. It   |
| had gray, fish-like skin, a wide mouth, one glowing eye, flipper like |
| feet and webbing between its legs like a "flying squirrel." It had    |
| feather like objects on its back, which opened and closed when it     |
| moved. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of    |

| 1973 - Two men were driving on Route 23 toward New York City from     |
| work when they saw a large, round, silver craft hovering over a field |
| near Wayne, New Jersey. The UFO landed, so they stopped and got out   |
| of their car. But then the driver then got scared and he decided to   |
| drive off. The other man stayed behind and conversed with seven       |
| human-like beings, four men and three women, who got out of the UFO.  |

| 1973 - Later this same night Police Chief Jeff Greenhaw of Falkville, |
| Alabama photographed a 5 1/2 foot tall being in a crinkly looking     |
| silvery suit after investigating a reported UFO landing. The Chief    |
| stopped his car in the road and the thing moved slowly like a robot   |
| toward the car. When 10 feet away it turned and began running. The    |
| Chief pursued it in his patrol car, but the being accelerated and     |
| disappeared when the car spun off the road. "He was running in a very |
| odd manner, from side to side, arms down to his sides, and it looked  |
| as if he had springs under his feet to propel him. He could take 10   |
| feet in one leap." The photo is regarded by some UFO investigators as |
| a hoax, as showing a man wrapped in aluminum foil. (Source: David F.  |

| light near Loxley, Alabama. He was pulled out of the truck by six     |
| robot-like beings that seemed to read his mind. The next thing he     |
| remembered he was back on the highway going about 90 mph in the       |
| truck. He may have been onboard for up to 30 minutes. A sulphur-like  |
| smell was noted during the encounter. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted    |

| 1976 - At 10:40 a.m. at Akita Airport, Japan Captain Masara Saito,    |
| age 34, an airline pilot for Toa Airlines, situated in an airliner on |
| the runway and preparing to takeoff, and the control tower observed a |
| glowing yellow disc, like two plates rim-to-rim. It hovered to the    |
| south near the airport for five minutes, then flew away toward the    |
| sea. Over 50 people witnessed the UFO. The object was estimated to be |
| 16 feet in diameter, at an estimated altitude of 1500 meters from the |
| ground. "It was something I had never seen before," said Captain      |
| Saito. Tazawa Takumi, air traffic controller on duty, who observed    |
| the object through binoculars, said it looked like "two plates placed |
| together, with the top one inverted." (Sources: Robert Gribble, MUFON |

| 1981 - Abel Boro was hunting with his friend Ribamar Ferreira in the  |
| rain forest in Matoes, near Parnarama, Maranhao State, Brazil when    |
| they saw a bright star that descended and hovered over the two        |
| terrified men, focusing its light on Boro. He climbed a tree and      |
| Ferreira ran away. The object hovered over the tree, spinning around  |
| and doing something bad to Boro, who was shaking with fear. His body  |
| was glittering. When Ferreira came back with help, Boro was dead; his |
| body was all white and he reportedly didn't have a drop of blood left |
| in him. (Sources: John F. Schuessler, UFO-Related Human Physiological |

| 1992 - At 4:00 p.m. a large green, vertical, cylindrical object with  |
| thin legs was sighted moving north between Chichester and Midhurst,   |
| West Sussex, England. It moved slowly at 30 mph at only 100 feet      |

| 1993 - At 10:00 a.m. an eleven-year-old girl and her cousin saw a     |
| gray, saucer-shaped object  with lights on the bottom in              |
| Connersville, Indiana. Three lights emerged from a fog and circled a  |

| 1999 - At 8:25 p.m. two cylinder-shaped crafts were seen maneuvering  |
| over a road near Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Two vehicles stalled |
| as the objects approached and several of the witnesses felt dizzy in  |
| the presence of the objects. The objects were silver in color and     |
| highly polished. Each object had a row of about 13 yellow-orange      |
| lights. There was also a blue haze around one of the objects. Also,   |
| at least two silhouettes of humanoid beings with large heads were     |
| seen in each of the crafts. The eyes of the beings were red and       |
| fiery, and were like slits. The UFOs did not land, but hovered just   |
| above the ground. There was a sudden sound like thunder, and the      |
| objects abruptly vanished. Scorch marks were reported to be found on  |
| the ground near where the objects had hovered. (Sources: Albert S.    |

| 2005 - In Welland, Niagara County, Ontario three witnesses reported   |
| seeing a bright white light at 7:00 p.m., which when it approached    |
| turned out to be a triangular craft with three lights on the bottom.  |
| It made no noise, and had red, blue and little white lights on it.    |
| The object rose up into the clouds. The sighting lasted 15-20         |
| seconds. (Sources: Geoff Dittman, 2005 Canadian UFO Survey, case #    |
