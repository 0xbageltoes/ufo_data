| 1950 - In Point Loma, California on this date in 1950 seven teardrop-shaped  |
| flying objects maneuvered near a weather balloon. Several navy        |
| personnel, including one using a theodolite to view the object,       |
| watched the UFO turn toward the W and fly away out over the Pacific   |
| Ocean. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. 1950:                |

| 1959 – At a few minutes after midnight in Oakdale, California several |
| witnesses sighted a seven-meter wide, bowl-shaped disc. Shadows were  |
| seen moving about inside the craft. (Source: APRO Bulletin,           |

| 1975 – Three 19-year-old girls driving together in Goodridge,         |
| Minnesota noticed a bright light in the sky, and their car's engine   |
| and lights failed. The light came closer and they saw it was an       |
| orange colored object, flat on top and round on the sides. It also    |
| had several flashing yellow lights and appeared to be 20-30 feet in   |
| diameter. After passing only 25 feet from the car, it suddenly        |
| vanished, whereupon and the car's lights and engine spontaneously     |
| came back on by themselves. (Sources: Warren (Minnesota) Sheaf,       |
| December 31, 1975; Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle      |
| Interference, case 391).                                              |

| 1978 – Three important UFO sightings occurred on this date. Dr.       |
| Palumbo, the director of the meteorological institute at the          |
| University of Naples in Naples, Italy saw a luminous object travel    |
| from the east to the west at a high rate of speed. It left no trail   |
| behind. At ten o’clock in the evening a luminous 12-meter diameter    |
| disc was sighted over a road in Albinia, Tuscany, Italy. It moved off |
| over some woods, and then turned and flew away toward the north.      |
| There was extensive news coverage of both sighting reports. In the    |
| state of Maldonado, Uruguay on a beach between the cities of          |
| Piriapolis and Funta del Este a reporter, Sr. L. Rengger, saw a giant |
| V-shaped formation of yellow lights. A couple of the lights pursued   |
| his car, and one of the two crossed the road in front of his car at   |
| an estimated 300 meters altitude at a distance of 500 meters.         |

| the Seneca Nuclear Power Plant in Warren, Pennsylvania. Either the    |
