| 1942 - At around 7:00 p.m. two soldiers in the air traffic control    |
| tower at the Army Air Corps Flying School in Columbus, Mississippi    |
| observed the rapid descent of two red round glowing objects that      |
| demonstrated extreme maneuverability and then hovered over the woods  |
| at the end of the runway. They next experienced an episode of missing |
| time as well as sensory dislocation: they found themselves out in a   |
| field with no memory of how they got there. (Sources: Richard M.      |

| 1948 - At 5:03 a.m. a farmer in Maplewood, Ohio observed a silvery    |
| sphere of large dimension rise from a wooded area and hover above his |
| farm. It dropped a silvery substance that disintegrated before        |

| 1955 - Eight children in Casa Blanca, Riverside County, California,   |
| from 4-15 years of age, saw a “semi transparent” round object of      |
| various colors in the sky at around three o'clock in the afternoon.   |
| It would appear and disappear with musical “pings.” Some adults were  |
| called to come see it, but they saw nothing. An object, “as large as  |
| 3 houses,” came down to hover three feet from the ground. Beside it   |
| appeared a transparent being 3.5 feet tall, with red eyes and mouth,  |
| and a brilliant disc on its belt. Other similar objects also landed,  |
| one on a housetop. One boy started walking toward one of the vessels  |
| and was forcibly restrained. Another saw a beckoning, disembodied arm |
| in mid-air. A creature with four arms appeared, and told two of the   |
| boys to climb a tree to be “picked up.” They did so, and a UFO        |
| started to approach with little men riding on its rim. One boy        |
| climbed down after a garden hose was turned on him by the other       |
| children; the other “slid” onto a nearby roof and then walked off it, |
| landing on his head, stunned but with no apparent serious injury.     |

| 1967 - In Cussac, Cantal department, France at 10:30 a.m. 13-year-old |
| Francois Delpeuch and his younger sister, Anne Marie, age 9, were     |
| tending their family cows when they saw four dwarfish figures, 3.5 to |
| four feet tall, on the other side of the road, dressed in black.      |
| Nearby was a six foot spherical object of dazzling brilliance that    |
| rested on the ground. On closer examination they saw that the beings  |
| were completely black---either naked, or wearing skin tight black     |
| coveralls. They had pointed heads or helmets, which were also black.  |
| One was picking something up from the ground, and another had a       |
| bright object, like a mirror. When the entities became aware of the   |
| children they rose up into the air vertically, one after the other,   |
| and plunged head first into the top of the sphere, which then rose in |
| a spiral pattern with a whistling noise. It left behind a smell of    |
| sulphur. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of |

| 1967 - In Warminster at Cradle Hill, England a cone-shaped UFO was    |
| seen by 25 witnesses watching for UFOs on this night. It landed 100   |
| meters from a copse of trees on Cradle Hill. Arthur Shuttlewood went  |
| toward the landing sight, and at 300 meters distance he spoke to a    |
| being (there are no details describing the being). The UFO went dark, |
| and as he walked back a creature of some sort flew overhead. (Source: |

| 1968 - At 9:30 p.m. six witnesses in San Sadurni de Osomort,          |
| Barcelona, Spain saw a UFO 200 meters away, hovering just two meters  |
| above the ground. It was a metallic sphere, which gave off a yellow   |
| light. At 9:40 p.m. several people in Castrejana, Vizcaya, Spain saw  |
| an object over the Mount Kobetas mountain peak for one minute. It was |
| square, with a dome on top, and extremely bright. (Sources:           |

| 1968 - Starting on this evening at 6:30 p.m., a group of children in  |
| Coleraine, Quebec, Canada on four consecutive evenings saw a strange  |
| being hanging onto a boulder overlooking a cemetery. He was a         |
| dwarfish humanoid about 4 feet tall, with a shaven or bald head,      |
| naked chest, heavy black beard, and with red and bumpy skin, “like    |
| that of a lizard.” This being would disappear into thin air           |
| unexpectedly. A roaring noise was also heard coming from an           |
| excavation at the foot of the boulder, and a kind of “flying saucer”  |
| was seen, about 30 feet wide and colored blue, white and red. It left |
| a long trail of smoke, and each time it “looked as if it were trying  |
| to land behind the boulder.” The children were Denis Bogus, age 7,    |
| who first saw the object; his brothers Michael and Andre, and their   |
| uncle, George Bogus; other adults who subsequently observed the       |
| phenomena were Normand Daigle and Luc Cadorette. (Source: David F.    |

| 1968 - Larry Sorenson was driving from Ely to Delta, Utah on this     |
| night when he saw a stationary bright, white light close to the       |
| horizon. It turned a red color and became much brighter. Sorenson's   |
| truck engine suddenly failed as he continued to drive towards the     |
| light. He got out and watched the light travel overhead and disappear |
| behind him. It was changing colors from red to green to white and     |
| back to red. After the light was gone, the truck could be restarted.  |
| Sorenson noticed another car had also been stopped on the road. When  |
| he got home, the trip had taken almost two hours longer to complete   |
| than expected, and he had to account for two hours of missing time    |
| with a possible UFO abduction experience. (Sources: Mark Rodeghier,   |

| 1970 - At 11:30 p.m. 18 witnesses from six families watched an oblong |
| or oval shaped object with a cupola during a close encounter near a   |
| lake in Enebacken, Sweden. The UFO changed color from red to orange   |
| to red as it moved about. The trees were illuminated by the close     |
| approach of the object, and it made a humming noise. The sighting     |
| lasted for two hours. Three round depressions were found in the grass |
| were the object apparently landed. The depressions were 40 cm in      |
| diameter, 5-7 cm deep, and arranged in an equilateral triangle 3      |
| meters apart. (Source: Sven-Olof Fredrickson, FSR, October 1971, p.   |

| 1972 - Three Reading, Pennsylvania police officers, including a       |
| sergeant, observed an oval-shaped object hovering several thousand    |
| feet in the sky above Mount Penn. They said the object changed color  |
| from white to red to bluish-green. After an unknown period of time,   |
| the UFO suddenly shot upward and out of sight, according to the       |
| officers. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, October 1972, p. 3).    |

| 1975 - At 10:45 p.m. Mr. R. Cyrus, a 48-year-old man driving on a     |
| clear night between Noe and Longages, France saw a three-meter        |
| diameter dark disc in a field that jumped at his car, then shot       |

| 1978 - On this night in Guemes, Cordoba province, Argentina an ovoid  |
| object with reddish flashes moved at a low altitude in the proximity  |
| of the local observatory. Residents discarded the notion that it was  |
| a plane. At 11:00 p.m. two UFOs appeared in the skies over the city   |
| of Mendoza, Argentina. Their estimated speed was 6000 kph, altitude   |
| 30,000-40,000 meters, and they were photographed with "special        |
| cameras and techniques." (Source: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping       |

| object on the ground, with two silvery-garbed humanoids standing next |
| to it. Another being was inside the transparent dome on the top of    |

| to stop and completely disabling its electrical system. The object    |
| resembled a large truck tire encircled with several red and orange    |
| lights. It was making a loud revving sound. The witness quickly got   |
| out of his truck and ran to an embankment. He then saw a short, heavy |
| set Grey humanoid within the glass canopy. It had a large head and    |
| glowing, slanted eyes. When another truck approached, the object rose |
| vertically and quickly flew away in a zig-zagging flight              |
| path. Scratch marks and an oily thick and foul smelling liquid was    |
| found on the truck's hood. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue #   |

| 1998 - A black triangle shaped UFO was seen in Calgary, Alberta,      |
| Canada at 1:30 a.m. The witness estimated the object to be "several   |
| times larger than an airplane." It hovered, than zipped across the    |
| sky in two seconds. (Source: Geoff Dittman, Canadian UFO Survey       |

| 2001 - A woman reported to the National UFO Reporting Center that     |
| her 12-year-old daughter came home from school in Grantville,         |
| Pennsylvania and said she had to tell her something, and she didn't   |
| think she would not believe her. At 7:47 p.m. she had seen            |
| two saucer-shaped craft in the sky that approached her; one had a     |
| "sparkly light" that came out of bottom of one of the ships in a      |
| tubular shape, that went towards the ground and stayed there for 15   |
| seconds, then came back up into the ship. "Then both ships left the   |
| area going away from our hours." He daughter is afraid that something |
| will happen to her or her family. She could not sleep well for        |
| several days since the event. (Source: George A. Filer & David E.     |

| 2001 - At 6:00 p.m. a black, triangular-shaped object was observed    |
| over Omaha, Nebraska in daylight for 45 seconds.  At 9:20 p.m. two    |
| very similar looking black, triangular objects , moving low to the    |
| ground, were seen in Marietta, Ohio for about a minute. They were     |
| moving very quickly in a northeasterly direction. (Source: Peter      |

| 2004 - In Omemee, Ontario, Canada a low, dark, cloud-like object was  |
| spotted in the sky at 7:35 p.m. that moved from west to east, changed |
| direction, then changed direction back again to west to east until it |
| was out of view. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 2004 Canadian UFO Survey,    |

| 2007 - At 11:34 p.m. a man had just let his dogs out into his         |
| backyard in Stafford, Virginia when they starting acting very         |
| aggresively. The older female dog got out the door and immediately    |
| ran down a hill as if to attack something. When the witness walked    |
| out and followed behind the dog, he illuminated the area with his     |
| handheld spotlight and saw what appeared to be two small beings,      |
| about 4 feet tall. They looked to be made out of light, that was      |
| faint but only illuminated their heads and hands, as if their bodies  |
| were cloaked by clothing. Next these two figures retreated quickly    |
| about ten feet down the hill, and, incredibly, seemed to crawl up     |
| into an unseen opening or portal. It looked like they were going up   |
| into a completely darkened craft. The witness could only describe it  |
| as a portal or window like opening, which didn’t emanate any light.   |
| He could still see that there must have been some sort of craft       |
| present, because when it started to move away it caused an air        |
| turbulence and a moving shadow two feet off the ground. He tried to   |
| shine his light on it but it seemed to absorb all light. As it moved  |
| away it rose up into the sky and then he could begin to make out a    |
| shape. Before the small figures entered the craft they looked back at |
| the witness, and their eyes glowed softly with a pale blue light, but |
| he could not see any other facial features. His dog stopped barking   |
| when the object left. The witness described the shape of the object   |
| as arrow shaped, about 20 feet long, with the pointed and narrow end  |
| in front and wider at the rear. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |
