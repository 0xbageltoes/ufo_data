| 1946 - Sr. Joao Prestes Filho, age 40, had anticipated an uneventful  |
| day of fishing in Aracariguama, Sao Paulo State, Brazil but he        |
| returned home at 7:30 p.m., terrified by his encounter with a beam of |
| light that came from the sky and struck him without warning nor any   |
| noise. He went into his house saying that he had been hit by a silent |
| beam of light, which stunned him and knocked him to the ground. A     |
| little while later his flesh looked like it had been cooked, as if it |
| had been exposed to intense microwave energy, and started a rapid     |
| deterioration. He died from the effects.  (Sources: Felipe Machado    |

| 1950 - At 1:30 a.m an ex-Air Force officer driving on Highway 80 in   |
| Saltsburg, Pennsylvania said he watched a turtle shell-shaped disc    |
| hovering at low altitude. The 15 meter wide object kept away from him |
| when the witness attempted to approach it. At 7:00 a.m. on this same  |
| date twenty witnesses watched a 25 foot wide, extremely bright UFO    |
| maneuver in the sky over Gering, Nebraska. It appeared to change      |
| shape as it flew off toward the southeast. In the afternoon a         |
| metallic flying disc trailing some kind of ribbon hovered, darted     |
| about, and jumped into some clouds over Houston, Texas. It left       |
| flying toward the east. That night in Bloomfield, New Mexico a dark,  |
| five-foot diameter disc paced a car. When the driver stopped the car  |
| the object circled the car, then sped away at a high speed. (Sources: |

| 1953 - Two separate UFO radar-visual events occurred at two           |
| locations, in northeast Georgia and across the river in South         |
| Carolina. An object maneuvered in the sky at 5:07 p.m., then circled  |
| Congareee AFB in Sumter County, South Carolina, flying into a         |
| prohibited area. An earlier radar-visual sighting of a disc-shaped    |
| object was made at the Savannah River (Nuclear) Project. at 3:45 p.m. |
| The sighting lasted for two hours and seven minutes, and RF-80        |
| fighter jets and Air National Guard F-51's were scrambled to          |
| intercept. The U.S. Air Force attempted to explain the sightings as a |
| weather balloon. (Sources: Project Blue Book Report #11, report dated |

| 1957 - On this morning at 8:13 a.m. a fighter pilot flying over       |
| Rouen, France photographed a hat-shaped saucer identical in           |
| appearance to the McMinnville, Oregon photograph taken by Paul Trent  |
| in 1950. (Sources: Life Magazine, April 1, 1966; Frank Edwards,       |

| 1965 - On this afternoon two radar technicians were repairing the     |
| height finder radar antenna located northeast of Benton Air Force     |
| Base near Red Rock, Pennsylvania when a small metallic looking        |
| saucer-shaped object landed near them. A beam of light came out of    |
| the object and struck both technicians, and that was the last they    |
| could remember of the incident. They failed to report to their        |
| command post, and a search by both military and civilian police       |
| ensued. Sixteen hours later a state trooper found the two men walking |
| on Route 487 in a dazed state. They were taken to a local hospital    |
| and found to be dehydrated. Later, trace amounts of alpha radiation   |
| were found on their clothing, and unexplained marks were discovered   |
| on their necks. One of the men had a brief recollection of            |
| encountering strange short creatures, who poked instruments into his  |
| eyes, ears, and mouth. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer database;    |

| 1966 - At 9:00 p.m. a 20 meter in diameter bowl-shaped saucer with a  |
| hexagonal cabin hovered over a golf course in Melbourne, Victoria,    |
| Australia making a humming sound. It shot away extremely fast.        |

| 1967 - At 1:25 a.m. in Lovasen, Vilhelmina, Sweden two discs, one 30  |
| meters in diameter and the other 15 meters in diameter, hovered at 20 |
| meters altitude near an electric plant. They flew to the              |
| north, slowly at first and then extremely fast, lighting up the       |
| surrounding forest. (Source: Axe Jonsson, FSR, March-April 1968,      |

| 1967 - Four members of the Carter family were driving together        |
| between Pierre and Midland, South Dakota on this night when they were |
| approached at telephone pole height by a V-shaped object with a       |
| bright light. It made a humming sound as it passed low over the car   |
| and it illuminated the ground with a bright light, and the occupants  |
| felt a numbness. It thensped away erratically. (Sources: Rapid City   |

| 1967 - At 11:00 p.m. U.S. Air Force security personnel watched as a   |
| disc-shaped object descended and hovered over a missile site near     |
| Minot AFB, North Dakota. Reported by the guards, other airmen in      |
| trucks chased it. It shot up vertically when jets were scrambled.     |
| There was radar confirmation of the presence of the object. (Sources: |

| 1971 - Gilbert Camus, a radio technician, was driving to his shop in  |
| Savigny, Jura department, France at 1:10 a.m. He was between Trenal   |
| and Condamine when he noticed lights ahead on the right side of the   |
| road. As he approached, he saw that these were on a line of eight     |
| bluish luminescent rectangles on the ground in a marshy meadow beside |
| the road. Above them he could distinguish, in the moonlight, a        |
| flattened hemispherical dome, apparently of dark metal, about 25 feet |
| high and 50 feet wide.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| When he got closer to the object he saw three "animals" on all fours  |
| climbing up the road bank. Their heads were level with his windshield |
| so they "must have been of great stature." Their heads were shaped    |
| like an ant's with "a rounded lobe flanked by two other lobes         |
| swelling out like cheeks." He saw no faces. In the meadow he could    |
| see about 20 more of these beings, some upright and others on all     |
| fours. His car had just passed them when it filled with a bluish      |
| white light from behind, as if a "ray" had been projected at him. He  |
| lost control of the car, which spontaneously slowed down to about 12  |
| mph, then recovered its initial speed when he reached the outskirts   |
| of Condamine. Later, when he took off his clothes he found on his     |
| shirt, below the belt line, several golden yellow rectangles about 1" |
| by 2". These disappeared after a few minutes. Three days later        |
| similar chocolate brown rectangular marks appeared on his undershirt, |
| and these persisted through 3 or 4 washings.                          |
|                                                                       |
| The paint began to come off his car when he washed it. Most           |
| surprisingly, he found himself cured of a liver ailment, which until  |
| then had been giving him excruciating headaches. A semi-elliptical    |
| imprint was found in the meadow the next day about an inch deep, with |
| a long axis of about 36 feet. Inside the circle dandelions, abundant  |
| elsewhere in the meadow were absent, and where it crossed a drainage  |
| ditch the ice in the ditch had melted, and the water still seemed     |
| warm. At the edge of the woods beside the ground marks a large tree   |
| branch was freshly broken off. In the snow were footprints like those |
| of "shoes without heels", some as big as 16" long. (Source: David F.  |

|                                                                       |
| 1976 - At dusk Mrs. T.  went to her back doorstep in Cheshire,        |
| Connecticut to call in the children. When she looked up she saw an    |
| object moving slowly at treetop level “a few thousand feet away.” Her |
| husband came out and saw it, two. It had a translucent dome on top    |
| and gold lights around its periphery. Above the dome was a deep red   |
| flashing light, and there were holes in the bottom out of which a     |
| blue light shone. Mr. T. estimated its size as 80 feet in diameter.   |
| It descended among some trees in a wetlands area near their home.     |
| They watched it for two hours, until 9:30 p.m. The man and his two    |
| sons then got in their van and drove to a point closer to the object. |
| They noticed an unnatural silence, but could not get a good view.     |
| When they returned home Mrs. T. was missing. After searching the      |
| house, they returned to the living room when she suddenly showed up.  |
| Her speech was slow and slurred, and she claimed that she had been in |
| the bedroom. At 11:30 p.m. the couple went to bed, but they woke up   |
| at 12:45 a.m., finding that they had somehow exchanged positions in   |
| bed. Both felt nauseous, and the back door of their house was found   |
| to be open. The next day an investigator visited them and discovered  |
| three wedge-shaped holes in the ground and broken tree branches where |
| the UFO had evidently landed near the house. A few days later the     |
| couple vaguely remembered being taken onboard the craft during the    |
| hour before they woke up. The husband clearly recalled “being in a    |
| galley area where they were eating. An extraterrestrial was sitting   |
| there with his head on his hand looking up at me as if saying, “What  |
| are you doing here?” This being had wrinkled whitish gray skin, high  |
| cheekbones, a high forehead, and eyes that were three or four times   |
| bigger than human eyes; he was also bald. He was looking at the man   |
| with an expression of “disdain.” Under hypnosis the wife remembered   |
| much more. One kind of alien was about four feet tall, a second       |
| group, “the doers”, were about 5.5 feet tall; and a third type with   |
| huge eyes and pupils like that of a cat, was 6.6 feet tall. The       |
| couple said the beings communicated with them by telepathy, and that  |
| they believe that “their minds have been probed by extraterrestrials  |
| since the March incident.” (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,     |

| 1976 - Miss Rasmussen, a 23-year-old woman in Redmond, Oregon first   |
| saw an object high in the sky at 9:25 p.m., which then dropped down   |
| to an altitude of only 75 feet. The object was disc-shaped, about 26  |
| feet in diameter, and had red and white lights revolving around its   |
| exterior. Two light beams were directed from the object to the        |
| ground. The radio in her car went dead when the object came near, and |
| although the woman kept driving, the radio did not work again until   |
| two miles down the road. The object did not follow the car. (Sources: |

| 1977 - At 11:00 p.m. Lonnie Stites and his wife, Deborah, were        |
| driving their pickup truck around a bend in the road in McNatt,       |
| Missouri when "the whole area lit up like a football field light was  |
| turned on, and a very bright light was shined on our windshield." He  |
| saw a man of normal height or slightly smaller stature standing       |
| alongside the road. He was human looking, but dressed in green        |
| coveralls with square glasses and a tight green cap over his ears. He |
| was "waving us down." Up on the hill was another figure carrying what |
| appeared to be "a ball of electricity about the size of a             |
| basketball." The second figure was walking away from an object that   |
| looked like a water tank, about 10 feet across and 10 to 15 feet      |
| tall, with red lights going around it. The UFO was about 50-60 feet   |
| from them. Mrs Stites said that she saw two people on the hillside    |
| carrying "basketball sized lights," and that the UFO at one point     |
| flew over the truck. They turned the truck around and drove away in   |
| great fear. (Sources: St Louis (MO) Post-Dispatch, May 1, 1977; David |
| F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case   |

| 1992 - A military policeman, Luis Ribeiro de Oliveira and his friend  |
| Pedro Rodrigues da Silva, had gone hunting for wild ducks in an       |
| isolated area in the Rio Palhano area, Ceara State, Brazil. At 6:30   |
| p.m. both men observed what appeared to be a "star" descending at     |
| high speed. Suddenly a bright light enveloped both men and Pedro ran  |
| and hid behind some nearby bushes, while Luis ran towards town with   |
| the light chasing close behind him. Luis could see that the light now |
| resembled a luminous, wheel-shaped object the size of a bus. Soon he  |
| felt he was being sucked up into the object, while his friend Pedro   |
| watched in terror as he saw Luis being taken up into the light. Pedro |
| saw Luis enter the round light and then it suddenly vanished in plain |
| view. Terrified but determined to help, Pedro armed himself with a    |
| shotgun and searched the area. However, was unable to find Luis       |
| anywhere in the area, so he ran to town and entered the local bar,    |
| telling everyone what had just happened.                              |
|                                                                       |
| Five hours later Luis appeared in town and told Pedro what had        |
| happened to him after he disappeared. He remembered running and his   |
| legs suddenly becoming numb. He then recovered consciousness, hearing |
| strange foreign sounding voices, and when he looked up he saw five    |
| strange humanoid beings standing in front of him. Frightened, he      |
| asked them in Portuguese what was going on, and he received the       |
| following answer: "Don't be afraid, we won't harm you, we are         |
| Catadorians from Catandorius Decnius. Our civilization originated     |
| from another higher civilization that lived on the earth 353,000      |
| years ago." They pointed to a small pyramid shaped object and told    |
| Luis that it was a model of their "temple." The aliens told Luis that |
| they were here on Earth looking for remnants and descendants of that  |
| lost civilization that they claimed lived in underground caves and    |
| tunnels worldwide. Luis was then placed inside a gas-filled sphere in |
| the middle of the room. In front of him was a panel with multicolored |
| lights, and he heard what sounded like radio transmissions. The five  |
| beings stood around him, standing about 1.5 meters (4½ feet) tall,    |
| and spoke in a strange language. Nevertheless, their leader could     |
| communicate with the witness telepathically in perfect Portuguese.    |
| Soon the leader left to speak with the other aliens, and Luis lost    |
| consciousness again. When he woke up he found himself in the same     |
| place that the UFO had originally picked him up from. Feeling a       |
| little dizzy, he searched for Pedro and found his shotgun, and then   |
| walked back to town. Luis described the humanoids as short with gray  |
| skin, black eyes lacking any pupils or eyelashes, large heads, wide   |
| shoulders, and they wore tight fitting clothing with boots and        |
| gloves. Their heads and bodies were completely hairless. Their speech |
| was measured and their breathing was heavy and labored. Every time    |
| their leader spoke to the others Luis felt a sharp pain in his head.  |
| All the humanoids were identical to each other; he could not tell any |
| difference among them. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer database,    |

| 1994 - A radio died inside the house of the witness at 10:50 p.m. in  |
| Martigues, Bouches-Rhone department, France when a delta-shaped       |
| object oscillated in the sky outside. The object flew on a            |

| 1997 - At eight o'clock in the morning a two-meter long vertical      |
| cylinder was spotted landed in a field in San Martino d'Spino,        |
| Lombardia, Italy. The craft measured one meter in diameter, had three |
| legs and two portholes. It took off to the west when approached.      |

| 2004 - Some famous UFO photographs were taken on this day near Mexico |
| City, Mexico. A Mexican military surveillance aircraft captured       |
| multiple objects (11) with its infra-red sensors.  The objects were   |
| not visible to the flight crew at the time.  There was extensive      |
| publicity about this event in May 2004. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U      |
