| 1870 - At 6:30 p.m. in the Atlantic Ocean south of Cape Verde, the    |
| crew of the steamship Lady of the Lake sighted a gray object in the   |
| sky divide into four connected sections while it flew against the     |
| wind. Behind it trailed a long hook connected to the center of the    |
| UFO. It was visible for at least 30 minutes. (Sources: Gordon I. R.   |

| 1950 - At 5:45 a.m. two industrialists in Spain saw a bright blue,    |
| cloud-like object while driving in Villarta de San Juan, Ciudad Real  |
| Province. It emitted a very bright light that appeared to collide     |
| with the object. The UFO was seen again 20 times during their drive.  |

| 1950 - At Kirtland AFB, New Mexico eleven USAF Sergeants watched a    |
| tan-colored flying wing head towards the northwest, turn to the       |
| north, and then fly off at a fantastic speed. (Source: Loren E.       |

| 1953 - At two o'clock in the morning in an isolated cabin in Tujunga  |
| Canyon, California two young women in their early twenties, Shaw and  |
| Whitley, remembered seeing an oscillating light followed by a period  |
| of about two hours of missing time. Under hypnosis an abduction       |
| scenario was recalled. Seven or eight beings, all dressed in black    |
| tight-fitting one-piece suits, entered the cabin through closed       |
| windows (that is, they somehow passed through the glass panes in the  |
| windows). They had oval-shaped, hairless faces. Six of the beings     |
| were about five feet tall. Two of the beings were of average height   |
| but thin, estimated at 5 feet 7 inches tall. They all had slender     |
| builds, narrow shoulders, and long arms. The abductees were           |
| paralyzed, taken aboard a domed disc, and given physical exams. The   |
| UFOnauts communicated with each other using an unintelligible         |
| language, but they used telepathy with the abductees, and allegedly   |
| left them with some information about future events. (Sources: Ann    |

| 1966 - On this night near the airfield in Key West, Florida in 1966 several  |
| disc-shaped UFOs with flashing lights around the rim were sighted     |
| from an outdoor theater. The UFOs hovered, then shot away. (Source:   |

| 1967 - A 14-year-old teenager named from Wapello, Iowa reported       |
| seeing a domed, disc-shaped flying object with legs near his home.    |
| The UFO had a central row of portholes and multicolored lights. The   |
| UFO hovered for a short while, then flew away at high speed. This is  |
| a Project Blue Book "unidentified" case. (Source: Ann Druffel, MUFON  |

| 1969 - Two unidentified teenage girls were returning home in the      |
| Colegio Batista district of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil at   |
| around 8 p.m. when they saw a luminous object with a blue light       |
| hovering in the west. It had a ring of white lights around it and     |
| appeared to be spinning. At home later one of the girls went to the   |
| window and saw a little man near a gate ten meters away. He was       |
| standing erect and facing her window. He wore a kind of diving suit   |
| with a soft green luminosity, and a helmet through which she could    |
| see a pair of glowing reflective eyes, like those of a cat. She told  |
| her earlier companion and a third girl. The second girl also saw the  |
| entity, who by then was standing facing sideways. The third girl ran  |
| to the aid of the first witness who was so frightened by the figure's |
| appearance she went into a state of shock. That same evening the      |
| boyfriend of one of these girls was walking on the other side of the  |
| city when the streetlights went out and he saw the faintly            |
| illuminated silhouettes of two small figures standing on a precipice  |
| above the street only a few meters away from him. Frightened, he      |
| hurried on, but walking through the area later the streetlights were  |
| on again and the figures were gone. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted    |
