| 1663 - At noon on this day a large ball of fire, 45 meters in         |
| diameter, descended toward Lake Robozero, Bieloziero, Russia. Two     |
| beams of light came from the object and was directed onto fisherman   |
| in a boat on the lake. The water in the lake was illuminated to a     |
| depth of 30 feet. The fisherman were burned by the heat from the      |
| beams, and the water became covered with a "rust" material. (Sources: |

| 1948 - In the early afternoon many people in Phoenix, Arizona         |
| witnessed four silver disc-shaped objects that flew fast from east to |
| west, then flipped in sequence. Three of the objects were seen again  |
| later. (Sources: George Eberhart, A Geo-Bibliography of Anomalies, p. |

| 1951 - Five witnesses including an engineer watched maneuvering       |
| disc-shaped UFOs in Grant County, New Mexico at around 10:45 a.m.     |
| They first saw two disc-shaped objects that swooped down at a 45      |
| degree angle and entered a cloud, next hovered for a short while, and |
| then three objects emerged from the cloud, leaving behind a vapor     |
| trail. They went from hovering to speeding off in excess of 500       |
| mph instantaneously, and had portholes or orifices below the rim      |
| line. (Source: letter to Edward Sullivan, Civilian Saucer             |

| 1954 - At 10:20 p.m. USAF Major W. J. Davis and Captain R. D. Sauers  |
| were flying a U.S. Air Force C-47 transport plane over San Marcos     |
| AFB, Texas when they sighted a dark blue oblong object that paced the |
| C-47, veered away, then crossed in front of it. The incident lasted   |
| five minutes. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns;  |

| 1957 - In Atchison, Kansas around 9:00 p.m. three women watched four  |
| small discs, estimated to be only five centimeters thick, dart and    |
| maneuver around the sky for 30 minutes, then hide from an airplane    |
| that passed overhead. They were described as glowing, and flew off to |
| the southeast. (Sources: Atkinson (KS) Globe, August 16, 1957; Loren  |

| 1964 - At 1:20 a.m. in New York City, New York Mr. S. F. D'Alessandro |
| watched a 10' x 5' bullet-shaped object with wavy lines on the        |
| rounded front part and six pipes along the straight rear portion fly  |
| through the sky, making a "whishhh" sound. The witness's dog growled  |
| during the sighting. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO      |

| 1964 - At 8:15 a.m. E. J. Haug of the San Francisco Orchestra and the |
| San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and C. R. Bubb, a high school    |
| mathematics teacher, sighted three UFOs while vacationing at Yosemite |
| National Park, California. The three bright silver, round objects     |
| flew in a stack formation at a high speed, changing positions within  |
| the formation. The sound of rushing air was heard during the 3-4      |
| seconds that the sighting lasted. (Source: Don Berliner, Project      |

| 1965 - At 5:00 p.m. two large orange spheres zig-zagged over a        |
| pasture in Pitlochry, Tayside, Scotland, causing the livestock to     |
| panic. There were several witnesses, and the sighting lasted for an   |
| hour. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case # 6880, citing  |

| 1965 - On a highway in Salto, Uruguay at 11:00 p.m. five people in a  |
| car heard a loud hum and then saw a UFO land directly in front of     |
| their car, stalling the car's engine. Its brilliant white luminescent |
| glow changed to red, then to yellow, and then to green. The object    |
| itself, a leaden color, was nine feet in height and as wide as the    |
| road. Three human-looking figures could be seen moving inside the     |
| UFO, illuminated by a green light. Finally, with a burst of orange    |
| flame, the object rose vertically and vanished. (Sources: Coral & Jim |

| 1965 - An hour later, at 11:00 p.m. EDT, a domed disc hovered 100     |
| feet over the lake in Salem, New Hampshire. The dome had a central    |
| mast and its rim glowed red and yellow, and it was making a humming   |
| sound. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors, p.  |

| 1966 - At around 2:00 a.m. Mr. & Mrs. Palmer in Wood Green, outside   |
| of London, England had a ten minute close encounter with a            |
| disc-shaped object that caused lasting physiological effects and left |

| 1967 - A young boy on a farm near Port Perry, Durham county, Ontario, |
| Canada heard a loud oscillating noise at 7:30 a.m., and went over a   |
| hill in the direction of the sound to investigate. On the other       |
| side he saw what appeared to be a landed disc-shaped craft with four  |
| metallic legs, but instead of resting on the landing gear it was      |
| actually hovering just above the ground. On a platform around its     |
| perimeter were seated eight to ten little men about three feet tall,  |
| who wore tight fitting brown uniforms. A circular depression 12 feet  |
| in diameter was later found on the ground at the site. (Source: David |

| 1968 - A married couple with a 5-year-old son were driving between    |
| Villaverde and Brenes, Sevilla province, Spain at 12:30 a.m. when     |
| they saw a landed UFO by the side of the road. They said it resembled |
| a small bus with windows and luminous portholes. (Source:             |

| 1968 - In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil a six meter in diameter hat-shaped   |
| disc hovered five meters over a field at 4:00 a.m., 100 meters away.  |
| It had three rods or antennae that were pointing up, as well as       |
| portholes. (Source: Irene Granchi, UFO Abductions and Reports from    |

| 1968 - A silent, dazzling blood-red globe of light was seen hovering  |
| and pulsating at treetop level in Cambridge, Massachusetts at just    |

| 1970 - A man named Rodrigues had a 15 minute close encounter with a   |
| Saturn-shaped object at 9:00 p.m. in Marilia, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The  |
| object followed his car for several miles. (Source: Jose Arnaldo,     |
| Phenomenes Spatiaux, March 1971, p. 22).                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1970 - The witness, who was staying at his parents home that night,   |
| felt a strange compulsion to go out and drive to nearby Lake Michigan |
| in order to watch the sky. He had arrived at the shore near Good      |
| Hart, Michigan at around 10:30 p.m. when a very bright light caught   |
| his eye. It seemed to have a descending trajectory, and he discounted |
| any mundane explanation for what he saw. Watching through a           |
| telescope, he realized that the craft had orange, yellow, green and   |
| blue indigo lights. He could now see a large disc-shaped outline that |
| glided lower towards his position. He saw a very brightly lit, large  |
| cartouche-shaped window. Inside he caught a glimpse of some figures   |
| who seemed to be peering over a console or instrument panel. The      |
| craft descended silently behind a rise about 100 yards from the       |
| witness. It hovered for a moment, then settled down on the beach.     |
|                                                                       |
| For 15-20 minutes he saw no movement around the object, and so,       |
| curious, he walked towards it. The air around the UFO felt warm. He   |
| stopped about 50 feet from the huge object and heard a metallic       |
| sound. By the faint light available he saw a ramp come snaking out of |
| the side of the ship toward him. The ramp sloped up to the blank      |
| hull. There was no opening visible, just a long ramp like a tongue    |
| sticking out from the side and burying itself in the sand just ahead  |
| of the witness. Without giving it much thought he walked up the ramp, |
| and as he approached the hull seemed to dissolve ahead of him. He     |
| walked through an opening that appeared in his path. The interior of  |
| the ship resembled terra-cotta stone, and there was a soft            |
| illumination that emanated from the walls. It was comfortably cool    |
| inside and the air smelled of sage and cinnamon. He was in a corridor |
| that stretched ahead of him in both directions until it disappeared   |
| beyond inside walls. Various small openings with little handles and   |
| knobs were situated at what appeared to be random locations along the |
| corridor. He walked to his left down the corridor, the aroma of sage  |
| and cinnamon pervasive and persisting. He soon found a door and       |
| realized that the passage behind him was closing itself off into a    |
| door as well.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| He walked into what appeared to be a central core of the object.      |
| Moments later he came upon an improbably placed viewing plate in      |
| which he could see the south end of Lake Michigan and lights from the |
| nearby Big Rock Nuclear Power Plant. As he spoke to himself, his      |
| voice echoed strangely through the confines of the ship. He noticed   |
| to his right a view plate. He caught a glance through the darkened    |
| glass of several creatures that seemed to be at the controls. He      |
| looked inside the control room and saw five figures all with their    |
| backs to him. The figures were humanoid in form with large heads.     |
| They seemed to be occupied with a series of procedures. The five were |
| all dressed in a similar style. The outfits were form-fitted, and     |
| tended to give off a bluish glow. The middle figure turned slowly to  |
| face him. The eyes of the humanoid were much larger than a human's    |
| and spread farther around the sides of the head. No nose was visible, |
| with flat cheekbones, lending a somewhat rotund appearance to the     |
| face .                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| At one point the witness saw himself in his own mind, apparently the  |
| way the creatures perceived him. The beings communicated via          |
| telepathy and he was escorted into another room where he was sat in a |
| chair with knobs and controls in front of it. There he saw 3-D images |
| flash through his mind at very high speed. At one point the aliens    |
| brought him a small cube-shaped container that contained a dark blue  |
| liquid, which he was told to drink. The aliens spoke among each other |
| in a strange singsong language. He was told that, among other things, |
| that the speed of light was "imaginary." He received the impression   |
| that the craft was impossibly larger inside than what it looked like  |
| from the outside. The aliens told him that their main interest in     |
| coming to earth was water. He was eventually deposited back at the    |
| same spot on the beach where he was initially picked up. (Source:     |

| from Wolfeboro, Carroll County, New Hampshire. Their sighting lasted  |
| for 15-20 minutes. At 11:00 p.m. a large cigar-shaped UFO was also    |
| sighted by four witnesses in nearby Gilford, Belknap County, New      |
| Hampshire. The object was estimated to be about 300 feet long and the |
| sighting lasted 40 minutes.  (Sources: (1) George D. Fawcett, Flying  |

| inside the craft. (Sources: International UFO Reporter, July-August   |

| 1990 - On this night on Iona Island, Scotland Edward Carlos, who had  |
| been involved in other previous close encounters, saw an inexplicable |
| beam of light coming down through the clouds. Shortly after, the beam |
| struck him and he experienced a missing time episode. Later, under    |
| hypnotic regression, he recalled being examined by several humanoid   |
| entities, including a reptilian-like humanoid, several small pallid   |
| skinned humanoids, and insect-like robotic creatures. He recalled     |
| having an anal probe examination to determine his health. The beings  |
| also examined his various vital organ systems, including his heart,   |
| and they then used a laser-like light to allegedly clear Carlos's     |
| arteries of plaque. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1990 Humanoid         |

| 1992 - In Marshfield, Missouri a boomerang-shaped object was seen by  |
| two witnesses at 5:30 a.m. As the lights on the object passed over    |

| object, one and a half times the size of a house, was seen overhead   |
| by a 23-year-old man while in his car at 12:07 a.m. It rotated on its |

| 1995 - A witness was lying in bed in his bedroom in Grand Haven,      |
| Michigan at 9:05 p.m. when he saw flashing lights that changed from   |
| blue to white. Four little creatures approximately 3-4 feet tall then |
| appeared around his bed. Two were around his legs and the other two   |
| were up around his waist area. The creatures seemed to be doing some  |
| type of medical procedure on him. He then passed out and saw flashing |
| lights again, and then the lights vanished. (Source: Albert S.        |

| 1995 - At around ten o'clock in the evening a huge bright light       |
| buzzed a car driving on U.S. Highway 160 ten miles east of Alamosa,   |
| Colorado. A gigantic dark shadow flew east, surrounded by many much   |
| smaller blinking lights. The kids in the car were badly frightened.   |

| 1995 - At 10:40 p.m. in the northern Sangre de Cristo Mountains, near |
| Howard, Fremont County, Colorado a local Vietnam vet claimed to have  |
| seen a large boomerang-shaped object appear from the north and hover  |
| over his mountain property. He then had 40 minutes of missing time,   |
| during which his he claimed his mobile home and truck had been picked |
| up and moved "6 inches", based on the altered location of the         |
| building and the truck's tracks. He reported he had a swollen welt,   |
| 4-inches in length, in his rectum after regaining consciousness. Over |
| the next two weeks he lost 20 lbs., and a wild animal he had          |
| befriended, his "pet black bear", was now missing. He said that he    |
| had been having strange sightings occurring since the middle of June  |
| 1995, and that he had discovered "piles of carcasses" up the slope    |
| from his 9,000-foot elevation land. He claimed the carcasses had been |
| in various stages of decay, and that they were comprised mostly       |
| of cattle, but also horses, fox, raccoon and other animals found in   |
| the area. He also said that two weeks before his apparent abduction   |
| experience, he found "tiny 4-toed human tracks" around the perimeter  |
| of his trailer site. He had also noted unusual military activity in   |
| the area as well. Often, after his UFO sightings, he would notice     |
| unusually heavy military flights over the area, which convinced him   |
| his government was somehow involved with the strange occurrences. For |
| instance, after one sighting episode when he was able to photograph   |
| the strange craft, the next day while he was gone from his home       |
| somebody had ransacked his trailer, and had taken all of his film and |
| camera equipment. (Sources:Christopher O'Brien, Enter the Valley, p.  |

| 1995 - At midnight another witness awoke in Buena Park, California to |
| briefly see an extremely bright light out on the patio. It appeared   |
| to be hovering about 3-4 feet from the ground. Later that night he    |
| was still very shaken when he saw a humanoid figure with a very large |
| head and standing about four feet tall. The figure had an amazingly   |
| smooth stride, almost like it was walking on air. It seemed to move   |
| above the ground in the patio area just outside the blinds.           |
| Everything vanished suddenly. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |

| it at it hovered nearby for the next 20 minutes. (Sources: GEIPAN;    |

| several figures could be seen moving around. There was another flash  |
| and the craft disappeared. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |
