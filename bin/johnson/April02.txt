|                                                                       |
| 1958 - On the evening of this day in 1958 a cigar-shaped UFO maneuvered      |
| along the course of the Ohio River. It had a long row of portholes    |
| along its side, and flew downriver. (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO    |
| Evidence (Volume I), p. 137).                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - Late on this night in Medina, New York Miss Shane Kurz, who    |
| had been observing UFOs maneuvering in the skies for the past several |
| nights, had gone to bed after seeing another one. She suddenly felt   |
| paralyzed, and then lost track of time. She remembers a bright light  |
| outside her window and a loud humming sound. Her next memory is       |
| waking up with her foot covered with mud, her eyes swollen shut, and  |
| a triangular shaped burn mark on her abdomen. Later under hypnosis,   |
| she remembered being somehow taken into an ovoid metallic gray craft  |
| with lights around a revolving rim. She found herself inside an       |
| octagon-shaped room with lights that seemed to emanate from all       |
| around her. She was then placed on a black slab like table and was    |
| unable to move. Later she saw a being with an oval-shaped face, very  |
| light skin, and large black almond shaped eyes. The being             |
| communicated with her, apparently by using telepathy, and told her    |
| she would not be harmed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |
| Database 1967, case # 1937, citing personal communication from the    |
| witness, Shane (Kurz) Sia).                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1971 - In 1971, a middle-aged man in Greenhill, New South Wales, Australia   |
| was standing in his kitchen at around 10 p.m. when he noticed a small |
| entity standing outside. The man, an Australian aborigine, next felt  |
| a sucking force that pulled him outside, smashing him through a glass |
| window that had an iron bar across it with a clearance of less than a |
| foot. His wife, hearing the pane of glass breaking, entered the       |
| kitchen in time to see her 5' 2" husband disappearing horizontally    |
| through the lower pane, which was 4.5 feet from the floor. To jump    |
| through it would have been impossible, as it was only 32 inches wide  |
| and only 10 inches in height, and fronted upon the kitchen sink. The  |
| distance to the ground outside was seven feet. The man was terrified, |
| yet he could not run from the strange being out of fear. Instead, he  |
| went towards it. He was discovered on the ground by a relative, cut   |
| and bruised, seven feet away from the smashed glass. This strange     |
| occurrence took place only hours after a number of people in nearby   |
| Kempsey had observed a strange bright light in the sky. (Sources:     |

| HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1971-13, citing Miss      |
| Patricia Riggs).                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - In 1972 a UFO was seen over Greensburg, Pennsylvania at 9:30 p.m.,    |
| swaying back and forth in the sky in a "falling leaf" motion.         |
| (Source: Stan Gordon, Westmoreland County UFO Study Group).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1976 - Mr. Bazargani from Chalus, Iran was walking through a forest near his |
| home on this day in 1976 when he had a UFO stop directly overhead. He |
| realized he was paralyzed and could not move when he saw four beings  |
| emerge from the craft via a ladder. They took him aboard and brought  |
| him into a oval-shaped room. The UFO occupants were described as      |
| having big noses and thin lips. They took a strange looking           |
| instrument that emitted light and scanned it over his body from head  |
| to foot. His abduction lasted two days. (Source: David F. Webb and    |
| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case A1466).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1980 - Another UFO abduction occurred on this day in 1980 in Pudasjarvi,     |
| Finland. Ms. Ivanoff, age 25, was driving her car across a bridge     |
| when her car entered a fog and her car headlights were deflected      |
| upwards. She saw a silver domed disc with portholes overhead. She     |
| next lost consciousness and experienced a two-hour period of time     |
| loss. She later recalled interacting with Grey aliens and             |
| encountering an environment in an otherworldly environment. They      |
| conducted a medical exam on her and returned her to her car. (Source: |
| Thomas E. Bullard, UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery, Volume   |
| 1, p. 100).                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1986 - On this day in 1986, author Whitley Strieber's young son was abducted |
| for what may have been the first time, from the family cabin in       |
| Orange County, New York. A huge black disc was involved with the      |
| abduction experience. (Source: Whitley Streiber, Communion).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1988 - Two abductions occurred on this night in 1988, one in Massachusetts   |
| and another in Gulf Breeze, Florida. (Sources: Joe Nyman and the UFO  |
| Newsclipping Service).                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1989 - Another abduction occurred on this night in 1989, presumably          |
| connected with the UFO phenomenon. A woman in Tennessee noticed in    |
| the dark a thin humanoid outside her home. It had a bluish            |
| complexion. Five men appeared, four apparently human, wearing         |
| olive-drab uniforms. The fifth was a dark-haired humanoid that wore a |
| khaki coat. She was taken away in a black van. On the same day a UFO  |
| appeared low over the Santa Fe de Bogotá airport in Colombia, causing |
| air traffic controllers to divert several flights to land in other    |
| airports. The UFO was sighted by pilots, ATCs, and many other         |
| witnesses, and also appeared on radar. (Sources: Albert Rosales,      |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1989, case 1683, citing Karla Turner,       |
| Taken; Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1991, p. 221).                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1991 - A large cylinder with many lights flew slowly over Faribault,         |
| Minnesota at 7:00 p.m. in 1991, and hovered for a short while. There  |
| were many witnesses, who also attested to the presence of many        |
| military aircraft in the sky at the same time. (Source: Paul          |
| Ferrughelli, Computer catalogue of UFO reports, 1988-1994, case 1060, |
| citing the UFO Newsclipping Service.)                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1994 - At 12:20 a.m. in 1994, French soldiers in St. Joseph, Reunion Island  |
| watched a disc or ovoid-shaped object hover over the Indian Ocean for |
| 85 minutes, emitting rays of light. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,   |
| issue no. 325).                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1995 - One year later, at 11:00 p.m. in 1995, a metallic disc hovered for    |
| two minutes over Pujaut, France and directed a beam of light at the   |
| witness. A widespread power outage was experienced in the area at the |
| same time. (Source: Banque O.V.N.I., p. 095).                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1996 - In 1996 at 11 a.m. in Varginha, Brazil a silver disc flew in and      |
| stopped over a factory. A second disc also flew in and merged into    |
| the first disc. (Source: Bob Pratt, UFO Danger Zone, p. 333).         |
|                                                                       |
