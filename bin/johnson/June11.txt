| 1881 - At sea at 4:00 a.m. between Melbourne and Sydney, Australia,   |
| the two sons of the Prince of Wales, one of them the future king of   |
| England, were cruising aboard "La Bacchante" when a flying object     |
| resembling a fully lighted ship was seen, "a phantom vessel all       |
| aglow." (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of    |
| Landings, p. 180, citing Charles Fort, The Books of Charles Fort, p.  |
| 637).                                                                 |

| 1954 - While flying from Charleston, West Virginia to Atlanta on this  |
| morning, British astronomer H. Percy Wilkins observed two brilliant,  |
| oval shaped objects above the clouds 2 miles away. "Sharp edged,"     |
| bright gold in color, they "looked exactly like polished metal plates |
| reflecting the sunlight," he wrote. They moved in slow motion         |
| northwards as the clouds drifted south. He also noticed a third UFO,  |
| this one gray in color. (Source: Frank Edwards, Flying Saucers --     |
| Serious Business, pg. 47.)                                            |

| 1956 - Nueces River, Texas - Dan Martin claimed he was taken aboard a  |
| large landed UFO, where he spent seven hours being lectured by the    |
| master of the ship. He wrote a book about his experience, entitled 7  |
| Hours Aboard a Space Ship. (Source: Hollywood Citizen-News, July 20,  |
| 1956).                                                                |

| 1961 - Jose Darnaude, age 28, of Villanueva del Rio y Minas, Spain    |
| felt a strange prickling sensation all over his body but especially   |
| on his head when he next saw a spinning luminous object approach      |
| rapidly from the northeast. The disc-shaped UFO dropped down at a     |
| 90-degree angle, and stopped to hover at 20-30 meters altitude, 250   |
| meters away. It changed color from white to orange to red to purple   |
| to white again. Over a dozen other people witnessed it for several    |
| minutes before it rose vertically at great speed and flew towards the |
| southwest. Horses in the area went crazy with fear, sheep broke       |
| loose, and dogs cowered in silence. Mr. Darnaude has degrees in law,  |
| economics, and business management, and at the time was the manager   |
| of his family's agricultural and cattle breeding business, on whose   |
| estate the incident occurred. (Source: Vicente Juan Ballester Olmos,  |

| 1966 - A man in Westport, Massachusetts who was going fishing early   |
| in the morning (3:45 a.m.) saw an object dive toward his car and      |
| hover at treetop level. He stopped his car and observed it for two    |
| minutes. It was shaped like two plates glued together, and had a      |
| smaller oval dome on top. It took a 45-degree inclination, rose, made |
| a right-angle turn, and changed color from white to yellow to blue to |
| green as it accelerated. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A      |

| 1967 - Da Nang, Vietnam - In the early evening two silver cylindrical  |
| UFOs were seen by several U.S. military personnel on the ground near  |
| the military base for several minutes. The UFOs were chased off by    |
| two F-102 U.S. Air Force interceptors. (Sources: NICAP UFO            |

| 1967 - In the middle of the afternoon Carroll Watts saw a large       |
| cigar-shaped object land on a farm near Loco, Texas. A short being    |
| exited the craft and began walking around it. The being was wearing a |
| white, tight-fitting uniform, had a baldhead, slit-like ears and      |
| somewhat larger eyes than humans. Watts attempted to take a picture   |
| of the being, who quickly ran back into the object which took off and |
| flew to the north out of sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |

| 1967 - At 8:00 p.m. two children in Price Hill, Ohio saw a            |
| disc-shaped object one meter in diameter and 25 cm thick, making a    |
| metallic noise as it hovered 10 meters above them. They took a series |
| of photos but they showed only a blurry light. (Source: Jacques       |

| 1968 - On this evening in Lavras de Mangabeira, Brazil a UFO shaped   |
| like a flattened oval was seen in a field by a witness. Next to the   |
| object stood a short, baldheaded humanoid who sported a black beard   |
| and had dark round eyes. He wore a red, tight-fitting coverall and    |
| green boots. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |

| 1969 - A doctor X was returning home from a funeral late this night   |
| near Segovia, Spain when he found his vehicle suddenly blocked by a   |
| dense curtain formed by hundreds of small luminous white cylinders    |
| hovering in a vertical position in front of his vehicle. Next Dr. X   |
| suddenly heard a voice in his head that told him to relax that        |
| everything would be alright. At the same time he noticed on the front |
| passenger seat an opaque cube-shaped form that appeared out of        |
| nowhere. His next recollection was of again driving his vehicle       |
| around a curve and then arriving home, feeling very tired and haggard |
| having no recollection of what occurred during approximately one-hour |
| period of missing time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact  |

| 1970 - Atlantic Ocean -- Thor Heyerdahl and navigator Norman Baker,    |
| aboard their boat the Ra II, radioed in that they had watched a UFO   |
| move across the horizon for several minutes during the early morning  |
| hours. It disappeared in a "bright orange flash." The sighting was    |
| not connected with any space launches, but may have been related to a |
| U.S. Navy Polaris missile launch. Heyerdahl and his crew were         |
| attempting to prove that ancient Egyptians could have crossed the     |
| Atlantic in papyrus boats centuries before Columbus. (Source: APRO    |

| 1971 - At 10 a.m. a five-meter in diameter, silver lenticular         |
| disc-shaped object landed beside the highway in Cuesta de las Vacas,  |
| San Juan, Argentina. It was seen on the ground by a policeman and two |
| others for about a minute. (Source: Oscar A. Uriondo, FSR Case        |
| Histories, February 1973, p. 15).                                     |

| 1976 - Pizancon, France - Driving home at 1 a.m., Helene Giuliana, age |
| 20, found that the engine of her car had stopped and the headlights   |
| went out. Then she noticed above the Martinet bridge, 75 feet ahead   |
| of her, a bright reddish-orange dome-shaped light. She put her hands  |
| over her eyes and when she looked again it had disappeared. She was   |
| able to restart her car and drove home. When she arrived home at 4    |
| a.m. she realized it had taken her two hours longer than it should    |
| have. Under hypnosis she recalled being taken aboard the UFO by two   |
| short beings with large eyes, wearing black coveralls. She was        |
| fastened onto an operating table, where they ran "a kind of box" over |
| her. (Source: Jean Bastide, MUFON UFO Journal, July 1976, pg. 6.)     |

| 1985 - Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China -- A Chinese Civil Aviation      |
| Administration Boeing 747 encountered a UFO on the Peking to Paris    |
| flight that almost forced the captain to make an emergency landing.   |
| Flight CA 933 was over Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, at     |
| 2240 hours when Captain Wang Shuting and his crew first observed the  |
| object.. The UFO flew across the path of the airliner at its altitude |
| of 33,000 feet at a very high speed. The object illuminated an area   |
| of twenty-five to thirty square miles and was huge, with an apparent  |
| diameter of six miles. It was elliptical in shape and had an          |
| extremely bright spot in the center, with three horizontal rows of    |
| bluish-white lights on the perimeter. The sighting lasted for two     |
| minutes. (Source: Timothy Good, Above Top Secret, pg. 212).           |

| 1989 - At seven o'clock in the morning a Canadian Airlines            |
| International crew watched a dark grey or black ovoid object,         |
| estimated to be about 2 meters in length, make complex maneuvers in   |
| the sky not far from St. John's, Newfoundland for three minutes.      |

| 1995 - On this night several golfers in Cleburne, Texas watched a     |
| metallic cigar-shaped object hover over the golf course for several   |
| minutes. A five-minute long videotape was made of the UFO by a        |
| professional photographer. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO     |
