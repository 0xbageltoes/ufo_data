| 1966 - Taylorsville, Indiana - At 5:55 p.m. an egg-shaped object       |
| zoomed towards the driver of a car "like a meteorite," then slowed to |
| an approach speed of 60 mph. The engine and headlights of the         |
| witness's car slowly faded and died as the UFO came near. The object  |
| was metallic and had three red and three green flashing lights. It    |
| gave off a buzzing sound like an electric transformer. The object     |
| passed by the stalled car and increased in altitude to between        |
| 500-1000 feet, then flew away towards the northeast. The car could    |
| then be restated. (Sources: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving     |

| 1966 - A young woman was changing a tire on a lonely road near        |
| Brooksville, Florida on this night when she was approached by a huge  |
| hairy biped creature with large green eyes and encased in an eerie    |
| greenish glow. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1966 Humanoid Sighting     |

| 1969 - Thirteen miles southeast of Quincy, Illinois on State Highway  |
| 96, three people saw an object shaped like a rounded triangle. It     |
| came very low and close to their car and suddenly lifted the car 10   |
| feet off the road. The motor and lights continued running, but the    |
| steering was out until the UFO left the area. (Sources: Mark          |

| 1972 - Coming over a rise in the road in Murray Bridge, South         |
| Australia 19-year-old mechanic named Maxwell had the motor and lights |
| die. They came back on, then sputtered several times. A diamond       |
| shaped object with the top cut off was sitting on the ground 45       |
| meters away in a paddock. The car radio made a noise like a "computer |
| on TV", with a constant beeping rhythm. The object made a vertical    |
| takeoff. Three holes were later found in the soil at the site of the  |
| landing. (Sources: Keith Basterfield, UFO Research South Australia,   |

| 1973 -  Military radar tracked a UFO near the Torino-Caselle Airport  |
| in Turin, Italy; a business pilot named Ricardo Marano and others saw |
| a disc-shaped object with glowing blue-red colored rings hovering 365 |
| meters over the end of the runway. It darted back and forth in the    |
| sky, so he gave chase in his Piper aircraft. The object zigzagged     |
| away at 5,000 km/hour. (Sources: Phenomenes Spatiaux, December 1973,  |

| 1974 - At 6:10 p.m. Jacques M. was driving a car following that of    |
| Pierre Errecoundo and Maggy Carof, on a UFO hunting expedition in     |
| Grosscourt, Oise, France. It was after dark and the cars were using   |
| their headlights. Jacques suddenly saw a man at least eight feet tall |
| in the light of his car's headlights, standing by the roadside. This  |
| being was milky white in color, as if wearing a tight white coverall, |
| and his round head was without hair or facial features.               |
| Panic-stricken, Jacques drove on past; then, reconsidering, he turned |
| around and drove back. He followed the same route but he saw nothing  |
| more of the man. Meanwhile Pierre, noticing that Jacques was no       |
| longer following him, had gone back to look for him. He saw a white   |
| headlight beam and a red light pass in front of him in the distance,  |
| apparently on the road, but silently, and it disappeared before       |
| reaching an intersection. Then Jacques showed up in his car. When     |
| they compared their stories and retraced his route, it was discovered |
| that Jacques could only account for eight of the 11 minutes he had    |
| been gone. He was therefore interviewed later under hypnosis. In a    |
| hypnotic trance he recalled that he had gotten out of the car and     |
| watched the being for 3.5 minutes, and had felt that he was           |
| benevolent. He also said that there had been a big yellowish white    |
| light in the field, which "quickly disappeared." The being suddenly   |
| vanished, after which the witness returned to his car and to his      |
| conscious recollection of events. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted        |

| 1977 - In Costilla County, Colorado a 3-year-old cow was found dead   |
| and mutilated near the San Pablo Wilbert Maestas Ranch. A helicopter  |
| had been seen in the vicinity with bright revolving lights. (Source:  |

| 1978 - At round 6 a.m. six to nine bright nocturnal lights rose from  |
| the sea off the shore of Ventimiglia, Liguria, Italy, and then flew   |
| away. There were several witnesses. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,   |

| 1979 - At 3:25 a.m. four police officers from Rickmansworth, England  |
| in two separate patrol cars chased a long luminous cigar-shaped       |
| object at 500 feet altitude for over two hours. The object flew off   |
| toward the southeast. A balloon cover story was later released to     |
| explain their sighting. (Sources: Gary Heseltine, UFO Magazine (UK),  |

| 1979 - A peasant named Santiago was weeding a palm grove near La      |
| Palma, Oaxaca state, Mexico at around 5 p.m. when eight very tall     |
| armed men approached him. They had apparently come from a nearby      |
| hovering disc-shaped object, which was emitting a green light. The    |
| men wore green goggles, had communicators, and carried what appeared  |
| to be "machine guns." They all had very dark complexions. They spoke  |
| to the witness in Spanish and ordered him to cut off his penis with   |
| his machete. The witness apparently wandered the rest of the night in |
| shock and was given medical treatment in the morning. (Sources: David |

| 1979 - On the same night a couple staying in a beachfront cabin in El |
| Combate, Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico saw a bright, multicolored            |
| oval-shaped object hovering above the water ½ mile off shore. It      |
| appeared to emit some type of fog or vapor; the object then began     |
| blinking its lights on and off. The witnesses lost interest for a     |
| short time and left their viewing point and and went back to watching |
| television.  A few minutes later an intense white light flooded their |
| living room from outside. Looking out, they could see some kind of    |
| luminous flat platform approaching the shoreline, and on top of the   |
| platform stood a four-foot-tall man. He wore a one-piece white outfit |
| with gloves and boots, a very wide belt, and a large helmet with a    |
| dark visor that completely covered his face. The source of the white  |
| light was a luminous white sphere directly on top of the platform,    |
| which emitted some type of multicolored smoke. Upon seeing this the   |
| couple screamed, causing the platform and its occupant to return back |
| to the hovering object offshore. At this point the witnesses returned |
| back inside and did not see the object depart. (Source: Albert S.     |

| 1982 - In Botucatu, State of Sao Paolo, Brazil Joao Valeiro da Silva  |
| was awakened at 2:00 a.m. by a noise in his backyard. He opened the   |
| door and was confronted by two strange little men and a woman, each   |
| about three feet tall, and wearing brilliant blue coveralls. They     |
| approached him, holding their palms upward as if to show they carried |
| no weapons. Despite the friendly gesture the witness fainted, and     |
| nobody missed him until early next morning when his brother Simeon    |
| awoke early at 5:00 a.m. and tiptoed into his room to borrow some     |
| antacid medicine. He noticed Joao was missing and what looked like    |
| signs of a struggle, so he awakened the household. His family found   |
| Joao lying outside, nude and unconscious, and alongside him was his   |
| clothing in a rumpled pile. They rushed him to hospital where he      |
| recovered two hours later. Although Joao did not remember being taken |
| onboard a craft, he remembered that he found himself in a             |
| hospital-like operating room, and the same small beings were there    |
| that had appeared at his door. They wore clothing that looked it was  |
| made from a rubber material. They talked to him and led him to a wall |
| bearing an outline of a human form. The beings would look at the      |
| drawing and then at him, as if comparing the two. Then they left. A   |
| naked girl then entered the room. She had long hair, was tanned or    |
| dark, and carried an instrument about a foot long. When she grasped   |
| his head he lost consciousness. An subsequent interview with his      |
| family disclosed that a "sickly smelling oily substance" had covered  |
| his nude body. Da Silva also complained that his genitals "were       |
| burning". (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1982, |

| 1989 - At 9:20 p.m. a delta-shaped object passed low over a road      |

| passed through the area making a noise like a locomotive engine.      |
| There was large scale tree damage, over an area of 160 square meters  |
| of forest, having cut through some trees that were three meters tall, |
| yet leaving some trees that were interspersed untouched. One worker   |

| 2000 - A farmer on his farm southeast of Lincoln, Nebraska heard his  |
| dogs barking loudly at around 7:00 p.m. He looked outside and noticed |
| a very bright light in one of his fields, so he decided to walk out   |
| there with his dogs. However, the dogs were afraid and refused to     |
| follow him. As he got closer to where the lights were located they    |
| suddenly turned off, and he decided to go back to the farm home. When |
| he got back his dogs acted aggressively toward him, as if they didn't |
| recognize him. He then ran upstairs to the second floor and used his  |
| binoculars to search the field. He could now see a lighted            |
| disc-shaped object on or near the ground, and he was able to see what |
| looked like lighted windows on the object. Next, he noticed movement  |
| in a thicket near the disc, and suddenly a figure moved quickly from  |
| the thicket to the object. Shortly after this the object brightened   |
| and took off. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 18152; |
