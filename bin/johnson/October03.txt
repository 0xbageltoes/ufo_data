| Bressuire, France at dawn when he saw a circular craft with a         |
| three-meter diameter and a small figure wearing a diving suit,        |

| 1954 - Between Rue and Quend, France on Route D27, near the village   |
| of Vron, Rene Coudette and B. Devoisin were riding bicycles with a    |
| third witness when they saw an orange object, shaped like a beehive,  |
| on the road ahead of them. A small strange "man" wearing a diving     |
| suit, about 0.9 meters (3 foot) tall, was standing close to it. When  |
| they got within 70 meters of it, the object took off very fast. Less  |
| than three hours later, the same or a similar orange object chased a  |
| car down a road in Quend for eight kilometers, then flew away toward  |
| the sea. The witness was a butcher named Georges Galant. (Sources:    |

| age 22, while riding a motorcycle between Montmoreau and Villebois    |
| Lavalette, France. It seemed to be gliding over the ground. It showed |

| over an area seven meters across. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying       |

| 1967 - At 7:45 p.m. Kathy Skolem of Portland, Connecticut, age 13,    |
| saw an orange cloud bigger than the moon, which changed colors from   |
| pink to blue to green. This turned out to be a barium cloud           |
| experiment launched by NASA at 7:18 EDT from Wallops Island,          |
| Virginia. However, she then saw a white domed disc surrounded by a    |
| haze. It had lights around its rim, and it flew off toward the        |
| southeast. At 8:40 p.m. a glowing Saturn-shaped object with a fuzzy   |
| amber center flew over Cambridge, Massachusetts. It had white lights  |
| sparkling around its circumference. This too was not the barium cloud |
| experiment, which they had seen earlier in the evening. (Sources:     |

| 1971 - Mr. and Mrs. Cury where driving in Anapolis, Brazil at 1:40    |
| a.m. when their car's engine made an odd sound and suddenly           |
| accelerated to 160 kph despite the driver's effort to slow it down. A |
| large glowing sombrero-shaped object appeared in front of the car. It |
| passed back and forth across the road, oscillated up and down, then   |
| sped away. On the same day two disc-shaped objects descended low over |
| Rainbow Lake in Derry, New Hampshire. There were independent          |
| witnesses to the event, and other UFO sightings in the area.          |

| 1973 - During a flurry of low-level UFO sightings in the area of      |
| North Melbourne, Australia, a man woke up in the middle of the night  |
| and noticed two figures standing in the shadows in front of his       |
| bedroom wall looking at him. They were described as humanoid and      |
| tall, and they appeared to be floating just above the floor. Both     |
| swayed gently from side to side. Both beings had large baldheads,     |
| slanted eyes, lipless mouths, and small flat noses. Their ears were   |
| pressed back against the side of their heads. No clothing details     |
| could be discerned. Moments later one of the beings opened his mouth  |
| and a high-pitched whine filled the room. At the same time both       |
| beings began to fade and disappeared. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1978 - Thousands of witnesses in Bogota, Colombia saw two UFOs in an  |
| unusually clear sky. One was shaped like a "croissant" and the other  |
| was cylinder-shaped. Both gave off an intense luminosity. Traffic     |
| halted throughout the city during the sighting. (Source: UFO          |

| 1978 - At 9:37 p.m. a car driving over a mountain pass near Sayama    |
| City, Japan was suddenly illuminated. An orange beam of light came    |
| down from the sky and struck the Mr. Amano's two-year-old daughter's  |
| stomach. Then a short humanoid being with no obvious nose appeared    |
| and pressed a metallic object against his forehead. He began          |
| receiving telepathic communication from the being accompanied by a    |
| high-pitched noise. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:  |

| of missing time. When she regained consciousness she found herself    |
| outside her house. (Source: Thomas E. Bullard, UFO Abductions: The    |

| 1996 - At approximately 8:00 p.m. local time a number of vehicles      |
| traveling on I-25 south of Springer, New Mexico were witness to a     |
| cigar-shaped object, estimated to be at least "two stories" tall and  |
| covered with very bizarre lights. The object was seen to descend out  |
| of the night sky and hover over an area near the highway. At least    |
| 4-5 automobiles, and two tractor-trailers had stopped along the       |
| highway and their passengers had gotten out of their vehicles to look |
| at the object. At some point during the sighting the object           |
| extinguished its lights and apparently settled to the ground. One     |

| 1996 - On this Thursday night numerous sightings of one or more        |
| blue-green "fireballs" streaking overhead were reported to various    |
| law-enforcement agencies in California. Some reports hinted at the    |
| possibility that the sightings were associated with several fires of  |
| unknown origin that had allegedly broken out as the object or objects |
| passed overhead. Witnesses in at least four counties made reports to  |
| the California Emergency Management Office in Sacramento. One         |
| observer reported that he had seen a bluish or blue-green fireball    |
| descend almost vertically to the east of his location in Bakersfield. |
| The object was observed for approximately 20-30 seconds, during which |
| time it traversed an arc or approximately 30 degrees of angle. The    |

| 1997 - At four in the afternoon Osmo Kurkela was walking home from    |
| school in Raahe, Finland when he saw a red light in the sky that was  |
| coming straight down towards him. It stopped ten meters from the      |
| witness then landed. The UFO was five meters long and ten meters      |
| wide. Three human-looking beings emerged and one of them appeared to  |
| be a woman. Osmo ran home and attempted to hide, but his next         |
| recollection was being taken from his home and into the object. A     |
| sperm sample was allegedly taken from the young man. (Source: Albert  |
