| Tucson, Arizona at an estimated altitude of five miles. It rolled and |
| soared off toward the southwest at an estimated speed of 500 mph.     |

| Air Force Base in Texas at an estimated altitude of 60,000 feet,      |
| moving at an estimated speed of 1200 miles per hour. It was sighted   |
| by a pilot in a T-33 military aircraft. At 8:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight |

| 1954 - A huge blue disc buzzed two men, Smith and Beacon, 45 miles    |
| west of Geelong, Victoria, Australia at 6:30 a.m. It then shot        |
| straight up into the sky until gone from view. At noon a cigar-shaped |

| estimated 2,000 meters altitude. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer     |

| 1964 - Sometime after midnight Mr. Adams was driving on highway 66    |
| near Moriarty, New Mexico when a 25-30 foot wide UFO, luminous light  |
| green in color, came down and hovered 100 feet above his pickup       |
| truck. The truck stalled when it passed underneath the UFO. Mr. D.    |
| Adams then fired a .22 calibre pistol at it and heard a metallic ping |
| as if the bullet bounced off the object. As the UFO moved away he     |
| fired six more shots with apparently no effect. His dogs barked       |
| incessantly during the close encounter. (Source: Los Angeles Herald   |

| 1964 - That night on Interstate highway 10 south of Las Cruces, New   |
| Mexico a luminous UFO flew over a car being driven by Mr. P. Arteche. |
| It flew with a jerky motion and frequently changed direction. A       |
| private pilot made a report of a similar object at the same time.     |

| 1967 - A metallic elliptical object with a belt of alternate red and  |
| green lights was seen flying over Toronto, Ontario at 9 p.m. It       |
| hovered and then descended. The witness became frightened and fled    |
| the scene when the UFO got too close for comfort. On the same night a |
| silent disc-shaped UFO followed a car closely in Monroe, North        |
| Carolina. It responded to signals made by the driver using the car    |
| headlights. There were independent witnesses. (Sources: NICAP UFO     |

| 1969 - On this evening in Farnworth, England a teenage couple,        |
| Hodgkinson and Rushton, reported hearing a buzzing sound while their  |
| dogs barked in a terrified manner. They saw a gray UFO fly close by.  |

| 1974 - In Greenland, New Hampshire near Pease Air Force Base at 1:10  |
| a.m. a low flying, orange colored UFO was seen by a single male       |

| as looking like a hockey puck. (Source: John Oswald and David F. Webb |

| 1983 - A UFO came along and flew over a soccer match in progress in   |
| Huepul, Chile at only 5 meters above the field. It stopped the game   |

| 1988 - A single witness driving on US highway 98 east of Gulf Breeze, |
| Florida had a disc-shaped UFO pace his van. The UFO stayed just ahead |
| of the van and beamed a blue beam down onto the road. At the same     |
| time planes were seen circling the area. (Source: MUFON field         |

| 1992 - A jet aircraft tentatively identified as a U.S. Air Force F-14 |
| Tomcat was seen pursuing a domed disc-shaped UFO in Lajas, Puerto     |
| Rico. The UFO would make multiple stops, and as the jet closed in the |
| saucer split in half. The top half flew off toward the southwest and  |
| the other half flew off to the east. The F-14 jet remained circling   |
| in the area, and then flew off to the east. (Source: Timothy Good,    |

| 1994 - A round craft passed in front of a car in Pensacola, Florida   |
| at 10:40 p.m. It passed to within 50 feet of the front of the         |
| automobile. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, November 1994).               |
|                                                                       |
| 1997 - The witness was driving on a business trip when he had a flat  |
| tire at 10 p.m. near Longview, Texas. A truck driver stopped to       |
| assist him when they both became aware of a UFO about 100 yards away. |
| There looked to be humanoid figures dressed in white clothing moving  |
| around inside the craft. The object was circular and emitted an       |
| occasional flash of light. The truck driver walked closer to the      |
| object in order to get a better look. He suddenly ran back in fear    |
| yelling that they had to leave quick. Both men got into the truck and |
| began speeding away. Shortly after the UFO silently passed over the   |
| truck and quickly flew out of sight. At the same time in Houston,     |
| Texas two witnesses reported seeing 10-13 amber-colored lights fly    |
| over in a V-shaped formation. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid   |
| Contact Database 1997; case #3121, citing Mark Harman, UFO Times,     |

| 2003 - While driving home from work at 8:00 p.m. Mr. Marcus Warner    |
| saw a blue flashing light in his rear view mirror. He pulled to the   |
| side of the road in Pontypool, Gwent, Wales and stopped his car's     |
| engine. He was then approached by some men in black suits resembling  |
| businessmen or government agents. At this point his memory began to   |
| fail, but he recalls one of the men leading him to an open area near  |
| the local "Burtons Biscuit Factory." He then had a feeling of         |
| weightlessness and an intense feeling of calm. He remembered seeing a |
| formation of figures, arranged into a ten pin bowling formation. He   |
| has a recurring image of a needle piercing his left eye. He has no    |
| recollection of driving the rest of the way home, but arrived there   |
| somehow. He has not, to date, undergone hypnosis in an attempt to     |
| recover the events that occurred during his amnesia. (Source: Albert  |
