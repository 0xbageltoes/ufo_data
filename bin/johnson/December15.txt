| 1950 – Ground radar tracked an unidentified flying object over the    |
| Oak Ridge Nuclear Research Facility in Anderson County, Tennessee at  |
| 11:45 p.m. The object was sighted visually as well and described as   |
| teardrop shaped. The sighting lasted 10 minutes. (Source: Loren E.    |

| 1953 – At one o’clock in the morning a terrified growling dog alerted |
| the witness to a presence outside the house in Sherbrooke, Quebec.    |
| There was a knock on the door heard next. Checking outside the        |
| witness could see a 100-meter wide UFO flying off. Crushed bushes     |
| were discovered at the landing site. (Source: Jacques Vallee,         |

| 1954 - On this day in 1954 a man had a close encounter with three aliens in  |
| Brazil. While fishing in the river in Campo Grande in the state of    |
| Mato Grosso del Sol, he saw a small sphere revolving around a larger  |
| sphere, about two meters above the ground. The larger object had      |
| landing gear shaped like three round balls. Three human-looking       |
| occupants who were small in stature got out. They had with them a     |
| luminous basket and a metal tube with a cone-shaped end. They used    |
| these tools to collect soil samples. On the same day a Royal          |
| Australian Navy pilot reported that two UFOs paced his aircraft. The  |
| UFOs appeared on radar. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen, Flying Saucer    |

| 1956 – While out gathering Christmas trees around 11:00 o’clock in    |
| the morning in Derry, New Hampshire, a Mr. Horne saw a two-foot tall, |
| green colored dwarf, with a high forehead, large floppy ears, and     |
| short arms and legs. The texture of the creature’s skin was course,   |
| like the skin of an elephant. The dwarf made a screeching noise when  |
| approached. (Source: Walter N. Webb case investigations, report dated |

| 1965 - In 1965 a phantom automobile was seen in the Cotswold Hills in Avon   |
| county, England at around midnight. A vehicle shaped like a Land      |
| Rover, but without wheels, passed a car, and then vanished in a puff  |
| of smoke. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 7030,       |

| 1967 - At 1:00 a.m. three men driving to Saxon, Wisconsin on Highway  |
| 2 saw a rapidly spinning sphere with a white light on the top         |
| and bottom, and red and green lights around the middle. The object    |
| approached at low altitude, and then hovered over a nearby field.     |
| While hovering a smaller sphere discharged from the bottom, and it in |
| turn discharged a smaller sphere, which then discharged a yet smaller |
| sphere. These small spheres hovered momentarily one beneath the       |
| other, then returned to their original positions within each other    |
| and into the original object, which then sped out of sight. (Source:  |

| 1968 – Shortly after midnight one of several UFOs in the sky swooped  |
| down and paced a car with five teenage hunters inside near Coorong,   |
| South Australia for over two minutes. It came close to the car        |
| several times before speeding away. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs     |

| 1968 – In Macon, Georgia a teenage couple, Mr. Thornton and Miss      |
| Churchill, saw a dark cigar-shaped UFO with a bright dome on top at   |
| around eight o’clock in the evening. The dome had rotating red,       |
| green, and white lights. The UFO appeared to fall from the sky,       |
| stopped, tilted, righted itself, then dimmed and brightened. It shot  |
| out beams of light. Bright green flashes went out from it several     |
| times. (Source: Mrs. Frank Abbott, NICAP case investigation files,    |

| 1971 – A round, silver disc-shaped object was sighted by a Mrs. H.    |
| Parker in Bridgewater, Tasmania at 6:20 a.m. It had a brightly        |
| reflective surface that flashed like a mirror over a river. After two |
| minutes the object turned slowly to reveal an oval, disc-shaped       |
| appearance. It rose up, hovered for a minute, and was gone over a     |
| hill. (Source: Australian Flying Saucer Review, December 1972, p. 12, |

| 1973 - In 1973, on a highway in Le Gua, France a near collision occurred     |
| between a car and a 15-meter long silver cloud shaped UFO at around   |
| eleven o’clock in the morning. The UFO was heading in a southerly     |
| direction, but made an instantaneous ninety-degree turn and shot off  |
| toward the east. At 7:20 p.m. on a highway in Chateauneuf-sur-Loire,  |
| France a green ball of light dropped from the sky. At the same time a |
| car’s engine and radio died. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue   |
| 134, and December 1975).                                              |

| 1975 – On a farm near La Neuvelot, France at 11:00 p.m. a five-meter  |
| in diameter disc landed in a field. It rose up fast and shot away     |
| toward the west-southwest. At the same time there were several        |
| unexplained nocturnal lights in the sky.                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1976 - At 9:20 p.m. on this evening in 1976 in Holland, Massachusetts, a     |
| cigar shaped UFO hovered stationary in the sky for a few moments. The |
| figures of three or four beings could be seen through oval-shaped     |
| windows in the craft. The object disappeared in a bright red flash    |
| after another 7-8 seconds. (Source: International UFO Reporter,       |
| February 1977, p. 5).                                                 |

| 1977 – At 8:45 p.m. a domed disc illuminated the area of Saint Ciers  |
| du Taillon, France like day, then flew away. It came back again the   |
| same site 20 minutes later. That same night a blindingly bright light |
| came up close to a French Navy Nord-262 transport plane with three    |
| crew members aboard and followed it, circling it for five minutes.    |
| The UFO did not appear on ground radar at the naval base in Lorien,   |
| in Morbihan department, France. Also that night mysterious booms were |
| reported up and down the eastern Atlantic shoreline of the United     |
| States at around 10:30 p.m. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, January  |
| 1981; Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p. 41 citing J.   |

| 1978 - There were a series of close encounter UFO incidents in Italy on this |
| date in 1978. In Torrebruna, Italy a man driving his car shortly      |
| after midnight saw a lighted UFO hovering just above the roadway. He  |
| blinked his headlights and the object descended and landed on the     |
| road ahead of him. The car's radio then stopped working. He got out   |
| of his car and approached the object and a door opened up. He then    |
| entered and found himself in a circular brightly illuminated room     |
| crammed full of instrument panels. He did not see any occupants.      |
| After a few minutes the witness left the object and saw it depart at  |
| high speed. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |
| 1978, citing Chris Aubeck, Return to Magonia; Lumieres dans la Nuit,  |

| 1978 - At 12:15 p.m. two young boys were playing in a yard in         |
| Catania, Italy on the island of Sicily, near a large TV antenna. The  |
| sky darkened and then a large disc-shaped craft approached and tilted |
| at an angle, just above the TV antenna. The object emitted            |
| multicolored rays of light and had an open hatch in its center        |
| section. A bright beam of light shot out of the opening and a         |
| strange, 1.5 meter tall “monster” descended within the beam. The      |
| being was described as "ugly" with two large eyes and two             |
| antenna-like protrusions on its head. A second similar being          |
| reportedly descended carrying a "laser" type gun and shot at a rock   |
| causing it to burn and explode. He was seen to bend down, touch the   |
| ground, and then spill a black liquid on it. Moments later a beam of  |
| light transported the beings back into the craft. The craft then shot |
| away at high speed. Ground traces were reportedly found. (Source:     |

| 1978 - At 5:45 p.m. a luminous orange sphere, about two meters in     |
| diameter, passed low over houses in a residential area of Macomer,    |
| Italy on the island of Sardinia. At 6:30 p.m. several witnesses in    |
| Collegno,Torino, Italy spotted a bizarre human-like figure about 1.60 |
| meters in height, wearing a rose-colored coverall and without facial  |
| features. It moved around in a field at very high speed and then      |
| remained immobile, leaning against a wall for more than 30 minutes.   |
| The witnesses were afraid to approach the figure. Some thought it was |
| a prank and summoned the authorities. As the police arrived the       |
| strange figure suddenly ran through an opening in the wall at         |
| incredibly speed and quickly disappeared from sight. (Source: Albert  |
| S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978, citing Chris Aubeck,      |

| 1978 - Back on the island of Sicily at 11:45 p.m. a witness named Capuzello  |
| saw two, two-meter tall beings exit from a saucer-shaped craft that   |
| had landed on a road in Licodia Eubea, Italy. They spoke some kind of |
| unintelligible language that sounded like gibberish. (Sources:        |
| Lumieres dans la Nuit, issues 214 and 240; Maurizio Verga, ITACAT –   |

| 1978 - At 11:50 p.m. a truck driver in Ragusa, Italy suddenly         |
| experienced radio interference and stopped to fix it. He then saw two |
| very tall humanoids standing only five meters away. They were dressed |
| in black, tight-fitting coveralls and helmets. They helmets had short |
| protuberances like antennae on the sides and they had transparent     |
| face plates. Inside human-like faces could be seen. Two bright beams  |
| of light were emitted from their helmets that illuminated the cab of  |
| the truck. The beings came closer and uttered unintelligible sounds,  |
| then turned and left. Seconds later the witness saw a dome-shaped     |
| craft take off with a bright flash. A strong smell of sulphur was     |
| noticed in the vicinity. (Source: Richard Hall, MUFON UFO Journal,    |
| issue # 153).                                                         |

| 1980 - In 1980 over 40 people in the southeastern part of London, England    |
| saw a UFO hover, divide into pieces, re-group, dart a short distance, |
| and then shoot straight up. (Source: Timothy Good, Above Top Secret,  |

| 1981 - At dusk in 1981 in Aksaray, Nigde province, Turkey a bright light     |
| shaped like a "flying tray" hovered some 200 to 300 meters from a     |
| car, performed maneuvers in the sky for a few minutes, then shot away |
| toward the southwest. (Source: Haluk Egeman Sarikaya, International   |

| 1981 - In San Luis del Palmar, Corrientes Province, Argentina at 3:30 |
| a.m. 42-year-old Ruben Meneses was driving a dump truck on a dirt     |
| road at 3:30 a.m when he had a close encounter with a                 |
| brilliant object that approached his truck. The truck began to        |
| vibrate, and hefelt a tingling sensation all over his body. He was    |
| unable to move as the truck was lifted up into the air and seemed to  |
| become transparent. Meneses then blacked out. He later awoke sitting  |
| confused in his truck at a location about 55 miles from where he had  |
| been, and did not remember how he got there. He was hospitalized in a |
| state of confusion, shock, and disorientation. When he awoke he also  |
| had a vague memory of a humanoid encounter.Later under hypnotic       |
| regression he remembered being taken inside a room with mirror like   |
| walls, where he was made to lie down on a cot-like bed. He saw three  |
| short thin humanoids with dark gray skin, extremely long arms and     |
| thick wrinkles on their foreheads. The little beings communicated     |
| with Meneses using telepathy. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO      |

| 1983 - In 1983 Mr. Coventry in Glasgow, Scotland reported seeing a fog at    |
| 6:25 a.m. in which all sounds stopped. A gray flying object the shape |
| of a railroad car, but with a convex curved roof, then appeared,      |
| making crackling and humming sounds. The UFO had three                |
| porthole-shaped windows in the side, and what appeared to be a yellow |
| smoke swirled around in the interior of the object. It shot up into   |
| the sky and was gone. (Source: Ron Halliday, UFO Scotland: The secret |

| 1991 - At 7:30 p.m. on a farm in Catlett, Fauquier County, Virginia a woman  |
| with multiple abduction experiences reported being abducted by aliens |
| again in 1991, this time for 70 minutes. A curious feature of this    |
| abduction event was that when she was returned she noticed that the   |
| aliens had put her earrings back on backwards. (Source: UFO           |

| 1994 - At around 3:00 a.m. Miss Myrna Rodriguez had been in a deep    |
| sleep at her home in La Playa Guayanilla, Puerto Rico when she had    |
| the sudden sensation that her body was being lifted up, apparently    |
| floating away from the bed. She awoke with a start and found herself  |
| unable to move. When she looked around she found herself surrounded   |
| by four short humanoids, two on each side of her body, who were       |
| apparently somehow holding her up in mid-air without any means of     |
| support. The beings were short and thin, with huge, round hairless    |
| heads, small pointed ears, and large, dark, slanted eyes. They had    |
| what appeared to be mole-like marks under their eyes, and their noses |
| and mouths were almost indistinguishable. They had thin bodies with   |
| long skinny arms. They all wore dull silvery uniforms. The beings     |
| next began touching her with their delicate hands all around her      |
| stomach and chest area, at the same time talking to themselves in a   |
| low murmur like chatter. The witness was alarmed to see that the      |
| beings somehow had suceeded in opening her chest area, without        |
| causing her any pain or discomfort. They seemed to be checking her    |
| internal organs, including her heart, which she saw moving as it      |
| pumped blood through her body. During the whole experience she felt a |

| benevolent and were there to help. She eventually floated gently back |
| to her bed where she was able to move and immediately checked her     |
| stomach and chest area for any scars, but found none. The beings had  |
| vanished. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1994, |

| 1995 – At 10:30 p.m. a big rectangular object with many lights        |
| maneuvered in the sky at the same time that three lights were seen on |
| the road in La Spezia, Italy. The big UFO flew away to the west,      |
| leaving a bright trail in the sky. An electrical power outage         |
| occurred in the area at the same time. (Source: Larry Hatch, U        |

| 1998 - There were many UFO reports in the early dawn hours and on this       |
| evening in 1998, earlier in the evening than the normal hours for the |
| Geminid meteor shower. At 5:30 a.m. at Teterboro Airport in New       |
| Jersey near New York City, a man working at the airport felt a        |
| strange compulsion to go outside. When he did he saw a huge,          |
| wedge-shaped craft with lights over the George Washington Bridge. At  |
| the same time he heard a message, apparently through his normal       |
| hearing. At nine o’clock in the evening a dark equilateral            |
| triangle-shaped craft outlined by lights passed silently over         |
| Bethelem, Pennsylvania. It flew from the east to the west at a very   |
| slow speed. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |

| 1999 – A disc with green flashing lights pulsating around its middle  |
| rim section approached the beach on North Island in New Zealand from  |
| the ocean traveling at a speed of 200 knots. It flew low, at an       |
| estimated altitude of only 50 meters, and accelerated away making a   |
| deep buzzing noise. (Source: UFO Magazine (USA), April 2000, p. 17,   |

| 2001 - In 2001 there were many reports of a circular glowing object circling |
| the metropolitan area of Toluca, Mexico at around 3:00 a.m. The       |
| object was reportedly viewed through binoculars. At 7:20 p.m. an      |
| amber colored, low flying triangle moved through the sky over         |
| Greensboro, North Carolina toward the southeast. Within its structure |
| it had many "translucent spheres or orbs interchanging within it.” In |
| flew off in the direction of Fayettesville. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U  |

| 2003 - At six p.m. a circular object flew over the coconut trees for  |
| about four minutes in Baling, Kedah State, Malaysia, and then         |
| disappeared. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, |
