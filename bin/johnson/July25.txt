| 1938 - A lieutenant in the Spanish Army in Guadalajara, Spain saw a   |
| dark, lens-shaped UFO descend toward the ground at 11:30 p.m. The     |
| disc was eleven meters in diameter and the top and bottom secions     |
| spun in opposite directions. A transparent column from underneath the |
| object came down slowly, and two figures could be seen moving around  |
| inside the column. A blue beam of light was projected at the witness  |
| by the UFO, and he felt a chilling cold sensation. (Source:           |

| 1952 - A man who was fishing in the pre-dawn hours in the Serchio     |
| River in the Tuscany region of Italy saw a disc hovering for ten      |
| minutes. From it hung a hose that plunged into the water. The object  |
| was 20 meters in diameter, with five propellers in the rear and a     |
| dome with something like blades on top. An orange glow could be seen  |
| through slits along the deck. A man wearing a diving helmet looked at |
| the witness through a window, and he received a kind of electric      |
| shock as a "green ray" hit him. He looked up with difficulty, in time |
| to see the object fly away toward the east. Six days later a stranger |
| with a foreign accent contacted the witness and intimidated him.      |

| 1957 - Mr. Joao Guimaraes, who was a professor at the Catholic        |
| Faculty of Law in Santos, was sitting near the shore in Sao           |
| Sebastiao, Brazil at 7:10 p.m. when he saw a hat-shaped, luminous     |
| craft approach from the sea and land near him. From it came a         |
| metallic stairway. Two normal men with long, fair hair hanging to     |
| their shoulders, a youthful appearance and wearing one-piece suits,   |
| came down, gave no verbal answers to his questions, but invited him   |
| "telepathically" to come aboard the craft. Inside the illuminated     |
| compartment, he sat on a circular seat with the crew. The machine     |
| rose for a short flight. On his return, Guimaraes found that his      |
| watch no longer worked. (Sources: Charles Bowen, The Humanoids: FSR   |

| 1959 - In Gaiawanaki, Papua New Guinea a beam of light shone down on  |
| men on the beach, lighting up the area like day. A domed disc came    |
| down to a low altitude. It had a dark, concave base, and illuminated  |
| dome, and traveled on its side in the sky. (Source: Norman Cruttwell, |

| 1959 - On this day at about 1:30 p.m. in Irondequoit, New York W.D.   |
| Neva, a technical illustrator, saw a thin, crescent-shaped object     |
| with a small white dome in the center resembling a gun turret at 1:00 |
| p.m. The object flew at an estimated 800 mph, banked, and disappeared |
| from view behind some trees after 5-10 seconds. (Source: Project Blue |

| 1965 - Two five-foot long cylinders connected by cross-bars landed in |
| Trois Rivieres, Quebec, Canada at 4:30 p.m. A five foot tall being    |
| was seen outside. There were three witnesses, and the encounter       |
| lasted five minutes. (Source: John Brent Musgrave, UFO Occupants and  |

| 1965 - In Castalia, Ohio 16-year-old M. D. Harris, an amateur         |
| astronomer, was viewing the night sky at 9:15 p.m. when he saw what   |
| looked like a bright blue star move 90° across of the sky in 10-15    |
| seconds. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official        |

| 1965 - On this night Mr. Alva was awakened by a strange sound and saw |
| an object on the ground near the Chosica Power Plant, Peru emitting   |
| flashes of green light. He woke up other employees, who had time to   |
| note that the object was about three meters in diameter, had small    |
| windows in its upper part, and a revolving telescopic appendage. The  |
| investigating commission found dark, triangular traces on the ground. |

| 1966 - College student James Clark was driving home after 1:00 a.m.   |
| between Greenville and Vanceboro, North Carolina when he saw a flying |
| object that followed him even though he drove at high speeds          |
| attempting to elude it. He finally stopped to watch it, but became    |
| afraid when it flew within 100 meters of the car, only 15 meters      |
| above the ground. The lights on the object pulsated, and the color    |
| changed in sequence, orange to red to blue to green and then back to  |
| orange, and it also wobbled on its axis. It came within 30 meters,    |
| then suddenly left straight up. It flew up and out of sight in less   |
| than five seconds. The entire incident lasted an hour. (Sources:      |
| Project Blue Book files counted in official statistics, case 10781;   |

| 1968 - At 2:05 a.m. in Olavarria, Buenos Aires, Argentina a corporal  |
| and several other soldiers went to a spot where a UFO, emitting       |
| multicolored flashes and making a droning sound, appeared about to    |
| land. It settled to the ground and three beings more than six feet    |
| tall, wearing silvery uniforms, emerged and advanced with slow,       |
| unsteady steps toward the soldiers. The corporal fired a burst of     |
| submachine gun fire at them, upon which the beings lifted up their    |
| hands to show a small luminous ball, whereupon all the witnesses were |
| overcome by a strange lassitude and were incapable of using their     |
| guns. Only after the beings re-entered the UFO and it had taken off   |
| with a zigzag motion did the soldiers recover their faculties.        |

| 1968 - At 5:30 a.m. Oscar Augustin D'Onofrio was traveling on Route 3 |
| in General Alvear, Buenos Aires, Argentina when he observed at the 37 |
| km mark, 100 meters away from the road, a luminous spot that          |
| gradually increased in size. The engine of his car stopped working,   |
| and the witness remained paralyzed without being able to move.        |
| Moments later there emerged a "spaceship," which shot out sparks. He  |
| saw two figures, but at that distance he could not make out their     |
| characteristics. The UFO rose up and disappeared. (Source: David F.   |

| 1968 - A family of three in Pastora, Argentina saw a silvery object   |
| about 25 feet in diameter. The engine of their car began to slow      |
| down, then die completely as the object came near. The object, which  |
| looked like a spinning top, hovered for five minutes only 10 meters   |
| from the road. Then it rose quickly and vanished — the engine came    |
| back on by itself. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving     |

| 1969 - A two-meter diameter orange sphere flew to the southwest at    |
| only 12 meters over a path in Estival, France. It returned a short    |
| time later flying to the northwest. (Source: Claude Poher, Etudes     |

| 1970 - In Jabreilles des Bordes, France at 5:30 p.m. in 1970 a disc landed   |
| on four legs. It had two antennas, one 45 cm long and one 1.5 meters  |
| long. There were physiological effects experienced by the witness.    |

| 1972 - The witness, a 37-year-old woman, saw a blue light from a      |
| saucer-shaped object nearby while driving in Frankston, Victoria,     |
| Australia on this evening. She tried to accelerate away from the      |
| object, but her car's engine died, although the headlights remained   |
| on. She felt as if she was "under observation" and heard a voice. Her |
| engine then started by itself and the saucer left. The woman had seen |
| the same object before on July 3. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO        |

| 1978 - A large metallic cylindrical object hovered for 30 seconds     |

| hovered again, then moved away toward the southwest making short      |
| stops. (Source: Pierre Delval, Ouranos, vol. 24 (1978), p. 10).               |

| 1979 - At 2:00 a.m. in Canoga Park, California a large white light    |
| made several passed at a car. One hour later a diffuse white ball of  |
| light maneuvered in the sky for 30 minutes over the Chatsworth        |
| Reservoir. At 3:15 a housewife and cocktail waitress was abducted     |
| while driving home from work by a UFO she thought was a plane         |
| crashing. She experienced an episode of missing time and partial      |
| amnesia about other events, but did recall undergoing a physical exam |
| while lying on her back. A probe was inserted into her leg, and her   |
| eyes were dabbed with a liquid. (Sources: MUFON UFO Journal,          |

| 1979 - At 11:30 a.m. Federico Ibanez, a 54-year-old farmer, was out   |
| driving his car in his vineyards in Turis, Valencia, Spain when he    |
| sighted something white and shiny ahead of him. He thought at first   |
| it was his neighbor's car, but when he rounded a bend in the road the |
| object blocking the road resembled a vertical half-egg that stood on  |
| legs, with the truncated end facing downwards. It was nine feet high  |
| and almost 3 feet wide. He then noticed two 3-foot-tall beings        |
| running toward the object. The wore white shiny outfits that covered  |
| their head and came down to their knees. They had small black legs    |
| that ended in little feet that looked like "boxing gloves." Their     |
| faces were blank except for what appeared to be a black protruding    |
| face mask of some sort. Within seconds the beings entered the object, |
| which then took off throwing up a cloud of dust. Sr. Ibanez got back  |
| in his car and drove off to inspect his vines. A subsequent           |
| investigation found four circular marks on the road forming a precise |
| rectangle. The farmer, who knew nothing about UFOs, had a solid       |
| reputation among his friends and neighbors. (Sources: Patrick Huyghe, |

| saw was a square-shaped craft and a 3-meter (10 foot) tall robot      |
| standing at the side of the UFO. It had no arms, and the head was     |
| covered with a metal mesh material. It made guttural sounds. Later    |
| that day several independent witnesses reported seeing a blunt gray,  |
| 300-foot long cigar-shaped object with windows fly over woods and the |
| sewage treatment plant in Latrobe, Pennsylvania heading west.         |

| 1992 - On this day in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico a UFO abductee was       |
| allegedly visited by a man with human appearance and "Hindu"          |
| features. In a telepathic communication the abductee was informed     |
| that the Grey aliens were androids, and lived for only a few days     |
| before then were recycled. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |

| 1992 - Three young men were racing dirt bikes on a river bank in      |
| Tarasovka, Ukraine when they saw a luminous sphere land. A 1.6 meter  |
| (5.5 feet) tall man emerged from the object wearing white coveralls   |
| and a helmet. He walked in a peculiar manner. (Source: Albert S.      |

| 1993 - At 3:40 a.m. a dome-shaped object 4 meters in diameter         |
| followed two witnesses home in Warsaw, Poland. They videotaped the    |
| object circling their house. The next day unexplained new marks on    |
| their skin suggested to them that they had been abducted. (Source:    |

| 1995 - At 9:35 a.m. two luminous objects maneuvered up-and-down in    |
| the daytime sky over Ocate, New Mexico. They darted to the horizon,   |
| and then appeared to buzz a military plane. Later that night in       |
| Sapello, New Mexico a light was seen dimming and brightening in the   |
| sky at 11:15 p.m. It rose vertically, then zigzagged erratically,     |
| then shot straight up. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO         |

| 2000 - At 7:00 p.m. Ignatiy Aleksandrovich Srartsev and two of his    |
| friends were out in a wooded field near Firsanovka, Moscow, Russia    |
| when they heard a strong whistling sound coming from behind the       |
| trees. They then noticed a round object ringed with portholes. The    |
| UFO hovered over them and emitted some kind of beam of energy. The    |
| ray hit one of the men, who seemed to disappear in plain sight of the |
| other two men. Only his clothes remained. Three minutes later he      |
| reappeared, completely naked, in front of his stunned friends. He     |
| said that he had been abducted by "leshies" (Russian wood goblins),   |
| but the other two quickly pointed out to him that it had been a UFO.  |
| The men then quickly left the area. The man's memory of the event was |
| completely gone. He could only vaguely remember that some strange     |
| gray-colored beings had been sticking needles into his body. (Source: |

| 2000 - Fisherman off the south coast of Viegues Island, Puerto Rico   |
| sighted a huge disc with a great many blinking lights surrounding it. |
| On the bottom of the object was a big green light that beamed down to |
| the ocean surface. The UFO hovered 100 feet over the ocean surface    |
| while a huge bolume of water rose and entered the object. (Source:    |
