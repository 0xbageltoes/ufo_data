| 1860 - In Wilmington, Delaware at 9:45 p.m. a pale blue light         |
| illuminated a 200-foot long cloud-like object in the sky that moved   |
| slowly and silently through the sky. At regular distances behind the  |
| cloud followed three "very red and glowing balls." (Source: Gordon    |

| 1947 - At 9:30 p.m. four or five bright white, one-meter wide discs   |
| flew over New Cumberland, West Virginia one after the other at        |
| 15-minute intervals. They flew away to the south. At 10:30 in Topeka, |
| Kansas a disc-shaped object flew in from the northwest, stopped in    |
| midair, and circled. Two more discs, one each from the southwest and  |
| southeast fly in and join the first one. All three fly away silently  |
| toward the west. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, cases     |
| 1163 & 1164).                                                         |

| 1950 - USAF weather reconnaissance sighted four groups of round,      |
| metallic silvery objects flying over Fort Peck, Montana at 11:51 a.m. |
| (Source: Project Blue Book, July 1950 report).                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1950 - At 1:45 p.m. a CAA flight engineer, flying over Cincinnati,    |
| Ohio sighted a metallic cigar-shaped UFO maneuvering silently in the  |
| sky. It ascended to 17,000 feet and stopped in midair, hovering in    |
| place for ten seconds. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database,     |
| case 1766).                                                           |

| 1950 - Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. At 5:00 p.m. two skilled Arsenal    |
| employees, witnessed a bowtie-shaped object flying in the sky,        |
| appearing like it was made of polished aluminum. It flew straight and |
| level, then one triangle rotated one-quarter of a turn in the         |
| opposite direction and returned to its original position. The object  |
| then made a ninety-degree turn and accelerated away after at least 30 |
| seconds. (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in official         |
| statistics, case 758; Don Berliner, Project Bluebook Unknowns).       |
|                                                                       |
| 1952 - A National Airlines flight flying some sixty miles southwest   |
| of Washington, D.C. over Virginia reported that a bluish-white light  |
| approached their plane, hovered, and then moved away. The UFO was     |
| tracked on radar by Washington National radar operators. (Source:     |
| Project Blue Book).                                                   |

| 1959 - Walking to her cow shed on her farm in Blenheim, New Zealand   |
| at 5:40 a.m. Mrs. Frederick Moreland saw a round object with two      |
| intense green lights come down out of the clouds and hover at rooftop |
| level. Around its rim were two counter-rotating rows of jets giving   |
| off orange flames and heat. A transparent glass-like cowling covered  |
| the top, and through this she could see two men wearing diver's       |
| helmets. One of them stood up and leaned forward. Both wore           |
| tight-fitting silvery suits. As it departed the UFO made a            |
| high-pitched whining noise, and left behind an odor "like pepper."    |

| 1959 - At midnight in Suchs, Spain a Mr. Domingo watched a 80 cm      |
| sphere hover only 15 meters above the ground. It illuminated the      |
| countryside "like daylight." The witness panicked and ran when he     |
| heard the sound of an explosion. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester      |

| 1966 - Camillo Faieta, age 35, a lineman for the local utility        |
| company, was on duty at 2:20 a.m. when a brilliant light dazzled him. |
| He determined that the light came from an object on a small island in |
| the Emissario Canal near Pontedera, Italy. Two little men were seen   |
| briefly on the ground before the object took off. There were four     |
| other witnesses to the sighting in addition to Sr. Faieta. (Sources:  |

| 1969 - A disc was sighted over a farm south of Garrison, Iowa shortly |
| after 10 p.m. A 40-foot wide circle of burnt soybean plants was found |
| in a field on the farm. (Source: APRO Bulletin, July-August 1969, p.  |
| 1).                                                                   |

| 1972 - A dead dog was found with all of its hair missing in           |
| Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Forty feet away from the carcass was a      |
| six-foot wide circle of swirled grass. (Source: Ted Phillips,         |

| 1990 - Manchester, New Hampshire. At 7:00 p.m. a teenage girl saw a   |
| brilliant light from her bedroom window rise from and hover over a    |
| swamp across the road and a few hundred feet away. She realized that  |
| this was the forward light of a tapered cylindrical object. It        |
| rotated to reveal its length. There were square lights or windows     |
| equally spaced along the midsection of its dark gray metallic         |
| surface. At one end was a horizontal cable, at the end of which was a |
| red light. The object glided along laterally until she lost sight of  |
| it behind a line of trees. (Source: Dan Wright, MUFON UFO Journal,    |
| February 1991, p. 11).                                                |

| 1993 - At 9:15 p.m. in Syracuse, Indiana a man on his porch heard a   |
| dynamo humming sound. He went to his backyard and saw a multi-colored |
| cigar-shaped object drift slowly toward the west, rise up 50-70 feet, |
| and then drift to the north. It passed in front of trees, and then    |
| behind some more trees and was gone from view. (Source: MUFON         |
| investigation files, case 931243J)                                    |

| 1993 - At 9:30 p.m. in Ligonier, Indiana two teenagers driving south  |
| on Sparta Lake Road saw several red lights moving at a low altitude   |
| and making a humming sound. They stopped and got out of their car to  |
| watch as the lights maneuvered over farm buildings and then go behind |
| some trees. At the same time or five minutes later in Cromwell,       |
| Indiana three people traveling south on Rte. 3 saw a number of lights |
| that appeared to be a multi-colored oval-shaped UFO. It made a        |
| whining noise. (Source: MUFON investigations files, cases 931244J and |
| 931245J).                                                             |

| 1994 - A luminous, diamond-shaped UFO dropped down over a road in     |
| Avezzano, Italy. It turned, leveled off, and flew off toward the      |
| north-northeast. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case      |
| 16443).                                                               |

| 1995 - Two strange looking, short humanoids stood at the foot of a    |
| woman's bed in Winnipeg, Manitoba at one o'clock in the morning. She  |
| was almost completely unable to move, but managed to touch one of the |
| beings before they disappeared. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |

| 1996 - SAS troops on an ambush patrol in South Armagh, Northern       |
| Ireland saw four small Grey humanoids walk up from behind a hill and  |
| cross their path. Minutes later the special services soldiers saw a   |
| flash of light in the sky. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |

| 2000 - At 1:30 a.m. a woman and a professor friend of hers had just   |
| left a Lions Club dinner and were driving south of Puerto Cuatro,     |
| Chile when they spotted two strange yellow lights ahead on the        |
| roadway. The driver flashed her high beams at the two intense lights  |
| and she began to slow down her car because they remained stationary.  |
| They then saw a figure standing about three feet away from the front  |
| bumper. The figure was described as large, lacking ears, and covered  |
| with extremely long gray hair, particularly around the neck. It had   |
| two immense, slanted yellow eyes. The driver and the creature         |
| exchanged stares for about ten seconds, after which the car drove     |
| along the left lane. The creature followed the vehicle's departure    |
| with its head, and its neck was apparently able to make 180-degree    |
| turns. Terrified, the two drove away. They saw the yellow light again |
| as it lit up the entire road before disappearing. (Source: Albert S.  |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2000, case # 3784, citing Joseph   |
| Trainor, UFO Roundup, Vol. 5, No. 31).                                |

| 2002 - Three lights maneuvered, pulsed, and then faded out on a clear |
| night in Paramus, New Jersey at 11:10 p.m. Two of the objects moved   |
| slowly toward the northeast at a high altitude. The third object      |
| appeared in the northeast sky and flew between the first two, then    |
| changed direction and flew toward the north. All objects pulsed       |
| brightly and then faded. (Source: UFO Magazine (US), October 2002, p. |
