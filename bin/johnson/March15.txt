| 1950 - At 6:15 p.m. a disc-shaped object circled a motorist on        |
| highway 153 north of Clearfield, Pennsylvania. There were humanoids   |
| inside the craft that were visible through windows, and a             |
| bluish-green ray was shot in the direction of the witness but missed. |
| A white light lingered in the area for more than 30 seconds, then the |
| UFO flew off toward the northwest. (Sources: William Baggs, Miami     |

| 1951 - Three men saw a one hundred foot long metallic cigar-shaped    |
| object over the city of New Delhi, India at 9:50 a.m. It gave off a   |
| black exhaust when it accelerated. The UFO flew toward the southwest  |
| and then vanished from sight. It was visible for over seven minutes.  |

| 1959 - A reddish yellow sphere stopped 100 meters over the Torino,    |
| Italy airfield at 11:00 p.m. It was pulsating and very bright, and    |
| hovered 20 minutes. (Sources: UFO Nachtrichten, September 1959; Larry |

| 1965 - Mr. James Flynn, a 45-year-old man, was out in a boat with his |
| hunting dogs in the Big Cypress Swamp in Florida when he encountered  |
| a metallic cone-shaped UFO at around one o'clock in the morning. The  |
| UFO had three rows of square windows and a yellow light. It made a    |
| generator-like sound, then emitted a jet-like sound followed by a     |
| blast of air. His dogs howled. Then a beam of light shot out from     |
| underneath the object, striking the witness in the forehead. He fell  |
| unconscious, and awoke with blindness in his right eye. Damaged       |
| foliage was found at the site, and Mr. Flynn was admitted to hospital |
| for a five day stay. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen, Flying Saucers: The |

| 1974 - At 1:45 a.m. a man and his fiancé were in a parked car on a    |
| road near the shore in Erbalunga, Corsica, France when he looked up   |
| and saw on the roadside bank, only 10 feet from their car, the        |
| silhouettes of three persons with long arms, bending forward. They    |
| appeared "smooth" and no clothing was seen. The witness at once       |
| backed up and got out of the road; then his fiancé called his         |
| attention to a pyramid-shaped luminous object which was just taking   |
| off from a spot about 400 feet away. It had a brilliant yellow base   |
| separated by a black band from an orange point area; the point was    |
| directed diagonally downwards. Once the object was in the air it      |
| suddenly disappeared. The car's radio went out as the object took     |
| off. A search the next day found no traces. (Sources: David F. Webb & |

| 1974 - A man was sleeping in his van in Metairie, Louisiana after     |
| visiting a friend when he awoke at six o'clock in the morning to see  |
| a silver disc-shaped object hovering above a house across the street. |
| It made no noise at all. His next memory was of getting out of the    |
| van. Later he had vague memories of sitting in some type of cold      |
| silvery metallic chair and having several "people" standing around    |
| him. He remembered that the "aliens" told him not to be afraid, and   |
| that someday they would be back. He could not recall anything else.   |

| 1977 - At 8:30 p.m. Mrs. Joan Le Clair and four other local people    |
| saw a UFO hovering over some nearby trees in West Jacksonport, Door   |
| County, Wisconsin. Mrs. Le Clair looked through binoculars and could  |
| see an elongated object, green on top and bottom, with a red band     |
| around the center. "There appeared to be another compartment on the   |
| bottom of this disc, and I could see windows in this lower part.      |
| There appeared to be a figure inside the object." After three minutes |
| the UFO sped away. Other observers of the UFO failed to see the       |
| windows or the occupant. (Sources: Sturgeon Bay Advocate, March 17,   |

| 1999 - At 11:15 p.m. 18-year-old Rodrigo Friedrich was returning home |
| from a party in Altonia, Parana, Brazil when he noticed what appeared |
| to be numerous shiny stars in the sky. One of the “stars” began to    |
| descend at high speed. He at first thought it was a shooting star and |
| ignored it. Forty minutes later, when he reached home, a bright glow  |
| attracted his attention about to a spot about a kilometer away.       |
| Curious, he approached and encountered a 30-meter wide disc-shaped    |
| object that was completely illuminated. Near the object where six     |
| short humanoids, running back and forth and seemingly looking for     |
| something. Rodrigo began to get a headache and tried to yell out to   |
| attract some additional witnesses, but with no success, so he left.   |
| As he walked away he looked back and saw the object climb into the    |
| sky at high speed. Several days later Rodrigo began experiencing      |
| nightmares in which he saw short, gray-colored humanoids. (Source:    |
