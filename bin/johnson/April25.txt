| 1897 - People returning from church in Merkel, Texas observed a heavy |
| object being dragged along the ground by a rope attached to a flying  |
| craft. The rope got caught in a railroad track. The craft was too     |
| high for its structure to be visible but protrusions and a light      |
| could be distinguished. After about ten minutes a man came down along |
| the rope and cut the end free. He climbed back aboard the craft,      |
| which flew away toward the northeast. The man was small and dressed   |
| in a light blue uniform. (Sources: Houston Daily Post, April 28,      |

| 1898 - Astronomer Michailovitch at the Belgrade Observatory in        |
| Serbia, Yugoslavia sighted a fireball at 9:32 p.m. that stopped still |
| in the sky and hovered in one spot for six minutes before continuing  |
| on. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Anatomy of a Phenomenon, p. 17; Ion      |

| 1950 - A series of unknown lights and UFOs where seen near the Dugway |
| Proving Grounds in Utah. A "flying icebox," surrounded by an aura of  |
| spears was seen over the Ammunition Storage Area near Dougway         |
| Mountain at 3:00 a.m. A 24-hour search of the area ensued. (Sources:  |

| 1950 - At 4:00 p.m. a 200 foot long cone-shaped device flew over the  |
| Vancouver, British Columbia airport at 15,000 feet altitude, and      |
| there were many calls to the police and news media. A white substance |
| hung about the tail of the object but it left no condensation trail.  |
| The sighting lasted one minute. (Sources: The Oregonian, April 26,    |

| 1952 - At three a.m. a shining white metallic disc with legs, a       |
| ladder, a tube, and a transparent dome landed in the Serchio River in |
| Liguria, Italy. It shot red beams of light at the witnesses, who were |
| able to avoid being hit by them by jumping into a ditch. (Source:     |

| 1954 - Three trained weather observers at Kadena Air Force Base in    |
| Kadena, Japan sighted bluish-white circular objects overhead at 11:30 |
| p.m. The USAF specialists named Spillem, Duracher, and Conner watched |
| the UFOs make two circles,  then zigzag to the south. They made       |
| another circle, and then went off to the southeast. Circular,         |
| bluish-white in color. No sound, no radar tracks, no balloons aloft.  |
|                                                                       |
| 1959 - Luis Da Silva saw a "red hot" colored disc in the sky on the   |
| evening of April 23rd in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Around midnight of April  |
| 23-24 he awoke and felt the need to go outside to the garden. There   |
| he found a noted that told him to return the following night at 1:30  |
| a.m. When he did so, a circular UFO appeared in the air 300 feet      |
| above the ground, and he felt himself paralyzed. A man descended from |
| the UFO in a slow spiral, but when he reached the ground he stopped   |
| above it and his feet did not quite touch the ground. He wore a       |
| helmet and some form of plastic clothing, and gloves looking like     |
| they were made of a transparent, glass material. He told Da Silva to  |
| return on Thursday at 2:05 a.m., and then re-ascended in a spiral     |
| into the craft. On Thursday the same sequence of events occurred, but |
| the next time three entities descended in sequence. The last one of   |
| these men asked Da Silva for a piece of paper, and inscribed upon it  |
| a message of some kind, written in indescipherable markings.          |

| 1960 - Mrs. M. Clark of Shelby, Montana saw five circular or round    |
| objects fly in a trail formation, hover, accelerate, and make sharp   |
| turns. A strong white light beam shone down from the balls of light   |
| (BOL), which had a red glow. They flew at a low altitude, and made    |
| sharp turns. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official    |

| 1966 - On this night at around 8:15 p.m. two motorists in Towanda,    |
| Pennsylvania felt heat and had their car engine and headlights fail   |
| when they encountered a UFO with four portholes hovering about 350    |
| feet away, with flames shooting off of it. (Sources: Timothy Green    |

| 1966 - At 8:52 p.m. EDT the governor of Florida's plane was paced by  |
| two UFOs over Ocala, Florida. The crew and passengers of the Convair  |
| aircraft carrying Florida Governor Haydon Burns sighted two           |
| apparently connected bright yellow or yellow-orange globe-shaped      |
| objects that paced the plane for about 40 miles. Witnesses included   |
| newsmen and state officials. When Burns ordered his pilot to turn     |
| toward the UFOs, they climbed steeply and disappeared. (Sources: Palm |

| 1968 - A "saucer nest" crop circle was found in sugar cane near West  |
| Cairns, Queensland, Australia. It was oval in shape, 70 feet by 36    |
| feet. (Sources: Stan Seers, FSR, May-June 1969, p. 4; Ted R.          |

| 1969 - At 7:30 p.m. a ten-meter diameter disc-shaped object was seen  |
| hovering over a park in Greenacre, New South Wales, Australia by      |
| three witnesses. A Greenacre woman, Mrs. Froml, and her 13-year old   |
| daughter were going home by taxi. When they passed Roberts Park they  |
| saw the object hovering over a playing field lit by floodlights,      |
| where some youths were playing football. The floodlights formed a     |
| kind of ceiling over the field and it was unlikely that had any of    |
| the players looked up, they would have seen anything. The object was  |
| football shaped, the top was transparent, and the bottom was a        |
| greenish metallic color, like gun metal. It had an interior light     |
| that was "the brightest blue imaginable," and the bottom portion had  |
| three large transparent holes. The object was tilted downward, and    |
| inside the object could be seen three tall humanoid figures, over six |
| feet tall. in the transparent upper half of the UFO. One pointed down |
| at the witnesses and then turned toward a rectangular, lighted area,  |
| apparently working some controls. Mrs Froml asked the cabbie, a Greek |
| immigrant, to stop the taxi, but instead he accelerated away from the |
| park and drove straight to her home. After he dropped her and her     |
| daughter off, he left in a frightened state, without collecting his   |
| fare. (Sources: Bill Chalker, The Oz Files, p. 126; David F. Webb &   |

| 1971 - About 9:00 p.m. a woman near Pottstown, Pennsylvania spotted a |
| luminous object over a farmer's field while driving on a rural road.  |
| It was a very bright, pulsating light. It would move and stop, move   |
| and stop, in a jerking manner. She first thought the object was       |
| something conventional like an aircraft light, but its strange motion |
| seemed to belie that explanation. The woman stopped the car next to   |
| the field and just studied the object. The object was about as high   |
| as the light on a radio tower. She rolled down her window see if      |
| there was any engine noise, but there was none. (Source: NICAP UFO    |

| 1974 - A domed disc-shaped object hovered nearby an apartment         |
| building in Marcinelle, Belgium at 10:30 p.m. It inclined toward the  |
| witness, a single woman named Bouchez who was inside the building,    |
| and then shot three beams of light over the apartment building.       |

| 1975 - Three events occurred in Rugles, Eure, France during this      |
| remarkable experience that lasted over an hour, beginning at 9:30     |
| p.m. First, a meteor was seen shooting through the sky. Next, a 40    |
| meter diameter dome with a  smaller disc was seen. Finally, a small   |
| glowing dome appeared inside a room. (Source: GEPA Phenomenes         |

| 1976 - At 10:30 p.m. a 12 meter in diameter UFO crossed the road in   |
| front of a car being driven by a Mr. Y. Vandenbroek in Tervuren,      |
| Belgium, at an altitude of 100 meters. Suddenly four searchlights     |
| were turned on inside the object, and directed at the ground. The     |
| object moved silently, tilted at an angle after five minutes, and     |
| moved away slowly. There were eight witnesses from four separate      |
| families. (Source: Rudy de Groote, UFO Register, volume 7 (1976), p.  |
| 31, citing the Gazzette Antwerpen).                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - At 3:50 a.m. eight soldiers on a military patrol on the Pampa  |
| Lluscuma, Chile suddenly saw a bright light nearby. The soldiers' dog |
| and horses remained still while the lights hovered nearby. The leader |
| of the group, Corporal Armando Valdes, ordered the other soldiers to  |
| put out their campfire. The two large lights were about 800 meters    |
| away, and hovering close to the ground. Cpl. Valdes approached the    |
| lights, ordering them to identify themselves. At this point a bright  |
| light enveloped Valdes and he vanished in plain view of the others.   |
| The others began frantically searching for him but they were unable   |
| to find him. At around 4:15 a.m. Valdes suddenly reappeared. He had a |
| strange look on his face and he emitted a sinister laugh, asking      |
| several times where his mother was. Then he said, again in a very     |
| sinister sounding voice, "you will never know who we are and where we |
| come from."                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| The others noticed that he appeared to have a week's growth of beard, |
| whereas he had been clean-shaven just an hour ago, and his digital    |
| watch indicated the impossible date of April 30. He was almost in     |
| hysterics and one of the soldiers had to slap him, at which point he  |
| fainted. One of the other soldiers, Raul Salinas, who had been        |
| standing a few meters back of the others, noticed a strange humanoid  |
| creature behind some nearby rocks. He described it as half animal and |
| half human; no facial features were visible, but it seemed to be      |
| wearing a helmet and was carrying a red light. Salinas was stunned to |
| see the creature appear at several places simultaneously, he thought  |
| that maybe it could have been several humanoids. He did not mention   |
| this to the others at the time, since they were already scared, but   |
| the others did not see the humanoid or humanoids. When Valdes woke up |
| he could not remember where he had been. It is assumed the Chilean    |
| military conducted various medical tests on Valdes. (Source: Albert   |
| S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1977, case # 3062, citing Diego |
| Contreras & Raul Nunez).                                              |

| 1978 - At 2:15 a.m. a UFO with an inside occupant was sighted by a    |
| Mr. Hake while driving along Highway 83 in Baltimore, Maryland. The   |
| close encounter lasted several minutes. (Source: CUFOS files, report  |
| received in 1978).                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - At 2:30 in the afternoon the witness was in her kitchen in     |
| Villamare Di Sapri, Italy when she noticed a large luminous sphere;   |
| clear in color descend to the ground nearby. The witness went to      |
| fetch a camera. At this point the sphere seemed to shrink in size and |
| a short being wearing a bright orange coverall type suit stepped out. |
| The being walked around looking in all directions. Its face appeared  |
| brighter than the rest of the body and it had human like features. On |
| its head it wore a cone-shaped device or cap. It moved in short steps |
| and bounds. This apparently frightened the witness who yelled for her |
| husband. The being glanced at the witness and then ran behind a       |
| nearby tree stump. A thick fog then began forming in the area and     |
| simultaneously the luminous sphere shrank in size and dissolved into  |
| nothing. The being apparently disappeared also. (Sources: Lumieres    |

| 1978 - At 7:00 p.m.a witness on the shore in Vittorio, Sicily, Italy  |
| observed through binoculars a glowing "boat"  5 kilometers offshore.  |
| It then ascends, and hovers in the sky for 45 minutes. It had two     |
| antennas at the ends of the object. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,   |

| 1978 - Later that same day UFO investigator Pat De La Franier was in  |
| his office in Stratford, Ontario going over some UFO reports when     |
| there was a sudden knock at the door. Where his office is located he  |
| could ordinarily hear everyone coming through the main door when      |
| admitted through the security door, and then hear their footsteps     |
| walking down the hall. But this knock came abruptly, and when he      |
| opened the door there was a very odd-looking man standing there. He   |
| was dressed entirely in black. He was about five and a half feet      |
| tall, extremely thin, with a somewhat unusually large head. His hair  |
| looked like it had been completely shaved and the hair was just       |
| growing back. His skin had an unusual olive hue. His lips were very   |
| thin and his cheeks were sunken in. His eyes were dark and so         |
| elongated that they literally wrapped around his temples. La Franier  |
| had never seen eyes like that, "They just bored into me". The         |
| stranger just stood there staring at him. La Franier was fixated by   |
| his eyes and he felt somehow intruded upon on a mental level. After a |
| full minute the man spoke. "Would you like a photograph of your       |
| family?" It was a strange question, and his voice was very strange,   |
| too. It was low and hesitant as if this man had absolutely a poor     |
| conception of how to put a sentence together. The English was         |
| flawless, but he struggle to get through the sentence. La Franier     |
| said no, he did not need any more pictures. And with that the         |
| stranger stepped back, turned and just disappeared. The man was       |
| completely gone. Later La Franier discovered that many of his papers  |
| were missing. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database,  |

| 1981 - In Beijing, China at 7:00 a.m. a bullet-shaped ellipsoid, with |
| the middle of the object white and the bottom green, glowed and hung  |
| in the sky in a vertical position. It moved slowly, then stopped, and |
| finally shot away fast. The sighting lasted 25 minutes. (Source:      |

| 1981 - At 3:54 a.m. a dog barked excitedly at the same time a married |

| object with a long tail hung in the sky, rocking back and forth 80    |
| feet above the ground over a garden in Blairgowrie, The Orkney        |
| Islands, Scotland. Mrs. Freeman's dog cowered, and she was            |

| civilians and law enforcement officers in Waynesville, Ohio. From     |
| their home a husband and wife were the first to report a circular     |
| lighted object hovering silently in the southern sky. The big light   |

| was encased within a structure that resembled gridwork. The couple    |
| called the Lebanon City Police Department around 10:15 p.m. and the   |
| Warren County Communications Center dispatched a Waynesville police   |
| officer to the location. Upon arrival at the scene the officer        |

| 2006 - Between 2:30 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. a teardrop shaped,             |
| silver/chrome metallic flying object, 3-4 feet wide by 8 feet to 10   |
| feet long, flew just 50 feet above the witnesses' car while they were |
| driving on east bound I-70, about 50 miles west of Green River, Utah. |
| The buzzing by the object was brief, and lasted only 2-3 seconds.     |
| (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, April 2006   |

| 2007 - In Northern India (exact location not given), the witness was  |
| returning home from work at 2:00 a.m. when suddenly the road in front |
| of him ‘disappeared’ because there was a huge bus-like object with no |
| wheels hovering over the road, blocking it. He then flashed on the    |
| car high beams to get a better look, and when he did this the         |
| object split in two and there was a very bright flash of light,       |
| lighting up everything briefly like daytime. A creature descended     |
| from the object and looked at the witness. Terrified, he turned the   |
| car’s headlights off, but kept the engine running so he could escape  |
| in the event of an attack. However, the being seemed to ignore him.   |
| It looked humanoid but was about 7-8 feet tall and quite bulky and    |
| hairy like a bear. The head was slightly bigger than that of an       |
| average man. It was carrying an instrument that looked like a crystal |
| cube with a handle. It raised the instrument and waved it around      |
| briefly, and then took out a box and put the instrument in it. It     |
| then approached the witness’s car and as it approached the witness    |
| felt heat and a ‘force of high magnitude’. When it was about a meter  |
| away from him the man fainted due to the intense pressure he was      |
| feeling, like a G-force caused by high speed acceleration. He         |
| regained consciousness after 10 minutes, and the creature and the     |
| object were gone. There was a depression in the road about one foot   |
| in depth and 10-12 feet in diameter, where the UFO had been hovering. |
| The witness rushed home but was unable to sleep. The next day, while  |
| going to the office, he stopped at the same spot and noticed that     |
| somehow the road had been repaired. (Sources: Peter Davenport,        |
