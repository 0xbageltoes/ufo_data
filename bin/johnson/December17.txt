| would die. After a short while the light moved away. (Sources:        |

| UFO was sighted from the air by a pilot and co-pilot. It flew at a    |
| high rate of speed and was tracked on radar. Radio interference       |
| between the warplane and the base was also noted at the time. On that |
| same night a humanoid encounter occurred in the United States. At     |
| about 9 p.m. in Conashaugh, Pennsylvania Ms. M. Carow, a 68-year-old  |
| woman, went out in her backyard with a flashlight and was surprised   |
| to see two dwarves. One was three feet tall, the other one three and  |
| a half feet tall. Both wore tight silver suits and helmets. The       |
| shorter one was stocky but the taller one was slender. She shone her  |
| flashlight on them for three minutes before they walked away.         |

| blue discs of light around the rim. A snowy white mist, apparently    |
| generated by the UFO concealed the ground beneath the object.         |
