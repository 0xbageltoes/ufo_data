| 1953 - At 3:45 p.m. northwest of Sonoma, California two military      |
| witnesses with high credibility and training, named McNab and Hunter, |
| saw a UFO make 90-degree and 180-degree turns and full stops, rise    |
| vertically, then shoot off toward the northwest. (Sources: J. Allen   |

| 1957 - Six witnesses in Stafford, England including a man named       |
| Roestenberg sighted a cigar-shaped object moving toward the southwest |
| at 4:35 p.m. It left behind an orange trail twice its own length.     |
| When a jet plane approached it rose vertically and vanished into the  |
| sky. The duration of the sighting was five minutes. (Sources: Richard |

| 1961 - At 12:14 p.m. a Polaris missile launched from Cape Canaveral,  |
| Florida was paced by a UFO. Its radar signal was so strong that the   |
| radar tracking locked onto the UFO instead of the missile.The UFO     |
| stayed on the radar screen for several minutes. (Source: William R.   |

| 1961 - At 9:12 p.m. a bright red disc-shaped object was sighted near  |
| Benjamin, Texas by two men in a light plane. It followed their Beech  |
| Debonair airplane, zigzagged, and then landed. The pilot was          |
| interviewed by the US Air Force. (Sources: Dominique Weinstein,       |

| 1967 - A gray 30-foot long ovoid UFO with a blue halo flew only 25    |
| feet above a car on a road in Bruceville, Indiana at 8:30 p.m. It had |
| lights on its rim and made no sound as it flew. It show away toward   |
| the southeast. The sighting lasted two minutes. (Source: Francis L.   |

| 1973 - At one a.m. in Quarouble, France a glowing box shone a strong  |
| beam of light. It made some complex maneuvers, ascending into the     |
| sky, then flew off toward the southeast. (Source: Lumieres dans la    |

| 1975 - On this night three teenagers named Jones, Symms, and Dencie   |
| were driving by Lake Erie in St. Thomas, Ontario when a blue light    |
| came and hovered over their car, and then followed it along road.     |
| They made a sharp turn in their car, and the UFO made an even sharper |
| turn. The car then stalled, and the radio went off as the light drew  |
| closer. It then flew off toward the west. (Source: London (Ontario)   |
| Free Press, January 10, 1975).                                        |

| 1976 - Near the shore of the ocean in Merville, Normandy, France a    |
| witness named Masseron heard a voice repeating "LPX LPX..." at around |
| ten p.m. and saw a 1.5 meter long ovoid object standing on the        |
| ground. A black being stood nearby. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,   |
| June 1978).                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - A 25-year-old man name Price observed two irregularly shaped   |
| bright yellow objects in the night sky while driving near Grafton,    |
| New South Wales, Australia at around 4:00 a.m. One of the objects     |
| approached and appeared to slowly move down a mountainside. It seemed |
| to periodically issue a "shower of sparks". This initial sighting     |
| lasted for about 20 minutes. The man then drove on but had difficulty |
| recollecting the next part of his journey. Some 30 minutes later he   |
| observed a very bright object that looked like a "chicken coop" at a  |
| place called Bakers Creek Falls, near Armidale, New South Wales. The  |
| object was on the ground, stationary for 10 minutes, and then it      |
| moved. It was a very large elongated object with "portholes",         |
| hovering over the ground. He took photographs but they only show a    |
| blurred yellow shape.                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| Mr. Price next got out of his car and set off walking into the        |
| paddock to try to get closer to the object. However, as he got nearer |
| the object appeared to retreat into an extensive fog. The witness     |
| advanced and saw the fog retreating out of the ravine. Suddenly the   |
| movement of the fog stopped and returned along its original path      |
| towards him. It quickly enveloped him, reducing visibility to less    |
| than 10 feet. The fog was accompanied by a sound similar to a vacuum  |
| cleaner. Then the fog quickly dissipated along with the sound,        |
| leaving the witness alone. He returned to his car in the morning and  |
| noticed two "shockwaves" one minute apart, as if the whole area was   |
| suddenly shaken, and then normality. The witness could not recollect  |
| up to an hour of the journey despite traveling on a twisting and      |
| turning road, which presumably required the driver's constant         |
| attention. (Sources: ACOS Bulletin, September 1978, p. 27; Thomas E.  |

| 1978 - On or before this day at 4:20 p.m. a married couple named      |
| Blakemore encountered a black cylindrical UFO with a turret at the    |
| rear in Blandford, Dorset, England. The UFO emitted a cloud of fog or |
| smoke, radiated beams of light, and then ascended into the sky.       |

| 1978 - Mr. Gould, age 52, was chopping wood just north of his house   |
| in South Middleton, Massachusetts at 2:30 p.m. when he spotted a      |
| white-suited figure standing on a path about 90 feet away. The figure |
| was described as four and a half feet tall with broad shoulders and   |
| arms that hung down its sides. It wore a square helmet with two round |
| eyeholes and gray gloves, each with three digits. The witness spoke   |
| English and French at the figure but got no reaction. After awhile    |
| the witness drove back home and on his way there spotted a large      |
| egg-shaped object on a slope in a partially wooded area. The object   |
| was dark gray in color and had bubble like windows. Ground traces     |
| were found. (Source: David F. Webb, FSR, June 1981, p. 24; David F.   |
