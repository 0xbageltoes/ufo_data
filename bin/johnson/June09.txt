| 1951 - At 8:10 p.m. in Mikkeli, Finland two witnesses watched a 25    |
| meter diameter disc-shaped object flying at 300 meters altitude. It   |
| was absolutely silent and continued to fly slowly at a low altitude   |
| toward Leningrad, Russia. (Source: (1) Larry Hatch, U computer        |

| 1954 - Janet Brown, age 16, and a 13-year-old friend of East          |
| Dandenong, Victoria heard a loud noise at 6:20 p.m. and saw a large,  |
| dark object that "burst into light" hovering 20 meters away at the    |
| height of a factory gate. It was cylindrical, 10 meters long, 5       |
| meters high, with a canopy on top. It flew away and was lost to sight |
| behind some trees. (Sources: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers           |

| 1958 - At 10:17 a.m. a pilot named Scharf flying an F-102 fighter     |
| aircraft over Puget Sound, Washington State and many others sighted a |
| white cylinder-shaped UFO with a slight orange tint, which oscillated |
| and maneuvered for four minutes. The Air Force attempted to explain   |
| this sighting as a weather balloon. (Sources:Project Blue Book files  |

| 1967 - Four Spanish Air Force pilots, in a T-33 and an F-86, were     |
| chasing a UFO over Extremadura, Jaen, Spain when their communication  |
| radios failed. The UFO played cat-and-mouse with the T-33 aircraft    |
| when the pilot attempted pursuit. After several minutes the object    |
| shot straight up and disappeared. (Sources: Vicente-Juan Ballester    |

| 1967 - Six-year-old Leland Wlazlak was in the bathroom in Seattle,    |
| Washington at 9 p.m. when a red ball came in through the window and   |
| struck him in the forehead. It then "went up through the ceiling." He |
| looked outside and saw bright blue, red, and black lights, and a      |
| strange being who had short horns, slanting eyes, and a lipless       |
| mouth. The stranger asked the boy what the garden soil was, and told  |
| him to "watch the rocket ship--he'd be back." Then he flew up on the  |
| roof with the aide of two tanks on his back shooting out white smoke. |
| The boy said, "He didn't have a body." Two more strange beings were   |
| visible in the ship. Then the first being came back, asked Leland     |
| what a tree in the backyard was, and pointed a device that looked     |
| like a gun at him. The boy screamed and ran out of the bathroom.      |

| 1971 - Shortly before midnight a man his driving car at the highest   |
| point on the highway north of Dunedin, New Zealand had his car's      |
| interior illuminated by a big, low flying, circular UFO. It was green |
| in color, and was trailing a long sparkly tail of red and green       |
| particles. It came from the direction of the sea off Waikouaiti, and  |
| flew off to the southwest toward Taieri. (Source: Mataoru Ensign,     |

| 1971 - Mr. & Mrs. Alvarez reported that a seven meter in diameter     |
| dome-shaped object illuminated an area 250 meters wide as it flew     |
| silently and very close to the ground in Aznalcazar, Sevilla, Spain   |
| while they were driving in the area at 9:30 p.m. (Source:             |

| 1971 - At 8:50 p.m. Miss Esther Clappison or Rosedale, Alberta        |
| noticed a light outside her home and went to the window. She saw what |
| looked like a rectangular window that she judged was about 200 feet   |
| away, illuminated from within by a white light. It was on a darkened  |
| object whose shaped she could not make out, but she believed was      |
| resting on the ground. In the window was a man less that five feet    |
| tall dressed in olive green coveralls. The outfit completely covered  |
| him, even his face. He seemed to be aware of the witness and he used  |
| his body and arm to conceal some sort of instrument panel. He seemed  |
| to be trying to attract the attention of another humanoid figure      |
| outside the object, visible in the light from the window, who was     |
| stooped over and picking up rocks from the ground. She wanted to get  |
| closer to get a better look, but her dog would not let her. Trembling |
| and cowering, the dog forced his mistress back inside the house.      |
| After the object left the grass at the landing site was charred black |
| over an area 20 feet in diameter. (Sources: John Major, FSR Case      |

| 1971 - An oblong shaped UFO was seen in the sky over the shore at     |
| Morgans' Point, Texas at 11:30 p.m. by a man named Churchill. It      |
| "glowed brilliantly pink and then faded" 4 or 5 times as it flew. It  |
| was visible for 90 minutes. (Source: Austin American-Statesman, June  |
| 12, 1971).                                                            |

| 1972 - At 10:30 p.m. a young man in Algodonales, Cadiz, Spain         |
| observed a very bright light which temporarily blinded him. The       |
| engine of his car failed but the headlights remained on. Ahead of his |
| car, in the middle of the road, was a yellow oval shaped source of    |
| throbbing light about two meters in length. Blue protuberances came   |
| from the light. It suddenly disappeared, then reappeared over a ditch |
| and finally moved away silently at treetop height. (Sources:          |

| 1976 - Mr. Lusignan, a patent examiner, lost while hiking in the      |
| mountains near Echo Lake, Clear Creek County, Colorado saw two        |
| rectangular objects descend from the sky and land by a creek at about |
| 10 p.m. He watched as 15-20 people emerged from the two craft. They   |
| were "dressed in Indian or gypsy clothing" and talked in low whispers |
| as they set up a camp for the night. They talked in an unintelligible |
| language. (Sources: Clear Creek Courant, June 18, 1976; David F. Webb |

| 1992 - At four o'clock in the morning a man suddenly awoke in his     |
| bedroom in Malibu, California and found himself unable to move. He    |
| then saw standing next to his bed three small figures. They had pale  |
| white skin, frail looking bodies, large triangular-shaped heads, and  |
| huge luminous black eyes. The figures stood motionless staring at the |
| witness emanating a feeling of curiosity. The figures then receded    |
| backwards and with an apparent look of bewilderment vanished.         |

| 1996 - At 6:00 p.m. a black sphere shot at an Air France airliner     |
| from the Mediterranean Sea, then flew 30 meters above the aircraft.   |
| The plane requested and made an emergency landing at Ben Gurion       |
| airport in Israel. No Israeli military launches where in the area at  |
| the time of the report. (Sources: UFO Magazine (USA) November 1996,   |
| p. 24; Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p. 48).          |
| 1998 - At 6:20 a.m. several witnesses in a vehicle in Lynch Mountain, |
| Kentucky watched a tall glowing figure, without a neck and with a     |
| large head that was large on top and small at the bottom. It glided   |
| through a guardrail towards their vehicle. As it passed by the        |
| vehicle shook very hard. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |

| 1999 - White filamentous threads like "angel hair" fell for five      |
| hours from the sky, leaving a sheen on paddocks, hedges, and trees    |
| over a 90 km area around Esperance, Western Australia. (Source: George |

| 2002 - The National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington had   |
| two reports listed of a UFO landing with short humanoids near         |
| Polanuruwa, Sri Lanka on this evening. Two witnesses went to bathe in |
| the nearby river when a UFO appeared overhead making a thundering     |
| sound. When it landed two two-foot tall humanoids came out of the     |
| craft. Reportedly, "very soon it disappeared." (Source: Peter         |

| 2004 - At 6:00 p.m. local time a teardrop-shaped UFO and other UFOs   |
| was seen in Ruby Bay, Nelson, New Zealand. The witness was standing   |
| on the beach having a smoke when he saw the object, which had         |
| spinning red lights and was beaming light down into the water. He ran |
| and got his friend to see it as well. Other residents of the          |
| campground also saw it. It moved closer towards the beach sending     |
| beams of light across the bay, and made an electrical humming noise   |
| and a thundering sound that could easily be heard. The craft moved at |
| a phenomenal speed and disappeared and reappeared in different        |
| places, moving up into the sky. At about 8:00 p.m. and over the next  |
| hour another 6 craft appeared in the sky. The objects in the sky      |
| looked like giant orbs of amber light and over the rest of the night  |
| the objects moved around the Nelson Harbour and the hills around Ruby |
| Bay. The objects came in close and shot off randomly for the rest of  |
| the night until morning. Flat batteries in cars reportedly occurred   |
| throughout the McKees Domain, and dead fish washed up on the beach in |
| Ruby Bay later that day. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO       |
