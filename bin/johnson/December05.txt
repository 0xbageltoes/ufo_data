| Lauderdale, and made increasingly frantic radio calls announcing they |
| were lost and calling for assistance. A huge rescue search operation  |
| caused more aboard a Martin Mariner sea rescue plane to be lost.      |

| were on a mission of peace, preparing people for eventual contact.    |

| 1999 - On this evening at 10 p.m. Maria Alice Medina was sitting on   |
| her verandah in Pato Branco, Parana, Brazil drinking some coffee when |
| she observed a short (1.20 meter tall) humanoid approach her. The     |
| being wore silvery coveralls and blue boots. His head was bald and he |
| had large black eyes. The humanoid attempted to communicate with her  |
| by emitting strange sounds, but Maria was not able to understand. He  |
| then turned around and walked away into some nearby woods. Soon       |
| afterwards she saw a bright light rise from the woods and shoot up    |
| into space. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database     |
