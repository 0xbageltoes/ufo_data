| 1973 - On this evening a motorist driving near Gaffney, South         |
| Carolina reported static on his car radio as he was paced by an oval, |
| metallic UFO. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle  |

| 1977 - At 1:05 a.m. a teenager in Prospect, Kentucky spotted a        |
| rectangular, orangish-red object coming down to near his jeep. His    |
| jeep's radio failed 15 seconds into the sighting. He felt compelled   |
| to watch the object, which stayed in the vicinity only a short time.  |
| Later under hypnosis, however, he related being taken inside the      |
| object and examined by three strange creatures who were shaped like   |
| machines. The electrical system on his jeep went haywire the day      |
| after the sighting. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving    |

| 1977 - At two o'clock in the afternoon Donald Fender, age 49, a       |
| self-employed bee keeper from Greeneville, Tennessee was driving on   |
| Route 40 to Madison (north of Nashville). He was in his pickup truck  |
| and had his dog with him. In the vicinity of Cookeville, Tennessee    |
| his dog began to act strangely, and Fender felt "like someone wanted  |
| to talk to me." Obeying an impulse, he turned off onto a side road.   |
| He noticed a long balloon-like thing that stretched along one side of |
| the road for a distance of about a mile or so. It was white and silky |
| in color and texture. He then saw another one on the other side of    |
| the road. Curious, he pulled over and stopped his car. His dog was by |
| then acting quite agitated.                                           |
|                                                                       |
| Suddenly, without any transition, he found himself inside a solid     |
| white oval-shaped room, or enclosure, approximately 50 feet long. He  |
| sensed, rather than observed, five humanoids gathered around him.     |
| They were small in size and they stared at him. One was to his        |
| immediate left. They began to question him about a number of things,  |
| most of which Fender was unable to remember. They also gave him       |
| certain information: they told him they "were emissaries of peace"    |
| and that they could enter Earth's atmosphere only at this point---or  |
| "window"--along the road, that this spot would "become the future     |
| home of space travel." They also told him of dire events including    |
| major catastrophes that would come about in the near future.          |
|                                                                       |
| He was shown various scenes as though he were floating far above      |
| them, of areas of mass devastation. These included scenes of          |
| farmlands he identified as being in England, which were devoid of any |
| life. After approximately 15 minutes he suddenly found himself back   |
| in his truck with no idea of how he got there. Along the roadside     |
| there was no longer anything unusual to be seen, and his dog was      |
| behaving normally again. He felt very strange and disturbed by the    |
| experience. Arriving at Madison an hour later than he expected, he    |
| was unable to account for the lost time. There was a good deal about  |
| the experience that he was unable to recall. He was so upset about it |
| that within a week he drove to Washington, D.C. to report the         |
| incident officially. He went to the Department of Defense where he    |
| claimed he spoke to Defense Secretary Brown himself. His story was    |
| met with little enthusiasm. There was more to his story than he was   |
| willing to divulge to investigators, he claimed. (Source: David F.    |

| 1978 - Four men were out pouching early in the morning in a field by  |
| the River Weaver in Fordsham, Cheshire County, England when they      |
| sighted a silvery balloon-like object float down along the course of  |
| the river and land on the bank. It emitted a strong purplish glow     |
| that made it hard to look at. Two figures of normal height emerged.   |
| They wore silvery suits and had miners lamps on their heads, and      |
| these glowed purple. Cows on a nearby field seemed to become          |
| paralyzed and unable to move. Using a metal cage, the UFOnauts penned |
| in one cow and seemed to measure it. The witnesses became frightened  |
| and ran from the area, and as they ran they felt a strange tingling   |
| sensation in their groins. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |

| 1993 - At 4:39 a.m. a woman in North Miami, Florida got up to go to   |
| the bathroom. On the way back to her bedroom she suddenly felt        |
| compelled to go to the kitchen and pull open the window. She then     |
| became afraid and went back to bed, but as she turned over in bed she |
| heard a sound like a train and then a sound like an automatic door    |
| closing. She woke up two hours later and went to take a shower; there |
| she realized that both of her knees were coated with an unknown white |
| powdery substance. Her son remembered seeing a humanoid figure        |
| standing in his doorway and then going back to sleep. (Source: Albert |

| Turner, Taken).                                                       |

| 2003 - The witness was asleep in bed with her boyfriend at their home |
| in Florida when she suddenly awoke and looked at the doorway and      |
| noticed two creatures that were "squishy" in appearance. They were    |
| dark colored and about three feet tall. By her bedside there was      |
| another creature, who was very tall, thin, and with large yellow      |
| eyes. It was between gray and lime-green in color. Terrified, she     |
| pulled the covers over her head, but suddenly she did not feel afraid |
| anymore. She then felt very confused and does not know if she left    |
| her bed, but she could not speak. At one point she was lying on her   |
| stomach and something was being inserted in her rectum. When her fear |
| returned a creature that somehow was made to appear human comforted   |
| her, telling her not to be afraid that she would not be hurt. The     |
| tall creature seemed very comforting towards the witness. He stood    |
| over her, patted her on her head and told her telepathically that     |
| they were not yet done. Soon she found herself back on her bed, very  |
| scared and confused. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact     |
