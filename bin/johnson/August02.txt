| 1909 - In Oamaru, near Sumpter's Hill, Otago, New Zealand a large     |
| boat-shaped flying object with three lights was observed at 3:00      |
| a.m., clearly illuminated by the moon. Two figures were visible       |
| inside the craft, and the object flew "at a fast rate." (Source:      |

| combat missions--saw a thin, bright silver ovoid hovering in the sky  |
| for 5-8 seconds. It then dropped down 3,000 feet in three seconds and |
| hovered again for ten seconds, and finally faded out after being in   |
| view a total of 20 seconds. It looked like it was made of highly      |
| polished metal, and was at a minimum distance of six miles from the   |
| observer. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official       |

| bottom that illuminated the road. the UFO paced their car for one     |
| kilometer, making no noise and flying just three meters above the     |
| ground. Mrs. Hiot saw a human-looking figure inside the saucer.       |

| aircraft was about to land around midnight when they saw a luminous   |
| object circling overhead at high speed. It came down to hover about   |
| one meter above the runway for some four minutes. It was spherical,   |
| spinning, and emitted flashes of blue, green and orange. When         |
| approached by ground personnel it took off at very high speed.        |

| radar trackings at several Air Force Bases in the United States. The  |
| U.S. reports centered on the midwestern states, especially Kansas,    |
| Oklahoma and Texas. There are reports from Latvia, Austria,           |
| Argentina, Peru, Mexico and seven reports from Brazil. |

| 1965 - A famous color photograph was taken in Tulsa, Oklahoma by      |
| 14-year-old Alan Smith at 1:45 a.m. Unlike most photos of alleged     |
| UFOs taken by teenagers, this one had supporting witnesses. The photo |
| shows a mosaic pattern of yellow, blue and white light in the shape   |
| of an ovoid with three tiny fingers. The object was described         |
| as about size of a basketball, which moved slowly and changed color,  |
| and also made a high pitched whining sound. Alan took his shot when   |
| the UFO was almost directly overhead. (Sources: Hayden C. Hewes,      |

| 1967 - On this day in Arbroath, Tayside, Scotland a domed oval-shaped |
| craft, 20-30 feet in length, moved slowly at 100 feet above a         |
| teenager riding on a bicycle. There was a red glow coming from the    |
| dome, which started to flash. The object was completely quiet.        |

| the S. S. Izhevsk saw a white sphere in the dark sky as it            |
| sailed slowly south. A bright football-shaped light appeared several  |
| minutes later and rushed from west to east. It threw off sparks,      |
| increased in size, stopped, became an egg in appearance, and gave off |
| a thick white mist that emerged as the object grew dim. The entire    |
| incident lasted for more than 25 minutes. (Sources: Norma Short,      |

| wheels in front for landing gear. The object rose up and was lost     |
| from sight in 30 seconds. At 11:44 p.m. a very bright red object was  |
| observed by several witnesses at treetop level over a mountain, Monte |
| Gallicant, in Tarragona province, Spain swinging like a               |
| pendulum. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Catalogue of 200     |

| 1971 - In Ohrid, nine miles from the town of Rasanec, in the former   |
| Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia a group of four had a close encounter  |
| with a silver-colored UFO. There were physiological effects when a    |
| beam of energy knocked the driver of their vehicle down, and the car  |
| radio ceased to work. The silver disc, 10-15 meters in diameter,      |
| first landed and then began glowing. Two "wings" came out of the      |
| sides as it landed. (Source: Joseph M. Brill, Skylook, September      |

| transparent domes landed in a pasture in Englefontaine, Nord          |
| department, France. They made a buzzing sound that was heard by the   |
| two children who witnessed it. the discs rose in tandem, then flew    |
| off to the west. Crop circles were found at the landing sites. At     |
| 10:30 p.m. a domed ovoid object with square windows was seen on the   |
| ground in a clearing in some woods in Auzay, Vendee department,       |
| France. The UFO jumped up from ground level, turned 120 degrees  and  |
| flew off into the woods. No traces were found at this second landing  |
| site. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 141 & 228).            |

| 1974 - In Calvert, Texas a newspaper editor and his wife heard        |
| "strange metallic noises", then witnessed a deep red UFO that         |
| "roared" and pulsated, and chased their car for several miles on      |
| Highway 979. UFO shook all over, like it was about to fall apart.     |

| 1976 - At around four o'clock in the morning Michael Wood, age 26,    |
| was driving home when, as he reached Ten Mile Hill near Hobart,       |
| Tasmania, Australia he heard a sound like loud electronic music       |
| "turned up too high.” The area in front of his car lit up like a      |
| "yellow lighted picture screen", on which he could see projected the  |
| profile of a figure, ten feet tall, wearing a tight-fitting black     |
| jacket and a pair of light trousers, which seemed to be turning to    |
| look at him. He braked his car but the car went through the “screen.” |
| He could find no trace of it after stopping and going back to look    |
| for it again. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:          |

| 1976 - At 3:30 a.m. in St. Pierre-sur-Mer, Aude department, France a  |
| five-meter in diameter domed disc was encountered hovering at six     |
| meters altitude. The lights went out immediately on the object, then  |
| came back on gradually.(Source:  Lumieres dans la Nuit, May 1977).    |

| 1979 - At 2:30 a.m. the two witnesses were driving through the town   |
| of Le Delus on the island of Ile D'Oleron, France when they noticed a |
| green flash of light overhead followed by two bright descending       |
| spheres. One of the spheres shot towards the rear of their vehicle    |
| while the other descended close to the ground. A large rectangular    |
| shaped opening became visible in the second object and three humanoid |
| figures were seen descending a ladder. The witnesses did not stay to  |
| see any more, but drove away quickly from the area. (Sources: Albert  |

| 1985 - At 9:45 p.m. in Black Earth, Wisconsin a white nocturnal       |
| light projected a beam of light that moved back and forth like a      |
| searchlight. The beam stopped, then the object descended slowly in a  |
| zig-zag pattern. There were no radar returns. (Source: Jay Rath, The  |

| 1987 - Maria Marzoli was in Domodossola, Italy at 9:45 p.m. when she  |
| saw a bright white light encased in what appeared to be a cloud       |
| descend from a nearby mountain. When she approached the spot in order |
| to get a better look she saw three floating human like figures        |
| approaching the light. The figures were about 1.80 meters in height,  |
| and glided just above the ground in a vertical position. All three    |
| wore light-colored tunics and pants and had long light-colored hair.  |
| The figures briefly turned to stare at the witness before             |
| disappearing into the bright spherical white light. The light then    |
| disappeared into the distance, changing color into a greenish tint.   |

| 1994 - The witness awoke shortly after midnight in her home in Cayey, |
| Puerto Rico after hearing a bang resembling the sound of a            |
| firecracker exploding. It came from the entrance to her bedroom. She  |
| heard the sound again, but this time it was closer to her bed, and    |
| she next saw a short, thin gray-skinned humanoid with a large head    |
| and huge black eyes walk standing in front of her bed. The            |
| creature then entered her grandson's bedroom. She then apparently     |
| fell back to sleep, because she was woken up by her grandson who told |
| her that that same short creature with large eyes had sat on his      |
| chest and had stared at him. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid     |

| 2000 - At 6:45 p.m. the witness had gone outside her house in Capilla |
| del Monte, Cordoba province, Argentina to empty the trash and was     |
| returning back to the house when she noticed something floating above |
| the ground over some nearby laurel bushes. It appeared to be an       |
| amorphous transparent figure, with large bright yellowish             |
| almond-shaped eyes. The figure floated towards a nearby tree knocking |
| itself against it, and a branch was seen to fall down. At the same    |
| time that it stared to vanish the witness heard a loud humming sound, |
| and there seemed to be a kind of charged energy in the air.           |
| Frightened, the woman ran inside the house and summoned her husband,  |
| but the figure had already vanished. The following days she suffered  |
| from headaches and heard metallic voices calling her name. (Source:   |

| 2001 - In La Joya, Guanica, Puerto Rico at 3:00 a.m., the same night  |
| that Carmelo Sepulveda found one of his rabbits decapitated and       |
| another injured, one of his neighbors heard rabbits squealing and     |
| turned on an outside lightbulb that faced toward the animal cages. He |
| then went outside to take a look, and saw something resembling a      |
| child standing next to one of the cages. However, the poor lighting   |
| was not sufficient to let him make out any details. The figure        |
| quickly took shelter among Sepulveda's cages and the rabbit's squeals |
| stopped. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2001,  |

| 2001 - At 5:30 a.m. well known local merchant was on his way south    |
| towards Antofagasta, Chile on a desolate road when he suddenly        |
| noticed a strange flying creature approaching his truck at very high  |
| speed from the direction of the sea. As he braced for a possible      |
| impact the creature suddenly shot up vertically and disappeared from  |
| sight. The creature was described as brown in color, bigger than a    |
| condor, with huge glowing red eyes and a long pointed snout. Its      |
| overall appearance was "horrible." Others have reported seeing a      |
| similar creature in the region. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |

| 2001 - On this night Ms. M. of Rosario, Argentina felt herself        |
| summoned by aliens, and she felt herself traveling through a tunnel   |
| of "water" or something that felt like water. She soon found herself  |
| in a jungle that was very hot. Next she found herself in a mansion    |
| all white in color, and it gave her the impression of being in a      |
| hospital. Inside the building she saw numerous children of both sexes |
| that apparently lived there. The children were barefoot and wore      |
| white, loose fitting outfits. She also saw human adults that          |
| identified themselves as the "instructors". The children looked human |
| but with some alien traits, "almost like hybrids." The aliens told    |
| her that soon they would be leaving the Earth due to the coming chaos |
| and cataclysm. She saw an image of a huge explosion and many injured  |
| persons. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2001,  |

| 2004 - A young man, Andrey Alexandrovich Zabava, was spending time at |
| the seashore near Cape Plaka near Partenit, Crimea, Ukraine in the    |
| company of several tourists from Russia and Poland. Their main reason |
| for being there was to hunt for UFOs, because they believed there was |
| an underground alien base hidden inside Ayu-Dug (Bear) Mountain, just |
| to the west of Partenit. Their first six nights were uneventful, but  |
| on this night they saw several dim spots of yellow light that         |
| appeared one after the other on the northeastern slope of the         |
| mountain where there are no known buildings. The lights were          |
| positioned in a triangle. At about 01:00 a.m. a strange object        |
| appeared from the west slowly floating above the Black Sea. The       |
| object made a slow right turn, drifting in total silence, and slowly  |
| descended towards Ayu-Dug. When the object got closer Andrey could    |
| discern an elongated rhomboid form, clearly outlined by rows of       |
| lights. There were four bright emerald green lights positioned at the |
| four corners of the craft, and numerous red lights were running along |
| its edges, constantly blinking in a clockwise direction. Bright       |
| yellow-green lights were located at the center of the bottom of the   |
| craft, while four blue lights were positioned around it in a cross    |
| shape. This magnificent craft also had several dimly lit yellowish    |
| windows along its top section. When the craft was at its closest, a   |
| stream of hot air could be felt emanating from it. When the UFO       |
| passed along the seashore, Andrey noticed that all electric lights    |
| along the seashore blinked out simultaneously as if from a power      |
| interruption. Finally, the craft approached Ayu-Dug at a low altitude |
| and seemed to dissolve into thin air, but immediately following       |
| this a bright beam of light appeared from the seashore and began      |
| searching the sky and scanning the water. Apparently some             |
| border guards had become alerted to the presence of the strange       |
| craft. Andrey also noticed that his friend Vitya's wristwatch had     |
| stopped when the craft passed directly overhead.                      |
|                                                                       |
| At around 3:00 a.m. bright yellow flashes of light appeared at the    |
| top of the mountain, resembling fireworks. Over the next 15 minutes a |
| total of eight clusters of objects zoomed out of the mountain, and    |
| flew off towards the southwest and eastwards towards Novorossiysk. At |
| 5:00 a.m. Andrey and Vitya had begun their descent of Cape Plaka,     |
| when they heard a voice yelling at them from behind. "Sons!" it said  |
| in Russian. They stopped and turned around. A figure resembling an    |
| elderly woman stood on a rock. Her face could not be seen because it  |
| was still dark and she was not facing them. The height of the         |
| strange woman was about 1.5 meters and she was dressed in a long gray |
| loose fitting garment that completely covered her legs and a hood     |
| that covered her head. In a soft female voice in pure Russian, she    |
| said, "Sons! Don't tell anybody down there about what you have seen,  |
| they will not understand." The somewhat stunned young men did not     |
| began a conversation with her and did not pay much attention to her.  |
| Several seconds later Andrey turned around again and the woman had    |
| vanished. There was only a sharp rock outcrop and seemingly no place  |
| for her to hide. Increasingly agitated, the witnesses searched for    |
| the "nun" but could not find anyone.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| They continued their descent from the rock, when Vitya screamed and   |
| pointed to the shoreline near one of the Partenit piers. There they   |
| saw another humanoid entity, very tall, about two or even three       |
| meters in height, and dressed in a tight-fitting, dark blue diver     |
| suit, which completely covered its body. It had on a helmet which was |
| attached directly to the suit. A yellow rectangular "window" was      |
| positioned over the face area, but no facial features were visible.   |
| The entity was standing in the water up to its waist, and looking at  |
| the embankment and houses on the shore. Unexpectedly, after several   |
| seconds of observation the alien figure simply dissolved into thin    |
| air. The stunned witnesses finished their descent to the hamlet in a  |
| very shaken state. On the pier they spoke to an old sea captain named |
| "Jora", who reported experiencing recent problems with his electronic |
| equipment onboard his cutter on several occasions. (Source: Albert S. |
