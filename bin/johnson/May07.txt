| 1948 - At 3:45 p.m. several witnesses including Kaiser and Bray in    |
| Memphis, Tennessee saw 50 or more lights make sharp turns in the sky  |
| for three hours. They flew from east to west. Not meteors, according  |
| to astronomer. (Sources: Memphis Commercial Advertiser, May 8, 1948;  |

| 1950 - A couple and their grandson were returning from a picnic at    |
| 6:45 p.m. when they saw a silvery white object at treetop level. They |
| were about nine miles south of Ely, Nevada at the time. It hovered    |
| for ten minutes, then oscillated "as if attempting to rise" and       |
| suddenly flew out of sight at high speed. (Sources: Project Blue Book |

| 1952 - Five very clear photographs were taken on this day at 4:30     |
| p.m. in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They show a          |
| disc-shaped object with a double protuberance on top. Its estimated   |
| size was 300 feet in diameter. An apparent discrepancy with some      |
| shadows was explained by the Brazilian UFO investigator, Dr. Olavo T. |
| Fontes, as having been due to some broken leaves. The witnesses were  |
| named Keffel and Martins. The Brazilian Air Force conclusion on the   |
| photos is that the "object is several kilometers from the camera."    |

| 1963 - On this evening in Kirkby, Merseyside, England Margaret        |
| McCutcheon and her 13-year-old son reported to the police that, after |
| the lights blacked out in their home while watching television, they  |
| saw an object about six meters in diameter near the house. It had two |
| aerials and a red flashing light, and it was emitting a low buzzing   |
| sound. After a minute, it flew away. (Sources: Flying Saucer Review,  |

| 1965 - At 7:30 p.m. a light seen by a witness named Marshall over     |
| Oxford, Michigan split into two parts, one of which was copper        |
| colored. Then two more lights joined up with the first two. One of    |
| the objects may have been tumbling. A Project Blue Book "unknown."    |

| 1966 - A short, cylindrical object with pointed ends was sighted over |
| Goodfellow Air Force Base, Texas at 9:55 p.m. by Airman 3rd class W.  |
| L. Whitehead. It had a yellow light at one end, a blue light at the   |
| other, and flew straight and level for 35 seconds. A Project Blue     |

| 1967 - A domed disc-shaped object hovered at 200 feet altitude over a |
| cemetery in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada at around 2:00 a.m. It was seen |
| by five teenagers, including a 14-year-old named Ricky Banyard and    |
| another named Glenn Coates. A muffled whistling sound was heard       |
| coming from the object, and the object directed a vertical light beam |
| to the ground. They looked at it through binoculars. A series of      |
| bangs and a "screaming" noise like a jet were heard when the object   |
| took off. Charring of stones and other physical traces were found at  |
| the site. (Sources: Edmonton Journal, May 8, 1967; APRO Bulletin,     |

| 1967 - Later that evening a nocturnal light followed a car with the   |
| Luck family of three through the rural countryside of Arnett,         |
| Oklahoma back home. It then shot off to the west at high speed. It    |
| looked solid in appearance, according to the witnesses. (Sources:     |

| Zealand watched a metallic looking, oval-shaped object hover in the   |
| sky near the sun for ten minutes starting at 2:03 p.m. The center of  |
| the object had a "transparent-like sheen" and it was the apparent     |
| size of a basketball held at arm's length. It moved away to the       |
| northeast. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, May-June 1970, p. 1; Mrs. K.      |

| 1974 - At 6:15 a.m. a yellowish-orange ball of light, one meter in    |
| diameter, landed on two legs between two highway tunnels on Highway   |
| N518 near Petits Goulets, Drome department, France and was seen by a  |
| single male witness named Tardy, who was driving nearby when the      |
| incident occurred. The landing spot was on a geologic faultline.      |

| 1974 - Mrs. Margaret K. Roffe, a nurse's aide at the local Veterans   |
| Administration Hospital in Coatesville, Pennsylvania was walking from |
| one hospital building to another at around 9 p.m. when she heard a    |
| swishing sound and saw a disc-shaped object descend and land on the   |
| roof of Building #1. Four silver-colored legs emerged from the object |
| just before the object landed, and a ramp came down out of the bottom |
| of the craft. Three gray-skinned humanoid occupants emerged from the  |
| craft by climbing down the ramp backwards. They were all less than    |
| five feet tall and had long, large bald heads and arms with clawed    |
| hands; their legs were short. They spoke an unintelligible language   |
| among themselves in high, squeaky voices. She was able to see their   |
| features well because the area was well lit by an illuminated dome on |
| the roof of the building. When the beings noticed her they re-entered |
| the object. The object then took off slowly, making a swishing sound, |
| and passed over some nearby trees, which were shaken violently when   |
| the craft flew over. The legs withdrew into the object as it took     |
| off. (Sources: Ted Bloecher, 1975 MUFON Symposium Proceedings, p. 56; |

| 1975 - At 9:00 p.m. four witnesses--two couples--in a car followed a  |
| dark ovoid flying object in the mountains west of Tucson, Arizona;    |
| the UFO follows the car back, making a humming sound. (Sources: APRO  |

| 1977 - A powerful spotlight from a silent, delta-shaped object lit    |
| the forest in Undersaker, Jamtland, Sweden on this night. A very      |
| large second object, also triangle shaped and with three large        |
| windows rose in the beam of light. Both objects hovered over the      |
| trees, then changed shape from triangular to rectangular. (Sources:   |

| 1980 - At 5:20 p.m. an object described as an "upside down soup bowl" |
| with a dome on top came out of cloud cover directly ahead of the      |
| witness's car driving on I-40 near Valdese, North Carolina. It was    |
| estimated to be 40 feet in diameter and had a red rectangular area on |
| the bottom. It made a U-turn, then banked away. The car's radio       |
| experienced interference during the close encounter. (Sources: MUFON  |

| 1980 - At 9:05 p.m. a woman with the last name of Riley was driving   |
| her car in Redding, California accompanied by her two teenage         |
| daughters (15 and 14 years old) and by another 13-year-old girl, when |
| they were frightened by the sudden appearance of a patch of smoke or  |
| fog that suddenly enveloped their van. All normal noises ceased,      |
| while the women seemed to "float" inside a "cloud". Very worried, as  |
| soon as they were able to leave the "cloud" they drove to a friend's  |
| house, where they discovered that they could not account for 30       |
| minutes of time. During the hours that followed they suffered from    |
| various physiological reactions and the following day, marks          |
| resembling strange punctures appeared on the skin of two of the       |
| girls. Soon afterwards they experienced strange dreams in which "men" |
| were pointing strange weapons or objects at their heads. The          |
| witnesses reported the strange event to the police who advised them   |
| to contact a private UFO organization. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,      |

| 1988 - At 10:30 p.m. a blue sphere was seen at 600 meters altitude    |
| over the city of Sakharnaya, in Vladivostok, Russian Far East; it was |
| completely silent. Sections of it pulsed light. (Sources: Larry       |

| 1989 - A South African Mirage FIIG AF allegedly jet shot down a UFO   |
| that flew in from the ocean over the Kalahari Desert, 80 miles north  |
| of the South African border in Botswana. It had been tracked by radar |
| by the Frigate SA Trafalberg, and the Naval headquarters in Cape      |
| Town. They retrieved a silver disc-shaped craft, and two Grey aliens  |
| were captured alive. They had three fingers/toes on each limb, and no |
| sex organs. The object was reported to have been lens-shaped, 18      |
| meters in diameter with three landing gear. There were three aliens   |
| onboard; two alive but one died soon afterwards. The alive alien was  |
| eventually moved to the S-4 facility. NORAD apparently tracked the    |
| object as it fell to earth. An experimental SDI weapon was reportedly |
| used to expedite the downing of the craft, which apparently had       |
| already experienced some technical problems. South African and        |
| American military personnel crossed the Botswana border without       |
| permission in order to retrieve the craft. The bodies and materials   |
| were transported to the US in a C-5A cargo plane from South Africa.   |

| 1995 - At 2:30 a.m. a lady driving near Beaverton, Oregon reported    |
| seeing a "pink sky", and then a triangular-shaped UFO hovering over a |
| field behind her house. The craft was gray, with lights in the        |
| corners and a tile-like surface on the exterior. Two of the lights    |
| were orange and the third was an orange-red color. A beam of light    |
| that followed the contour of the craft connected all three lights.    |
| Later on, many more trangular craft were seen over the same field.    |
| Large white, box-shaped objects and "people" were observed on the     |
| ground and appeared to be working in the field. (Source: Albert S.    |

| 1995 - That same night near Glasgow, Scotland Igor Terzic was driving |
| his vehicle when a UFO began hovering over it. He next recalls        |
| finding himself parked in the middle of the road, where a truck       |
| almost hit him. Later under hypnosis he recalled being abducted and   |
| taken inside the object. There he saw two kinds of humanoids of both  |
| genders. One type of tall with (upside down) pear-shaped heads, huge  |
| eyes, and no discernable mouths. The others were similar but shorter  |
| and smaller. He heard a voice in his head tell him he was going to be |
| alright. He thinks he was experimented upon, but the only thing he    |
| recalled was drilling a hole in his head at one point. (Source:       |
