| 1950 - An oval-shaped, aluminum colored object hung in sky at 40,000  |
| feet altitude over Indian School Road southeast of Phoenix, Arizona   |
| at 6:00 p.m. It was estimated to be 200 feet in diameter, tapering to |
| narrower proportions in the rear. It moved silently through the sky   |
| with a red fiery trail one hundred feet long, but left no vapor       |
| trail. It was gone from sight in 4 to 5 seconds. (Source: Loren E.    |

| 1961 - F. Reynolds and his son were camping near the water in Bowna,  |
| New South Wales, Australia. They observed an object on the ground     |
| with four windows in it. There was a fire nearby, and four figures    |
| could be seen between it and the object. At 9:30 p.m. it had          |
| disappeared. Witnesses in Wodonga, West Albury, Wangaratta and        |
| Tallangatta independently observed an unknown object in flight that   |
| same evening. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century |

| 1967 - At 12:20 a.m. a glowing orange-red hemisphere with the flat    |
| side down was seen in a rural area of Phillipston, Massachusetts by a |
| single witness. It was ten times the apparent diameter of the moon.   |

| 1967 - Two men were driving in a remote part of Piggott, Arkansas     |
| when their truck's engine failed. Before they could get out of the    |
| vehicle to investigate they saw a 50-foot wide saucer shaped object   |
| descend to the ground in front of them. Two bizarre looking "aliens"  |
| emerged from the object and walked over to their truck. The humanoids |
| were described as of average human height, but with large heads that  |
| were flat in the back, and gray in color. They had normal eyes,       |
| noses, and mouths. They also wore tight-fitting gray diver's suits.   |
| The men felt like they were being bombarded with vibrations and had   |
| the uncanny feeling that the aliens knew what they were thinking.     |
| Rolling down the truck windows, the men spoke to one of the aliens,   |
| who reportedly told them that they meant them no harm and they could  |
| continue on their journey if they promised to keep this meeting a     |
| secret. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1967,   |

| 1968 - At nine o'clock in the evening a dark oval shaped object with  |
| a searchlight in the front, wobbled and moved with motion of a boat   |
| moving over waves in the ocean. It passed over the local electric     |
| power substation in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and flew off following    |
| the power lines. (Sources: Walter N. Webb, case investigation files;  |

| 1969 - A silver domed disc-shaped object with a beam of light was     |
| seen on the road ahead as a married woman drove between Glenwood and  |
| Lancaster, Missouri at 10:30 a.m. Her car slowed down from 50 miles   |
| per hour to just 8 mph when the beam touched it. Her dog reacted with |
| fear, and her eyes hurt for three days after the incident. (Sources:  |

| 1969 - That same night a domed disc passed over a police car five     |
| miles west of Westhope, North Dakota at 10:10 p.m. It then hovered    |
| over the road, wobbling as it hovered, and shot a beam of light       |
| downward onto the road. The object eventually slid sideways, then     |
| lifted off vertically into the sky. The police officer, Mr. Janzen,   |
| reportedly felt strange "psychological forces" and suffered           |
| physiological effects as a result of his encounter. (Sources: NICAP   |

| 1972 - In Decatur County, Indiana west-northwest of Milhausen a farm  |
| couple reported seeing a huge delta-shaped UFO at 4:10 a.m. A heavy,  |
| reddish-orange stone was found on the ground that later vanished.     |
| According to APRO field investigator Donald Worley, the woman         |
| suffered chest pains at the time of the UFO encounter, and there was  |
| some unusual interference with the investigation by a mystery person. |

| 1972 - In Aubigny, Eure district, France a 63-year-old fireman        |
| spotted a disc or oval-shaped object with tripod landing gear descend |
| from the sky, then land 200 meters away. It had a red ball of light   |
| on top of it and two portholes. The lights on the object blinked out  |
| after 40 seconds. Mr. Lauretz reported that his car engine sputtered  |
| and lost power when he attempted to leave the scene by driving away.  |
| This effect lasted for the first 200 meters. (Sources: Phenomenes     |

| 1977 - Indianapolis, Indiana - A 13-year-old boy with the last name of |
| Brandenburg took three photographs of a dark disc-shaped object with  |
| a transparent dome near his home shortly before four o'clock in the   |
| afternoon, while the UFO was circling the area. The photographs       |

| 1978 - At 10:10 p.m. a round object with glowing blue and red lights  |
| was seen by several witnesses in Sylva, North Carolina. It made a     |
| humming sound, gave off beeps and flew in circles at a low altitude.  |
| It finally flew off at high speed after three minutes. (Source: Sylva |

| 1983 - At 9:30 p.m. a bright light near the southeastern horizon      |
| approached a car with Mr. & Mrs. Waldemar aboard just north of        |
| Naylor, Missouri. As the elongated object approached they could see a |
| cluster of red, green, and orange lights on the craft, which they     |
| estimated to be 150 feet long from front to back. The UFO turned and  |
| flew away. (Source: UFO Newsclipping Service, May 1983, p. 1, citing  |

| Sheffield, England saw a large pulsating orange ovoid UFO fly by at   |
| 400 feet altitude (Source: Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1990, p. 25). |

| 1991 - A 22-year-old man in Citrus Heights, California observed a     |
| light gray triangular object flying at 2000-3000 feet altitude at     |
| 10:30 p.m. The object was estimated to be 200 feet in diameter, had   |
| rounded corners, and flew silently at a speed of between 100 and 150  |
| mph. It flew on a straight course, going directly overhead and        |
| finally passed beyond some trees. He could see the lightless object   |
| due to its reflection of lights from the ground. (Sources: MUFON      |

| 1995 - In Cass County, Missouri a number of 25 foot in diameter       |
| bowl-shaped metallic discs lifted off from the ground in a farmer's   |
| field at 6:15 a.m. They wree only 100 feet away from the witness when |
| they took off. (Source: Francis L. Ridge, UFO Intelligence            |

| 1997 - After dropping off his girlfriend at her home in the city of   |
| Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia Juan Sudarsky was walking home alone at  |
| around 3:00 a.m. when he suddenly felt very cold. He next saw a       |
| purple light drop from the sky, and at the same time he heard a       |
| high-pitched screeching sound and he felt dizzy. He fell to his       |
| knees, sweating profusely despite the sensation of cold. An orange    |
| beam of light then appeared beside him. Several odd looking,          |
| medium-sized creatures then emerged from the beam. They appeared to   |
| have only one eye and each had a large antenna that radiated an odd   |
| blue light. They had a strange orifice where their mouths should have |
| been. The creatures emitted intermittent screeches of varying         |
| frequencies. Juan could apparently understand them, because he was    |
| receiving mental messages. The beings then formed a circle around     |
| Sudarsky, and one of them approached and touched his forehead. He     |
| then got a mental message in perfect Spanish, telling him to guard    |
| the planet against pollution, because their own world was almost      |
| totally ruined, and now there were only 50 of them left. Soon after   |
| this they flew back into the purple light via the orange beam of      |
| light. Before leaving, the leader showed Sudarsky a strange           |
| communication device. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |

| 1999 - A woman in Belper, Derbyshire, England saw a bright orange     |
| light in the sky from her home at 10:45 p.m. and got her binoculars.  |
| Looking through the binoculars she could tell the UFO was "a perfect  |
| black triangle" with a row of red lights on one side. It was also     |
| completely silent. Fifteen minutes later a motorist driving down a    |
| highway in Duffield, England saw a bright light in sky and pulled     |
| into a bus stop for better view. He reported seeing a "flat,          |
| triangular, black shape with equal sides, flying with the point       |
| first." (Source: Curt Sutherly, UFO Mysteries: A Reporter Seeks the   |
