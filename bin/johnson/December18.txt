| 1933 -  At ten o'clock in the morning hundreds of witnesses in        |
| Onkerzeele, Belgium watched a Fatima like solar apparition, with      |
| sparks and flames from a dancing "Sun". (Source: Larry Hatch, U       |

| 1950 - At 8:39 a.m. a circular light changed shape and brilliance as  |
| it hovered over Oak Ridge AEC Laboratories, Tennessee. It faded to a  |
| star, then flew away to the northwest. There was radar confirmation   |
| of the sighting from the nearby McGhee Air Force Base. (Source: Bruce |

| 1954 - At 3:45 a.m. several hundred people, including sentries        |
| guarding the Catete Palace in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil witnessed        |
| a yellow glowing ovoid object that slowed from a high speed and       |
| stopped in just three seconds, and then hovered for 20 minutes. It    |
| illuminated the surface of the water in Guanabara Bay, and finally    |
| climbed up at an oblique angle, and was gone in 4-5 seconds. Two      |
| small jets of exhaust were seen flowing from the lower part of the    |
| object while it was accelerating. (Source: UNICAT, case 557, citing   |

| 1966 - At 4:40 p.m. a 23-year-old man at the eastern shore of Lake    |
| Tiorati in Bear Mountain State Park, Orange County, New York looked   |
| up and saw a silver-brown domed disc-shaped object in the western sky |
| at 45° elevation, heading northeast. It was wobbling and noiseless.   |
| He was able to take a photograph of the object before it disappeared  |
| over and behind a fire tower on a 1,320 foot hill about half a mile   |
| away. (Sources: NICAP case investigation files; J. Allen Hynek, The   |

| 1968 – A man and woman in their late twenties were driving together   |
| in a car five miles north of Wairakei, New Zealand at around 11:45    |
| p.m. when they drove by a tall being around six feet tall. The man    |
| wore a shiny dark blue or black loose fitting one-piece suit that was |
| tucked in at the boots. The being also wore gloves, a belt, and a     |
| cylindrical helmet with a clear visor. (Source: Anthony J. Brunt,     |

| 1975 – At 7:45 a.m. a "dah-dit" noise accompanied the slow ascent of  |
| an eight-meter wide, gray domed disc over a residential area of Ancy, |
| France. The object had square shaped windows. It flew away toward the |
| southeast. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, May 1976).                 |

| A aircraft flying near Maelifelli, Iceland on this day in 1976 picked |
| up a clear radar image of a UFO at a distance of 100 miles and flying |
| at 18,000 feet altitude. They tracked the UFO for one minute as it    |
| rushed below and passed their plane at a speed of 3,600 miles per     |
| hour. (Source: International UFO Reporter, March 1977, p. 2).         |

| 1976 – At 12:55 a.m. on Soda Springs Mountain Road in Caribou County, |
| Idaho three police officers had a close encounter with a 30-foot      |
| diameter oval-shaped UFO. The object was devoid of seams or windows,  |
| and had the bulk of three to four cars. It emitted a light green      |
| light and hovered only 60 feet away from them. It made no sound when  |
| hovering, but made a whistling "wind" sound when in motion. (Sources: |

| 1976 – Twenty-two hours later at 10:30 p.m. six witnesses, twenty     |
| miles south of Miami, Florida watched an oval glow with a disc-shaped |
| object inside fly to the south, passing over their heads at only 150  |
| feet. The object turned and flew away to the west. (Sources: J. Allen |

| 1977 – In Guadalajara, Spain a 34-year-old man, Mr. Miguel Herrero    |
| Sierra was driving his pickup truck down a road at a few minutes past |
| midnight when the vehicle’s lights, engine, and radio suddenly died.  |
| He pulled to the side of the road but couldn't find anything wrong    |
| with the car. He decided to wait in the truck for help. A man dressed |
| in a diver’s suit approached and told him through telepathy to come   |
| aboard a hat-shaped UFO, under which there was a cylindrical chamber  |
| that extended to the ground. Inside the object was a 14-meter wide    |
| circular room with smooth walls. Mr. Herrero stayed inside for        |
| approximately three hours, communicating telepathically with the      |
| occupants of the craft. He was released later, and discovered that he |
| had a small puncture wound on his arm, as if they had taken a blood   |
| sample from him although he did not recall them doing so. (Source:    |

| 1977 – On the same night, at four o’clock in the morning Central      |
| Standard Time, three 16-year-old girls saw a frightening monster      |
| while driving 15 miles north of Zoto del Marina, Mexico. (Source:     |

| 1980 – Several witnesses on a farm in Colesburg, Eastern Cape, South  |
| Africa watched an odd glowing cloud-like object with a hazy funnel of |
| light that reached downward to the ground for five minutes on an      |
| otherwise clear night. (Source: Cynthia Hind, MUFON UFO Journal, May  |

| 1988 - At 2:45 a.m. four gendarmes in Le Vigan, Gard, France          |

| 2001 - Two gray plumes of smoke were first seen in the sky over       |
| Stockport Railway Station in Stockport, Greater Manchester, England.  |
| A gray triangular object was then witnessed in the sky. Later that    |
| evening, at 8:00 p.m., a circular red light was seen high up in the   |
| sky moving quickly. It slowed down, accelerated, and then wobbled     |
| from side to side. At 8:50 in Crawley, West Sussex, England an object |
| looking like a rounded triangle was sighted. It was longer at one     |
| point, with a giant light in the center. (Source: British Ministry of |

| 2004 - Several strange lights were seen from Cau-Cau, Horcon, Chile   |
| starting at 8:30 p.m., engaging in complex maneuvers. A dot was first |
| seen, then a vertical line that turned to the left. Contrails left in |
| the wake of the objects and their irregular, sudden                   |
| maneuvers suggested they were not conventional aircraft. Photographs  |
| were reportedly taken. (Source: Scott Corrales, ufoinfo.com, report   |

| 2005 - At 11:00 p.m. a farmer in Knox, Indiana had a close encounter  |
| with a saucer-shaped craft hovering over his nearby field. It was     |

| sound. After hovering for three minutes it flew off to the west.      |
