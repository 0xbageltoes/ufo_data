| by two men aboard a Carco Air Service cargo plane flying south of     |
| Kirtland AFB at 1:20 p.m. The craft initially moved slowly and        |
| silently to the south, but picked up speed instantly speed and        |

| the second continued on in a south-southeasterly direction. They made |
| no detectable sound. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience: A  |

| trail. It also changed to a reddish yellow color as it gathered       |
| speed. (Sources: Sylvia Sutton, Flying Saucer Review, March-April     |

| 1971 - At 9 p.m. a 23-year-old man stood on his porch in Bellingham,  |
| Massachusetts and watched a bright yellow-orange light approach from  |
| the distance, leaving a gray contrail. The object then zig-zagged,    |
| descended, slowed, and passed by silently at an estimated altitude of |
| 200 feet before flying out of sight. (Source: Morton Schafer, MUFON   |

| made no discernable sound. The UFO was also reported by a resident of |
| nearby Cook's Corner near the Brunswick Naval Air Station. (Source:   |

| tree. During the incident, which lasted 55 minutes, their dogs were   |
| strangely quiet. (Sources: Columbia (Missouri) Tribune, June 28,      |

| 1977 - On this night a man with a flat tire was stopped on the        |
| highway between Abadan and Ahvaz, Iran when he suddenly felt heat     |
| from a "huge, bright object" that was very close to him. Mr. Shojacei |
| reported that the UFO changed color from red to green to purple, then |
| its lights went off. For 45 minutes the lights stayed nearby,         |
| surrounded by fog. When he turned off his car headlights, the UFO     |
| would extinguish its lights. (Source: Allan Hendry, International UFO |
| Reporter, January 1981, p. 15).                                       |

| 1981 - Kennebunk, Maine - Carol Palmero was sitting in her backyard at |
| about 2 p.m. when she saw a UFO pass overhead. The object was shaped  |
| somewhat like a football with rounded ends, made no noise and flew at |
| a steady rate of speed from northeast to west. The following day      |
| (June 29), at about 9 p.m., Fire Chief Ramon Nolette was standing in  |
| front of the dispatch station when he saw a green and white light go  |
| 1,000 to 1,500 feet into the air. Twenty minutes later he saw another |
| one. After Nolette called the Coast Guard he received calls from more |
| than fifteen people asking what the lights over the water were. Other |
| calls to the Coast Guard came from Portland, Cape Elizabeth, Wells,   |
| Ogunquit and Old Orchard Beach. A boat was sent out at 9:20 p.m. to   |
| look for the source, but the lights were not seen again. (Source: Joe         |

| interference at the time. (Source: UFO Newsclipping Service,          |
