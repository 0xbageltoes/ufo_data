| 1967 - Mr. F. Bedel, age 23, was driving on Route 135 about 8         |
| kilometers north of Freetown, Indiana on this night when he saw a     |
| plate-shaped object with red, yellow, blue and white blinking lights. |
| He lost control of his car and ran off the road. Less than two        |
| kilometers away and at about the same time, Phil Patton saw an        |
| identical object that came within 30 meters of his car. (Source:      |

| 810).                                                                 |

| 1967 - A woman walking home in Romieres, France at 6:45 p.m. saw a    |
| beam of light, about one meter in width, sweep across the ground in   |
| her direction. It came from a circular, white object that turned off  |
| its main light. She then saw reddish spots before it vanished         |
| entirely. Another witness saw the phenomenon from a separate          |
| location, two kilometers away. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to   |
| Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 811).                            |

| 1968 - Linda, a young woman, was on her way to Junior Achievement    |
| class in Ipswich, Massachusetts at around 6:30 p.m. when suddenly     |
| some bright lights in the sky attracted her attention. She looked up  |
| and saw a cigar-shaped object hovering overhead with bright flashing  |
| lights. She watched as it came down several hundred feet from her and |
| stopped about 150 feet from the ground. The UFO made no noise and had |
| a solid row of red and green lights going on and off in sequence      |
| along its midsection. It also had five steady bright white lights     |
| spaced evenly along the top section. Linda walked closer just before  |
| the UFO rose upm to a higher altitude, levelled off, and then moved   |
| away into the distance. She saw a tall man in a dark coat and a dark  |
| brimmed hat, who had been standing closer to the object. When she     |
| called out to him he turned and ran down the darkened street.         |

| 1995 - The witness was driving in her car at the corner of Congress   |
| and Gateway in Boynton Beach, Florida at 5:10 a.m. when she saw a     |
| seven foot tall brownish being with long stringy arms and legs on the |
| side of the road. It also had an elongated head and dark eyes. At the |
| same time a transparent craft, shaped like a multi-sided crystal,     |
| with two other beings inside, "tumbled" across the road about 60 feet |
| in front of her car. The witness slammed on her brakes and when she   |
| turned to look again both the object and the humanoid were gone.      |

| 2000 - At 4:30 a.m. in Columbia, Kentucky the witness awoke with a    |
| start and noticed a very bright light coming through the window. It   |
| was most white but also red and green, and it hurt his eyes. He also  |
| heard a loud pulsating sound. Looking toward the window he saw the    |
| outline of a figure, the size of a little boy, but it was gone in an  |
| instant. The terrified witness covered his head with his blanket and  |
| began to pray. After ten minutes the sound and the lights went away.  |
| Others in the area had seen low flying objects over their farms       |
| around the same time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |
