| sphere encircled in the middle with windows. The UFO came to within   |
| 150 feet distance, and an estimated altitude of only 65 feet from the |
| ground. Inside she could see a human-appearing pilot or occupant who  |
| wore a silver flight suit. A second figure stood in front of an       |
| instrument panel. At the time, the witness believed she saw an        |
| experimental aircraft of the U.S. Air Force. (Source: David F. Webb   |

| sighting an oval-shaped or disc-shaped UFO with red, green, and       |
| yellow lights around its bottom rim, and with a pulsating red light,  |
| at one minute past midnight. The UFO flew on a level flight path from |
| east to west over Benton Harbor. After several minutes a second UFO   |
| joined it. Both objects hovered for 30 seconds and then vanished. A   |
| hissing sound was reported. This is a Project Blue Book               |
| "unidentified" case. The entire duration of the sighting was          |
| estimated to be more than 40 minutes. (Sources: U.S. Air Force        |

| 1967 - Police officer Courson of Galesburg, Illinois witnessed a      |
| domed disc while driving in farm country between Galesburg and Moline |
| at 4:25 a.m. The UFO had a pulsating red rim and a bottom that        |
| rotated rapidly. The UFO approached the witness, then passed overhead |
| at a low altitude. Like the Benton Harbor, Michigan UFO of the same   |
| night, this object also made a hissing sound. This is also a Project  |
| Blue Book "unidentified" case. (Source: U.S. Air Force Project Blue   |

| 1967 - At 8:15 p.m. in Olpe, Kansas nine witnesses spotted a          |
| cone-shaped, blue-green light that was estimated to be 15 feet in     |
| height. The UFO emitted a reddish-orange light as it went over the    |
| house. They decided to follow the low flying UFO in a car. The UFO    |
| was observed to hover for awhile. It then shot up vertically, and     |
| descended slowly. It was described as a lighted interior. The         |
| sighting lasted ten minutes. (Source: NICAP investigation files,      |

| 1969 - At 11:00 a.m. a woman in Glenwood, Missouri noticed her dog    |
| acting strangely and attempting to hide under the seat in her car.    |
| Next, the hair stood up on her arms. She then saw a bluish-white beam |
| of light ahead on the road. Her car slowed from a speed of 50-60 mph  |
| down to 10 mph when it entered the beam. Looking up, she saw a        |
| disc-shaped object hovering 1000 feet overhead. The car didn't        |
| respond to the accelerator until after it had left the beam. The      |
| woman's eyes bothered her for three days following the incident.      |

| 1969 - Sr. Dominguez was driving his truck down a road in Campamento  |
| Manantres in the State of Magallanes, Chile at 9:45 p.m. when his     |
| headlights dimmed. He noticed a four-meter wide disc hovering six     |
| meters away. A door on the craft opened and some beings floated out.  |
| The beings were presumably humanoid but were not described            |
| sufficiently to classify into any group. There were ground traces     |
| left at the site. (Sources: Ted R. Phillips, Physical Effects         |

| 1975 - At two a.m. near Melbourne, Victoria, Australia a man and his  |
| cousin watched a bright orange hexagonal shaped craft hovering close  |
| to the ground and about a kilometer away. They felt a strange         |
| vibration coming from it and perceived an audible sound. The craft    |
| then took off vertically at high speed. The main witness reported     |
| seeing two human-like figures flying around outside the craft, using  |
| what appeared to be backpacks. His parents felt the vibration and     |
| heard the humming sound but didn't see the UFO. (Source: Peter        |

| 1975 - Around midnight Suzanne, a married woman, woke up              |
| in Chantilly, France with the feeling that an intruder was in her     |
| house. She next heard the sound of dishes breaking. She and her       |
| husband went to the kitchen investigate, but found nothing. Her       |
| husband went back to sleep, but she remained awake. After awhile she  |
| saw a light in the corridor and went back to check. There she         |
| confronts a beautiful tall humanoid being with wavy blond hair,       |
| wearing a long yellow outfit. The figure seemed to float just above   |
| the floor. They exchange glances. The being seemed surprised by her   |
| presence and immediately disappeared into the wall. The next day an   |
| unusual light came into the house. The witness reports that           |
| she experienced a period of "good fortune" after the incident.        |
| Previously, she reportedly saw odd beings on a train in 1959 and a    |
| luminous sphere in 1962. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |

| orange, domed disc-shaped UFO descend into the field near his         |
| factory's security gate in Sylmar, California. The UFO either landed  |
| or hovered close to the ground for five minutes, but no noticeable    |
| landing traces were found at the site. (Source: Ann Druffel, MUFON    |

| or domed disc descended and brightly illuminated the surrounding area |
| near a home in Oconee County, South Carolina. There were 14           |

| executed sharp turns during the 44 minutes it was visible. (Source:   |

| 1980 - A disc hovered over mine tailings in Warren, Arizona at around |
