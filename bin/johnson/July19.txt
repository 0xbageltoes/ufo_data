| wide windows around the rim. The object dropped several small red     |
| lights, then made a sharp turn and flew off to the west. (Source:     |

| minutes. Note: Ochs reported similar sightings on three following     |
| nights. An hour later, another witness named Sokol reported seeing a  |
| round red ball or wheel-like object with a central nucleus; around it |
| were revolving or orbiting lights or balls. They winked off.          |

| 1965 - There were several sightings for this date. In Samarai, Papua  |
| New Guinea a red glowing cylinder moved across the sky from left to   |
| right. It flew with an oscillating motion, and made a sound like a    |
| diesel engine. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon in Antofagasta, Chile a  |
| cone-shaped object flew over the city at high speed, with the pointed |
| end toward the rear, making loud explosive noises. At 5:30 p.m. in    |
| Vaucluse Beach, New South Wales, Australia a seven meter domed disc   |
| was seen resting on a sandy beach. When Mr. Crowe, the witness,       |
| approached to within 16 meters (53 feet) it rose with a rushing air   |
| noise like air being released from a balloon. There were ground marks |
| left in the sand, and a check of radioactivity showed it was higher   |
| than the normal background level. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs over |

| silver colored UFO flying over Watertown, Massachusetts at four       |
| o'clock in the morning. She was on the ground at the time of her      |
| sighting. The UFO changed colors through the entire light spectrum    |

| luminous circular object with four arm-like appendages hovering over  |
| Hingham, Massachusetts for 45 minutes. Each "arm" had three lights.   |

| 1967 - A young girl saw a saucer-shaped object hovering above a       |
| cornfield in Sao Benedito Do Sul, Pernambuco, Brazil. Inside the      |
| object she could see a humanoid entity of small stature, and a second |
| similar entity was observed outside. The second entity made gestures  |
| at the girl, who interpreted them to be an inquiry about the          |
| edibility of the corn. At some point a dog nearby began barking, and  |
| the second entity quickly boarded the vehicle, which ascended         |
| rapidly. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of  |

| 1977 - An abduction by aliens including a physical exam occurred      |
| around midnight on this night in the United States (location          |
| withheld). When the abductee awoke she found three pasty white short  |
| humanoids in her living room. They were 4.5 feet tall, hairless, and  |
| had watery, liquid appearing eyes. They took her onboard a UFO by     |
| levitating her with a light beam and conducted some type of physical  |
| exam after making her lie on a metallic, exam table. For the          |
| following ten days after her return the abductee felt ill and         |
| experienced vertigo. (Source: Thomas E. Bullard, UFO Abductions: The  |

| this night in Florida, Illinois, and Washington State. At 4:30 a.m.   |
| in Fort Lauderdale, Florida 50 silvery discs maneuvered in and out of |
| the clouds and flew off in various formations toward the west. In     |
| Metcalf, Illinois at 8:10 p.m. a shiny object turned bright white as  |
| it flew silently below the clouds. The objects shape was not possible |
| to determine. In Maple Valley, Washington two adults and a child      |
| watched a white star-like object move to-and-fro on a wiggly flight   |
| path, flying silently to the northeast. In Monroe, Washington a round |
| green object moved very fast from west to east at a high altitude. It |
| left a green trail in the sky. It was not a meteor, claimed the       |
| military witness. (Source: Bob Gribble, National UFO Reporting        |
