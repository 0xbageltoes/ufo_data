| 1957 – At 5:15 p.m. three U.S. military witnesses in Morocco, driving |
| in the desert between Tiflet and Monor, sighted an elongated aerial   |
| object. It ascended into the sky, descended, then made a second       |
| ascent. Large and distant, the object shot off toward the south. This |
| case is listed in the Project Blue Book files as case number 61 for   |
| the month of December, but is considered "explained" by the US Air    |
| Force as contrails. (Source: U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book files   |
| counted in official statistics).                                      |

| 1957 – Later that day in Svea, Minnesota at four o’clock in the       |
| afternoon, a ten-meter diameter red disc roared through the sky,      |
| flying at only six meters above the ground. It was seen by many       |
| witnesses at it lit up the ground, moved through some woods, and then |
| climbed into the sky, shooting away toward the west. (Source:         |
| newspaper clippings, December 12, 1957).                              |

| 1957 – At the same time in Bonanza, Oregon two people claimed to have |
| seen a luminous disc hovering over some hills at six kilometers       |
| altitude. It suddenly shot away toward the southwest at 800           |
| kilometers per hour. (Source: Loren E. Gross, The Fifth Horseman of   |

| 1957 – At 5:30 p.m. near Woodward, Oklahoma Mr. and Mrs. Martin were  |
| driving through some woods with their child and were nearing a hill   |
| when a domed, disc-shaped UFO flew nearby and temporarily took        |
| control of their car. The UFO was described as about 16 meters in     |
| diameter with portholes around the rim. The electrical system of      |
| their 1954 Dodge Coronet failed when the UFO approached. They felt a  |
| hot blast of air and heard a high pitched sound at the same time. The |
| car restarted by itself when the UFO flew away. (Sources: J. Allen    |

| 1957 – At nine o’clock in the evening the engine and headlights of    |
| two cars traveling between Coulee City and Soap Lake, Washington died |
| when a huge, fiery UFO flew overhead from north to south. Strangely,  |
| the dome lights came on inside both cars during the engine and        |
| headlight failures, even though they weren't turned on. The cars      |
| remained stalled until the object had passed out of sight. There were |
| eight witnesses. (Sources: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, p. 75;     |

| 1965 - In 1965 in Beckington, Wiltshire, England a phantom automobile,       |
| shaped like a Land Rover but without wheels, passed the witness’s     |
| car. It made a whining noise, then vanished. (Source: Larry Hatch, U  |

| 1966 - At 6:30 a.m. Charles Hern and his wife were walking their dog  |
| in Cheshire, Ohio when they noticed a red light on the opposite bank  |
| of Kyger Creek. Several short men could be seen moving about. Two     |
| other witnesses joined them, and then red and orange lights began     |
| flashing on and off. A beam of light seemed to be constantly directed |
| at the water. Finally the lights went out and a bright greenish light |
| came on. Then the craft shot up into the air and disappeared into the |
| sky. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, November-December 1966, p. 10; David F. |

| 1975 – In Tranmere, South Australia a mother and daughter heard a     |
| strange noise at 2:45 a.m. The next morning they discovered that      |
| something had apparently landed on and crushed some of their          |
| strawberry plants. They found two 0.9-meter diameter areas in which   |
| the plants were flattened and swirled in a counter-clockwise          |
| direction. (Source: Richard Hall, MUFON UFO Journal, September 1976,  |

| 1975 – At 5:30 p.m. in Palais-sur-Vienne, France a huge ball of light |
| was seen hovering by some high tension electrical power lines. The    |
| light vanished after several seconds. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, |

| 1975 – In a pasture in Cascade County near Simms, Montana nocturnal   |
| lights were seen to have landed near the carcass of a dead calf two   |
| nights in a row. On this, the second night, the calf’s carcass was    |
| later found mutilated. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Messengers of         |

| 1975 – On this night in the Siskiyou Mountains of California five     |
| young men witnessed a greenish cloud-shaped object slide over a cut   |
| in a mountain low over the tops of tree stumps in a clear cut area.   |
| Inside the greenish glow they could see the outline of a man.         |

| 1978 - In 1978 a seven-meter diameter domed disc hovered over a road in      |
| Portegrandi, Italy at 1:30 a.m. It had four windows on its side and   |
| emitted rays of light. At 2:45 a.m. on a road in Catanzaro, Italy     |
| three policemen saw a luminous domed object tilt over the roadway. It |
| shot away from them when they hit it with a spotlight. Later that     |
| evening at 11:30 p.m. two young men were walking along a mountainside |
| path in Milanere, Torino, Italy when they sighted a bluish white      |
| light among the trees. One of the men approached the pear-shaped      |
| light and he suddenly vanished. The bright light then took off into   |
| the sky. The other man went for help and a rescue party searched for  |
| the missing man. He was found unconscious, cold, and weak. He had     |
| been missing for thirty minutes. Light bothered his eyes, and a scar  |
| was found on his leg. All that he could remember was seeing three to  |
| four figures with large pumpkin shaped heads standing in front of the |
| light. He was paralyzed, and vaguely remembered odd lights and sounds |
| and the feeling of being touched. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit,    |
| issues 212, 214; Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978,   |
| case # 137, citing Paolo Fiorino, UFO Universe, October-November      |

| 1981 - In 1981 an enormous UFO shaped like an orange ball, and estimated to  |
| be 750 feet in length, made a number of turns in the sky south of     |
| Reserve, New Mexico at 7:30 p.m. and then executed a ninety-degree    |
| turn near Luna Mountain. The five witnesses said they saw a jet       |
| aircraft chase the UFO out of sight. (Source: International UFO       |
| Reporter, June 1982, p. 15).                                          |

| 1989 - At 4:30 a.m. a security guard name Arias was patrolling the    |
| Colonial Palms shopping mall in Miami, Florida just south of the city |
| when he encountered three very tall beings standing in the parking    |
| lot area. The humanoids were described as being at least seven feet,  |
| five inches tall, thin, with large heads and huge cat-like eyes. The  |
| guard ran to the closest payphone and dialed the emergency number. A  |
| police unit was dispatched but a search of the immediate vicinity     |
| failed to find anything. (Sources: Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1991, |

| 1989 - In 1989 a number of nocturnal lights were seen over the city of San   |
| Diego, California for about 30 minutes. One UFO buzzed a pickup       |
| truck. The witnesses said it had an octagon shape with a V-shape at   |
| the rear edge of the object. (Source: Timothy Good, The UFO Report    |
| 1991, p. 235).                                                        |

| 1999 – According to UFO Magazine published in England, a 15-meter by  |
| 6-meter crater was found near a dam in Guyra, New South Wales,        |
| Australia. Apparently a mysterious flying object struck the dam at a  |
| 45-degree angle and then skidded before sinking into the mud. The     |
| police in the area set up a one-mile wide exclusion zone. (Source:    |
| UFO Magazine (UK), May 2000, p. 70).                                  |

| 1999 – On this same day at 7:45 in the morning, an executive in       |
| Mexico City, Mexico videotaped an oval-shaped UFO with the telescopic |
| zoom lens of his video camera. The object reflected the morning       |
| sunlight, and after four minutes it emitted a bright beam of light    |
| from its center. The color of the light changed from yellow to red to |
| white. (Source: George A. Filer, MUFON UFO Journal, January 2000,     |
