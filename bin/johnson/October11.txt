| 1951 - In Minneapolis, Minnesota at 6:30 a.m. General Mills balloon   |
| researchers, including aeronautical engineer J. J. Kaliszewski and    |
| aerologist C. B. Moore, pilot Dick Reilly in the air, and Doug Smith  |
| on the ground sighted a UFO. The flight crew saw the first object, a  |
| brightly glowing UFO with a dark underside and a halo around it. The  |
| object arrived high and fast, then slowed and made slow climbing      |
| circles for about two minutes, and finally sped away to the east.     |
| Soon they saw a second UFO, confirmed by ground observers using a     |
| theodolite, which sped across the sky. The total time for the         |
| sighting of the first object was five minutes, and the second         |
| sighting lasted a few seconds. (Sources: Project Grudge Report #1,    |

| 1954 - Farmers in Doncourt-Village, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France were   |
| awakened by a whistling sound and saw a flat object land near the     |
| woods. It soon rose up vertically very fast, and flew away. The       |
| ground was found calcified. Soil samples were taken by the police for |
| analysis. (Sources: Figaro, October 13, 1954; Jacques Vallee,         |

| 1954 - Two men riding motorcycles near Acquigny, Eure, France saw a    |
| bell-shaped craft about 2.5 meters tall while it hovered just a meter |
| above the Evreux-Louviers railroad line. The lower part was ringlike, |
| and the object gave off reddish and greenish sparks. A burst of       |
| orange light was seen as it jumped about 10 meters high, then it      |
| remained motionless for about one hour. During this time a third      |
| witness joined the first two. The UFO ultimately brightened and flew  |
| away toward the east. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the   |

| headlights came on again and he was able to restart his               |
| truck. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight Line    |

| Corbigny when felt an "electric shock" at the same time their car     |
| headlights died. They then saw a craft in a pasture 50 meters away.   |
| It was cylindrical and fairly thick in shape. Three dwarf humanoids   |
| were standing close by. No light was seen, except a small, reddish    |
| point of light. Both witnesses were paralyzeduntil the craft left. A  |

| 1954 - At 7:30 p.m. three men driving near Taupignac,                 |
| Charente-Maritime, France got out of their car to observe an intense  |
| red sphere in the sky. Then they discovered a round disc-shaped       |
| machine with a dome, six meters in diameter, giving off a yellow-red  |
| light, only 200 meters away from them at 10 meters altitude. It was   |
| motionless and silent. It suddenly moved horizontally for a short     |
| distance and landed behind a woods. Two witnesses went closer and saw |
| four dwarfs, one meter tall, who seemed busy with the machine. The    |
| creatures rushed inside when the witnesses arrived within 15 m. The   |
| witnesses was blinded by a sudden burst of light blue, then orange,   |
| then red, and the object took off vertically at fantastic speed.      |

| stopped and maneuvered in midair, the larger one took on a deep red   |
| color, turned to an intense white light with a red aura, and both     |
| landed. Witnesses did not wait around to investigate further.         |

| 1969 - Two objects hovered just twelve feet above the ground in the   |
| pre-dawn sky in Baralaba, Queensland, Australia, each flashing red    |
| and yellow lights. Both objects then rose and were joined by a third  |
| larger UFO. This new object was turtle shaped, and had "surface       |
| craters" on it, and reflected light. It made a high frequency buzzing |
| sound like mosquitos. (Source: APRO Bulletin, September-October 1969, |

| 1971 - Itaperuna, Brazil - At three o'clock in the morning Paula       |
| Caetano Silveira awoke from sleep abruptly, as if by "a mental        |
| shock." From his bed he saw a light in the garden, so he went to his  |
| kitchen where he could get a better view. Through the window grating  |
| he saw the same object that had stopped him on September 22nd. It was |
| hovering a half meter from the ground only three meters from his      |
| house. Paulo Caetano saw several small figures beside the craft, who  |
| pointed a small box-like implement in his direction. The witness and  |
| the small figures remained eyeing each other, with no movement, for   |
| 10 minutes. At some point Paulo Caetano's head began to ache. The     |
| craft and its occupants left, but the witness was so upset he was     |
| unable to return to sleep. (Sources: Walter Buhler, UFO Encounters:   |

| States.  There are 27 reports in the UFOCAT database for this day,    |
| including ten reports of nocturnal lights and two close encounters    |
| from Ohio alone. |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - At dawn around fifty motorists pulled off the expressway in    |
| Montgomery County, Ohio to watch two plate-like objects flying        |
| around. The Ohio State Highway Patrol was dispatched to the scene.    |

| 1973 - In Connersville, Indiana at 4:40 p.m. a disc-shaped UFO with a |
| segmented compartment on the bottom hovered over trees near a house.  |
| It was silver colored with a dome, and had three green doors on the   |
| bottom. It shot off after several seconds. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,   |

| 1973 - Nearly three hours after the first close encounter report from |
| Connersville, Indiana 46 people watched an oval-shaped UFO with a     |
| pale yellow light on top, and a segmented compartment on the bottom,  |
| as it flew over a U.S. government test range and restricted air       |
| space. It took off, but was seen 30 minutes later to the              |
| northeast.(Sources: APRO Bulletin, May-June 1976, p. 1; Kevin D.      |

| 1973 - At 7:30 p.m. a domed disc-shaped object hovered low and        |
| maneuvered between some trees in Laurel, Indiana for three minutes.   |
| It made a sound like a swarm of bees. The object jiggled up and down  |
| and sideways, and looked like two saucers joined together with a      |
| cabin on top. The bottom of the craft was trisected, with a circle in |
| each of these sections. A truck driver blew his air horn and the      |
| craft took off over trees at a fantastic speed. (Sources: Donald      |

|                                                                       |
| 1973 - Two men, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker, were doing some    |
| evening fishing from an old pier in an abandoned shipyard on the      |
| Pascagoula River in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Shortly after nightfall, |
| at around 8:30 p.m., Charley Hickson, looking around to bait his      |
| hook, saw a domed, football-shaped object descend until it hovered    |
| just off the ground about 30 feet away from them. The craft had two   |
| windows and two blue lights, and made a buzzing sound. When the       |
| object landed an unseen door opened to reveal a brilliantly lit       |
| interior. Three beings came out and floated toward the witnesses.     |
| These beings were about five feet tall. Their skin was gray and rough |
| like elephant skin that made them look like mummies. No clothes were  |
| apparent. In the center of their faces was something about two inches |
| long that came out to a point and resembled a nose. They had a slit   |
| for a mouth, which never opened, if they had eyes they couldn't be    |
| seen because the area above the nose was too wrinkled. They had no    |
| neck and their ears were pointed and retractable. Their arms were     |
| unusually long, and their hands were like mittens with a thumb        |
| attached. Their legs never moved but stayed together like a pedestal. |
| Their feet were elephant-like.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| When two of the beings grabbed Hickson by his arms he felt a pain in  |
| his left shoulder. This immobilized him and allowed his captors to    |
| lift him and somehow float him over to the craft. The third being     |
| seized Parker, who immediately went limp. Once inside Hickson was     |
| nearly blinded by the light but was unable to close his eyelids. He   |
| saw no furniture, only a screen-like device on the wall. He hung      |
| suspended in the air at a 45-degree angle while an eyelike device     |
| appeared out of the wall in front of his face and circled around him. |
| The beings that held Hickson moved in a stiff, mechanical way but did |
| their work with speed and efficiency. One made a buzzing sound. The   |
| beings then disappeared for some time. When they returned, they       |
| grasped Hickson again and floated him through the opening, which had  |
| reappeared. They left him back at the place where they had found him. |
| His legs collapsed when he touched the ground. Parker stood by with a |
| terrified look on his face. Meanwhile, the buzzing sound and blue     |
| light resumed, and the craft rose straight up and disappeared almost  |
| instantly. Hickson "heard" a message in his mind that the beings were |
| peaceful. Hickson subsequently reported having three more close       |
| encounter incidents, one of which apparently involved the same        |
| beings. Two involved telepathic communication only and the transfer   |
| of information that has not been disclosed. (Sources: David F. Webb   |

| 1973 - On the same afternoon as the Hickson and Parker abduction in   |
| Pascagoula, Mississippi, a three-year-old boy told his mother that he |
| had been playing with "some old monster" in the backyard. He said the |
| monster was gray with wrinkled skin and pointed ears. This occurred   |
| in Tanner Williams, Alabama not far from Pascagoula. (Sources: David  |

| 1973 - At 10:30 p.m. the Cline family of Berea, Tennessee awoke to    |
| the sound of dogs barking. Looking out, they saw an object that rose  |
| from the ground above some trees. Something humanoid with an          |
| oversized head was next seen crossing the road. Landing gear imprints |
| were found at the site. (Sources: Pulaski (TN) Citizen, October 24,   |

| 1973 - At just before 11:00 p.m. a mass of lights approached Boulder, |
| Colorado from high overhead, flying at a steady speed. Strung out of  |
| the bottom were a series of lights divided into thirds. (Source: APRO |

| 1974 - A metallic domed disc-shaped object came to within a quarter   |
| of a mile of a pickup truck being driven by an astronomer in          |
| Cloudcroft, New Mexico at 4:10 p.m. The engine of the truck stalled   |
| but the tape deck continued operating. The saucer curved up into the  |
| sky over the next 8-10 seconds, after which the engine functioned     |
| normally again. (Source: Peter Sturrock, Report on a Survey of the    |

| 1974 - In Farmington, West Virginia a witness with binoculars watched |
| a dark object with four red lights around the rim at 8:30 p.m.,       |
| presumed to be disc shaped. The object moved slowly at treetop level, |
| and appeared to be searching the woods. (Source: Bob Teets, West      |

| 1983 - An egg-shaped UFO with a one blunt end and one round end and   |
| two large spotlights hovered low over a roadway four miles south of   |
| Cochrane, Ontario at 6:30 a.m. It made no sound. (Source: Doris       |

| 1989 - A figure with two eyes and a broad mouth stood inside a        |
| glowing ovoid UFO wth two landing gear in Voronezh, Russia. A         |
| horizontal "H" symbol or insignia was seen on the craft. (Sources:    |

| 1989 - On this evening 16-year-old Hatawa Barinova was returning home |
| on her moped from trade school in Mayskiy, Kabardino-Balkariya        |
| Republic, North Caucasus, Russia. Suddenly she heard in her head a    |
| low pitched, mechanical, monotone voice that clearly said, “Sit down  |
| quietly!” She looked up and saw a thin transparent “grid”,            |
| resembling polyethylene, falling over her. Beams of light emanated    |
| from each polygon. The grid-like net began to control the moped,      |
| covering the witness from all sides. She felt a compression in her    |
| head and her breathing became shallow, and soon both she and her      |
| moped began to rise in the air. She started screaming for her mother, |
| but her voice sounded like an echo inside a “barrel.” When she tried  |
| to jump from the moped she momentarily grasped the luminous grid and  |
| received a mild electrical discharge. Through the grid she saw her    |
| aunt Galya approaching and yelling something; she could see her lips  |
| moving but heard nothing. Her aunt, along with her aunt's husband,    |
| managed to grab the terrified girl and pull her away to safety as the |
| grid rose upwards and disappeared. She was taken home where she was   |
| treated for burns to her hands and fingers. Around the same time      |
| other locals had spotted a large luminous sphere hovering above       |
| approximately the same location. (Sources:Jacques Vallee, UFO         |

| 1990 - In Bristol, England three witnesses watched a delta-shaped     |
| object surrounded by an orange glow at 8:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m. two    |
| disc-shaped objects were seen over highway A835 in Saddleworth Moor,  |
| England. The object shone a spotlight into one of the cars of the     |
| witnesses. There were three separate reports of the disc. (Source:    |

| 1994 - Dogs alerted witnesses to the presence in the sky of three     |
| white lights in a row between Custer and Hot Springs, South Dakota,   |
| which shift to a triangle configuration, then back to a row again     |
| before lost from sight. Each light strobed in sequence. The           |
| configuration was about 600 feet across, at an estimated altitude of  |
| 1,000 feet and a speed of 100 mph. (Source: MUFON investigation       |
