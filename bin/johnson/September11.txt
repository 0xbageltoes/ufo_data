| 1946 - In Oak Lawn, Illinois a V-shaped formation of five silver      |
| disks, with one trailing behind, were seen heading northeast to       |
| Indiana, bypassing Chicago. They were the size of small peas at arms  |

| 1952 - A group of young people in Flatwoods, West Virginia saw a      |
| bright red "meteor" land on top of a hill at around 7:15 p.m. A       |
| fluctuating orange-red light was seen on the hill, so they went up to |
| the site to investigate. They were accompanied by beautician Kathleen |
| Hill and her two sons and another youth, Gene Lemon. When the seven   |
| witnesses got close to the hilltop, they observed a globe as large as |
| a house, making a throbbing or hissing sound. A huge black figure     |
| with glowing orange eyes blocked their path. The figure was about 12  |
| feet high (4 meters), and it had a reddish pear-shaped head or        |
| helmet, with two luminous eyes from which beams of bluish light       |
| emerged; it also had a dark metallic green body that "floated" toward |
| the witnesses, who fled in terror. The “entity” glided toward them,   |
| then toward a luminous, 20-foot wide pear-shaped about 50 feet away,  |
| which was pulsating between bright orange and dull red. There was     |
| also a mist in the area which had a choking, metallic smell. Gene     |
| Lemon fainted, so some of the others had to drag him away with them,  |
| while the others ran. Lemon vomited all night long. Reporters who     |
| went to the site later that evening saw no object, but could still    |
| smell the lingering odor. Next day, a 15-foot circle of flattened     |
| grass, some “skid marks”, and a strip of browned vegetation were      |
| found at the landing site. (Sources: Charleston (WV) Daily Mail,      |

| 1969 - Shortly after midnight a man named Rodilana saw a ten meter    |

| 1969 - Flying from Chicago, Illinois to Cleveland, Ohio a passenger   |
| on a plane sighted a silver disc-shaped object accompanied by 12      |
| smaller spheres. The disc was large, while the spheres were 12" in    |
| diameter. The UFO got close to the plane, within 300 yards, for       |
| several minutes, and according to the witness the airplance           |
| experienced radio interference, he felt a sensation of heat from the  |
| object, and the UFO actually pulled the airplane towards it. (Source: |

| 1971 - On this night Juan De La Palmareno, an 81-year-old peasant,    |
| was guarding a melon field in Aznacollar, Spain from poachers when he |
| saw a vessel "as big as a bus" land near an old well. Many, perhaps   |
| over 50, blue uniformed men without headgear disembarked. Most of     |
| them went down into a depression in the field, but 5 or 6 stayed      |
| behind, and one of these shone a light into the witness eyes. He went |
| into the village to report this, followed for much of the way by two  |
| men with a light. Ground marks were said by the witness to have been  |
| left at the landing site. (Sources: Ignacio Darnaude Rojas-Marcos,    |

| 1973 - Two motorists driving in Long Barn, near Sonora, California in |
| the early morning hours observed a "silverish-yellowish orange disc"  |
| hovering silently over a canyon on the south side of Highway 108.     |
| Several other sightings were reported in the vicinity between         |
| September 12-17. (Source: Sonora Daily Union Democrat, September 18,  |

| 1973 - Kent, Litchfield County, Connecticut - At 10:30 p.m. two        |
| 17-year-old boys were driving north on Route 7 from Westchester       |
| County, New York to Connecticut and saw a large oval object with      |
| flashing colored lights when they were several miles south of town.   |
| The object hovered just over the ridge on the west side of the        |
| Housatonic River, and they stopped and got out for a better look.     |
| They were joined by another couple, a boy and girl also driving back  |
| from Westchester to Connecticut. Meanwhile on Spooner Hill, in Kent,  |
| Connecticut to the east, a witness on his way to visit his friends, a |
| young married couple, saw the same object and when he arrived at his  |
| friend's house, he called them outside. By this time the object had   |
| dropped behind a ridge, although they could still see its lights      |
| shining over the crest of the hill. They got into the witness car and |
| drove down the hill to Route 7, where they met the four younger       |
| people. All seven then drove north into town to bring back two        |
| additional witnesses. The large object was no longer visible, but     |
| they now saw a dozen or so smaller whitish lights maneuvering in a    |
| circular pattern just this side of the ridge. These lights then       |
| separated into a single line and proceeded north toward Mt. Algo,     |
| just southwest of the main section of Kent. The witnesses got into    |
| their cars and followed the lights toward Kent. The two additional    |
| witnesses were dropped off in town while the other seven turned west  |
| on Rte. 341 and crossed the bridge over the river, heading toward Mt. |
| Algo. There they turned south on Schaghticoke Road, which runs along  |
| the base of the mountain, to Bonu's Field, an open spot about a mile  |
| south. The group assembled there briefly but was unable to see        |
| anything. Meanwhile, at about the same time, a separate group of      |
| three teenage girls, camping out in a backyard along the Housatonic,  |
| observed a line of lights descending Mt. Algo on its steep, north     |
| side. The witnesses at Bonu's field had gotten back in their cars and |
| drove north again to the junction of Rte 341, where they discovered a |
| small parked white car that had not been there a few minutes earlier. |
| They parked their cars and the two younger boys got out and asked the |
| occupants of the white car (two unidentified girls) if they had seen  |
| anything unusual. They said that they were waiting for a group of     |
| hikers who had told them an hour earlier that they were "hiking over  |
| the mountain" and that the girls should meet them there.              |
|                                                                       |
| Just then a group of 15 to 20 "hikers" came jogging down Schaghticoke |
| Road from the same direction the young people had just driven (they   |
| had not seen anyone on the road). Each "hiker" had a lighted hat like |
| a miner's hat on his head and they all carried poles or "rods." They  |
| were mumbling or "chanting" and approached in a double column. They   |
| did not answer the boy's questions as they passed on either side of   |
| them, when asked where they'd come from. According to the young       |
| people, the "hikers" apparently turned right at Route 341 and headed  |
| towards Kent. However, when they all got back in their cars and drove |
| after them, the "hikers" were nowhere to be seen--as though they had  |
| disappeared into thin air. According to the two young men and the     |
| younger couple, there were at least two hours they could not account  |
| for. The three older people could not recall what they did or where   |
| they went after the "hikers" passed them. Hypnotic regression was     |
| attempted, but the results are not described. (Sources: Budd Hopkins, |

| 1975 - Bernie, a young Milwaukee truck driver, was driving his truck  |
| near Rockford, Illinois around 1:00 a.m. when he had an "out of body  |
| experience" (OOBE) and the next thing he knew he found himself in a   |
| UFO. He conversed with a human-like entity, whom he identified as     |
| "Bob C", telepathically for nearly two hours. During this exchange he |
| was given a number of apocalyptic prophecies, and was then handed a   |
| cube-like device (or crystal) with instructions that if anyone should |
| demand it, he should surrender it immediately. He then found himself  |
| back in his truck. When he arrived at his destination and parked his  |
| truck, he got into his car to drive home and found his passage        |
| blocked by a UFO.  Several "Men in Black" (MIB) types confronted him  |
| and asked for the device. He turned it over to the men. Following his |
| experience, he claimed to have a number of additional telepathic      |
| communications with "Bob C." (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,   |

| 1981 - After having a late dinner with some friends, Mauricio Cavallo |
| decided to drive around Monferrato hill in Trino Vercellese,          |
| Piemonte, Italy. He parked his vehicle and proceeded to explore on    |
| foot. He soon saw a bright football-shaped light that appeared to     |
| descend into the thick woods. After checking where he thought the     |
| light had landed, and failing to find anything, he decided to drive   |
| home. At home he felt uneasy and could not sleep. Inexplicably,       |
| around three a.m. he decided to drive back to the site where the      |
| light had come down. When he arrived he was overcome by a strange     |
| malaise, and soon saw a reddish orange yellow light floating about    |
| 100 meters away. Terrified, Cavallo felt himself being levitated up   |
| towards the light. His next recollection was of being inside a sphere |

| 1994 - A man was lying in bed in his home in the U.S. state of        |
| Georgia (exact location not given), when around two a.m. he suddenly  |
| awoke and found that several short Grey humanoid beings were touching |
| him, apparently trying to roll him over. They were about four feet    |
| tall, had large heads, huge black eyes, soft wrinkly skin, very long  |
| arms, and four-digits on their hands. Some of them were wearing robes |
| like monks, but the ones without robes were the typically described   |
| "Greys". They floated him out and up into a large triangular-shaped   |
| craft. Inside the object, he found himself in a room with "Gothic"    |
| looking arches and illuminated walls. He was met by a dark gray being |
| with deep eyes, and a very "convoluted" flesh, who ordered him to lie |
| down. This being had slits in his eyes, and called himself the        |
| "leader." He remembered lying down on a cot-like structure that came  |
| out of the wall. Everything became confused at this point.; he was    |
| only able to remember seeing huge eyes and 12" long fingers working   |
| on him. Next, he was floated down a hallway into another room. There  |
| he met some strange robed entities, who resembled the statues on      |
| Easter Island. They were about five feet tall, grayish brown in       |
| color, and with long, stout features. At this point the "leader"      |
| reappeared and placed his hands over the abductee's eyes. Moments     |
| later he entered another room that smelled like wet concrete or lime. |
| There he remembered seeing several different species. Later, he found |
| himself in another room with a large window. From this vanntage point |
| he was able to see the stars, and got a good look at the side of the  |
| craft. Finally, he was told it was time to go back, and he next found |
| himself standing in his backyard. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |

| 1997 - In West Palm Beach, Florida a woman named June, who had been   |
| involved in previous humanoid close encounters, had gone to bed early |
| because she was falling asleep while lying down watching television.  |
| At ten o'clock in the evening she awoke to find a Grey humanoid       |
| standing over her in her bedroom. She tried to fight him off by       |
| hitting him, but her hand seemed to swat thin air. She could see her  |
| hand go right through the alien's body. She screamed out loud,        |
| telling him to go away. All the time she kept trying to hit the       |
| creature, nothing seemed to work. The alien stayed right beside her.  |
| Then suddenly another voice came from nowhere and it said, "Go away!" |
| This voice sounded in slow motion. It was a very deep and masculine   |
| voice. Surprinsingly, the being vanished. She remained paralyzed from |
| her waist down, and she was so sluggish her brain seemed as if it had |
| been drugged. She wanted to go back to sleep, but somehow she knew if |
| she did something bad would happen. After struggling for awhile she   |
| was able to move and sat up in bed. It took several more minutes      |
| before she could get to her feet and stagger into her living room.    |
| She stayed up until 3:30 a.m. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |

| 2000 - A huge lighted disc-shaped object lit up the sky in West       |
| Berlin, New Jersey. Mrs. D'Imperio and her family (4 witnesses) saw a |
| lighted wheel in the sky at 9:30 p.m. with what looked like bicycle   |
| spokes coming out of it. Another ring was on the outside of the       |
| object, like a "wheel within a wheel". "What amazed me was lights     |
| were coming down the spokes going around the outside of the other     |
| [outer] ring, coming back to where they started and coming together,  |
| [joining up with] all of them in the center of the ring. They kept    |
| repeating this action." Next, a second object came and joined the     |
| first, going around the circle and making another spoke. As they      |
| watched for some time two helicopters came overhead. One was bigger   |
| that the other one, and they both went straight for the UFO they were |
| watching. They then flew around it for awhile. (Source: George A.     |

| 2001 - At midnight, several witnesses on the outskirts of Sydney, New |
| South Wales, Australia first reported a group of three craft coming   |
| over the mountains, flying in a triangle formation. The object at the |
| head of the triangle was estimated to be at least 7,000 meters long,  |
| and the two behind it were 1,000 meters long. There was also a bright |
| red light flying with them in a consecutive pattern. This group then  |
| disappeared. Next came another nine (9) craft, which came over at a   |
| speed of 30-35 km/hour; these were about 500 meters long but did not  |
| blend in with the sky as the first group had. Then eight of the craft |
| disappeared, but the ninth stayed behind and after a minute or two it |
| landed. The main witness and seven others in a hiking group went to   |
| investigate. When they got to the scene, they spotted 50 or more      |
| short, greenish-gray creatures that appeared to be “testing” and      |
| examining the area. After about an hour the creatures went back       |
| inside their spacecraft, and took off into the night sky. (Source:    |

| Andover, Hampshire, England at 5:00 a.m. Next, at three o'clock in    |
| the morning PDT a triangle-shaped object zoomed overhead in Palo      |
| Alto, California. It made no noise and pulsated, and appeared to      |
| change size three times, before each point of light on the apexes of  |
| the triangle seperated and flew off in different directions. After    |
| that, a structured craft in the shape of a triangle flew slowly from  |
| the north to the southwest in Westlock, Alberta, Canada at 11:10 p.m. |
| It seemed to be a charcoal gray or even black in color, but stood out |
| from the color of the night sky on this clear night. Finally, on the  |
