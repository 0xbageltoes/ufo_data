| 1893 - In Leslie, Kentucky thirty minutes after sunrise the sun took  |
| on a "peculiar color" and the sky became filled with thousands of     |
| discs, the size of wagon wheels, in motion. They would change shape   |
| into triangles, squares, and odd forms. They were various colors,     |
| including red, green, black, and red. (Source: Jerome Clark,          |

| 1947 - At 12:30 a.m. ten kilometers southwest of Fkenberg, Sweden the |
| pilot and co-pilot of a DC-3 Swedish postal plane saw a UFO that      |
| looked like a green parallelogram. They watched it for 8-10 seconds.  |

| 1947 - Late in the day two private pilots flying over Mexico,         |
| Missouri sighted three gray discs flying rapidly toward the           |
| northwest. They tried to chase them in their plane, but were quickly  |
| outdistanced. (Sources: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947: A Preliminary      |

| 1951 - The driver of a transcontinental train in Australia, on the    |
| east/west line, saw a flying object at four o'clock in the morning    |
| that illuminated the countryside like a full moon. It flew very fast, |
| came close to the train, appeared ready to land in the desert, then   |
| took off and disappeared. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to        |

| 1952 - At 12:10 a.m. USAF Captain D.A. Woods sighted a large, round,  |
| very bright object with a V-shaped contrail in Lathrop Wells, Nevada. |
| It had a dark cone in the center. The object flew very fast, stopped  |
| and hovered, made an instantaneous 90-degree turn, and began a gentle |
| climb followed by a final sudden acceleration. (Sources: Project Blue |

| 1954 - Rev. W. L. Shelton saw two domed ellipses in Danville,         |
| Virginia at 6:15 a.m. They were 20-feet wide, 8-feet thick, and       |
| glowed silver and orange. The orange glow extended about ten feet.    |
| They hovered at first, then climbed vertically at a terrific speed    |
| side-by-side while getting brighter. He observed them for two         |
| minutes. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official        |

| 1955 - On this day many witnesses in Guarenas, Venezuela saw a silver |
| orb zipping back-and-forth and hovering over the town, making a       |

| 1955 - There were three reports of unusual humanoids in Ohio on this  |
| date, two from Hamilton County and one from Franklin County. A child  |
| with the last name Perry, in Camp Washington, Ohio was reported in    |
| hysterics after seeing a "green man" at the window in the evening.    |
| Several people in Mount Air, Ohio saw a dwarf creature that night. A  |

| 1964 - At 9:20 p.m. a red ellipsoid pulsated as it flew over Melrose, |
| Massachusetts. It had an orange-red halo, as seen through a           |
| telescope. It made no sound. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:        |

| 1965 - At 1:30 a.m. Hector Crespo, a highway engineer, his son        |
| Urgenio, and Francisco Lopez were approaching Zhulleng, 11 miles from |
| Cuenca, Ecuador when they saw two beams of bright light shining up    |
| into the sky. On going to investigate what they believed was a car    |
| wreck; they found a circular object 20 feet in diameter, with a       |
| transparent dome on top. A bright amber light kept flashing around    |
| the edge, and flickering red and blue beams were shining downwards.   |
| The three men approached to within 60 feet of the UFO, and could see  |
| through an open doorway instruments and lights inside it. Three       |
| human-like figures were seen outside the object, one apparently       |
| adjusting the light beam projector, and the other two handing him     |
| tools. They all moved very slowly, “as if under water.” They were     |
| dressed in metallic-looking, silvery white, close-fitting coveralls,  |
| with wide white belts, dark epaulets, and shiny helmets. At one point |
| two of the “men” turned and looked directly at the spot where the     |
| witnesses were watching from, as though knowing the operation was     |
| being observed, but simply returned to the repairs. The object stood  |
| on telescopic legs with curved dish-like footpads, although they were |
| uncertain as to whether there were three or four legs. Crespo’s son   |
| became so frightened that he became nauseated, so they went back to   |
| their car. After awhile they saw the object take off, and the light   |
| moving around the edge was now a brilliant red and the vertical white |
| beams had been extinguished. Just before it “took off like lighting,” |
| it became too bright to look at. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted         |

| 1966 - In Gaylesville, Alabama at 8:50 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. Funk and     |
| their three children witnessed a cluster of four small, glowing,      |
| orange-yellow lights in a triangular formation, moved from east to    |
| west for 4.5 minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO     |

| 1967 - At 2:00 a.m. Marine Private Esteban D. Cova was just leaving   |
| the hangar at Maquetia Airport, Venezuela when he was accosted by a   |
| little man about three feet tall who was covered with wiry hair. The  |
| little man had a very large head, bulging eyes, and made a deep       |
| whistling sound that gave the witness a prickling sensation           |
| throughout his body. The little man then spoke in Spanish, asking     |
| Cova, "Won't you come with us? We need one more." Cova passed out.    |

| 1968 - Awakened by a flapping noise outside, hospital receptionist    |
| Maria Cintra in Lins, Sao Paulo State, Brazil opened the door to find |
| a “foreign looking woman” wearing white light colored, shiny clothes, |
| and a tight fitting hood, and holding an engraved glass bottle and a  |
| mug. Mrs. Cintra filled these for her from the drinking fountain.     |
| While she did so, the woman placed her hand on the witness shoulder   |
| and repeated several times the word “Rempaua.” Then the woman went    |
| out and entered a luminous, pear-shaped UFO craft, shaped with a flat |
| bottom that was hovering 3 feet above the hospital’s lawn. Another    |
| person also saw the craft. It took off and climbed slowly in a        |
| spiral, with a repetition of the flapping sound. (Sources: APRO       |

| grass found at the site. (Sources: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr., Strange    |

| 1972 - A man was driving down the highway in Rural, Illinois on this  |
| night when a bright light in the sky caught his attention. He         |
| followed it to where he saw a disc-shaped craft descend and hover     |
| close to the ground. A door opened in the craft, and an angled        |
| plank slid down from it from the doorway to the ground. Several slim  |
| humanoid figures wearing coveralls began to exit the craft. The       |
| witness crept up to it and suddenly the outer rim slid aside,         |
| following the curve of the craft, exposing transparent cylinders,     |
| which looked to be incubators with infants inside them. As the        |
| witness stared at them in disbelief, one of them opened its eyes and  |
| smiled at him, and he smiled back, then a look of distress came upon  |
| its face as if it appeared to be having trouble breathing. The man    |
| proceeded to pound on the glass, trying to break it open, and then    |
| picked up a rock intending to smash it open, but he abruptly          |
| felt himself being lifted up, from his two sides, away from the       |
| craft. He believes that the aliens knew he had been trying to help,   |
| and were glad that the noise he created alerted them to the apparent  |
| problem with the incubated hybrid. His memory ends at this point with |
| an ensuing period of missing time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,        |

| 1974 - In Feignies, Nord Department, France at 9:00 p.m. Mr. & Mrs.   |
| Moret watched a round black orb, outlined by a faint white luminous   |
| corona, split in two. The sphere was about 200 meters away and it     |
| slowly descended to hover 20 meters above the ground before it split  |
| vertically into two "half moons", one of which flew off to the        |
| south-southeast and was lost from sight. The other half remained in   |
| place, and figures in helmets were seen moving about inside. A sort   |
| of veil was drawn across it, and two "cosmonauts" clad from head to   |
| foot in a whitish-gray metallic material, and wearing large helmets,  |
| were then seen moving in it. The witnesses watched them for 40        |
| minutes, during which time the UFO remained stationary. The diameter  |
| of the original ball was about 25 feet, and the UFOnauts' were        |
| estimated to be five-feet tall. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit,      |

| 1975 - near Buffalo, North Dakota - Sandra Larson, age 32, and her     |
| daughter Jackie, age 15, were being driven from Fargo to Bismarck,    |
| North Dakota by Jackie's boyfriend when they heard a loud rumbling,   |
| thunder-like noise around 4:00 a.m. and saw eight glowing orange      |
| spheres descend from the sky. The objects stopped in mid-air, and     |
| three of the objects shot back upwards. Sandy had a peculiar feeling  |
| as though the car was motionless, and at the same time Jackie         |
| suddenly found herself in the back seat with no memory of how she got |
| there. When they got to a gas station they discovered that an hour of |
| time was unaccounted for. Later, under hypnosis, Sandra recalled      |
| having been "floated" from the car into a UFO, where a six-foot tall  |
| being (1.8 m) with a mummy-like head bandaged up in tape, with the    |
| eyes remaining visible, had performed some sort of surgical operation |
| on her on a medical table. She had the sensation that even her brain  |
| had been briefly removed. This being had a luminosity around its head |
| and shoulders, and it had long metallic-appearing, mechanical arms.   |
| Its body was like "brown vinyl." No communication with the being was  |
| recalled. (Sources: Jerome Clark, Saga UFO Report, August 1976,       |

| isolated area. He described everything he saw onboard the craft as    |
| very quaint and simple, not at all sophisticated looking. He also saw |
| what appeared to be a star-map on a wall. Inside the craft he met     |
| human-like occupants of different statures. Some were over two meters |
| tall, but others were much shorter than that. The women were          |
| generally shorter than the men; they were described as beautiful and  |
| well built, wearing form-fitting outfits, which seemed metallic in    |
| texture. He traveled onboard the “spacecraft” for what seemed like a  |
| short distance, and did not go to another planet. He was shown a      |
| guest room where he was allowed to sleep comfortably. Later, he was   |
| given four crackers to eat and a small glass of a substance           |
| resembling wine. He was told that what he ate would last for four     |
| days. Among many things the humanoids told him was that they believed |
| “in a higher being.” (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1976 Humanoid        |

| 1976 - Four men--Weiner, Foltz, and Rak (including a set of           |
| twins)--had gone out night fishing in a canoe during a camping trip   |
| on East Lake in the Allagash Waterway, Maine when at around 9:00 p.m. |
| one of them became aware of being watched. He turned around and saw a |
| huge, bright, multicolored sphere of light rising from below the      |
| treeline. When one of the men shined a flashlight at the object, it   |
| began to approach their canoe slowly. A tube-shaped beam of light was |
| emitted from the object and hit the water. The object and the beam of |
| light began approaching the four men and all four of them began to    |
| paddle frantically toward shore, trying to get away. At this point    |
| they lost all conscious memory of what happened next. Later, under    |
| hypnosis all four remembered being levitated up from their canoe and  |
| into the hovering craft via a hollow tube-like beam of light. Inside  |
| the they encountered several short dark gray-colored humanoids with   |
| large oval-shaped heads and huge, black, almond-shaped eyes. They all |
| wore metallic uniforms and were described as somewhat insect like.    |
| The men were made to undress and sit on a plastic like bench. The     |
| humanoids then looked into each of the men’s eyes and mouths with a   |
| pencil size rod with a light on its tip. Then each was made to lie on |
| an exam table where each was examined with several handheld and large |
| scanning machine like instruments. Samples of bodily fluids were      |
| taken from all four men. Later, after several hours, they were        |
| floated back down into their canoe. (Sources: Raymond E. Fowler, The  |

| 1977 - The witness in Fontanigorda, Liguria, Italy was having         |
| difficulty sleeping and got up at 4:15 a.m. when he noticed through   |
| some partially opened blinds a very bright white light approach and   |
| stop a few meters away. Moments later two figures with gold-colored   |
| faces appeared in front of the light. The light then moved to the     |
| right side near the curtains, which were the only things separating   |
| the witness from the phenomenon. Next, one of the humanoid figure     |
| started to enter his bedroom through the curtains; it had an          |
| oval-shaped head with an upside-down, triangle-shaped light on the    |
| top part of its face. The witness yelled out, causing the figure to   |
| leave, leaving a faintly luminous handprint on the curtains. Soon     |
| after this, two more figures were heard walking by. Finally, the      |
| lights and the figures vanished. Investigators reportedly found       |
| ground traces. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact          |

| 1978 - At ten o'clock in the evening two witnesses in a car in        |
| Hyannis, Massachusetts on Cape Cod watched an oval-shaped craft       |
| hovering low over the US Route 6 road. Within the craft several       |
| figures could be seen moving about behind several rectangular         |
| windows. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978,  |

| 1979 - Two men in Sitio Dentro, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil were      |
| walking back home late at night when they saw a huge bright light     |
| appear above them, illuminating the area like daytime. They looked up |
| and saw a huge object coming towards them. They could see two beings  |
| inside the craft through a transparent window. The beings could be    |
| seen from the waist up and looked nearly identical to each other.     |
| Both men ran behind a house and squatted by a wall, trying to hide    |
| from the UFO. It then passed over a nearby bar making a very loud     |
| noise. The next morning they discovered that the roof of the bar had  |
| been tore off and several rafters had been broken. One of the men     |
| felt sick for three days after the encounter. (Source: Albert S.      |

| 1982 - A deer hunter in a hammock in a tree at night, in the jungle   |
| in Cocalinho, Maranhao State, Brazil, waiting for deer, was zapped by |
| a beam from a nocturnal ball of light at around 6 a.m. He             |
| became sick, laid down, and died shortly thereafter. (Source: Jacques |

| 1995 - On this night a man in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil     |
| encountered three 50 cm tall humanoids wearying white coveralls and   |
| helmets with antennas. One carried a pen-like instrument, which he    |

| 1998 - The crew of a DC-10 flying over France observed the fast       |
| passage of six luminous points of light in tight formation for 10     |
| seconds at 12:32 a.m., with a single trail. The flight was            |
| horizontal, but described an arc of 90° in just 10 seconds, which was |
| judged to be a supersonic speed. (Source: GEIPAN, case 1998-297).     |

| 2004 - A lone witness in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada saw two          |
| stationary lights in the sky for about an hour, beginning at 3:30     |
| a.m., at which time a haze or fog filled the area and he              |
