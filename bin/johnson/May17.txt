| 1909 - At 10:00 p.m. many witnesses in Belfast, Northern Ireland      |
| observed a silent cigar-shaped flying object with a light that        |
| flashed several times. It rose higher and shot away to the east.      |

| 1947 - Between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m. Field Engineer Savage in Oklahoma   |
| City, Oklahoma saw a frosty white, round and flat object, with a      |
| diameter to thickness ratio of 10:1. It was estimated to be the size  |
| of a B-29 (140 feet wingspan) traveling north at a 350° heading at    |
| between 10,000 to 18,000 feet moving at three times the speed of a    |
| jet, making a slight swishing sound. (Sources: Oklahoma City Times,   |

| 1950 - At three o'clock in the morning four oil men in Hay Creek,     |
| Wyoming watched two saucers over an oil field for two hours. The      |
| object had lights and flames around its rim. It made dives            |

| 1950 - On this night a military witness reported that a saucer-shaped |
| object landed at the Amarillo, Texas airport for five minutes. Its    |
| touchdown set the grass on fire. It took off and flew to the west.    |
| There was an OSI investigation. On the same night a dark, "absolutely |
| solid smoke ring" sped through the clouds of Timperley, Cheshire,     |
| England. It was the size of a plane. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A |

| 1959 - Three crocodile hunters saw a huge football-shaped object 100  |
| meters away from them while hunting in Cooktown, Queensland,          |
| Australia at 4:30 a.m. The object spewed forth a 50 meter wide band   |
| of vapor. Two of the hunters stood up to get a better look. One of    |
| the two later died, and the other suffered some severe physiological  |
| aftereffects from the encounter. (Sources: Bill Chalker, The Oz       |

| 1960 - At 6:30 p.m. two men herding donkeys in Taboleiro de Nazare,   |
| Ceara State, Brazil were chased by a huge round object at low         |
| altitude for about 20 minutes. It pursued them for 18 kilometers,     |
| keeping same distance. Finally, after it flew away by climbing very   |
| quickly out of sight. Ten minutes later a luminous green ball of      |
| light was spotted along the coastline in Acarau, Ceara State, Brazil. |
| It stopped offshore, then followed the coastline to the southeast.    |
| Another light followed along after it a short time later. (Sources:   |

| 1964 - At 9:00 p.m. a fiery object, maneuvering at low altitude, was  |
| seen from Massillon, Ohio. It was sighted from Wooster and            |
| Smithville, Ohio at 9:10 p.m., then from Lawrence and Burbank at 9:25 |
| and 9:30 p.m. It flew erratically with a whirring sound and changes   |
| of color, apparently interfering with police radio. It went down      |
| toward the northwest, appearing ready to land. Abnormal radioactivity |
| was allegedly found at the landing site. (Source: Jacques Vallee,     |

| 1965 - On this evening a luminous UFO zigzagged over Brisbane,        |
| Queensland, Australia. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the         |

| 1966 - At 3:10 a.m. an aircraft design engineer in Mentor, Ohio saw a |
| bluish-white object pickup 10 smaller objects in groups, brightening  |
| each time a pick-up was made, then dimming. The parent object then    |
| turned to the west and accelerated away. At 4:00 a.m. on US Highway   |
| 26 near Warm Springs, Ohio seven small nocturnal lights circled a     |
| large UFO; 4 entered, 3 left, returned and then entered               |
| again.(Sources: Robert Gribble, MUFON UFO Journal, May 1991, p.16).   |

| wingtip of an airliner. The outer discs lagged briefly during a turn  |
| by the airliner. (Source: NICAP report form; Colorado UFO Study       |

| 1967 - At 10:00 p.m. a stream of lights seen in the sky in Kamyshin,  |
| Volgograd, Russia were actually windows on a huge cigar-shaped UFO    |
| that flew from the northeast to southwest, and was lost from view as  |
| it ascended up into space. Major Y. B. Popov, of Novosibirsk,         |
| together with Junior Lieutenant A. S. Nikitenko and several local     |
| residents saw a cascade of lights rushing across the night sky from   |
| the northeast in even rows. The lights were located on the surface of |
| a very large cigar-shaped object; the impression was that of an       |
| ocean-going vessel. (Source: Jacques Vallee, UFO Chronicles of the    |
| Soviet Union: A Cosmic Samizdat, p. 189).                             |

| 1967 - At 8:30 p.m. in Rural Hall, North Carolina witness Red Ledford |
| observed a round, orange-colored object, similar in size to a small   |
| aircraft, which zigzagged back-and-forth for five minutes over a jet  |
| that was heading northeast. (Sources: Don Berliner, Australasian      |
| Ufologist, April 1999, p. 54;  Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence,     |

| 1968 - At 8:45 p.m. Jose Da Silva, the driver of a VW minibus, and    |
| three passengers were listening to the radio under a light rain while |
| driving between Florianopolis and Lagune, Santa Catalina State,       |
| Brazil when they suddenly heard a whirring sound and noticed a        |
| diffused light over the road. Suddenly the van rose up in the air     |
| about 50 centimeters and stayed there for a moment before coming down |
| and again rising up in the air before it was set down on the road     |
| again, this time more slowly. The four men then noticed an intensely  |
| luminous circular object hovering overhead at about 100 meters        |
| altitude. Frightened, they watched from the van while the UFO hovered |
| above them. They described the object as only about two meters in     |
| diameter with several porthole-like windows on its lower part.        |
| Through the portholes shadows or sillouhetted figures were visible    |
| moving about inside. A reddish light emanated from the top of the     |
| object. The UFO remained motionless for a few minutes, and then       |
| tilted at an angle and disappeared towards the ocean. After the       |
| incident all four men suffered from nausea and vomiting. One of the   |
| men also lost all the hair from his eyebrows. Da Silva, who before    |
| the incident had had an abundant head of hair, became bald in less    |
| than a year. A circular burnt area was found on the roof of the       |
| minibus. (Sources: Inforespace, February 1976; Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1968 - At 7:00 p.m. many onboard a ferryboat in Canal de Chacao,      |
| Chile watched a luminous object slow, stop, and make curves in its    |
| flight to the north until gone. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue |
| 117).                                                                 |

| 1968 - Three photographs of luminous UFOs were taken by Dr. Gabriel   |
| Alvial at the University of Chile's El Inferniello Observatory, in    |
| the Andes Mountains, Chile. The scientific research facility involved |
| with this photographic case has been set up in the high Andes         |
| primarily as a Cosmic Ray measuring installation. The operators of    |
| the observatory apparently began observing a "series of luminous      |
| phenomena" months before. The objects were mobile but also stopped    |
| and hovered. One of the images can be viewed at                       |

| 1977 - In Tranent and seven surrounding towns in Lothian, Scotland,   |
| shortly after nine p.m., a domed disc-shaped object and other objects |
| were seen in the skies on a clear evening. One of the witnesses was a |
| 13-year-old boy named McKenzie. The UFOs generally flew off to the    |
| east. The sightings lasted at least 20 minutes. (Source: FSR,         |

| 1977 - A SWAT team witnessed a "flying Xmas tree" soar over the city  |
| of Memphis, Tennessee at 3:30 a.m. It was silent, and seen just 35    |
| feet over twin electrical power towers. It was the length of a        |
| football field, and 50-75 yards wide. (Source: Bob Pratt, MUFON UFO   |

| 1978 - At 8:30 a.m. at a farmhouse in Emilcin, Poland just            |
| eight-tenths of a kilometer from the scene of Jan Wolski's humanoid   |
| encounter the day before, a mother was preparing breakfast while her  |
| two children, Adas and Agnieska, played outside. She heard a sound    |
| like thunder which seemed to be coming from the ground. A short time  |
| later her son Adas came inside to tell her that he had seen a         |
| box-shaped aircraft, like "a little house," fly low over their barn.  |
| It then vanished by shooting up vertically with a sound like thunder. |
| Adas said that the object was flying with its smallest wall forward,  |
| and there was a square window in this side with rounded corners       |
| through which he could see a pilot. On the edges of the side, he      |
| said, were moving, swaying black rods, like the feelers on a snail.   |

| 1979 - At 12:25 a.m. William Herrman saw a UFO from his home in       |
| Summerville, South Carolina and felt the urge to get in his car and   |
| follow it to a remote location. Everything became silent, and the     |
| object descended from the sky, and pulled him inside the craft by     |
| means of a blue beam of light. He then lost consciousness. When he    |
| woke up he was on a exam table. He was medically examined by short,   |
| light skinned beings, with large heads and oval-shaped eyes. They     |
| wore red, tight-fitting coveralls and pullover boots, and their       |
| leader had an emblem like a winged serpent on his chest. They         |
| conversely extensively. He was then taken on a journey and allowed to |
| view a larger vessel in flight and people on the surface looking up   |
| at the craft. He was eventually returned to the same field as his     |

| 2000 - In the pre-dawn hours, in a dream-like state a local woman in  |
| Independence, Missouri remembered seeing a bright light overhead      |
| through her bedroom skylight window. She next remembered lying down   |
| on a table and a figure was at her head on the right side over her    |
| shoulder; another figure was at her feet on her right side. They      |
| seemed to be pulling or tugging at something that felt like a rope    |
| going through her body from her right shoulder to her right hip area. |
| She felt very uncomfortable and her chest hurt. She woke up in her    |
| bed, and noticed a bright light shining in the skylight, and what     |
| appeared to be a plane at first that was traveling south to North.    |
| The object had a tail with a red flashing light and two wings with    |
| red and green lights on the ends. The wings were very thin, and right |
| next to the tail, unlike a normal airplane. The body of the object    |
| was long with a squared off nose. The strange craft had two very      |
| bright large white lights underneath it at the front, shining         |
| directly towards the ground. No noise was heard. (Source: Albert S.   |

| 2001 - At 9:45 p.m. a Ph.D., his wife and their three children in     |
| Ames, Iowa witnessed a huge, silent triangular craft with bright,     |
| blinking, strobing and pulsing white lights. The craft took three     |
| minutes to cross the sky. Using binoculars, they checked details on   |
| the huge, nearby object. (Source: George A Filer & David E. Twichell, |

| 2004 - A woman was cleaning house in Culloden, West Virginia on this  |
| evening when she spotted a black figure run past her window. She      |
| looked outside and could not see anyone. She resumed her cleaning,    |
| but again saw another figure run by the window, this one not as dark  |
| as the first. Ten minutes later she was in the kitchen when she was   |
| blinded by a bright flash of light that came in through both of her   |
| back windows. She then closed her curtains. The next day her dogs     |
| were acting strangely and there was a local power outage in the area. |
