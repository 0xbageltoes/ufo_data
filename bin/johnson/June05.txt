| 1949 - On this night in 1949 a huge fireball zigzagged 800 miles toward the  |
| northeast from the southern tip of Florida to Georgia. There were     |
| several reports along the west coast of Florida as it flew across the |
| sky. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 1410.)           |
|                                                                       |
| 1952 - On this evening in 1952 three cases occurred that were listed by the  |
| Air Force Project Blue Book as "unknowns." At 6:15 p.m. in            |
| Albuquerque, New Mexico a shiny disc was reported moving through the  |
| sky by a military witness. Its speed was estimated as 5-6 times       |
| faster than a F-86 jet and was seen for six seconds. At Offutt Air    |
| Force Base in Nebraska three security guards saw a large red          |
| nocturnal light hover 1000 feet over the main gate to the Strategic   |
| Air Command's major airbase at 11:00 p.m. At the same time, eight     |
| star-like objects were seen flying over Lubbock, Texas. The first two |
| lights flew over in a trailing formation and the others followed      |
| singly. (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in official          |
| statistics, cases 1255, 1256, and 1257).                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - In East Dandenong, Victoria at 6:23 p.m. on this evening in 1954, a   |
| sixteen-year-old girl and her best friend were terrified by a 10      |
| meter long cylinder that hovered only 20 meters above them. A         |
| wristwatch stopped working and their flashlight's battery was         |
| reportedly drained. The craft had a window on top and a bluish light  |
| on each end, and made a drumming noise. (Source: NICAP case           |
| investigation files.)                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1955 - In 1955 a British fishing trawler crew spotted a silver daylight disc |
| flying over the North Sea off the coast of Holland at 7:30 p.m. It    |
| flew at an estimated 3000 meters altitude, and crossed the sky in     |
| five minutes. It was definitely "not a plane," according to the       |
| witnesses. At the same time, a sequence of three photographs were     |
| taken in St. Marc, Belgium showing a convex, lens-shaped disc object  |
| in front of some clouds. The object had a bright bottom and dark,     |
| shadowed top. Motion is implied by the different angles in the        |
| photos. The UFO was seen low nearby the witness's car. (Sources:      |
| Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 4364; Jacques Bonabot,         |
| Catalogue of Belgian UFO Cases, case #77).                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1957 - In Uriman, Venezuela on this night in 1957, members of a local Indian |
| tribe saw a luminous object land and several little men emerge from   |
| the object. When they tried to capture one of these dwarf-like        |
| creatures, it slashed at them with some kind of knife, and gave one   |
| of them a deep arm cut. On the same night another close encounter     |
| occurred near Warrensburg, Missouri. At 10:30 p.m. on highway 13      |
| north of town, three people driving together in a car had an orange   |
| ball of light approach and follow their car. Several small blue       |
| lights exited the larger object and flew off in every direction. A    |
| watch stopped working and there was interference on their car radio   |
| during the encounter. (Sources: Ted Bloecher files; J. Allen Hynek    |
| investigation files, case P44).                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1964 - While driving near the Pajas Blancas airport in Cordoba        |
| province, Argentina a doctor and his wife had the engine of their car |
| fail at four o'clock in the morning. They then found a huge object on |
| the road ahead of them. Its bright light went out, leaving only a     |
| violet colored light. After 20 minutes of no activity, a man          |
| approached the car and suggested that they try the car again. The     |
| engine started up. After telling the couple not to be afraid and that |
| he was on a mission, the humanoid joined two others and all three     |
| entered the object. It then rose rapidly into the sky, leaving a      |
| violet-colored trail. (Sources: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving |
| Vehicle Interference, citing Charles Bowen, The Humanoids; Jacques    |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 610).        |

| 1964 - At about the same time, 3:00 a.m. E.D.T. on the morning of June 5th,  |
| 1964 a 10-foot diameter glowing ball was seen ascending slowly in the |
| sky from a low altitude in Cleveland, Ohio. The ball of light         |
| ascended at a 45-degree angle, and was followed by 10 small lights.   |
| It also emitted blue light beams. (Source: APRO Bulletin, November    |
| 1964).                                                                |

| 1965 - A year later in Lynn, Massachusetts there were several reports |
| of a cigar-shaped object being seen over the local GE facility. This  |
| was in the same 24-hour period that James McDivitt took a photo of an |
| unknown light source from the Gemini 4 spacecraft, while in orbit in  |
| Outer Space over Hawaii. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, January-February    |
| 1966; NICAP UFO Investigator, October 1958, p. 2).                    |

| 1967 - In 1967 a school principal, several teachers, and students saw three  |
| UFOs, one of them low near some power lines during a daytime power    |
| outage at Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania. When the UFOs left the          |
| electricity in the school came back on. Damage was reported on two    |
| generators at the dam power plant. There were power failures reported |
| at 10:16 a.m. in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware     |
| according to the Federal Power Commission. Later that evening at 8    |
| p.m. on State Route 2 outside of Point Pleasant, West Virginia an     |
| unidentified flying object extended some kind of robotic tentacles    |
| and attempted to abduct a bloodmobile. (Sources: NICAP investigation  |
| files dated August 7, 1967; Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 93).         |
|                                                                       |
| 1968 - An orange balloon-shaped object with antennas made complex     |
| maneuvers over the city of Niteroi, Brazil at 10:10 p.m. The object   |
| also reportedly ejected some strips of foil. (Source: Larry Hatch, U  |
| computer database, case 8308).                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1969 - In 1969 at 6:00 a.m. in Uba, Brazil an orange UFO paced and circled a |
| car. The engine and car radio died. Later that day the Canadian       |
| Parliament Building was buzzed by a mysterious red light in Ottawa,   |
| Ontario during the evening hours. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer   |
| database, citing the Brazilian O Dia newspaper; John Colombo, UFOs    |
| over Canada: Personal Accounts of Sightings and Close Encounters, p.  |

|                                                                       |
| 1971 - In 1971 an airliner crew reported sighting four metallic cigar-shaped |
| objects, each about 6 meters in length, flying rapidly toward the     |
| west. The objects passed only 90 meters away from the aircraft, and   |
| left no contrails. Ground radar confirmed their presence. At 10:30    |
| p.m. a man saw three lights-red, white and blue-land among some trees |
| two miles from Norwood, Tasmania. They then took off in a flash the   |
| color of a skyrocket. Landing traces were found at the sight,         |
| including a 10-foot wide irregularly shaped flattened area. (Source:  |
| Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 8308; Launceston Tasmania      |
| Examiner, June 5, 1971).                                              |

| 1975 - In 1975 a couple driving from Appleton to Madison, Wisconsin spotted  |
| three UFOs. The second object had a long trail. It came down, split   |
| apart like booster rocket, arched through the sky traveling rapidly   |
| toward the southwest. On that same night two poor quality photographs |
| were taken of a Saturn-shaped UFO seen above some trees in Colpo,     |
| France. The object had antennas and emitted beams of light. (Source:  |

| 1976 - At 11:30 p.m. in 1976 a glowing cigar-shaped object hovered at a      |
| 40-degree angle over highway 140 in Merced, California. It appeared   |
| to have windows. It then made erratic maneuvers in the sky. (Source:  |
| NICAP UFO Investigator, July 1976).                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1980 - In 1980 a series of strange UFO-related events occurred in both       |
| Malaysia and the San Luis Valley of Colorado. At dusk in Moffat,      |
| Colorado a mustard yellow, old-fashioned "whirlybird" copter was seen |
| rising from a pasture. The next morning a prize-winning bull was      |
| found dead. No nearby airport had ever seen such a craft. At 2:20     |
| a.m. in Port Klang, Malaysia a spinning, luminous bluish-red ball     |
| hovered just 30 feet over a large oil installation. It emitted beam   |
| of light that struck a house near the petroleum tanks, and the house  |
| caught fire. Nearby airport radar confirmed the presence of a UFO.    |

| 1983 - In Varzi, Italy at 5:00 a.m. in 1983 dogs began barking when a        |
| cigar-shaped UFO approached the ground. The object emitted a foggy    |
| vapor at ground level, rose up and hovered in the air. It extended a  |
| rotating dome and orange light, and then flew away toward the         |
| south-southwest. In Vidor, Texas six people watched a star-shaped     |
| object with three rounded protrusions hover in the sky for 2 hours.   |
| It left when aircraft arrived on the scene. (Sources: International   |
| UFO Reporter, November-December 1984, p. 4; APRO Bulletin, May 1984,  |
| p. 7).                                                                |

| 1991 - An orange fireball with a pale halo flew east to west along    |
| the waterfront in Clacton-on-Sea, England at ten minutes past         |
| midnight on this date. When it shot up into a cloud the cloud became  |
| luminescent. (Source: Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1992, p. 152).     |

| 1992 - In 1992 strange lights were seen and videotaped at 10:50 p.m. near    |
| Wanaque Reservoir in New Jersey. The lights maneuvered about the sky, |
| and faded in and out. Wanaque Reservoir has been the scene of many    |
| repeated UFO sightings, especially in the 1960s. (Source: Paul        |
| Ferrughelli, Computer Catalogue of UFO Reports, 1988-1994).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1994 - In 1994 scientists videotaped a new aircraft over a mountain in Col   |
| de Vence, France at 4:30 in the afternoon. A diamond-shaped object,   |
| not seen at the time, appears in the replay of the videotape. A       |
| lens-flare was ruled out as the cause. . At 2:30 a.m. a rapidly       |
| blinking strobe-light flying object paced a car on US highway 285     |
| near Saguache, Colorado. It flew off to the west, going at treetop    |
| level. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue no. 327; Christopher     |
| O'Brien, The Mysterious Valley, p. 244).                              |

| 1995 - In 1995 a 100-meter diameter sphere followed a car for two minutes at |
| 700 meters altitude near Pamiers, France at 12:10 a.m. The occupants  |
| of the car reported being in a state of shock after the encounter.At  |
| 4:00 a.m. a large white ovoid object hovered over Poligny, France.    |
| Six smaller orbs exited the larger object, flew around, then          |
| returned. At 3:10 p.m. EDT a black disc was sighted moving toward the |
| northeast over Pensacola, Florida. It flew slowly at 15 mph, across   |
| the wind, at 100 feet altitude, and made no sound. (Source: Banque    |
| O.V.N.I., case 95; Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue no. 333; UFO          |

| 1997 - At 2:30 a.m. Nathalie, a young French woman, was sitting in    |
| her car with a companion in La Houssaye-en-Brie, France when both     |
| saw an object in the sky that resembled a wheel; it was made of 12    |
| projecting lights revolving counterclockwise. The observation lasted  |
| almost two hours, during which they were unable to move. After the    |
| sighting they both went to sleep. Later, under hypnotic regression,   |
| Nathalie remembered being lifted through a conical light beam into    |
| the hovering craft. Aboard the craft she was submitted to various     |
| medical tests, and apparently given an implant. She witnessed another |
| woman also being subjected to the same treatment. She described her   |
| abductors as being "very tall", about two meters in height, and       |
| assisted by a smaller "woman." Some of her abductors looked human,    |
| and some did not. In another room, she saw four beings sitting in     |
| chairs in front of glass panels. Some of these beings were courteous  |
| to her, and others looked to be rather irritated at her, for whatever |
| reason. The beings appeared to be well built, with huge strong        |
| shoulders. Their heads were larger than humans and oval in shape,     |
| with large black slit-like eyes. Another very curious detail was that |
| they had what appeared to be a lock of hair, tied up tight like a     |
| ponytail, that suck up straight from the tops of their bald heads.    |
| They wore tight fitting, two piece gray colored outfits with belts.   |
| In the room she saw windows in front of a corridor, the floor was     |
| luminous, and apparently made out of glass. She also saw a lozenge    |
| shaped table, black in color in the middle of the room. (Source:      |

| 1997 - In 1997 a hat-shaped UFO reportedly landed in Hayward, California at  |
| 9:30 p.m. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,    |

| 1997 - On this night a Mr. Hassan, near Redmond, Washington saw a low |
| level, hovering saucer-shaped object about half a mile away that was  |
| glowing white. He had the headlights of his car on it, so combined    |
| with the glow from the UFO he could clearly see that it was abducting |
| cattle. The cows appeared to be stunned, still in an upright          |
| position, as they floated up into the object. He also noticed "little |
| monsters" on the ground. They were 50-60 pound humanoids with large   |
| heads, grayish white skin, and dark black eyes. The witness became    |
| frightened and drove off. No one else appeared to be around at the    |
| time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1997,     |

| 1998 - In 1998 in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada two people witnessed two UFOs at  |
| 11:49 p.m. EDT, a large, bright object accompanied by a smaller       |
| orange light trailing behind it. The smaller light merged with the    |
| main light. Neither object made any sound. At 10:05 p.m. PDT a couple |
| in Vancouver, British Columbia observed a stationary, 40-foot tall,   |
| vertically aligned tube in the sky. They said it was ejecting flames  |
| from the underneath end. (Source: UFO Research Manitoba, 1998         |

| 1999 - In Ollioules, France at 11:30 p.m. local time, nine            |
| delta-shaped objects were seen flying in a V-shaped formation. They   |
| moved toward the west, then rearranged into a linear echelon          |
| formation. On that same night in Huntsville, Alabama a row of 5 or 6  |
| blinking lights were seen flying in the sky. The sighting had         |
| occurred at 11:45 CDT, and the witness had been awakened by noise     |
| coming from the sky. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, September 1999, |

| 2002 - On this afternoon at least 45 students said they saw a UFO     |
| land in the field behind Fatma Primary School in the Santral district |
| of Antalya, Turkey. Several students, including Murat Esici, 11, saw  |
| an "alien being" emerge from the landed craft, emitting red rays from |
| its eyes. It had a very big head, was about 1.80 meters tall, and     |
| had hands and feet that looked metallic. Miss Esici temporarily lost  |
| her voice immediately after the sighting. Students Zeynep Cpnar and   |
| Nalan Donmez also claimed they saw an unusual craft with the alien    |
| beside it. "His eyes and hands were red and a red light was emitting  |
| from his eyes." The children were overcome with shock after the       |
| incident. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2002, |
