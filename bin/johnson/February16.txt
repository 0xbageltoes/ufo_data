| 1955 - An aluminum colored hemisphere with a dome on top (a domed     |
| disc) hovered for a couple of minutes over a volcano at 1:00 p.m.,    |
| then flew off quickly to the east. It emitted a small object, which   |
| flew off to the west. It was sighted by several pilots and crew       |
| members of the Peruvian Air Force, flying to the southeast of Quito,  |
| Ecuador. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, March 1955; Dominique Weinstein,    |

| 1965 - A group of boy scouts lead by a Mr. Smythe sighted a domed     |

| its forward edge. It was estimated to be 150 feet away at its closest |
| approach, and at an altitude of 500 feet. It made a humming noise.    |

| 1966 - A luminous object was said to have landed in the woods near    |
| Brunswick Naval Air Station, Maine at 10:30 p.m. The UFO had flashing |
| red, blue, and green lights. A second object was later seen coming to |
| join the first one. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A  |

| 1967 - Raymond Wettling said that in the early morning hours a 180    |
| foot long, cigar-shaped UFO landed in a field beside Interstate 70    |
| near St. Louis, Missouri. Three silver-suited occupants emerged from  |
| the craft and invited him aboard for breakfast. He said he spent a    |
| pleasant hour and 45 minutes chatting with them inside their craft,   |
| over coffee. His hosts showed him through the craft's two rooms. One  |
| was lit up with bright red lights, the other looked like a modern     |
| office. After he left the ship, it took off straight up at a high     |
| rate of speed. No one else reported seeing it, but there was another  |
| UFO landing that evening near Weston, Missouri (see below). (Sources: |

| 1967 - At 10:15 p.m. EST two policemen witnessed a glowing object     |
| like a bright light bulb hovering in the sky over a rural part of     |
| Amherst, Massachusetts. It ejected a small red object that moved back |
| and forth before suddenly accelerating out of sight over the horizon. |
| The UFO made a swishing sound. (Sources: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:     |

| 1967 - A male witness reported that a UFO landed east of Weston,      |
| Missouri in Platte County near Hwy. P at 8:30 p.m. not far from the   |
| Missouri River. This report is potentially an important sighting,     |
| because it is at the intersection of two orthotenic lines of three    |
| UFO reports each, from as far west as Yorba Linda, California and as  |
| far east as Ascension Island, occurring on this date. To see a map,   |

| 1967 - An oval-shaped flying object with three red lights, one green  |
| one, and multiple rows of windows flew over US Route 66 in the desert |
| south of Kingman, Arizona at 11:43 p.m. at under 300 feet altitude.   |
| As the UFO passed over the highway the car being driven by the        |
| witnesses, Mr. & Mrs. Max Recod, was illuminated by a beam of light   |
| that also lit up the surrounding terrain. Two other white lights      |
| joined the first UFO; they merged with the oval-shaped UFO, then shot |
| up into the sky and away at an extremely fast speed. Mr. Recod is     |
| listed as a military witness. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator,       |

| 1969 - On this night in Chateau Des Martins, Vienne, France five      |
| horses in the paddock of M. Meingault were panicked by "something     |
| shining" with intensely bright eyes "of a very pale, brilliant        |
| green." Mr. Meingault saw the eyes approximately 3.75 feet above the  |
| ground. He re-entered his chateau to get his gun and when he returned |
| saw a "flying shadow" pursuing the horses. There was a great deal of  |
| damage to the paddock and fences caused by the frightened animals.    |

| 1971 - At 6 p.m. while waiting for a bus in Straken, Sweden Ake       |
| Westerberg saw a little man standing motionless in the middle of the  |
| road about 50 feet away. "I couldn't see his face; there was just a   |
| gray spot there." Westerberg stepped closer out of curiosity, and he  |
| heard the little figure growl. Then there suddenly appeared a flash   |
| of white light so intense that the had to shut his eyes. When he      |
| re-opened them a few seconds later the little figure had disappeared. |

| 1988 - Two police officers saw a very large spinning oval-shaped UFO  |
| with flashing red and green lights around its circumference in the    |
| Rosehill area of Willenhall, England. It made no sound and flew off   |
| quickly toward the southeast. Two more cops saw the same or a similar |
| UFO from Walsall. Their reports were sent to the Ministry of Defence. |

| 1996 - A huge craft with 50 to 75 lights flew directly overhead of    |
| the witness driving on Highway 285 south of Ojo Caliente, New Mexico  |
| at 10:05 p.m. The lights on the UFO were sequencing in a clockwise    |
| direction. It made no sound, flew straight up, then down, then        |
| hovered again. It left flying off toward the north. (Source:          |

| 1997 - Two teenage brothers in Lago de Rapel, Chile were followed     |
| home by a brilliant, noiseless flying object at 4:30 a.m. When they   |
| got home they ran inside and woke up their father. He first thought   |
| they were joking, but all three looked out a window could still see   |
| the object quietly hovering outside. They then woke up their father   |
| who thought they were joking. All three looked out the window and     |
| noticed that the object had landed on the ground. Next to it stood a  |
| being four feet 8 inches tall with a large bald head who wore a       |
| bluish colored uniform. All three witnesses became frightened and hid |
| until the object and its occupant left the area. (Source: Albert S.   |

| 2000 - At around 9:15 to 9:30 p.m. five large orange glowing lights   |
| flew in from the east over Rockford, Illinois. They maneuvered        |
| vertically and laterally. Two left the formation and disappeared. A   |
| third light split in two, dropping a new light out of its bottom. All |
| remaining lights then sped away. There were multiple independent      |
| reports called into the UFO Reporting Center. (Sources: Peter         |

| 2003 - At 11:00 p.m. a huge "jet black" triangular UFO with lights    |
| came slowly toward a witness driving on 109th Avenue NE in surburban  |
| Juanita, Washington. He pulled his truck to the side of highway and   |
| watched the craft for 30 seconds. It made no sound and it had a       |
| yellow searchlight on the front apex that moved its beam of light,    |
| and then went out. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting   |
