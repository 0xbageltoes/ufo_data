| 1951 - A U.S. Air Force B-36 on a training flight near Goose Bay,     |
| Labrador, Canada spotted a saucer-shaped object with multiple white   |
| lights on a parallel flight course, which then crossed over in front  |
| of them from right to left. The ADF went out for a few minutes, then  |
| the radar jammed and also went out for a few minutes. (Sources:       |

| cause. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of     |

| hovered motionless over the city of Southampton, England. It had      |

| off at high speed towards Eastleigh. (Sources: Charles Bowen, Flying  |

| 1978 - Mr. Gould, age 52, had experienced a series of humanoid        |
| encounters in January of 1978 in his neighborhood. At two o'clock on  |
| this early morning, again in South Middleton, Massachusetts he looked |
| out the front window of his house and noticed a group of humanoid     |
| figures standing besides the road. Five of the figures wore white     |
| coverall suits, as in the previous encounters, and one wore black.    |
| The black dressed individual appeared to be pointing to the ground.   |
| Their clothing was reflective. After a few minutes the beings walked  |
| into the woods and disappeared. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted          |
