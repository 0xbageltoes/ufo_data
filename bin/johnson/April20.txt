| 1897 - Capt. James Hooton was hunting in the vicinity of Homan,       |
| Arkansas when he heard the noise of a steam engine and found an       |
| object in a clearing. It looked like a cylinder with pointed ends,    |
| lateral wheels, and had a horizontal blade overhead. Hooton spoke     |
| with a man who wore dark glasses and walked behind the craft. There   |
| were three or four occupants in total. The witness was told this was  |
| indeed "The Airship" and that it used compressed air for propulsion.  |
| Capt. Hooton saw the wheels spin when the craft rose and flew away.   |

| 1945 - A priest gathering mushrooms near Reneve, France around 6 p.m. |
| saw a 17 cm tall midget with gray hair and a gray beard. It popped up |
| less than a foot away and ran off into the forest. The tiny being     |
| wore dark-red coveralls with a pointed helmet. (Source: Henry-Jean    |

| 1950 - Mr. Robertson was driving about 13 km west of Lufkin, Texas    |
| when he saw a round object about three meters in diameter hovering    |
| about 7 meters above him. It had a dull red glow. It took off with a  |
| "swooshing roar" as sparks flew from a slot under it. Minutes later   |
| the witness felt a burning sensation on his face. (Sources: Flying    |

| 1952 - A dark cylinder was sighted over London, England at 10 o'clock |
| in the morning, flying at 40,000 feet altitude. It was moving from    |
| north to south at a speed in excess of 1,500 mph. Jet interceptors    |
| couldn't reach or catch it. (Source: Toronto (Ontario) Globe & Mail,  |

| 1952 - At 9:15 p.m. several people at a drive-in theatre in Flint,    |
| Michigan saw several groups of UFOs fly over. There were two to nine  |
| objects in a group, and a total of 20 groups. The UFOs were shaped    |
| like "oat kernels" and made changes in direction like conventional    |
| aircraft at a high rate of speed, but a red glow surrounded each      |
| object. The weather was clear at the time, and the sighting was       |
| reported to the Air Force by a Naval Aviation student. (Sources:      |

| 1952 - At 9:30 p.m. a commercial pilot named J. Fidelli, on the       |
| ground at McClellan Air Field in Sacramento, California saw eight     |
| luminous objects moving in a undulating motion at a high rate of      |
| speed. They appeared to be following an aircraft during a landing     |
| approach. The formation of objects passed thru 20 degrees of arc in   |
| 6-8 seconds. They made no sound. (Source: letter to Civilian Saucer   |

| 1964 - Flying over Ross Island near McMurdo Sound Naval Air Station   |
| in Antarctica in the early morning hours, six members of the crew of  |
| a U.S. Coast Guard C-130 spotted nine bright white flying objects in  |
| a "V" formation. The UFOs came from above and paced along the left    |
| side of their transport plane. The aircraft entered a strange haze at |
| 12,000 m altitude, and it experienced a total failure of the radar,   |
| radio, and engine. However, during this temporary engine failure      |
| the plane did not loose altitude.  The entire encounter lasted about  |
| 45 minutes. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, March 1981, p. 1; Richard F.     |

| 1967 - At 3:30 a.m., near Estacion Casalegno in Santa Fe, Argentina   |
| the conductor of a train, Enrique R. Galimberti and another crew      |
| member saw what appeared to be bright multi-colored lights about 120  |
| meters away from the tracks. Thinking it was a fire, Galimberti       |
| stopped the train and both men attempted to approach the scene, armed |
| with fire extinguishers. When they got close to the area they saw the |
| multicolored lights moving around in a circular motion, and then both |
| observed a square metallic object over three meters in width behind   |
| the lights. It had several lighted windows around its edge. At the    |
| front the UFO had what appeared to be a "rotating wheel" that emitted |
| multicolored light flashes. Several short humanoid beings were seen   |
| walking around the object. They wore silvery gray shiny uniforms,     |
| appeared to be bareheaded, and carried what resembled "rifles" or     |
| weapons on their shoulders. The witnesses used the train horn to      |
| check for a reaction from the creatures but there was none. Another   |
| railway employee, Salvador Pomidoro, reported seeing the same square  |
| metallic object on the ground about 15 minutes earlier. (Source:      |

| 1967 - At 8:30 p.m. two dark objects with two bright flashing red     |
| lights and two dimmer white lights flew over a lake in Georgetown,    |
| Massachusetts. They made no noise. At 9:40 p.m. a mushroom shaped     |
| object with a frosted white light on top and a red light on bottom    |
| hovered over Bolton, Massachusetts. It had turquioise colored lights  |
| fore and aft, and eight yellow lights on its perimeter. (Source:      |

| 1969 - At 7:30 p.m. at a farm on Harwood Island, New South Wales,     |
| Australia a 25-foot diameter hat-shaped disc flew low over the sugar  |
| cane crop. It emitted a strong beam of light that swept the ground    |
| for 360 degrees. (Source: Bill Chalker, The Oz Files, p. 125).        |

| 1969 - On this evening in Itaucu, Goias state, Brazil, 25-year-old    |
| Adelino Roque was on his way to the local Serradinho ranch on his     |
| horse when a bright beam of light struck him from above. He soon      |
| found himself inside some kind of dark, drum-like object that was     |
| totally silent. The object was moving through the sky at a very high  |
| speed. He blanked out and could not remember anything after that. He  |
| awoke lying on top of a rock next to the Paranaiba River, miles from  |
| his original location. Meanwhile, his horse had been found tied up at |
| another ranch, apparently unharmed. Sr. Roque also appeared to be     |
| unharmed except for a strange bruise on his side. He did not remember |
| seeing any entities or hearing anyone talk to him during the time he  |
| was missing. Soon after his experience he began neglecting his work   |
| and drinking heavily. He also reportedly fell in love with his        |
| 17-year-old niece. A month later Roque again was reported missing,    |
| this time along with his niece. On June 12, both Roque and his niece  |
| were found dead under unusual circumstances. Some said they had been  |
| poisoned. (Sources: Gordon Creighton, FSR, September-October 1970, p. |

| 1969 - At 11:00 p.m. Mr. & Mrs. Phillips were driving on Highway 11   |
| one mile west of Browntown, Wisconsin when a UFO came directly over   |
| their car, then hovered just 100 feet away off to the right. Its      |
| color changed from orange to yellow-orange to red as it moved. It was |
| kettle-drum shaped, and had lights streaming from the bottom in a     |
| cone shape. The UFO followed their car home, for a total of five      |
| minutes. The UFO made a "tweeting" sound. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,    |

| 1972 - At 2:45 a.m. neighborhood dogs in Scituate, Massachusetts      |
| began barking. A policeman on patrol noticed a light beam on the      |
| ground, and when he glanced up he saw a perfectly round, white        |
| glowing disc-shaped object move overhead. It descended into a marshy  |
| area behind some trees. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:             |

| 1977 - Mark Marston, age 11, was looking for bird's nests in a hedge  |
| in Herbrandston, Pembrokeshire, Wales when "a red glow appeared in    |
| the sky 50 yards away." A few moments later a figure appeared and     |
| drifted through a closed gate at the other end of the field. It was   |
| dressed in a silver suit, like a diver, with a large helmet and a     |
| square, featureless face. It approached Mark rapidly, who turned and  |
| fled for home, screaming. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,    |

| 1980 - Barrio Aguerre, Ciudad Treinta Y Tres, Uruguay. At 12:40 a.m.  |
| 19-year-old Luis Vital Carneiro was returning home after visiting     |
| friends during a powerful electrical storm in the region. After       |
| entering a field through a gate he noticed a strange light cavorting  |
| over the field. Then, about 50 meters away near a barbwire fence, he  |
| noticed two short humanoid figures. Curious, he jumped the fence and  |
| approached the figures. At a distance of ten meters from the          |
| humanoids he noticed that they were projecting lights from the top of |
| their heads down toward the ground. These lights suddenly turned red, |
| and the two figures disappeared to re-appear 30 meters from the road. |
| As Carneiro attempted to jump the barbwire fence again, a beam of     |
| light struck him that knocked him senseless. When he regained his     |
| composure Carneiro ran to his aunt's house nearby and told her what   |
| had happened.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| Mrs. Orialis De Los Santos, his aunt, went out into her garden where  |
| she saw in the nearby field a group of four humanoids that seemed to  |
| quickly glide back and forth above the ground. Accompanied by Vital,  |
| they then counted a total of thirteen humanoids that "glided" about   |
| in different directions, within an area of about 100 square meters.   |
| For almost an hour the witnesses watched the strange humanoids cavort |
| about as if playing. Vital Carneiro again attempted to approach one   |
| of the humanoids but again was knocked down by a beam of red light    |
| that seemed to come from the creature's head. He fell to the ground   |
| feeling as he had been struck by lighting. Concerned for his safety,  |
| Mrs De Los Santos ran to her stricken nephew and dragged him inside   |
| the house.                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| From inside the house they could still see the short humanoids        |
| gliding about, plus at about 500 meters distance, behind some trees,  |
| a large bright silvery light appeared on the ground that began slowly |
| rising up and down. The witnesses described the humanoids as 60 cm in |
| height, with very large heads, triangular faces, large pointed ears,  |
| and rounded eyes. Their bodies were small and "rectangular" in shape. |
| They wore a kind of gray uniform and a rounded cap from where the     |
| beams of light originated. They seemed to communicate among           |
| themselves in quick bursts of "buzzing sounds." They glided quickly   |
| across the ground and according to Mrs. De Los Santos they stood on   |
| small rounded platforms. However, Carneiro does not recall seeing the |
| platforms. (Sources: UFO Newsclipping Service, June 1980, p. 12;      |

| 1980 - At 5:30 a.m. in San Mateo, California two witnesses in a car   |
| on I-280 watched five bright metallic Saturn-shaped objects silently  |
| travel the length of the San Andreas Reservoir. They flew straight    |
| and fast to the southeast. They reflected sunlight, and were seen     |
| against the background of hills and the overcast sky. (Sources: Allan |

| Nevada at 10:30 a.m. when they sighted a domed disc-shaped UFO. The   |
| UFO was seen below their horizon at a distance of only 300 feet. They |
| described it as a solid object, shiny like chrome, which tilted and   |
| fluttered as it flew. It was small, onlly 3-5 feet in diameter.  It   |
| tilted, accelerated rapidly, then sped away toward the cloud          |
| shrouded mountains. It did not appear on radar. (Source:  MUFON UFO   |

| 1982 - Sometime after three a.m. a man in County Tyrone, Ireland      |
| awoke trying to scream and immediately became aware of two unusual    |
| humanoid figures standing by his bed. One was short and the other     |
| tall and lumpy, and the second being somehow had its head inside the  |
| witness's mouth. The beings were communicating in a language that     |
| resembled the ringing of bells. The witness could not move or yell    |
| because he was paralyzed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid        |
