| 1933 - At 10:50 p.m. a luminous white object, with the apparent size  |
| of a 12 cm coin held at arms length, hovered over Bondy,              |
| Seine-St-Denis, France for five minutes, rose higher in the air, then |
| shot overhead. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 316).          |

| 1952 - Two pilots of a Navy TBM plane from Mitchel AFB on Long        |
| Island, New York chased a white, circular, domed disc at 9:50 a.m.,   |
| which finally accelerated and outdistanced them, climbing away. The   |
| TBM torpedo plane was flying at 6000 feet altitude when the crew      |
| first spotted the object. The disc was very light on top, but dark on |
| the underside. It was estimated to be from 20 to 30 feet in diameter, |
| at a minimum distance of only 2000 feet. When it was first seen it    |
| was at 200 feet, and then climbed to the plane's altitude. It started |
| a rapid climb from there and soon vanished from sight. The official   |
| Air Force explanation at the time was that it was a balloon, which    |
| nearly everyone who has reviewed the case doubts. (Sources: Project   |

| 1957 - A l arge shiny metallic sphere hovered over an Army military   |
| installation in Arlington, Virginia at 10:45 a.m. It vanished and     |
| reappeared twice. Meanwhile, some small brown discs were also seen    |
| maneuvering in the sky. (Source: Loren E. Gross, The Fifth Horseman   |

| 1958 - Two white, silent, hat-shaped saucers flew over the Tumacacori |
| Mountains in Arizona at 4:00 p.m., heading toward the southwest. They |
| flipped over, then flew in a sawtooth trajectory and entered a cloud. |

| 1959 - A luminous object was seen falling into the harbor of Gdynia,  |
| Poland on this night. Divers were sent to retrieve it and brought     |
| back a piece of un-rusted metal whose composition was not publicly    |
| disclosed. Several days later, a strange male figure wearing "a sort  |
| of uniform" was encountered dragging himself along the beach. Part of |
| his face appeared to be burnt and his hair singed. After being taken  |
| to hospital it was discovered that the uniform he wore was made of    |
| metal, and the being's organs were quite different from those of a    |
| human being. It had six digits on its hands and feet. The creature    |
| died after an armband was removed, and the body was sent to the       |
| Soviet Union. An autopsy allegedly revealed a different structure of  |
| internal organs and a spiral system of blood circulation. It had six  |
| fingered extremities and was about 1.60 meters in height. The body    |
| was placed in a freezer and stored in an underground bunker,          |
| supposedly in the Moscow area. The divers apparently also found       |
| another half of the object that crashed, embedded in the underwater   |
| mud.                                                                  |

| According to additional details revealed later, a second alien body   |
| was recovered on shore a short time after the first recovery. The     |
| alien that had still been alive was treated at the Gdynia-Redlow      |
| hospital, but soon fell into a coma-like state after an arm bracelet  |
| was removed. Both aliens had six digits on their hands and feet. An   |
| autopsy was conducted on one of the dead aliens; the one in a coma    |
| was put in a special chamber aimed at supporting its vital functions. |
| The six-fingered being taken to the U.S.S.R. is allegedly being       |
| stored in an isolated top-secret underground bunker, located under a  |
| building on a biomedical research center facility east of             |
| Solnechnogorsk. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:      |

| 1966 - At around midnight near Shearwater Lake in Crockerton,         |
| Wiltshire, England a resident of Frome, riding on a motorcycle, saw   |
| three "gray garbed and white faced" figures, looking like frogmen,    |
| jump into a hedgerow. They had wide-spaced eyes and no apparent       |
| mouths. One figure was seen to have fair hair. They were shorter than |
| normal humans, but with big shoulders, rather large heads, and thin   |
| legs. He turned around and came back, and saw a "large saucer of      |
| light" rise from the lakeside. The saucer hovered briefly before      |
| flying off in the direction of Cley Hill. Ground traces were found at |
| the site. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case #7058,     |
