| 1897 - The whole town of Jenny Lind, Arkansas watched an airship fly  |
| over from the northeast to the southwest at 7:30 p.m. It landed, and  |
| a human looking occupant got out. He spoke English, and told them he  |
| was out to "catch birds." (Sources: St. Louis Post Dispatch, May 5,   |

| 1932 - During a time of personal crises, the witness, now a retired   |
| pastor, found himself in a city of 16,000 located 150 miles west of   |
| Toronto, Ontario. On this particular night he was standing on a       |
| street lit up by a brilliant white light from above. Looking up, he   |
| saw the light came from a round cloud with a scalloped edge, about    |
| 200 yards overhead. From the cloud-like object streamed down a light  |
| like a laser beam. He next saw a young man with golden hair standing  |
| beside him, dressed in a suit of a similar color. The man had radiant |
| blue eyes, and was about 5.5 feet tall. He smiled at the witness and  |
| told him that his work would be in that city, and reminded him that   |
| “the cottages in the rear of the mansion are as important as those    |
| who dwell in the mansion.” He told him the witness would reside there |
| for six years and would then work his way to the west coast.          |
| According to the man’s account, the prophecies were fulfilled.        |

| 1950 - At 10:00 p.m. in Birmingham, Alabama a ghostly object grew and |
| changed shape; it flashes; then suddenly shoots up and is gone. There |
| were two witnesses together and an additional independent observer,   |
| and the event lasted 10 minutes. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer    |

| 1953 - On this afternoon at 1:50 p.m. a military witness at Harmon    |
| AFB, Newfoundland, Canada watched a flying football fly by at low     |
| altitude and high speed, heading south. It made a tinny sound. The    |

| 1955 - One year later, at 1:38 p.m. at the Keflavik Air Force Base in |
| Iceland, two USAF officers, USAF Lt. Col. E. J. Stealy and 1st Lt. J. |
| W. Burt, spotted 10 white oval-shaped objects, some 60-70 feet in     |
| diameter, moving "rapidly and jerkily." One of them left a brief      |
| smoke trail. The UFOs moved at a tremendous rate of speed, and were   |
| gone from sight in five seconds. This case was listed as an "unknown" |
| by Project Blue Book. (Sources: Project Blue Book case files counted  |

| 1960 - A yellow, cigar-shaped or elliptical object with four evenly   |
| spaced windows was observed at ground level by an architect in        |

| 1960 - In 1960 a giant cigar-shaped object crossed the skies over the town   |
| of Botocatu, Brazil during the daytime. It moved at a tremendous      |
| speed and was gone from sight in 30 seconds. (Source: Coral E.        |

| 1966 - At 3:40 a.m. an FAA air traffic controller in Charleston, West |
| Virginia tracked an unidentified, non-transponding target about five  |
| miles to the 11 o'clock position from Braniff Airline Flight 42       |
| headed east at 33,000 feet, which the crew saw high above them as a   |
| bluish-white object giving off a brilliant flaming light of           |
| alternating white-green-red colors. Radar showed the object veering   |
| away to 8-10 miles away at the 10 o'clock position, then come at the  |
| Braniff airliner to within three miles distance, then made a 180°     |
| left turn to the NW again within a diameter of 5 miles at 1,000 mph   |
| [5 G's]. The Braniff crew confirmed the object descending from 20°    |
| elevation above horizon. (Source: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience, |

| 1966 - Later that evening at 10 p.m. a white disc flew up to a farm   |
| in Cardington, Ohio and hovered low over a farmyard for 30 minutes.   |
| It took off fast when an airplane came into view. Two more sighting   |
| reports were made that day to Project Blue Book from nearby Columbus, |
| Ohio. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case #7237; APRO     |
| Bulletin, May-June 1966; Project Blue Book files).                    |

| 1969 - An abduction occurred in 1969 to a soldier while fishing on the banks |
| of the Rio das Velhas near the city of Bebedouro in the state of      |
| Espirito Santo, Brazil. Jose Antonio da Silva had left his home in    |
| Belo Horizonte and taken a bus to Bebedouro to go fishing the evening |
| before. At about midnight he reached the banks of a small lagoon and  |
| set up his tent and fished for a while without success. The next day, |
| at about 3 p.m. he became aware of figures moving around behind him.  |
| He heard a deep sound like a groan, then was struck in the legs by a  |
| "burst of fire" coming from a form partly hidden in the bushes.       |
| Seized with a cramp and feeling a numbness in his legs, he knelt      |
| down. A beam of light, greenish in the middle and reddish on the      |
| edges, had hit him. In a matter of seconds he was seized under the    |
| armpits by masked two four-foot-tall humanoid beings, who wore        |
| shining light-colored garments and aluminum colored helmets with      |
| facemasks. Tubes ran from the masks to small containers on their      |
| backs.                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| They blindfolded him and brought him before a little man with long    |
| red hair and a big nose. They dragged him to a craft that was shaped  |
| like a vertical cylinder terminated by wider saucer shaped top and    |
| bottom; rods from the base of the cylinder supported the upper disc.  |
| It was only bout six feet high and nine feet wide. Inside was a       |
| cubical room, brilliantly lit but from no visible source. Here they   |
| fitted on him a helmet like their own, then tied him down to a seat.  |
|                                                                       |
| He felt a sensation of taking off. During the flight, which he felt   |
| lasted for hours, they talked among themselves in an incomprehensible |
| language with many "R" sounds. At one point in the journey the craft  |
| seemed to turn on its side for awhile. When they landed he was        |
| blindfolded and dragged into a large room, where a little man without |
| a spacesuit confronted him; he had long reddish hair and a beard that |
| flowed to his waist. He was strongly built, and his skin was pallid   |
| in color. He had large round, green eyes and a big nose, and his      |
| mouth appeared toothless, "like a fish." To the side of the witness   |
| were laid 4 human cadavers, one a Negro's. A dozen more little men,   |
| all much resembling the leader, were in the room. They examined his   |
| fishing tackle and other possessions. Several carried weapons. The    |
| leader then addressed him in his incomprehensible language,           |
| simultaneously making sketches on a whiteboard beside him.            |
|                                                                       |
| He was given a stone cup and drank a bitter green liquid that         |
| restored his energy and made him better able to comprehend what the   |
| alien was trying to say. The leader conveyed to Da Silva the idea     |
| that he was expected to help them land on Earth, a proposition that   |
| the soldier rejected, fingering his rosary. The leader became         |
| irritated, snatched the rosary away, and showed it to the others. At  |
| this point a kind of vision appeared to Da Silva of a Christ-like man |
| with long fair hair and beard, dressed like a monk, who spoke to him  |
| in Portuguese, giving him a message, which he was sworn to keep       |
| secret. After this vision had vanished, Da Silva was again            |
| blindfolded, dragged back to the spacecraft, and returned to Earth in |
| the same manner as he had been taken away. He was released during the |
| night. When morning came he found that he was near Vitoria, more than |
| 200 miles from Bebedouro, and that four and a half days had passed    |
| since his abduction. He suffered various physical ailments later.     |
| Jose Antonio has repeatedly refused to reveal the content of this     |
| message. (Source: Hulvio Brant Aleixo and Dr. Walter Buhler, FSR,     |

| 1975 - A UFO was seen near the ground in Cupey, Puerto Rico at 4:20 a.m. in  |
| 1975. The object had an intense yellow pulsating light, and a row of  |
| eight rectangular lights. Ground marks were found at the site         |
| including a burnt area 25 feet in diameter. There were also large     |
| three-toed footprints, fourteen inches long and spaced 50" apart.     |

| 1976 - Several witnesses reported seeing a narrow, bright red trail   |
| that climbed steeply into the sky from sea level south of Robben      |
| Island in Three Anchor Bay, South Africa. A loud explosion followed   |
| it. The object turned in flight. Ninety minutes later the main        |
| witness heard a second explosion. That witness was Brigadier General  |
| C. Smith. (Source: Saga UFO Report, December 1976, p. 80).            |

| 1976 - Also in 1976, a 74-year-old grandmother and two of her grandchildren  |
| saw a domed disc slowly flying by in the sky over Wilrijk, Belgium at |
| 10:45 p.m. local time. It had small lights around the rim of the      |
| object. (Source: J. Bernard Delaire, UFO Register Volume 7, p 32).            |

| 1976 - About five hours after the Belgium UFO encounter a farmer      |
| driving through one of his fields in Orfordville, Wisconsin at dusk   |
| noticed a hovering object 150 feet above him. It had two bright       |
| headlights and two rotating red lights. An hour later his son saw the |
| same lights; they did a U-turn in the sky and flew away. (Sources: J. |

| 1977 - A 23-year-old man, Sr. Ferreira, disappeared in front of his   |
| fellow factory employees in Atuba, Para state, Brazil fulfilling a    |
| prediction made on May 4, 1976 that UFOnauts would come back for him. |
| He turned up the next day, 40 miles away, and said he had been in the |

| 1978 - Soon after a blinding blue light caused a road accident near   |
| Villa Mercedes, San Luis province, Argentina about 100 city residents |
| saw 50 greenish-blue UFOs flying over the city. In the midst of a     |
| dazzling light, they perfectly executed a series of maneuvers: they   |
| broke into two formations and then rejoined, and then they            |
| disappeared from view. Shortly after that some people reported that   |
| they had witnessed the landing of a saucer-shaped craft nearby. A     |
| being dressed in a green uniform emerged from the craft for a short   |
| while. (Sources: Buenos Aires Herald, May 8, 1978; Albert S. Rosales, |

| 1989 - At 9:30 in Easton, Connecticut an object shaped like a flying  |
| wing with red, yellow, and blue lights in back and a blinking red     |
| light on right side flew over tree line behind a house. Just before   |
| 10:00 p.m. an engineer and two others watched a boomerang or V-shaped |
| object as big as a football field near a golf course in Trumbull,     |
| Connecticut. It made a faint humming sound and had many colored       |
| lights. The engineer was driving home when he first saw the object,   |
| which had red and white lights turned on at first, then turned off;   |
| with the light turned off it looked like a blue boomerang.            |

| 1990 - In Antwerp, Belgium at 11:20 p.m. two observers reported       |
| sighting a silent orange disc-shaped object accompanied by a small    |
| white orb at 180 feet altitude. It had two legs on the bottom and     |
| what appeared to be a row of windows. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, |

| 1999 - A 45-year-old man went missing after he left his parents' home |
| in Bariloche, Rio Negro province, Argentina on this night. He was     |
| found 8 days later by bloodhounds in an isolated canyon, dehydrated   |
| and suffering from hypothermia. He claimed he had been abducted by    |
| "extraterrestrials"; two men dressed in white and an attractive woman |
| that picked him up and apparently wanted to operate on him. He had no |
| other memories about what occurred to him. (Source: Albert S.         |

| 2002 - At 3:45 p.m., two separate witnesses in towns nearby to        |
| Farmingdale, New York observed an egg-shaped UFO move at low speed    |
| and altitude in a clear blue sky. The object seemed "transparent      |
| rather than solid, more like a ring" and it left a white              |
| contrail-like wake much like a boat in the water would do. (Source:   |

| 2006 - A security officer on patrol in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada      |
| observed four lights in the sky at 11:45 p.m. Three seemed to be      |

| 2007 - In Timmins, Ontario, Canada a light was seen in the            |

| 2009 - The witness climbed into his sleeping bag around 11:00 p.m.    |
| in his tent while camping in the Lake District, England. At 1:30 a.m. |
| he was awakened by a deep humming sound that seemed to vibrate        |
| through him. The inside of his tent was also lit up by a dim glow.    |
| What was most puzzling and disturbing was that from that time onward  |
| he could remember nothing until dawn on Wednesday morning, when he    |
| woke up outside his tent, stark naked and very cold. His tent and     |
| clothes had a very strong 'ozone' smell. His only recollection was    |
| being laid face down on something hard, and having something hard     |
| pushed into his rectum, which was very sore at the time. (Source:     |
