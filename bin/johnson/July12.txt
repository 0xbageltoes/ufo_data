| 1952 - At 3:30 p.m. four elliptical-shaped objects, one-third the     |
| size of a transport plane, flew four abreast in formation at a high   |
| rate of speed over Annapolis, Maryland. They stopped in mid-air,      |
| executed a 90-degree turn, then accelerated and vanished in mid-air.  |
| At 9:00 p.m. an object the size of a B-36 bomber was picked up on     |
| radar flying over Kirksville Air Force Base, Missouri at a speed of   |
| 1,700 mph. (Sources: (1) Project Blue Book files counted in official  |

| 1965 - A UFO was sighted off of Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea on this   |
| night in the same approximate location as the famous CE-III sightings |
| by Father Gill in 1959. A red light changed to blue. It was extremely |
| bright, and was seen swaying from side to side in a broad pendulum    |
| swing, at least a mile in each direction. The witnesses were several  |
| school children and their teacher. (Source: Debbie Payne,             |

| dos Barbeiros, Brazil nearly hit a saucer-shaped craft, 6 meters in   |
| diameter, which had two V-shaped landing pads and a dome, and which   |
| had landed on the road. It made a whirring noise. (Sources: Lumieres  |

| 1969 - At 11:00 p.m. a dark gray, metallic inverted bowl-shaped disc  |
| flew over a farm in Van Horne, Iowa during a rainstorm, spinning      |
| counter-clockwise. It had a reddish-orange band two-thirds of the way |
| from its bottom to the top, and made a noise like a jet. The          |
| witnesses were three teenage girls. A 40-foot circle of wilted        |
| soybean plants was found, but the plants were not bent over or        |
| crushed. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience, p. 129; UNICAT |

| 1971 - At 11:00 p.m. Gaetan Paquin, a young man in his twenties, was  |
| just arriving home in Notre-Dame-Du-Nord, Quebec when a white object  |
| flew over the road. He next saw "a completely white being of human    |
| form, with a pointed nose, slanted eyes, and a little puckered mouth" |
| standing near him. He saw the being in profile. "His height did not   |
| exceed 4 feet. He had no hair, and nothing that resembled clothing.   |
| He was very, very visible in the darkness--there was no light, for    |
| the sky was overcast and the electricity was out that night." The     |
| being appeared to be transparent, and Gaetan had the impression that  |
| a stone thrown at him would have passed right through him. Although   |
| the apparition completely ignored the presence of the witness, Paquin |
| became frightened and fled. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,   |

| 1975 - Four witnesses were walking up a footpath on Highdown Hill in  |
| Sussex, England when they saw a disc-shaped craft land nearby. A gray |
| figure with a large lemon-shaped head then appeared. When the         |
| witnesses tried to approach the figure a shiny red beam of light hit  |
| one of them, and the man who had been struck screamed in pain and     |
| fell to the ground. He recovered quickly, and then all four of the    |
| witnesses fled the scene. Some glowing powder was allegedly found on  |
| the ground in the area later. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1975        |

| 1975 - At 12:50 p.m. Richard W. and three friends, Pat S., Nancy T.,  |
| and Ross K. were having lunch together at a coffee bar in Dunedin,    |
| New Zealand. The weather that was cold and damp and all of them were  |
| feeling a bit under the weather. They sat around a table located      |
| opposite the stairs and quietly ate their lunches. All of a sudden    |
| time seemed to stand still. The noisy and busy coffee bar, occupied   |
| by 80 people, became absolutely silent, when everything froze in      |
| place like a still frame from a motion picture. People were twisted   |
| in strange and unstable positions, frozen while performing movements, |
| and their bodies looked comic. Richard remembered witnessing a cloud  |
| of steam suspended motionless in a dynamic configuration above the    |
| expreso machine. He also remembered seeing a waitress pulling out hot |
| cakes from the oven, and sustaining their heat in her motionless      |
| hands. In the entire cafe only the four of them seemed to be          |
| unaffected, thus having the occasion to observe what was actually     |
| happening. At the top of the stairs leading down to the coffee bar    |
| from street level an unusual man appeared. He was about 1.75 meters   |
| tall and looked to be about 19 years old. He was dark, slim, thin,    |
| with olive skin and black wavy hair. His clothes looked normal, but   |
| displayed taste and elegance. Everything about him looked strikingly  |
| perfect. The man was surrounded by a beautiful white glow, especially |
| around his head and chest. The light seemed to come not from him, but |
| from the air that surrounded him. He glided down the stairs without   |
| moving his legs. He actually floated in the air slightly above the    |
| level of the stairs. Then he moved to the counter and stood first in  |
| the queue. As soon as he got there, everything started to happen      |
| normally again. People continued their actions from the point when    |
| they had been suspended in motion. Everything looked as though        |
| nothing had happened. The man bought a glass of fruit juice and sat   |
| at the last free chair available at a 12-person table. He             |
| acknowledged the witnesses attention with a smile. They wanted to     |
| talk to him and find out more about his unusual arrival, but there    |
| was no easy access to his chair. So they decided to leave the coffee  |
| bar and wait for him upstairs at the only way out. After five minutes |
| of waiting and not seeing him pass, Richard went back down to         |
| discover that he had gone, yet there was no other exit from the       |
| coffee bar. The group was also quite surprised to find that their     |
| various ailments, which included the flu and a migraine headache,     |
| were gone. About six weeks later they spotted him again. He stood at  |
| the top of the stairs at the same coffee shop again, intent on        |
| entering the cafe. He moved his head in their direction as a kind of  |
| greeting. His clothes were the same, except that this time he was     |
| surrounded by a faint green glow. When he appeared nothing actually   |
| happened. He walked down as normal people do (his steps somehow       |
| lighter than normal humans) unnoticed by anyone but the witnesses. He |
| again bought a glass of fruit juice and again sat in the same place.  |
| A few times he acknowledged their attention by a friendly look. This  |
| time they decided to interrupt him and find out who he was, so they   |
| wanted to stand up and get closer, but none of them could move. When  |
| finally they did manage to stand up, they directed themselves out of  |
| the coffee bar seemingly against their will. Pat tried desperately to |
| turn back, but her efforts failed. After a short while Pat decided to |
| return back inside the coffee bar, only to find that the mysterious   |
| stranger had already gone. They never saw him again. (Source: Albert  |

| 1975 - On the same day as the two incidents above, a giant hairy      |
| biped was seen sitting in the window of a hog shed in Preble County,  |
| Ohio. watching the ten-year-old witness, who had had a previous UFO   |
| encounter. The boy ran to get his mother, but when they returned the  |
| creature had gone. (Source: Donald Worley, Proceedings of the CUFOS   |

| 1976 - On this evening in Savanna, Oklahoma three boys watched a      |
| white disc-shaped object with beams of light search through some      |
| woods at a low altitude. The air felt warm and they heard a "Whoosh!" |
| sound. (Sources: McAlester Democrat, July 15, 1976; APRO Bulletin,    |

| 1977 - At 8:30 p.m. Adrian De Olmos Ordones, age 42, was resting on   |
| the balcony of his house in Quebradillas, Puerto Rico when he saw a   |
| very small figure across the road. It was about 40 feet away, and it  |
| slipped under a farm's barbed wire fence and walked toward a lamp     |
| post only 20 feet away. The little man was only three and a half feet |
| tall and wore a green garment that seemed to be inflated with air. He |
| also wore a large metallic helmet with a glass face plate encasing    |
| the head that came to a slight point on top. The helmet was           |
| surmounted by a short extension with a luminous point on top. On the  |
| being's back was a box like a knapsack. Sr. De Olmos also observed    |
| that he had only four fingers, that his feet were webbed like a       |
| duck's, and that he had a short tail, not long enough to reach the    |
| ground. In his right hand he carried a small shiny object. The        |
| witness told his daughter bring him a pencil and paper so he could    |
| make a sketch, but by mistake she turned on the balcony light. When   |
| she did the being ran back to the fence, passed under it, and then    |
| stopped and put his hand on his belt. Two red and two blue lights     |
| appeared on the backpack with two downward jets of sparks came out,   |
| accompanied by a sound like an electric drill. The being ascended 10  |
| feet into the air and flew horizontally to a grove of trees 150 yards |
| away. Mr. Olmos, his family, and neighbors watched the lights of the  |
| figure as he moved about the trees for 10 minutes, in company with    |
| another light. During this period the cattle on the adjacent farm     |
| "went crazy," running about and bellowing. The next day humanoid      |
| tracks were found and photographed at the site. A neighbor woman had  |
| seen a luminous object descend into the woods two days before.        |

| area. He had neither eyelashes nor other facial nor body hair, his    |
| head was unusually large, while his ears were very small. He moved    |
| very slowly with short little steps and was wearing normal human      |
| clothing. The next evening the same or a similar entity appeared      |

| his bedroom door open and someone walking in the living room. Soon an |
| alien figure came to his bedroom door and entered, followed by two    |
| more. The beings were basically humanoid, gray in color, with large   |
| black oval-shaped eyes. One was taller than the others and he was     |
| holding a glowing blue rod, which apparently paralyzed the witness.   |
| He telepathically told the boy that they were going to cure an        |
| infection that was brought to Earth by another alien race. They       |
| inserted a long tube down the witness esophagus and through it        |
| injected a liquid. He was then able to move and was told to follow    |
| them. Outside he was taken aboard a landed disc-shaped object, where  |
| he was scanned and examined. Later he was brought back to his room.   |

| 2002 - A scout troop with their scoutmaster saw 26 orange objects fly |
| from south to north slowly, in single file, over Browns Plains,       |
| Queensland shortly after 10 p.m. The objects were described as        |
| balloon shaped, and glowed orange. There was no sound, and there were |
| no navigation lights on the objects. (Source: Sheryl Gottschall       |

| 2003 - The witness and her mother were driving home down a road in    |
| Ashland, Kentucky at around 10:00 p.m. when they saw a moving light   |
| in the sky. They first assumed it was a plane, but then it started    |
| moving faster. It sped up to an unbelievable speed and shot back and  |
| forth between wo stars, and then stopped as if it had spotted them.   |
| At this point their car stopped running. The UFO had disappeared but  |
| they had a feeling it was still present, watching them. It            |
| reappeared, this time closer. They next saw 20 to 30 lights zooming   |
| across the sky. These all stopped at the same star in the sky as the  |
| first one, and they all vanished in a bright flash. They heard no     |
| sound during any of this. The daughter reports that she then fainted, |
| but her mother continued to watch. She said the light got bigger and  |
| brighter, and in the midst of the light her mother claims to have     |
| seen dark figures carrying strange instruments. When the daughter     |
| woke up, the car was on the side of the road about 20 feet from where |
| it had been. About half an hour had passed, but it seemed to have     |
| been much longer. Her mother was now passed out and outside of the    |
| car. She appeared unharmed, but she did have a scar on the back of    |
| her neck. The mother convinced herself that the mark was from the     |
| back of the car door when she "fell" out of the car. For subsequent   |
| nights the pair have seen strange lights in the sky at night, dashing |
| across the sky. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting      |
