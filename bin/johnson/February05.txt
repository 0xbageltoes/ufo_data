| 1883 - A huge fireball flew over Lake Glasfjorden near Arvika, Sweden |
| towards the northwest for 18 seconds. It turned toward the southeast  |
| and zigzagged through the sky for an additional 50 seconds. (Source:  |

| 1934 - On this evening an unknown mysterious airplane made an         |
| emergency landing on Fager Mountain in Malsev, Troms, Norway. Two men |
| were seen clearing away snow, and the engine noise was heard          |
| throughout the valley. Parallel marks in found in the snow, 75 meters |
| in length, as well as two sets of footprints. (Sources: John A. Keel, |

| 1950 - Seven people witnessed two cylindrical objects maneuvering in  |
| the sky at 5:10 p.m. near Falmouth Airport on Cape Cod,               |
| Massachusetts. A fireball dropped from one of them, then they climbed |
| into the western sky and disappeared. Listed as a Project Blue Book   |

| 1963 - On or about this date a student, Anastasio Lenven, saw an      |
| object land on the school grounds in Asuncion, Paraguay. In a         |
| separate observation, several residents, including an official of the |
| Ministry of the Interior, saw an object flying at very high speed     |
| over the city. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A        |

| 1967 - At 1:45 a.m. a boomerang-shaped object was seen for six        |
| minutes by seven musicians and five other observers in Oakland City,  |
| Indiana. The UFO flew off to the northwest. (Source: Francis L.       |

| 1967 - On this evening Timothy Johnson, a 14-year-old teenager in     |
| Hilliards, Ohio heard his dog barking and a strange noise, and then   |
| saw an 75-foot long ovoid object descend with tripod legs extended.   |
| The UFO had a rotating pattern of lights and came down to 30 feet     |
| over some railroad tracks, then landed near a school. It made a       |
| steady humming sound. From an elevator-like shaft came five or six    |
| tall, human-looking figures wearing black robes, who placed small     |
| spheres around the craft. A man walked up to them and appeared to     |
| speak with the entities. The teen was then noticed and the man ran    |
| after him, catching him by the back of the neck and causing burn      |
| marks. The man next dragged Timothy almost to the craft when his      |
| captors suddenly became panic-stricken, dropped him, hurriedly        |
| gathered up the spheres, and reboarded the craft, which took off      |
| rapidly. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, May-June 1967, p. 6;       |

| 1967 - At 9:45 p.m. M. Louis Monin, age 49, was outside his house in  |
| Sauvigny-les-Bois, L'Yonne, France when he saw an intensely yellow    |
| luminous ovoid object coming at very low altitude over a nearby       |
| cemetery. He called his 17-year-old granddaughter Marie Solange to    |
| watch it. The fat cigar-shaped object approached, then oscillated and |
| turned red-orange, and finally landed in Monin's garden, 110 feet     |
| away from them. It was about 60 feet long and 20 feet high. At each   |
| end of the cigar was a jet of "flames," directed obliquely downward,  |
| and a crackling noise could be heard. Next, a stout little man,       |
| 3.5-4.0 feet tall, appeared standing beside the object. Monin and his |
| granddaughter immediately went back into the house to call his wife,  |
| but when the three of them came out again the little man was gone and |
| the UFO now appeared as a red-luminous ball about 25 feet in          |
| diameter. This ball took off and was soon lost from view. The         |
| observation lasted five minutes, and no landing traces were found in  |
| the garden. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |

| 1968 - Nicholas Rinaldi, age 38, a commercial artist, observed a      |
| large cigar-shaped object at low level in rural Cromwell, Connecticut |
| at 8:25 p.m.  He tried to approach it in his car but it flew away.    |
| This was his third low-level sighting of a dark cigar-shaped UFO      |
| since his first spectacular close encounter on January 24, 1967 with  |
| 19 other separate witnesses. (Source: Donald A. Johnson, on-site       |

| 1970 - On this day a spinning domed disc-shaped object, glowing       |
| orange and blue, approached three observers at Chesterfield           |
| Inlet, Northwest Territory, Canada to within 50-60 feet. The motors   |
| of their three snowmobiles quit working. The disc shot straight up    |
| vertically and was gone. (Source: UNICAT, case # 133, citing L.       |
| Couvrette).                                                           |

| 1971 - On this afternoon two young men, P. Aliranta and E. J. Sneck,  |
| were working in the woods in Kangaskyla, Kinnula, Finland when Mr.    |
| Aliranta noticed a 15 foot wide metallic saucer-shaped object descend |
| and land on four thin legs in a clearing 50 feet away. After it       |
| landed a short entity just under 3 feet tall glided to the ground     |
| from an opening in the underside. It was dressed in a green one-piece |
| "diver's suit" and wore a helmet with a circular faceplate. It        |
| approached the young men, walking on top of the deep snow, and        |
| Aliranta moved toward it with his power chain saw in hand. Through    |
| three windows in the upper part of the object three more entities     |
| could be seen. The humanoid retreated from Aliranta and was           |
| levitating into the object from underneath when the young man grabbed |
| it by the heel of its boot with his bare hand. He found that touching |
| it burned like a hot iron and he had to let go at once. As soon as    |
| the being was back inside the object it ascended with a slight        |
| buzzing or humming sound. Both men felt stiff all over and had        |
| difficulty moving. Four landing leg marks and small footprints were   |
| left behind in the snow. (Sources: Tapani Kuningas, FSR Vol. 17 # 5;  |

| 1972 - In Evillers, France a red disc with blurry edges flew silently |
| toward the north at a steady speed until gone from view. (Source:     |

| 1976 - Two women saw a dark domed disc with red and white lights      |
| through a second floor bedroom window at their home in France. Inside |
| the transparent dome they could see two human like figures. They had  |
| tight fitting hoods on their heads. The UFO flew away over an         |
| orchard. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of  |

| 1978 - Thirty miles east of Baladonia, Western Australia a            |
| 30-year-old truck driver was paced by a UFO on the Eyre Highway at    |
| around one o'clock in the morning. At some point during the incident, |
| a brightly lighted object passed him, and then a small dull light     |
| pursued him for 30 minutes, retreating only when other traffic        |
| approached. He then had three hours of lost memory. The only memory   |
| he had was of a fragmentary recollection of some conversation with an |
| entity about an invention. At sometime after four a.m. he found       |
| himself a few miles outside the town, with most of his clothing       |
| scattered about the truck cab. (Source: Bill Chalker, MUFON UFO       |
| Journal,  August 1980, p. 5).                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - Thirty-year-old Julio Fernandez and his English Pointer dog    |
| Mus were driving in his car to do some early morning hunting for      |
| hares. They were driving towards Soria province, Spain. At about 4:30 |
| a.m. Julio stopped to drink coffee and anis at a wayside bar known as |
| the Hostal 113, beside the highway on the outskirts of Algora. At     |
| 5:45 a.m. Julio left the bar and drove on, half an hour later passing |
| Medicaneli. Suddenly he "knew" that he had to be at a certain         |
| location 15 km further on, and put his foot down on the accelerator.  |
| At this point his conscious recollection stopped.                     |
|                                                                       |
| Later under hypnotic regression Julio remembered driving his car when |
| for no accountable reason he suddenly braked. From this point on the  |
| car seemed to act of its own accord, reversing, and then coming to a  |
| halt after having entered a narrow dirt trail backwards. Then the     |
| engine stopped, the lights went out, and the radio cassette player    |
| ceased to work. It was as though the electrical current had been      |
| completely severed, because the new battery no longer charged and the |
| plugs no longer sparked properly.                                     |
|                                                                       |
| Mus started growling, so as a precaution Julio took his Winchester    |
| single barrel, semi-automatic shotgun out of the trunk and loaded it  |
| with its maximum of five carriages. It was then that he caught sight  |
| of two somehat human looking beings coming down the road. They halted |
| only one and a half meters from him. They wore seamless one-piece     |
| pastel green coveralls that reached to the feet and gave off a very   |
| faint luminosity. Their uniforms had no zippers nor openings and      |
| gathered at the waists. The suits were sufficiently tight fitting for |
| their muscles to show. They wore pale yellow cowls or hoods, leaving  |
| only the face uncovered.                                              |
|                                                                       |
| The men were about two meters tall and had extremely broad shoulders, |
| with powerful dorsal muscles showing prominently, narrow waists, and  |
| they seemed unusually athletic. Among features that set them apart    |
| from ordinary human beings were the exceptionally long arms and       |
| hands, large crania and very large eyes. Julio felt a sense of peace  |
| and calm envelop him. When they addressed him he at first thought     |
| they were using speech, but later realized that their lips did not    |
| move, so he assumed they communicated telepathically with him.        |
|                                                                       |
| They asked him to calm down and to follow them. Julio obeyed, taking  |
| along his dog and the gun. Julio was then led to a huge               |
| mushroom-shaped craft that had been concealed behind two hills in the |
| bottom of a small valley, though hovering four meters above the       |
| ground. It was shaped like an inverted soup plate, had a matt,        |
| silvery metallic color, and appeared to have a diameter of about 60   |
| or 70 meters and a height of some 15 to 20 meters.                    |
|                                                                       |
| Arriving underneath the central area of the craft, Julio noticed its  |
| had a completely smooth surface, as though molded in one piece, with  |
| no rivets or fittings. At this point he became aware of a powerful    |
| odor of pine, or possibly ozone, a smell also detectable on board.    |
| Julio's gun and knife levitated upwards into the craft. A smooth      |
| metallic cylinder then emerged silently from the center of the disc,  |
| stopping just above the ground. It was about four meters in height    |
| and 2.5 meters in diameter. A door, sliding upwards, opened in the    |
| descended cylinder's wall, revealing a small compartment lit by a     |
| strange white light coming from everywhere that Julio found           |
| disturbing.                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| By now frightened, he hesitated before stepping through the door into |
| the shaft. The dog refused to follow him so Julio had to drag him in. |
| What was now an interior elevator rose silently, stopping at an       |
| entrance to a corridor, where they alighted. Further along was        |
| another corridor, with two metallic doors, about 2.5 meters high. The |
| whole appearance of the place was the most clinically aseptic. The    |
| walls were continuous with the ceiling, being joined by a gentle      |
| curve. Continuing along the circular passage, he came to a small      |
| ladder. The ladder looked like the steps of a swimming pool, with a   |
| very shiny finish and a cylindrical handrail. One of the beings led   |
| the way up, scaling the steps in two jumps with phenomenal agility.   |
| With some difficulty Julio followed, carrying the dog under his right |
| arm and with the gun over his shoulder. He noticed the railing felt   |
| cold. At the top of the ladder was another individual who assured     |
| Julio that he had nothing to worry about. The "flight deck" was about |
| 15 meters wide and five meters high. In the center stood a kind of    |
| console. It had some resemblance to an electronic organ. It was about |
| 2.5 meters wide and had set metal footings with a transparent screen. |
| The control table itself stood upon a circular platform. Elsewhere    |
| stood three smaller consoles set around the circumference of the      |
| room, in front of which were high conical seats. Also set close to    |
| the surrounding wall was a large square lead gray panel and a         |
| metallic rectangular table.                                           |
|                                                                       |
| Set around the dome at intervals of about one and a half meters were  |
| rectangular windows made out of something like smoked glass.          |
| Meanwhile, his dog Mus had been around the flight deck, sniffing at   |
| everything, including at least one of the aliens, who reacted in a    |
| surprised manner. When Julio called out to his dog, the sound of its  |
| name evoked surprise among the entities. On asking where his hosts    |
| originated, Julio received an unintelligible mental response,         |
| including the expression "three seven, squared."                      |
|                                                                       |
| The aliens indicated that they would like to examine his dog and take |
| blood samples from him. Mus was carried to a rectangular table and    |
| blood from his paw was extracted using a fairly normal looking        |
| syringe. The men then communicated to Julio that they wanted to       |
| examine him and placed him behind the screen on the rectangular       |
| table. After a few minutes he was given to understand that was all to |
| be required of him. But in subsequent recollections---which proved    |
| harder to recover and which clearly he found disturbing---Julio said  |
| that numerous samples had been extracted from him, including blood,   |
| semen, urine, spinal fluid, saliva, and gastric juices. He believed   |
| that two women, similar facially to the men, were also onboard at the |
| time. Julio was ordered to sit on one of the seats at the central     |
| console. Next to Julio sat one of the crewmembers who raised the left |
| armrest and nimbly fingered several silvery buttons. The seat began   |
| to revolve along a track in the central console. Julio continued to   |
| sit beside the crewmember, his dog and gun at his side. Suddenly, a   |
| brief, piercing whistle was heard, producing a slight commotion on    |
| the flight deck.                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| The tallest of the three crew members quickly headed toward one of    |
| the consoles and all three studied the remote viewing screens in      |
| front of them. An image appeared of an older looking man. The crew    |
| members began talking among themselves. The man on the screen seemed  |
| to be a superior and spoke first, and then the others conversed with  |
| him. The language sounded harsh to Julio, he described it as sounding |
| like a mixture between German and Korean. They seemed to spit out the |
| words as they were talking, and some of the sounds were like coughs.  |
| The image disappeared from the viewing screen and Julio found himself |
| back in telepathic communication with his hosts. Hectic activity      |
| ensued; as crewmembers started desperately pushing buttons. The       |
| central platform began to rotate in a counterclockwise direction,     |
| halting when the control console came in line with what Julio assumed |
| was a "computer." Another whistling sound could be heard, from which  |
| point Julio seems to have passed out. After another whistle Julio was |
| awake again. The crewmembers showed interest in Julio's gun and,      |
| passing it around among themselves, asked him about its use. A heavy  |
| smoker, Julio lit a cigarette. The men asked if they might take one   |
| away for study and deposited it into the same cylinder. Soon Julio    |
| was escorted to the lift cylinder, the metal door rose and he was     |
| back outside, in bright sunlight.                                     |

| He staggered back to his car, where his dog awaited him, having run   |
| ahead. The car engine now worked, and he drove away without bothering |
| to look back at the disc. Among the information imparted              |
| telepathically to Julio by the UFOnauts was that other, shorter       |
| beings were coming here who employed less ethical methods. These      |
| others, it was explained, "are engaged in probing and programming"    |
| the minds of those humans whom they have contacted or kidnapped.      |
| Julio Fernandez was killed in a car crash in 1992, coincidentally     |
| near the site where he claimed to have been abducted. (Sources: Jane  |
