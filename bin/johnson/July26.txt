| 1948 - Six people in Chamblee, Georgia briefly saw a luminous         |
| football-shaped UFO that glowed, bobbed, weaved, and maneuvered over  |
| the town at 9:30 p.m. It flew off rapidly toward the south at an      |
| estimated 5,000 feet altitude. The Air Force explanation was that     |
| they saw a meteor. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in       |

| 1952 - In Washington, D.C. on this date, from 8:00 p.m. until after   |
| midnight, radar operators at several airports tracked many            |
| unidentified blips by radar all over the Washington area, at varying  |
| speeds. Airline pilots reported spotting unidentified lights during   |
| this period as well. Sharp UFO targets on the ARTC radar at National  |
| Airport at 9:08 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. Visual sightings were reported by  |
| civilians four times, near Herndon, Virginia and from Maryland. A     |
| National Airlines flight near Andrews AFB saw a UFO "directly over    |
| the airliner."(Sources: Project Blue Book files; Don Berliner,        |

| 1962 - At 8:30 p.m. near Darana, Argentina a 17-year-old motorcyclist |
| saw a weird creature on the side of the road. His cycle would not     |
| steer correctly; instead, it drove right up to the creature and       |
| stopped. The creature was six feet tall, with a head like a melon and |
| three eyes. It grabbed the youth's scarf, turned around and walked    |
| away like a robot, leaving deep tracks in the dirt. The youth saw a   |
| white light low in the sky in the direction the creature was walking. |
| He then drove away quickly. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports      |

| 1965 - At 9:35 p.m. three atmospheric astronomers studying            |
| noctilucent clouds at the Ogra Observatory, Latvia sighted a bright   |
| light in the west. Through a telescope they saw it was a 325 foot in  |
| diameter disc-shape with three spheres orbiting it. The UFOs          |
| gradually receded, but were seen at an estimated altitude of 60       |
| miles. (Sources:  Felix Zigel, Flying Saucers, June 1968, p. 25; APRO |

| 1965 - A teenager, Adilon Azevedo, and others in Carazinho, Rio       |
| Grande do Sul state, Brazil who fled the scene, saw two UFOs at       |
| ground level. They were about three meters in diameter, 1.5 meters    |
| high, and contained five occupants who wore luminous helmets and      |
| spoke among themselves in an unfamiliar language. One of the beings   |
| had a bright object in its hand. The witness experienced headaches    |
| for five days following the close encounter. (Sources: Coral & Jim    |

| 1967 - At 8:00 p.m. a multi-colored elliptical object flew over       |
| Seacliff, South Australia making a humming noise. Eighteen hours      |
| later, at 11:15 p.m. in Rowley, Massachusetts, R. Ricker witnessed an |
| orange UFO that made a whining sound. (Source: Project Blue Book      |

| 1968 - On this afternoon around 3:00 p.m. two young boys riding their |
| bicycles near the airport in Riviere Du Loup, Quebec stopped by the   |
| hangar and sighted a short three-foot tall, gray-skinned humanoid.    |
| The humanoid ran away and was joined by a second similar being. Both  |
| moved with stiff-legged motion. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |

| 1972 - In a continuing series of strange encounters at Cradle Hill in |
| Wiltshire, England Robert Mason and Stephen Barnett had reached a     |
| field beyond the copse at 9:15 p.m. while it was still light out. A   |
| short while later they both looked back towards a barn and caught     |
| sight of a figure, resembling that of a small man or boy, in the      |
| clearing just in front of the barn. Upon being noticed the figure     |
| dodged out of sight behind the side of the barn. Stephen looked       |
| through binoculars to see if the being would pass the line of trees   |
| leading back down the road to the gate, but saw nothing. They         |
| searched the copse but found no one. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,      |

| 1993 - On this night a witness in Plymouth, Scotland reported seeing  |
| a dark object hovering close to the ground. It had four bright lights |
| on its top and multicolored lights below. It illuminated the ground   |
| with a red glow. Several figures were seen moving around, apparently  |
| in front of the object. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact  |

| 2001 - At 9:50 p.m. two witnesses saw a luminous figure walking on    |
| the side of the road while driving on the road to Gerena, Sevilla,    |
| Spain. It seemed to move clumsily about in an attempt to enter the    |
| nearby field. The frightened witnesses accelerated away from the      |
| area. They described the figure as about two meters to 2.15 meters in |
| height, strongly build, and robust looking. It emitted a bluish-white |
| light. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2001,    |

| 2004 - During a power failure in Kerman, California that occurred at  |
| 1:20 a.m. Ms. E. B. was looking for a flashlight when the power came  |
| back on. Earlier that night around 12:30 a.m. she had seen an unusual |
| light in the sky and now went out to look in the sky where she had    |
| seen it. What she saw was a glowing silvery man-like figure that was  |
| flying above the neighborhood at a height of 21 to 24 meters. The     |
| figure flew at a reasonably fast pace. The moment she saw it she      |
| screamed and ran back inside, locking the door behind her, but she    |
| continued to watch it through a window. The figure went behind some   |
| trees and when it emerged on the other side it shot off towards the   |
| north at the speed of a rocket. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |
