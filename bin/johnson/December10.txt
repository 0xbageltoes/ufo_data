| 1896 - At 6:00 p.m. in 1896, in both Battle Mountain and Elko, Nevada a      |
| strange light was seen flying to the west. Moving too slowly to be a  |
| meteor, it suddenly shot straight up through the atmosphere. (Source: |

| 1952 - On this day in 1952 the Civilian Aeronautics Administration issued    |
| its report explaining the radar blips recorded over Washington, D.C.  |
| in July and August as temperature inversions. Ironically, on that     |
| same day unidentified bogeys appeared on radar screens over at least  |
| three US air bases. At 9:20 a.m. a UFO appeared on the radarscope at  |
| Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina. It stayed in position eight      |
| miles south of the base for eight hours. At Ladd AFB near Fairbanks,  |
| Alaska Project Blue Book explained a brief sighting by two airmen as  |
| a meteor. But at 7:15 p.m. an F-94 fighter jet with a two-man crew    |
| flying near Odessa, Washington had a UFO encounter that was not so    |
| easily explained. They sighted a large round, white UFO and obtained  |
| a radar lock on the target. The UFO reversed direction almost         |
| instantly, did a chandelle in front of the jet, rushed head-on toward |
| them, then stopped, and pulled up. Even though they were flying at    |
| 600 mph they were unable to close with the object. (Sources: Doubt    |

| 1953 - In 1953, two rings of white smoke appeared over Seymour, Indiana.     |
| These unusual smoke rings had lights around the perimeter. They       |
| seemed to stand in place, then made abrupt turns. (Source: Loren      |

| 1954 - In Lisbon, Portugal at around 2:45 p.m. local time a witness   |
| reported seeing a flying silver ball expelling a blue flame for 10    |
| minutes. (Source: Victor Lourenco, PORTUGAT UFO computer catalog,     |

| 1954 - Several daylight disc sightings and two humanoid encounters, one at   |
| night, occurred in Venezuela on this date in 1954. A photograph of    |
| five objects was taken in El Tigre. At 6:30 p.m. a doctor driving     |
| with his father in Floresta, Venezuela stopped his car to watch two   |
| little men run into some bushes. Shortly afterward they saw a         |
| luminous, disc-shaped object take off from behind the bushes at a     |
| high speed and dart off into the sky with a sharp "sizzling" sound.   |
| Later that same night in Chico-Cerro de las Tres Torres, Venezuela    |
| two hunters, Lorenzo Flores and Jesus Gomez, saw a luminous object    |
| "like two washbowls put together." It was three meters wide and       |
| hovering just two feet off the ground. Flames emanated from the base  |
| of the object. Four hairy dwarfs, three feet tall, emerged and        |
| grabbed Gomez and tried to drag him toward their craft. Flores struck |
| one with his gun butt, but it had no effect and felt like striking    |
| rock. The wooden rifle butt cracked from the impact. Gomez fainted    |
| from fright, and both young men were scratched and bruised. When they |
| told their story to the police it was obvious that their shirts had   |
| been shredded into ribbons. (Sources: Coral Lorenzen, Flying Saucers: |

| 1956 - Three teenagers sighted a round, silver football that hovered  |
| silently over a Railroad Station in Tsurumi, Japan for a couple of    |
| minutes, then shot straight up. (Source: Y. Matsumura, APRO Bulletin, |

| 1957 - At 6:00 p.m. a glowing white cigar-shaped object with a red    |
| trail, estimated to be 100 meters long, was sighted from the Boso     |
| Peninsula in Japan. It shot off to the south at 1,100 km/h. (Source:  |

| 1957 - In 1957, a pilot reported seeing three luminous objects cross the sky |
| at 20,000 feet altitude in Bogotá, Colombia. At 1:00 p.m. in          |
| Jabuticabal, Brazil a four-meter long "watermelon" landed in a field, |
| only 20 meters from a farmer. The grass was crushed at the landing    |
| site. In Barra do Pirai, Brazil at 10 p.m., a 10-meter wide luminous  |
| disc descended low over a roadway. When a truck turned on its         |
| headlights it shot away extremely fast. At 8:45 p.m. three            |
| crewmembers of a Mexicana Airline flight reported witnessing a round  |
| UFO emitting rays of light near Lagos, Mexico in the state of         |
| Queretaro. It departed by shooting straight up into the sky.          |

| 1963 - At 11:30 p.m. two airmen on the ground at RAF Cosford, England |
| watched a dome-shaped object land behind a hangar, then search the    |
| ground and area with a green light beam. (Source: Timothy Good, Above |

| 1967 - Many independent witnesses at 7:30 a.m. in the city of         |
| Bucharest, Romania observed a sphere with many antennae hovering over |
| a factory for 15 minutes. (Sources: Ion Hobana & Julien Weverbergh,   |

| 1968 - On this day in Olleros de Pisuerga,Spain a deltoid object was  |
| observed along the roadside, emitting a strong yellow and green       |
| light. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, A Catalogue of 200      |
| Type-I Events from Spain and Portugal, p. 22, case 96; Larry Hatch, U |

| 1968 - This event took place about one-quarter mile from the          |
| hydroelectric dam on Lake Secession, near Abbeville, South            |
| Carolina at 12:30 a.m. A man was alone in his lake front cottage when |
| he heard a whirring, dynamo sound coming from outside. He also saw an |
| amber-colored flashing light reflecting off the trees outside, so he  |
| walked outdoors and saw a disc-shaped UFO directly overhead, not more |
| than ten feet up. The craft was silvery metallic looking, saucer      |
| shaped with a smaller dome on top, 35 feet in diameter, about 10 feet |
| high, and it had four sets of lights which bathed the surrounding     |
| area in amber light. The witness was terrified and unable to move.    |
| After hovering overhead, the craft backed away some 20 feet and       |
| descended to where it was almost at eye level with the witness, who   |
| was standing on a deck on stilts above the lake, 8 feet off the       |
| ground. The dome had a round porthole, but he could not see if there  |
| was anyone or anything inside. Nevertheless, he "knew" that someone   |
| was there and was looking at him. The craft next rose up, coming      |
| directly forward and hovering overhead again. The experience lasted   |
| an estimated five minutes, although there were gaps in his memory as  |
| to what exactly happened next. The craft finally sped off             |
| effortlessly about 200 yards, and hovered momentarily over the lake.  |
| It then sped off at a 45 degree angle into the sky towards the        |
| southwest at a tremendous speed, quickly vanishing from sight.        |

| 1972 - A witness in Skelton, West Virginia reported observing a 10    |
| foot wide or large glowing sphere descend slowly to the ground at     |
| 9:30 p.m. A shallow 8 foot crater was found at the landing site the   |
| next day. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case # 9670;     |

| 1973 - B. R. Arroyo was driving in his car around 2:00 a.m. when he   |
| was paced by an ovoid UFO at low altitude near Sabana Grande, Puerto  |
| Rico for two minutes. (Source: D. N. Mansell, The UFO Register,       |

| 1973 - Also on this day in 1973, two 11-year-old boys in Chula Vista, San    |
| Diego County, California spotted a flying saucer from their school    |
| classroom. The bottom of the object was "real shiny like it was       |
| glowing." In Watsonville, Santa Cruz County, California early that    |
| morning at 5:50 a.m. a UFO with red lights on top and silver lights   |
| on the bottom moved gradually north after remaining stationary for 10 |
| minutes. The UFO was viewed through binoculars, and reportedly had a  |
| wide red band that rotated around the middle of the craft's body      |
| (Source: Ted Phillips, newspaper clippings, Chula Vista Star &        |

| 1973 - About four hours later (6:20 p.m. local time) in               |
| Ouzoues-sur-Loire, France a 50-year-old couple, several other         |
| witnesses, and gendarmes watched a silent, 5 meter tall cone-shaped   |
| UFO only 20 meters from the ground fly away toward the southwest. Two |
| hours after that, at about 8:30 p.m. in Hochries, Germany near the    |
| Austrian-Bavarian border, Friedrich Lennartz, age 33, and Peter       |
| Zettel, age 29, had a close encounter of the second kind when a       |
| multi-colored, ovoid UFO responded to a red signal rocket they had    |
| fired to get the UFO's attention. The UFO had been hovering near a    |
| mountain ski resort with the pointed end up. Its size was estimated   |
| as nine meters in diameter and 12-14 meters tall. The top portion     |
| looked like a yellow dome. Four rows of colored lights (red, green,   |
| blue, and white) rotated counterclockwise around the lower portion.   |
| They experienced loud static on their short wave radio as the UFO     |
| changed color to a dazzling red, made a 90-degree turn, and sped      |
| toward the witnesses, traveling 5-6 kilometers in 10 seconds. It      |
| hovered close to their mountain for two more hours as their dogs      |
| whimpered to be let into the cabin. The UFO then shot upward at a     |
| steep angle at "breakneck speed." (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO      |

| 1976 - In 1976 two humanoid encounters occurred in Europe. At 1:30 a.m. in   |
| Ponte de Lima, Portugal, a 2-meter tall dark figure, wearing a        |
| one-piece robe that fell to the ground in a straight, featureless     |
| line, and having no signs of arms or legs, glided over the street in  |
| front of two school teachers, a married couple in their fifties.      |
| Their dog hid behind them, then retreated. The figure was in view for |
| five minutes, the entire time it took them to walk to the man's       |
| sister's house. (Source: David Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT case     |
| 1810, citing Joaquim Fernandes, Insolito magazine, May 1978, pp.      |
| 14-16).                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1976 - A complex abduction scenario occurred that evening in central France. |
| Antonia (last name withheld), 68, was driving to her home near        |
| Limoges. She had entered a small woods that was strangely illuminated |
| by a white light. When she turned a corner in the road that light     |
| became a lenticular mass of brilliant light about 30 feet wide and 10 |
| feet high, resting on the road ahead. When 20 meters from it she      |
| stopped and tried to back up. Instead the car was pulled forward onto |
| the right shoulder of the road. In the midst of the light she felt    |
| her head forcibly turned to the right. She perceived an arm appear    |
| that described an arc through the air from front to back. All at once |
| the lights went out, and her car motor and headlights died. She heard |
| a slight click, and a sound like a sliding door opening. Two white    |
| luminous rectangular shapes about a meter in height seemed to appear  |
| in front of the hood of her car. She then felt two electric shocks    |
| running from head to toe, and lost consciousness.                     |
|                                                                       |
| She awoke to the sound of a pistol-shot and something striking        |
| against her car. She thought she heard a voice say in French, "Oh, we |
| have killed her!" Her outside mirror on the driver side had been      |
| broken off. She tried to get out of the car but had no sensation in   |
| her legs. The sensation in them began to return, but her feet were    |
| slewed over toward the right side of the car, where they had not been |
| before. Looking around, she realized the car was now about 100 meters |
| beyond the place she had lost consciousness. She turned on her        |
| headlights, and saw a metallic gray flying saucer hovering motionless |
| 3 meters above the road, 3-4 meters ahead of her. It had two lights   |
| sunk into the lower portion, and also two darker 8" squares, and was  |
| at least 30 feet wide. Her car engine suddenly started up             |
| spontaneously. Immediately the UFO's lights went out and it silently  |
| took off. She felt the car buffeted with a shock wave as it left.     |
| Antonia drove home, arriving 55 minutes later that she should have.   |
| Her dogs shunned her, and she could not sleep that night.             |
|                                                                       |
| (Continued.) In the morning she discovered a tear in her skin between her vagina   |
| and anus. On washing out her genital area she found that her vagina   |
| was stuffed with an earth-like substance. A vaginal infection         |
| subsequently resulted from this. Her memory of the event, including   |
| the missing time, gradually returned. For two weeks she suffered from |
| insomnia, and vivid images repeatedly came into her mind.             |
|                                                                       |
| She recalled being in a circular room, dark except at the center.     |
| There was no visible source for the light. In front of her, suspended |
| from the two ends by metal pipes from the ceiling, was a green table  |
| in the shape of a half-cylinder, convex side up, about five feet      |
| long. She was forcibly placed and twisted about into various extreme  |
| and painful positions upon this "vaulting horse" ("cheval d'arcon").  |
| Two figures stood looking at her. Not very tall, they wore            |
| close-fitting coveralls. One had a narrow, black mustache, wore a     |
| black skullcap, and his uniform had an "officer's collar." They had   |
| elongated, slanted eyes. The one with the cap smiled "tenderly" at    |
| her; the other looked evil and malevolent. She could also hear others |
| "murmuring" that she could not see. She remembered seeing a hand      |
| holding an instrument like a toy windmill, a spiral vane on a stick   |
| that had sparkling points of light. In the dark wall were visible two |
| dimly lit, small portholes, less than 8 inches in diameter. Later,    |
| she felt herself standing, being moved about as if someone was        |
| dressing her, then being thrown down onto something hard.             |
|                                                                       |
| When Antonia had her car's mirror replaced, the mechanic was          |
| surprised to observe that her car was strongly magnetized. The        |
| investigator, who spent a great deal of time working with the         |
| abductee, rejects fabrication or psychopathology as explanations for  |
| her experience. (Source: David Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:         |

| flew slowly at ground level 80 meters away. It had odd looking lights |
| on its top. At 8:00 a.m. in Legnano, Italy a single witness in a car  |
| reported that a bright red ovoid object hovered in a upright          |
| orientation just half a meter above the ground, only 20 meters away.  |
| It then paced the car for two minutes. (Source: Maurizio Verga,       |

| 1977 - A complex abduction case with one hour of missing time         |
| happened near Limoges, France at 6:30 p.m. The percipient was driving |
| in a car when it experienced EM ignition interference effects. This   |
| was followed by an episode of lost time; what was recalled was        |
| an abduction with a physical exam by several humanoids. The witness   |
| recovered consciousness in the car, and the car restarted             |
| itself. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 317).                   |

| 1977 - A 22-year-old man was out walking his dog in Shotton, Clwyd,   |
| Wales at around midnight when his dog drew his attention to a tall    |
| white figure standing behind a fence. The figure was about eight feet |
| tall and wearing a padded "space suit" that was self-luminous; it     |
| also wore a visor. The being walked stiffly with one arm raised. The  |
| man ran home as quickly as he could, followed by his dog. (Source:    |

| 1978 - In 1978 at 6:00 a.m., a round, luminous UFO approached a car with a   |
| married couple and their little son in Baena, Spain. It hovered over  |
| their car and paced it for several miles. The witnesses went to the   |
| police, who saw the object hovering over a hilltop. The object        |
| remained visible until broad daylight. At the same time, in Peage,    |
| France, a luminous UFO, about five meters in diameter and with an     |
| antenna, followed a man out walking at only 15 meters above the       |
| ground. Several others also saw it. At 7:20 a.m., a silver,           |
| triangular shaped object with yellow lights swooped down over a car   |
| in Comner, England, causing the two occupants to panic and the driver |
| to swerve off the road. They described the craft as bigger than a     |
| "Hercules" C-5A military transport plane. It was totally silent, and  |
| flew off to the east. Later that evening two reporters in Fontanales  |
| on the Grand Canary Islands saw three UFOs at a high altitude. They   |
| gave off white, yellow, blue and red flashes of light, and were seen  |
| for several hours. (Sources: (1) Cronica, December 12, 1978; Jane     |

| 1979 - On this evening in 1979 a fireball or missile flew in over the Grays  |
| Harbor, Washington area from the sea, executed a 180-degree turn, and |
| headed west. It crashed in a clear-cut forest near Elk River, on the  |
| south side of the bay. Many witnesses told of a military roadblock in |
| the area over the next two days, including what looked like National  |
| Guard or Army trucks. One former Navy SEAL reported encountering      |

| 1979 - Elaine Kaiser was abducted from her bedroom in Rhode Island on |
| this night. She saw a white light and lost consciousness. Under       |
| hypnosis she remembered flowing up a beam of light into a             |
| semi-circular room, aboard a craft. A being gave her a smock and she  |
| put it on without resistance, and then lay down on a table, while an  |
| unknown man laid on another table nearby. Instruments connected her   |
| to the man, and something like a blood transfusion occurred. A giant  |
| being in a black metallic suit relieved her pain by passing a had in  |
| front of her face. He told her telepathically that he came from 2.4   |
| million light years away. Several months later she thought she        |
| recognized this same man in a crowd. (Source: Thomas E. Bullard, UFO  |

| minutes until the craft disappeared. As he pondered what had happened |

| 2001 - At 5:30 p.m. EST a husband and wife had gone for a walk before |
| dinner in a new development in a wooded area near their home in       |
| Hooksett, New Hampshire. They suddenly saw a terrifying large glowing |
| white object hovering above the trees and making no noise at all.     |
| They could hear nothing as it glided through the tree tops slowly.    |
| They were both very startled, and the wife wanted to run, but the     |
| husband said, "run where?" When they got home they called the police  |
| to report it, as well as talked to their neighbors to see if they had |

| 2001 - An orange, saucer-shaped, misty looking object was seen in     |
| Placentia, Orange County, California at 5:45 p.m. It was actually     |
| more oval shaped, but with saucer like edges, and seen at a 45 degree |
| angle elevation from the ground. It looked almost transparent with    |
| two red and white lights on the top and bottom. It moved slowly to    |
| the west and decended as it moved. The witnesses followed it in their |
| car for about five minutes until they could no longer see it; it went |
| lower than the trees and the neighboring houses. (Source: Peter       |

| 2003 - A black, cigar-shaped object was spotted in the early morning  |
| over Sanders, Arizona. The witness was driving to work in the early   |
| morning in the twilight just before dawn. He first saw a light in the |
| sky as he was driving east. It got as bright as Venus, and then       |
| dimmed altogether; what was left, hanging motionless in the sky, was  |
| a greyish black cigar-shaped vehicle with a bump on the top. The      |
| witness continued to watch it as he pulled into the parking lot at    |
| his place of employment, and kept watching it for a few more minutes  |
| while it never moved. The color was odd for an airplane as well,      |
| because it black/grey and did not reflect light. It also made no      |
| noise whatsoever. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting    |
