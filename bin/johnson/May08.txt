| 1880 - A farmer named Ju Tan in Song-Zi Xian Couny, China came upon a |
| misty white light in some bushes around 8:00 p.m. He then felt a      |
| tingling paralysis, and heard a humming or rushing noise. He was      |
| levitated upwards and lost consciousness. His next recollection was   |
| finding himself, in a dazed state, in Guizhou province, which was 300 |
| miles away from his home. The time was two weeks later. (Source:      |

| 15,000 feet at an estimated speed of 36 mph. An F-86D fighter was     |
| scrambled, but there were negative sightings. The sighting was visual |
| and electronic by TPS 1D radar. Length of observation was 10 minutes. |

| at the same spot. (Sources: Dr. P. M. H. Edwards, FSR, March 1970, p. |

| hovered, moved up and down, and from side to side. It darted away,    |
| reappeared, and hovered again before moving away for good. The        |
| sighting lasted 15 minutes. (Sources: NICAP files, citing Ritter      |

| from the NASA Space Flight Center, and a lady member of the UFO       |
| investigators group APRO, went to her window at 3:30 a.m. and saw     |
| three short figures about five feet tall walking by in single file.   |
| All wore tight fitting, light blue sports shirts and dark trousers,   |
| and had "pale complexions and mousy hair." They appeared to be        |
| "intently engrossed." (Sources: APRO Bulletin, May-June 1971, p. 4;   |

| Hainault Forest, a park in London, England near Cabin Hill. They had  |
| been walking their dog in a light rain at around 7 p.m. when they     |
| heard a rustling sound in the bushes. They then observed a huge       |
| figure, about eight feet tall and four feet wide, that crossed their  |
| path about 25 feet away and disappeared into the woods. It was dark   |
| blue in color and brighter than its surroundings. It had no distinct  |
| arms or legs that could be discerned. A UFO landing had been reported |
| in the area a few days earlier---the reason for the investigator      |
| being at the site at the time when he encountered the startled        |
| witnesses. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue   |

| 2000 - At 9:05 p.m. a triangular object hovered over the mountains    |
| outside of Juniper and Kamloops, British Columbia. It split into four |
| smaller triangles, and changed color. Some powerful strobe lights hit |
| the mountain, then the pieces reformed to make one object, which shot |
| up vertically. (Sources: UFO Magazine (USA), September 2000, p. 28;   |

| house along Highway 13 south of Highway 2 in Clinton, Missouri. Its   |
| bottom perimeter looked octagonal, and it had four small yellow       |
| lights with a large red light in the middle. It directed a beam of    |
| light down to ground, the UFO swayed, and then blinked out. It made   |
| no sound. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,    |

| 2003 - Walking home from the train station in Brooklyn, New York at   |
| 6:43 p.m., the witness looked up to the southeast and saw a silver    |
| disc/saucer at about 10,000 feet altitude. It had a leading edge      |
| pointed slightly upwards and it was moving east. He states, "The      |
| saucer/disk seemed to be wobbling and it had what seemed to be        |
| notches that were evenly spaced around its middle as it wobbled and   |
| rotated. I had my 35 mm camera with me the the sighting was so quick  |
| that it was gone before I could get my camera out." (Source: George   |

| located in the Havana, Cuba municipality of Boyeros, several people   |
| witnessed the presence of a small silver oval-shaped UFO. Residents   |
| saw the small oval-shaped vessel, silver-colored with a metallic      |
| tail, as it descended and landed in an open field encircled by trees  |
| on the El Pedregal farm. It made no noise nor smoke. It was about the |
| size of a pickup truck tire. Raul Beltran, 17, states, "I was tidying |
| the shelves when a bright light came through the window that was like |
| a glowing ball with a tail in its lower section. I showed it to my    |
| mother and quickly ran outside to see where it would fall and watched |
| at the site until the UFO took off once more." It lifted off          |
| perpendicularly, and then left through the palm trees. According to   |
| the witnesses, the grass and small plants at the site where the UFO   |
| landed were somewhat burned. (Source: George A. Filer & David E.      |
