| 1955 – From her bedroom window in Washburn, Maine Mrs. Jacobs watched |
| a reddish-orange glare resolve into a golden domed elliptical saucer  |
| at eleven o’clock at night. In the lower part of the dome she could   |
| see figures moving about, like people "walking in front of a light."  |
| The experience made her feel nauseous, and at the same time she had a |
| definite feeling of being watched. (Sources: Otto Binder, What We     |

| 1957 - In 1957 in Bryson City, North Carolina a 20-meter-long cigar-shaped   |
| object flew slowly to the east, then circled the valley at around     |
| nine o’clock in the evening. It had a very distinct outline. (Source: |

| 1957 - At 6:30 p.m. Mrs. Mendonca and five other persons in Ponta     |
| Poran, Brazil saw a light in the southern sky, which later appeared   |
| as two spherical objects coming closer to them on an oscillating      |
| course. One of the UFOs hovered close to their car while the other    |
| circled. They were shaped like a sphere surrounded by a flat ring,    |
| and chased the car for two hours over the deserted road. The          |
| estimated diameter of each was five meters. (Source: Jacques Vallee,  |

| 1961 – At 4:35 p.m. two cloud cigars maneuvered within sight of an    |
| airliner and then paced the DC-4 aircraft near Aso-san, Japan. One of |
| the objects emitted a ball of light. The pilot, Mr. Matsumura, took   |
| photographs. That night at 9:45 local time in Lafayette, Indiana a    |
| 2.5 meter diameter disc dove at a car being driven by a               |
| twenty-year-old man named Hislope and then flew away. (Sources:       |

| 1962 – Color motion pictures were taken of a UFO near Angel Falls,    |
| Venezuela—the world’s tallest water fall—on a cloudy afternoon at     |
| 12:15 p.m. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, February 1963, p. 5).     |

| 1964 – A gunsmith had a close encounter with a beehive-shaped UFO in  |
| rural Fisherville, Virginia. At five o’clock in the afternoon Mr.     |
| Burns was driving east on highway Route 250 east of Staunton when a   |
| 125-foot wide, beehive-shaped UFO slowly crossed the roadway ahead of |
| him, causing his car to stall. As the metallic looking UFO descended  |
| it narrowly missed hitting some power lines. There was a bluish glow  |
| from the bottom. As it left, it rose to about 200 feet in altitude,   |
| tilted slightly, then disappeared quickly into the northeast. The car |
| could then be restarted. Geiger counter tests showed abnormally high  |
| radioactivity in the area. (Sources: Donald B. Hanlon, Flying Saucer  |

| 1967 – A ship enroute from Auckland, New Zealand to Guam was sailing  |
| past the Loyalty Islands at 11:33 a.m. when crewmembers sighted a     |
| beam of light like a powerful searchlight extending vertically upward |
| from some clouds on the horizon. The beam extension was 35 degrees of |
| arc in length. The beam seemed to emanate from a small cloud a few    |
| degrees above the horizon. (Source: William R. Corliss: Remarkable    |

| 1971 – At around 11 p.m. a disc-shaped UFO along the roadside of      |
| Highway 116 in Mossoro, Brazil in the state of Rio Grande do Norte    |
| shot sparks from a tube for ten minutes. It then ascended into the    |
| sky and flew off toward the ocean. (Source: Gordon Creighton, FSR     |

| 1977 – A green glow was first seen by a married couple in Fort        |
| Mitchell, Kentucky at shortly after one o’clock at night. This was    |
| followed by the sighting of a 12-foot-long ovoid UFO moving at a low  |
| altitude, at an estimated distance of only 75 feet. The UFO ascended  |
| slowly, then show away fast into the nearby woods. That same night    |
| there were several reports of mystery booms being heard in            |
| Burlington, Atlantic, and Bergen Counties in New Jersey. (Sources:    |

| 1978 - In 1978 there were a series of UFO reports from throughout Argentina. |
| At shortly after two o’clock in the morning several witnesses in      |
| Resistencia, Argentina saw 6-7 objects moving in formation through    |
| the sky at great speed. The UFOs were radiating a bright, light blue  |
| light but made no sound. Power outages were reported throughout the   |
| city. At 2:45 a.m. a very large glowing disc-shaped UFO headed a      |
| formation of three other craft that flew from north to south at an    |
| estimated 1000 meters altitude in La Rioja, Argentina. They           |
| reportedly lit up the sky like day. Each object was white in color    |
| with a green halo, and they left behind a bluish trail. A truck       |
| driver said his truck’s radio stopped working at the time. Ten        |
| minutes later a giant light was observed in the western sky in Santa  |
| Fe, Argentina. It was blue and green in color, and spewed fiery       |
| particles, resembling “an airplane on fire.” Smaller objects          |
| surrounded it. (Sources: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping Service, March |

| 1981 - In the evening on this day in 1981 a Turkish Army captain and several |
| townspeople watched a silent glittering ovoid object illuminate a     |
| large engine factory complex with a bright green colored light in     |
| Aksaray, Turkey. It flew at an estimated 800 to 1000 feet altitude,   |
| and shot away to the southwest. (Source: Sarikaya Haluk Egeman,       |

| 1982 – Two UFO car pursuits occurred in the same twenty-four hour      |
| period on opposite sides of the globe. At 1:50 p.m. an orange light   |
| followed a car down a highway in Maddington, Western Australia. The   |
| UFO would hide when the car slowed down, then come back and pace the  |
| car when the driver sped up. In Penthereaz, Switzerland at 9:00 p.m.  |
| a small glowing sphere followed a car for ten minutes and lit up the  |
| vehicle’s interior. The luminous ball was estimated to be only 12     |
| centimeters in diameter. (Sources: Australian Center for UFO Studies; |
| Bruno Mancusi, SWICAT Swiss UFO catalogue).                           |

| 1992 - On this night in 1992 a domed, disc-shaped UFO directed a red beam of |
| light into the river in Garland, McDowell County, West Virginia.      |
| According to the 15-year-old teenager who witnessed this, when the    |
| red beam turned off the high-pitched noise coming from the object     |
| stopped. There were also several other discs present in the sky at    |
| the same time. (Source: Bob Teets, West Virginia UFOs: Close          |

| 1999 – At 6:45 a.m. an ovoid UFO was seen zigzagging in the sky       |
| between Toledo and Salkum in Washington State. At 5:00 p.m. another   |
| light was seen zigzagging through the sky over Portland, Oregon. At   |
| 8:00 o’clock in the evening a brightly colored disc was seen hovering |
| and changing colors over Lakewood, Colorado. (Source: Peter           |
