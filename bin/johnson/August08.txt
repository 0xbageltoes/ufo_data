| 1949 - On this afternoon five luminous disc-shaped objects flew in    |
| V-formation over Medford, Oregon and were sighted by three witnesses  |
| in flight aboard a military aircraft. The discs were estimated to be  |
| 35 feet in diameter, and were flying to the east-southeast at 10,000  |
| feet altitude at a speed of 150 mph. The pilot attempted to chase     |
| them, but they outflew his airplane. (Sources: Richard F. Haines,     |

| 1958 - At 1:27 a.m. an official of the Argentine National Senate      |
| experienced a complete car failure, including his dashboard clock,    |
| when he saw a domed disc-shaped object 300 meters away while driving  |
| on the highway between Unsue and Bolivar, Buenos Aires province,      |
| Argentina. The object made a soft whistling sound. It approached the  |
| car, then climbed away rapidly, after which the car could be          |
| restarted. (Source: Oscar A. Uriondo, FSR Case Histories, December    |
| 1973, p. 17).                                                         |

| 1961 - The witness awoke at 3:30 a.m. in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, Canada  |
| to see two beings in her bedroom, one at each end of her bed. They    |
| were four feet tall and dressed in green tunics and trousers. They    |
| wore transparent helmets with the visors open. A neighbor saw a blue  |
| globe take off from the lawn with a swishing sound. (Sources: John    |
| Brent Musgrave, FSR, August 1977, p. 26; APRO Bulletin, April 1977,   |

| 1965 - At 11:30 p.m. Sylvia Hoialman, Becky Evanston, and Becky       |
| Aanstad, all 21 years old, were driving near the Lincoln Park Golf    |
| Course in Grand Forks, North Dakota when they saw a yellow luminous,  |
| disc-shaped flying object that they first took to be the moon. But it |
| then “blinked black and white,” and the silhouettes of several little |
| figures could be seen inside the craft. Three men in another nearby   |
| car also saw the object; a teenage boy reportedly ran toward it and   |
| the object disappeared with a bang. (Sources: Grand Forks Herald,     |

| 1967 - Evangelical Pastor Estanislao Lugo Contreras was at the shore  |
| in Salina, Venezuela on this evening when he saw a disc-shaped object |
| with a very bright orange glow and emitting a buzzing sound, rise out |
| of the sea. It hovered a few seconds and then rose obliquely into the |
| sky. (Sources: Jim & Coral Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, pp.      |
| 54-55; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings,    |

| 1968 - At around two a.m. Miguel Bitschko of Canuelas, Argentina was  |
| woke up by a bright light coming from outside his home. Going outside |
| he was astonished to see a huge disc-shaped object on the ground in a |
| nearby field. The object had a dome with a revolving red light on     |
| top. As he stared at the object in disbelief a door opened on the     |
| craft, then a ladder descended to the ground. Soon a very tall man,   |
| over two meters tall, emerged from the craft. The figure wore a shiny |
| metallic, tight fitting uniform. At the same time the object was      |
| emitting a loud humming sound. The giant started to walk towards the  |
| witness, who stood paralyzed with fear. The figure then suddenly      |
| stopped, walked back to the object, and got back in. The craft then   |
| climbed vertically up into the sky at high speed and disappeared from |
| sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1968,    |
| citing Fabio Picasso).                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1969 - Dollie Hansen of West Akron, Ohio was a UFO contactee who      |
| claimed to have been in touch with UFO occupants. She had been        |
| promised a trip in a spaceship on Thursday, August 7 that didn't      |
| happen. At 2:00 a.m. on Friday a knock came at her door, and outside  |
| was a superbly built young woman with deep chestnut hair but no       |
| features on her face. Nevertheless, Mrs. Hansen had no fear, and went |
| with her to a black car containing two men, which was wrapped in a    |
| gray mist, and conveyed them to the spaceship. She was given the      |
| promised ride, but she gave no details beyond this, except to say     |
| that the spaceship was softly lit and contained no visible seams or   |
| welds. Around the same time a local handicapped boy also reported     |
| being taken onboard a UFO and given a ride; his encountered occurred  |
| at 2:30 a.m. (Source: Daivd F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue |
| of Humanoid Reports, case 1969-43 (A1061); Brinsley Le Poer Trench,   |
| Mysterious Visitors, p. 114).                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1971 - Mr. Boyce, age 51, was driving near a horse race track about   |
| five kilometers outside of Kadina, South Australia when his car       |
| engine stopped and lights died at the same time the car was           |
| illuminated by an orange glow that lit up the side of the road.       |
| Leaving his car, the witness saw an orange oval or disc-shaped object |
| with two red and one green lights. The object was about 30 feet in    |
| diameter, and had 3-4 windows. It hovered at 50 meters altitude       |
| directly above his car for two to three minutes, and made a buzzing   |
| or purring sound. (Sources: Keith Basterfield, case investigation     |
| files, case S035; UFO Research Australia, March 1982, p. 25; Mark     |
| Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, p. 51; Richard |
| H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A Thirty-Year Report, p. 253).  |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - At around 3:00 a.m. Fernando Dedeu's car radio began to        |
| develop problems while driving in Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires          |
| province, Argentina. He stopped the car and gave a ride to a 6.5 foot |
| tall man who was wearing a shallow helmet. The man had a long chin    |
| and a turned up collar. Then his car engine stalled, whereupon a UFO  |
| next landed in a nearby field and his passenger left the vehicle      |
| unseen. The car's door handle lay in the road, detached. (Source:     |
| Alan Baker, p. 30).                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1975 - At 10:00 p.m. two teenagers in Ostricourt, Nord department,    |
| France, both 17, were watching a luminous object circle in the sky,   |
| when it came down in a field a quarter of a mile away from them.      |
| Together with a third younger witness they went off to the landing    |
| site, located among some old mineshafts and slag piles. They found    |
| the object hovering motionless about five meters above the ground, in |
| front of a stand of trees, some 300 meters to their left. It looked   |
| like a plate turned upside down with a dome on top, with alternating  |
| red and orange lights blinking around the rim. The dome was red and   |
| the underneath portion was yellow, and it made no sound. They next    |
| saw two humanoid figures standing 30 meters directly in front of      |
| them. The beings were about 1.50 metes tall, and they were moving     |
| slowly and stiffly in the direction of the young people. They held    |
| their arms as if they were "glued to their bodies, and their legs     |
| were motionless as they glided smoothly along just above the rough    |
| terrain. Although they were brightly illuminated by a white light,    |
| they had no discernable features. After about a minute the young      |
| people, who had been petrified with fear, "found their legs" and beat |
| a hasty retreat home. They told their parents what they had seen, but |
| no one believed them. Next day the young people went back to the      |
| site. Although they could not find any footprints or other ground     |
| marks in the area covered by the beings, they did find the ground     |
| blackened and grass charred at the point over which the object had    |
| hovered. Two months later, when the investigators examined the site,  |
| the blackened area was still visible. (Sources: Joel Mesnard & Jean   |
| Marie Bigorne, Lumieres dans la Nuit, December 1980; David F. Webb &  |
| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1975-39     |
| (A1852), citing Joel Mesnard & Jean Marie Bigorne).                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - At 9:40 p.m. in Belton, Missouri several military personnel    |
| witnessed the flyover of a UFO that was tracked on radar. The         |
| encounter lasted 45 minutes. A cattle mutilation had been discovered  |
| earlier that day in Elsberry, Missouri. (Sources: (1) Allan Hendry,   |
| International UFO Reporter, September 1978, p. 3; UNICAT database,    |
| case 145; (2) Elsberry Democrat, August 10, 1978).                    |

| 1980 - During the previous evening, around 9:30 p.m., author Ellen    |
| Crystal was out in an isolated field near Pine Bush, New York by      |
| herself when she noticed a large lighted object descend among some    |
| nearby trees. The object turned its lights off as it landed. She      |
| decided not to approach. However, after midnight she decided to       |
| investigate, drove near the site, and with a flashlight caught sight  |
| of a four-foot tall thin humanoid with a large head and huge yellow   |
| cat-like eyes. It was wearing a tight fitting, beige jumpsuit. The    |
| being stood there briefly and stared at the witness, who panicked and |
| quickly drove away. (Sources: Ellen Crystal, The Silent Invasion, p.  |
| 41; Ellen Crystal, UFO Universe, Spring 1989).                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1981 - A teardrop shaped UFO with a spinning ring paced an airplane   |
| off its left wing over San Jose, California on this day. Instruments  |
| onboard the plane experienced failures, but the effects ended when    |
| the object departed upwards. The aircraft briefly disappeared from    |
| FAA radar during the encounter. (Source: Richard H. Hall, MUFON UFO   |
| Journal, February 1984, p. 14).                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1987 - A security guard sighted a large circle of light over a        |
| pasture near Denver, Colorado. Two cows were found dead and mutilated |
| the next day. (Source: Timothy Good, Alien Contact, p. 59).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1993 - At around 1:00 a.m. near Narre Warren North, Victoria,         |
| Australia three carloads of people, including the principal witness   |
| 27-year-old Kelly Cahill, her husband and three children encountered  |
| a huge disc-shaped object hovering low above a field by the roadside. |
| It had what appeared to be orange-lighted windows around the bottom.  |
| Humanoid figures were seen moving about inside. Their next conscious  |
| memory was seeing the object suddenly shoot away at high speed.       |
| Later, as they approached their home, they saw a tall dark figure     |
| standing on the side of the road. Later they were able to recall how  |
| they had stopped their vehicle and gotten out to approach the large   |
| UFO. To their surprise, they noticed another car stopped at the side  |
| of the road. As they walked down toward the craft, they saw a         |
| seven-foot tall black figure with huge fiery red eyes appear in the   |
| field. The figure began moving slowly towards them, apparently        |
| gliding. Kelly panicked and began yelling hysterically "they have no  |
| souls!" when suddenly dozens of similar beings appeared and began     |
| moving quickly towards the group of witnesses. The aliens were        |
| beneath the immense flying craft. They seemed to congregate in small  |
| groups; one group glided toward Kelly and her husband covering a      |
| hundred yards in a mere few seconds. Another group approached the     |
| other car, which sat motionless near the hovering craft. Kelly had a  |
| sense that the creatures were evil. She clung to her husband,         |
| fighting the feeling of blacking out, but at this point all of the    |
| witnesses blacked out. Their next conscious recall was being in their |
| car watching the object shoot away. The occupants of the other        |
| vehicle would later come forward and tell almost exactly the same     |
| story: a story of abduction, mind control, and embarrassing medical   |
| procedures. Kelly recalled through dreams that one of the black       |
| aliens stooped over her naked body like he was kissing her navel.     |
| That night, when Kelly undressed for bed, she noticed a strange       |
| triangular mark on her navel, a mark she had never seen before. Kelly |
| suffered from general malaise for the next two weeks, and was taken   |
| to the hospital on two occasions, one for severe stomach pains, and   |
| another for a uterine infection. The witnesses all had a two 2 hour   |
| time lapse. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database     |
| 1993, case # 1865, citing Bill Chalker, International UFO Reporter,   |
| Volume 19, Number 5).                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1998 - At 5:30 a.m. five witnesses in Claut, Pordenone, Italy spotted |
| a UFO and a flying humanoid over a soccer field. Two farmers, the     |
| groundskeeper, and a pair of tourists watched the humanoid fly        |
| overhead and then rejoin the hovering object. The craft then shot     |
| straight up into the sky. One of the farmers, Angelo F., was having   |
| breakfast when he first saw the multicolored UFO. A second man named  |
| Angelo, the groundskeeper, saw the object when it flew by and hovered |
| over the field. The witnesses described the humanoid as having a      |
| large head and a small body "like a puppet." He was about four feet   |
| tall, and wore what appeared to be V-shaped body armor equipped with  |
| a luminous backpack. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact     |
| Database 1998, case # 3132, citing Antonio Chiumento).                |

| 1998 - At 10:45 p.m. a large dark triangle that was viewed through    |
| binoculars flew over the shoreline at Kerlaviou, Finistere            |
| department, France at a low altitude, heading toward the east. It had |
| lit corners and made a slight rumbling sound. (Source: Larry Hatch, U |
| computer database, case 18060).                                       |

| 1999 - A huge object with counter-rotating rings of light flew over   |
| Logan Village, Queensland, Australia at 9:20 p.m. It was lit up with  |
| lights like a Ferris wheel. (Source: George Filer, Filers' Files,     |
