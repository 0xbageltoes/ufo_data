| 1950 - Three orange cylinders flew to the north at 1600 km/h over     |
| Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. It was witnessed by a Lieutenant Colonel and   |
| another military witness. It was lost from sight when it disappeared  |
| into an odd looking, lone small thin cloud. (Source: Larry Hatch, U   |

| 1953 - At 6:20 p.m. an airman witnessed a 60 meter long luminous      |
| cigar-shaped or rectangular object with hazy ends, that flew from     |
| east to west over Sampson Air Force Base in Ontario County, New York  |
| while climbing slightly. It made a high frequency humming sound. It   |
| flew at an estimated 2500m altitude. In one minute the object         |
| traveled through an arc of 70 or 80 degrees. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U |

| 1953 - At 9:15 p.m. MST Air Force personnel stationed at the 769th    |
| AC&W station in Continental Divide, New Mexico observed an aerial     |
| phenomenon simultaneously by electronic and visual means. To the      |
| naked eye the object appeared as a very bright reddish-white object   |
| estimated to be 10 miles west of the radar site. The object passed    |
| behind a hill and then reappeared, apparently heading in a northerly  |
| direction at a slow speed. The airman making this visual observation  |
| reported it to personnel manning the radar equipment. They stated     |
| that they had an unidentified blip on the radar scope, appearing west |
| of the station approximately 9 miles away. The scope showed the       |
| object to be on a 270 azimuth at an altitude of 10,000-15,000 feet    |
| moving away from the site at 12-15 mph. It was eventually lost on     |
| radar at the 18 mile range. The object was under visual and radar     |
| observation intermittently for 45 minutes. (Sources: Project Blue     |

| 1965 - A group of teenagers, including Steve Miller, age 16, were     |
| driving on Route 250 near Brands Flats, Virginia at 7:30 p.m. when    |
| they saw a little man about 3 ½ feet tall sitting by the road         |
| watching the cars go by. He was wearing a silvery looking one-piece   |
| outfit. They got out of the car and pursued the little man. Two more  |
| little men joined the first and ran with him, and they easily outran  |
| the teens leaving no footprints in the muddy ground. The group then   |
| contacted the Staunton police, and within an hour a group of police   |
| were on the scene, as well as a young news photographer, Charles      |
| Weaver. Weaver, and another man named Huffer approached a barn, which |
| the photographer entered first. Huffer heard his companion call out   |
| to him, and when Huffer entered the barn he found Weaver on the       |
| ground. Weaver claimed something struck him and knocked him down. The |
| pair left the barn quickly, but as they fled they thought they saw a  |
| little man standing in front of the building. Weaver paused long      |
| enough to take a photo before joining up with the other               |
| investigators. The disposition of the photograph has never been       |
| determined. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue |

| 1967 - Sixty military witnesses at a U.S. base in Heidelberg,         |
| Germany heard a pulsating sound at 8:30 p.m., and then saw a shiny    |
| metallic dirigible-shaped object hovering over a building 100         |
| feet away. As jets approached to investigate the object, it took off  |
| with lights flashing in a regular cycle. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,     |

| 1967 - Three women saw an oblong, gray and red object, with prongs of |
| various colors was seen over Jamaica, Queens borough, New York at     |
| 1:30 a.m. Parts of the UFO seemed to move independently. The sighting |
| lasted more than two hours. (Sources: NICAP New York case             |

| 1967 - On this morning, about a week after seeing a large metallic    |
| sphere hovering above a highway near Charleston, West Virginia, Tad   |
| Jones was driving along the same highway at the same time when he     |
| came upon a man standing on the roadside in the same spot where the   |
| sphere had hovered. Thinking that it was a hitchhiker Tad slowed down |
| and called to him. The man did not reply but merely waved him on. He  |
| described the man as very tanned, wearing a blue coat, and a blue cap |
| with a visor. He was holding a box in his hand. It appeared to be     |
| some kind of instrument with a dial on it, like a clock, and a wire   |
| ran from it to his other hand. A later check with the local gas       |
| company proved negative as far as it being one of their men.          |
| Furthermore, no such instrument described by Jones was in use         |
| anywhere by any of their employees. He saw the same man again the     |
| next day, but drove on. (Sources: John Keel, FSR, May-June 1967,      |

| 1967 - A Methodist minister was driving on Route 185 near Coffeen,    |
| Illinois at 9:00 p.m. when he saw an object that was flat on the      |
| bottom and rounded on top cross the road 100 meters in front of him.  |
| It made no noise and moved slowly. He estimated that it was 20 meters |
| in length and three meters in height. (Source: Jacques Vallee,        |

| 1968 - Two men in River Bann, Derryvore, Ireland saw a disc land in a |
| field. Several entities emerged and placed probes into the hides of   |
| several paralyzed cows in the field. The UFO then took off and        |
| showered a fog-like substance that caused a tingling sensation, and   |
| the UFO then disappeared into a cloud. (Source: Jenny Randles, Little |

| 1969 - On a farm southeast of Fernley, Nevada while milking cows at   |
| five o'clock in the morning, a young man named Schade saw a red       |
| glowing sphere moving slowly, ten meters above the ground, a quarter  |
| of a mile away. The object hovered, the emitted white mist. Each time |
| it stopped moving the light went out. Finally, the UFO ascended with  |
| a jerky motion toward the west and Reno. (Sources: Mark Massingill,   |

| 1971 - A young couple out driving in the early hours of the morning   |
| in Jackson, Ohio had a close encounter with a spherical object that   |
| rose from the ground, and then hovered directly in front of their     |
| car. The driver stopped his car and backed away. The ball of light    |
| changed color from orange to purple. When the drove off it followed   |
| them. (Source: Columbus Dispatch, January 27, 1971; NICAP UFO         |

| 1972 - At three a.m. Norman Chastain was out fishing late at night in |
| the St. Johns River near Blount Island, Florida when he saw something |
| like "half a ball" with orange and blue flashing lights. It came      |
| "directly toward my boat" and hovered noiselessly overhead at 150     |
| feet. He turned off his light and the object slowly moved off. He had |
| drifted to the shore and with his spotlight he could see in the       |
| nearby woods "the darndest looking human-like creature one could ever |
| imagine." Waht he saw was a humanoid creature about five feet tall,   |
| with pointed ears, large eyes, and a sharp chin. Next a brilliant     |
| white light hit him that paralyzed him until dawn. He noticed an      |
| "overpowering stench" in his clothes and hair, and threw away his     |
| clothes. Three nights later he smelt the same odor again, and in the  |
| morning found a fungus like growth similar to "a cluster of several   |
| flesh colored heads looking at me;" he said they "had teeth, big      |
| eyes, a wide mouth, and pointed ears," and looked "like the devil     |
| looking creature" he saw on Blount Island. (Sources: Lloyd Brown, The |

| 1976 - M. Claude Cretin, while driving at 9:45 p.m. between Bouze and |
| Beaune, Cote D’Or department, France saw a searchlight beam flash     |
| three times. He then noticed a humanoid being standing in the bushes  |
| about 20 feet away beside the road. The being was wearing a diving    |
| suit of yellow-orange color with a round-topped helmet and a          |
| rectangular face plate. Atop the helmet was a whitish light. He could |
| only make out the upper portion of the figure because the bushes      |
| blocked his view. After driving on, he went and notified the police,  |
| who investigated on the following day and found freshly broken        |
| branches at the site. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: |

| 1991 - On January 13, 1991 border guard Istvan Balogh woke up in his  |
| bedroom in Oroshaza, Hungary and heard a loud booming voice repeat    |
| three times, "We will meet soon." The voice had a metallic quality to |
| it. On this date he had just returned from the movies at 1:15 a.m.,   |
| and had stepped out on his terrace when he saw a small gray           |
| disc-shaped object, four meters in height and two meters in width. As |
| he stared at the object a bright beam of light struck him. His next   |
| conscious memory was onboard a craft. He was inside a room with a     |
| window about 1 meter in diameter. He was then approached by two       |
| human-like figures with 3-digit hands and skin with a greenish        |
| complexion, wearing black uniforms. They communicated telepathically  |
| with him, telling him that they came from a world that was 15 million |
| light years from earth. They were able to travel such vast distance   |
| using dimensional portals. He remembered seeing an illuminated        |
| moon-like crater and a pyramid. He was eventually returned to his     |
| home at 2:00 a.m. He went and reported his story at the hospital, and |
| as a result he was later fired from his job as a border guard.        |

| 2003 - Anatoly Yurevich awoke in the middle of the night in           |
| Karaganda, Kazakhstan to the sounds of footsteps, then saw a two foot |
| tall creature standing at the side of his bed. It was very heavy set, |
| perhaps weighing as much as 115 kilos (250 lbs.). His dog hid under   |
| the bed blankets shaking with fear. The creature touched his knee and |
| then pulled on the blanket. It then vanished in full view. After a    |
| couple of minutes the witness felt a severe pain in his lower         |
| abdomen. His dog growled for 20 minutes after the incident, after     |
| which he was able to go back to sleep. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,    |
