| 1943 - USAAF bomber crews flying over Essen, Germany encountered a    |
| giant, cigarrette shaped UFO. (Source: Richard H. Hall, From Airships |

| 1949 - Joseph Shell, flying over Hart Mountain, Oregon at 2:25 p.m.,  |
| witnessed 5-8 metallic, oval-shaped objects flying in single file.    |
| They were each 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, and followed the        |
| contour of the terrain. Their estimated speed was 230 mph, and they   |
| were observed to change course. This case is listed as a Project Blue |
| Book "unknown" case. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in     |
| official statistics, case 404; Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO      |

| 1955 - A perfectly circular chrome disc flew over Ecclesfield,        |
| England at 1:00 p.m. at high speed. The disc reflected sunlight and   |
| went off toward the northwest. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer       |

| 1958 - Remo dell'Armellina was driving a truck toward Santa Fe,       |
| Argentina when he saw a giant figure, three meters tall, blocking the |
| road near the town of Boa del Tigre. He went towards it with an iron  |
| bar but could not get close because of the stench and a blinding      |
| phosphorescent light that emanated from the creature. It had very     |
| long arms, a scaly body, and wore a flightsuit coverall. The witness  |
| fainted; when he regained consciousness the being was gone. (Sources: |
| Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 468; |

| 1962 - Numerous witnesses in Palmer, Alaska watched two triangular    |
| UFOs dive and climb through the sky. (Sources: Project Blue Book      |
| files counted in official statistics, case 7931; Richard H. Hall, UFO |

| 1965 - A flat, reddish orange, ten foot wide disc, hovered at a low   |
| altitude 100 yards away from the witness in Acacia Ridge, Northern    |
| Territory, Australia on this evening. It illuminated its              |
| surroundings. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the Southern         |

| 1967 - At one o'clock in the morning a disc landed in a field in      |
| St.-Andre-Treize-Voies, Vendee department, France. When it took off   |
| it made a noise like a vacuum cleaner. (Source: Michel Figuet &       |

| 1967 - Two luminous trails were found over the ground in Sermerieu,   |
| France. Four dead cows were found together with an area of 400 meter  |
| wide area of burned crops. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 93). |
|                                                                       |
| 1968 - Mr. Pan Chen Hsiang, who was inside his house at 6:00 a.m. in  |
| the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, heard his son shouting for him to |
| come out onto the patio. He ran outside and following his son's       |
| instructions could see a strange, dark disc-shaped object in          |
| horizontal flight. It flew directly over them in complete silence.    |
| Its size was large and estimated to be 10 meters in diameter. Its     |
| color was flat gray and it appeared to have a dull metallic finish.   |
| It displayed regular flashes from its dome. Mr. Hsiang took six       |
| photographs of the object, which show an object with a darkened dome  |
| in a clear sky. (Sources: FSR, September-October 1968, p. 36; Paul    |
| Dong, UFOs over Modern China, pp. 309-311).                           |

| 1968 - Both the headlights and the engine of a car failed near Punt   |
| Gorda, Florida at 9:45 p.m. The motorist got out to investigate, then |
| saw a light at tree-top height, slowly settling to the ground. As the |
| light came nearer, the witness saw that it was attached to a metallic |
| body, shaped like a pilgrim's hat , with a green glow and bluish      |
| outline around the edges. A few minutes after landing, the object     |
| reappeared, then moved off at high speed to the northwest. The        |
| headlights of the car came on immediately, and the motor could be     |
| started with difficulty. The driver's watch was found to have stopped |
| working. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle       |
| Interference, p. 41, citing CUFOS files).                             |

| 1971 - A greenish domed disc was seen at dusk in Itaperuna, Brazil.   |
| When the witness approached the object to investigate he ran into an  |
| invisible barrier ten meters away from it, that knocked him down and  |
| caused him to lose consciousness. The landing site had burnt grass.   |

|                                                                       |
| 1973 - At 2:00 a.m. a dark, slow moving, silent cylindrical object    |
| blocked out stars as it moved across the sky in Feignies, France.     |
| There were two long windows on the craft, which flew off to the       |
| southeast. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, March 1975).               |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - Sao Jose Do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil - Geni Lisboa was     |
| busily baking wedding cakes early in the morning at 2:00 a.m., when   |
| her attention was drawn outdoors by the squawking of her pet          |
| parakeet. When she looked out she saw a luminous flying object        |
| approaching her property. The object circled her garden and hovered   |
| above the wall. Ms. Lisboa, only a few meters distant, could see      |
| three identical looking figures of small stature through the          |
| transparent upper portion. They were behind a kind of "parapet" which |
| hid them from the waist down. Each one was directly a beam of light   |
| down as if searching for something. Then their beams simultaneously   |
| converged on the witness, immediately paralyzing her. Feeling some    |
| pain and dizziness, she was nevertheless able to call out for help to |
| her neighbor, but the object departed before she was able to respond. |
|                                                                       |
| When her neighbor arrived, she found Ms. Lisboa's face swollen and    |
| her eyes bloodshot. Her body was painful, particularly in the joints  |
| and especially in the knees, but she continued working until the pain |
| returned and she was forced to call her neighbor again. Her           |
| physiological symptoms worsened and she was hospitalized for what the |
| doctors labelled a prolapsed uterus. She had had a gynecological test |
| six months before and had been healthy. In addition to this, her      |
| eyesight worsened after the experience to the point where she was     |
| forced to wear corrective lenses for the first time in her life.      |
| Also, her previous medical condition of hypertension seemed to have   |
| made an improvement to the degree where she was able to drop all      |
| previous anti-hypertensive medication. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted   |

| 1985 - In St. James City, Florida a dark elliptical UFO was sighted   |
| over the ocean at 9:45 p.m. It had lights around the perimeter,       |
| mostly white lights but there seemed to be sparkling colors at times  |
| scintillating around the object. (Source: MUFON database of filed     |

| 1989 - A car experienced brief electrical system failure, then        |
| recovered when a very strange looking UFO was sighted at around 11:00 |
| p.m. in Charovsk, Russia. The object was mushroom shaped on one side, |
| but looked crablike on the other side. (Source: Richard F. Haines,    |

| 1994 - A black and silver cylindrical UFO approached a fisherman in   |
| Brisbane, Queensland, Australia at 2:10 a.m. He lost track of time    |
| for the next 90 minutes; later he found cuts on his chest. (Source:   |

| 1998 - Two brothers saw a triangular UFO over their home in East      |

| 2003 - A cigar-shaped UFO hovered low near a mountain near Phoenix,   |
| Arizona at 10:10 p.m. It had pinpoint lights along its side that      |
| flickered sometimes. It had a large red light at each end, and was    |
| soundless. It suddenly took off so fast vertically that it seemed     |
| like it almost disappeared. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO    |
