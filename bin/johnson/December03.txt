| 1952 - In 1952 at 10:10 p.m. in the city of Bordeaux, France a long, bright  |
| cigar-shaped UFO moved slowly in the sky, then suddenly shot away,    |
| leaving a blue trail. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 131).   |
|                                                                       |
| 1953 - In 1953 at 6:02 p.m. Eastern Standard Time jets were scrambled from   |
| North Truro, Massachusetts in response to a radar bogey. Ground radar |
| showed rapid changes in the UFO’s speed and altitude. At 7:35 p.m. a  |
| pulsating orange ovoid object was seen over Bellmore, New York. It    |
| made a sudden, ninety-degree turn and shot away at over 1800 miles    |
| per hour. Unidentified radar returns were also reported that day at   |
| Holloman AFB, New Mexico and Ellington AFB, Texas. (Sources: US Air   |
| Force Project Blue Book files counted in official statistics,         |
| December 1953, cases 2, 3 and 4).                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - On this morning in 1954 in the town of Montebuono, Italy a 10 meter   |
| long cigar-shaped object passed overhead at 40-meters altitude. It    |
| had a large porthole on its side. It abruptly changed direction and   |
| shot straight up into the sky and away. (Source: Verga Maurizio,      |
| ITACAT - Italian UFO Catalogue).                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 1956 - In 1956 a disc paced a transport plane over Baltimore, Maryland for a |
| short while, then broke away, spinning counterclockwise. The plane    |
| attempted to follow the UFO but was unable to keep up. (Source:       |
| Leonard H. Stringfield, CRIFO Orbit, February 1957, p. 4).            |
|                                                                       |
| 1957 - In 1957 at 7 p.m. in Ellensburg, Washington a truck engine reportedly |
| missed but did not stall in the presence of a UFO. Many residents of  |
| the Menastash Ridge area of Ellensburg saw a "strange ball of fire"   |
| for 20 minutes. A truck driver reported that the light hovered over   |
| his truck, causing the motor to cough and sputter. His engine did not |
| stop completely, however, so he drove away. The night was misty, but  |
| the object was so bright that it lit up the sky as if it were         |
| daytime. (Sources: NICAP investigation files, Mark Rodeghier, UFO     |
| Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, case 85, citing Schopick).    |

| 1959 - In 1959 on a cloudy night on a farm near Chatton, New Zealand a disc  |
| flew in around 9:45 p.m. flying toward the northeast, stopped and     |
| then circled for 45 minutes. It gave off a bright glow around its     |
| rim. It was finally lost from sight behind the clouds. (Source: Larry |
| Hatch, U computer database, citing Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History,   |
| 1959, volume 4).                                                      |

| 1960 - In 1960, a man and his grandson were out duck hunting early in the    |
| morning near Atlantic City, New Jersey. They were sitting in a duck   |
| blind at around 6 a.m. when they saw a 20-meter wide disc approach to |
| within 100 meters of their position. It glowed red and lit the        |
| ground, and moved with a jerky motion “like a bouncing ball.” It      |
| changed color from red to purple as it rose vertically into the sky,  |
| then flew off toward the southwest. (Source: George D. Fawcett,       |
| Flying Saucers, September 1961, p. 53).                               |

| 1967 - On this day in 1967 three important UFO cases occurred. In the middle |
| of the afternoon, airline crews and others near Cape Kamennyy, Russia |
| watched a luminous sphere in the sky drop a red fireball and emit     |
| beams of light.                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 – About one-and-a-half hours earlier, at around 2:30 a.m.        |
| Central Standard Time, a famous UFO abduction case occurred in        |
| Ashland, Nebraska. Mr. Herbert L. Schirmer, a 22-year-old police      |
| officer and military veteran, noticed a glow in a nearby paddock      |
| while driving his patrol car along a highway. He pulled in to         |
| investigate, then his patrol car engine and lights died. He noticed a |
| silver disc about 30 feet in diameter, surrounded by a brilliant      |
| orange glow. He remembered that he tried to send a two-way radio      |
| message, but an orange and red beam directed at him made it           |
| impossible for him to move. He remembered being taken aboard the      |
| craft by four aliens about 4.5 to 5 feet tall with slanted eyes. They |
| used language and telepathy to communicate with him. He experienced   |
| temporary amnesia for about 30 minutes, followed by headaches and     |
| other physiological effects. The case was thoroughly investigated by  |
| the Air Force sponsored University of Colorado UFO study, headed by   |
| Edward Condon, with mixed conclusions. Hypnosis was used to enhance   |
| memory recall, and the two psychological experts called in to         |
| evaluate the case developed opposite opinions. One believed the case  |
| was a hoax and Mr. Schirmer was a pathological liar, the other felt   |
| that Schirmer was totally sincere and found his account convincing.   |

| 1967 – That same night in Barcelona, Spain a “cactus-like” entity     |
| with four appendages—presumably two arms and two legs—was sighted. It |
| left deep footprints in the soil. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester     |
| Olmos investigation files).                                           |

| 1973 – There were three close-encounter cases and numerous reports of |
| nocturnal lights reported on this night in 1973 as well. A            |
| 26-year-old woman driving along Route 322 at 9 p.m. in Logan, New     |
| Jersey, in Gloucester County, first noticed a red glow, then a        |
| hamburger-shaped disc with a red light on top and a green light on    |
| the bottom. The UFO made a hissing sound, and emitted bright white    |
| jets of light from the sides when the object moved, like rocket       |
| thrusts. At 11:30 p.m. in Horton Bay, Michigan a glowing,             |
| mushroom-shaped UFO was seen over a highway intersection. It made no  |
| sound, and “just disappeared.” On that same night on a farm between   |
| Lincoln and Cole Camp, Missouri a farmer reported that a low flying   |
| UFO frightened his livestock. (Sources: Woodbury (NJ) Daily Times,    |
| December 5, 1973; Petoskey (MI) News Review, December 4, 1973;        |
| Warrensburg (MO) Star-Journal, December 11, 1973).                    |

| 1978 - A brightly lit globular shaped object was seen flying at a low |
| altitude over Leme, Brazil on this night. Several moving figures      |
| could be seen moving inside through a large opening. (Source: Albert  |
| S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978, citing GEPUC Brazil).     |

| 1979 - On this night in 1979 in the province of Guadalajara, Spain           |
| veterinarian Dr. A. Cuesta was driving between Humanes and Yunque de  |
| Henares when a UFO began pacing his car and followed him for several  |
| kilometers. The craft positioned itself only 15 meters above his car, |
| and emitted a blinding light, causing him to lose control and drive   |
| off the highway. On the same night at 10:25 p.m. in Clay County,      |
| Nebraska two teenage girls were driving west of Fairfield on highway  |
| 73 when they sighted a metallic domed disc-shaped UFO pursue their    |
| car for about five minutes at a distance of 400 meters. The UFO was   |
| about 10 meters in diameter. Their sketches of the object appear      |
| remarkably similar to those drawn by the two abductees in the Buff    |
| Ledge, Vermont case from 1968. (Sources: UFO Newsclipping Service,    |
| April 1980, p. 13, citing Mundo Diario, December 5, 1979; APRO        |
| Bulletin, April 1980, p. 6, citing Hastings Daily Times, December 14, |
| 1979).                                                                |

| 1980 – One year later, at 10:30 p.m. on Highway 57 in McLain,         |
| Mississippi Mr. and Mrs. Lowrey had the FM radio of their car quit,   |
| the car’s headlights dim, and the car heater quit when a luminous,    |
| blue-white ball of light came briefly over the right side of the      |
| car’s hood. They estimated the light to be about a foot in diameter   |
| and only a meter away. The seat belt alarm also came on during the    |
| encounter. (Source: Allan Hendry, International UFO Reporter, January |
| 1981, p. 12).                                                         |

| 1990 - In 1990 at 6:20 p.m. two dark triangle-shaped objects with rounded    |
| corners flew over the city of Noirmoutier on the French coast in      |
| sequence, flying south to north. Both have a red area in the center.  |
| At 9:10 p.m. a large metallic triangular raft with large lights flew  |
| low over the city of Cuincy, France. At 11:20 p.m. in Jozsa, Hungary  |
| a car with a single occupant stalled when it passed a short humanoid  |
| standing on the side of the road. The driver experienced twenty       |
| minutes of missing time. When the witness recovered consciousness,    |
| the car was facing in the opposite direction on the highway with no   |
| apparent damage. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issues 307, 308, and |
| 326).                                                                 |

| 1994 - In 1994 at 11:00 o’clock in the evening two witnesses near the Garden |
| State Parkway in Eatontown, New Jersey observed a silent,             |
| triangular-shaped craft in the sky. (Source: Paul Ferrughelli,        |
