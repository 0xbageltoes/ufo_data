| 1952 -  A semi-circular cloud maneuvered and veered about in the sky  |
| over Beverly, Massachusetts at 6:00 p.m. It then rose vertically and  |
| was gone from sight. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. 1952:  |
| November-December, p. 73).                                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - Traveling by car to Mendoza on Route # 143, a concert pianist  |
| and six others traveling together saw a brilliant glow at the side of |
| the road near San Rafael Moreno, Argentina at 3:30 a.m. It was a      |
| luminous object about 100-200 meters away in a nearby field, and it   |
| was emitting a bluish light like that from a welding torch. According |
| to the description by Professor Maria Luisa de Amaya, it had the form |
| of two deep dishes placed together rim to rim. They could not make    |
| out any structural details. The witnesses stopped their car and got   |
| out, then walked toward the object. When they were about 50 meters    |
| away they noticed two human figures next to it. The beings were of    |
| normal height, wearing dark one piece diver's suits, with their heads |
| covered with a kind of cowl. One of the humanoids was crouching next  |
| to the object. After he got up, the two individuals entered the UFO   |
| through a rectangular door. The object began to emit smoke from its   |
| central region and rose up vertically, stopping a few meters from the |
| ground and throwing out two flickering red lights. Alarmed, the       |
| witnesses rushed back to their car and took off driving at high       |
| speed. The object pursued them for 20 minutes, until by the first     |
| light of dawn they could no longer see it. (Sources: Oscar A Uriondo, |

| 1958 - On this afternoon in Portglenone, Ireland a two-meter wide     |
| black flying object cut an oak tree in two, three meters above the    |
| ground and did not stop. The tree in question was 70 cm wide and 13   |
| meters tall. The event was observed by a farmer named Bennett.        |

| 1964 -  A 17 meter in diameter domed disc was spotted on the ground   |
| in Auckland, New Zealand at about 9:00 p.m. It had two rows of        |
| intense lights on the body of the craft, and a green light on the     |
| dome. The two female witnesses, Ms. Bender and Ms. Quinn, saw a door  |
| in the object open before they left. The sighting duration was four   |
| minutes. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of  |
| Landings, case 629, citing Spaceview; Bruce Cathie, Harmonic 33,      |

| 1967 -  At four o'clock in the morning on the Andalgala highway in    |
| Catamarca Province, Argentina Mr. & Mrs. Clerici watched a flying     |
| object that changed color from purple to green from time to time. The |
| couple became frightened when the object followed them for a few      |
| minutes, then it ascended into the air. (Source: Oscar A. Uriondo,    |

| 1968 - The witness had been in Goulburn, New South Wales, Australia   |
| the area back in 1950 and at that time had experienced a peculiar     |
| incident, which left him with a scar. He returned to the site in      |
| December 1968 and saw a disc-shaped craft 40 feet in diameter and 10  |
| feet high, and met its human looking occupant, who walked around the  |
| side of the object. The man had long hair, stood about 5' 6" tall,    |
| and wore silver colored shoes. The witness spoke with him in English  |
| for about three minutes, learning that the UFO occupant claimed to be |
| from Saturn. The man seemed to be in a hurry to get away. He boarded, |
| after which the craft rose off the ground and hovered momentarily at  |
| 15 feet before moving off and disappearing in the distance. (Sources: |

| 1971 -  Three witnesses in a Boeing 727 airliner and Air Traffic      |
| Controllers reported several groups of red balls of light that jumped |
| and maneuvered all over the mountainous area of San Martin de los     |
| Andes, Neuquen Province, Argentina beginning at 11:45 p.m. for the    |
| next 35 minutes. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, May 1972; Larry Hatch, U    |

| 1978 - At 11:48 p.m. security guard Fortunato Zanfretta was out on    |
| patrol of a housing complex in Marzano di Torriglia, Italy when he    |
| suddenly yelled over his radio that he had lost control of his        |
| vehicle, because it was speeding down a mountain road on its own      |
| accord. The car finally stopped and Mr. Zanfretta got out to          |
| investigate a strange light hovering nearby. He was later found       |
| incoherent next to his car. His pistol had been fired six times, and  |
| giant footprints were found at the site. Under hypnosis, he recalled  |
| that he had being taken onboard a UFO by giant humanoids and examined |
| with strange devices. He was asked several questions by them and was  |
| told that they would be back soon. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,        |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1978, case # 140, citing Paolo Fiorino, UFO |
| Universe, October-November 1991).                                     |

| 1978 - A luminous object surrounded by a red halo flew over L'Aquila, |
| Italy on this night. It stopped several hundred meters over an        |
| electrical generating plant, according to two power plant             |
| technicians, and the generator stopped for five minutes while the     |
| central power plant instruments went "haywire." Several had to be     |
| adjusted. (Sources: Jane Thomas, UFO Newspaper Clipping Service,      |
| April 1979, p. 14, citing La Razon newspaper, December 30, 1978;      |
| Lumieres dans la Nuit, February 1979).                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - On or about this date at about 4:30 a.m. three men,  employees |
| of a power company, were driving a company truck toward a bridge on   |
| the Rio Segundo between Arroyito and Transito, Cordoba Province,      |
| Argentina when they were approached by an intense light from a hill   |
| and suddenly found themselves teleported 15 kilometers further away   |
| from the bridge to the town of Transito. They believed no time had    |
| passed because their cigarettes were the same length as they had been |
| when they neared the bridge. At some point, the men spotted a domed   |
| UFO, described as a flattened rhombus 25 meters in diameter that was  |
| revolving, and one of them apparently signaled the occupants of the   |
| craft. (Sources: Jane Thomas, UFO Newspaper Clipping Service, April   |

| 1988 - A very controversial case occurred on this day over Puerto     |
| Rico near Cabo Rojo, east of Betances in Mayaguez province.           |
| According to two male witnesses on the ground, at 7:45 p.m. two US    |
| Air Force F-14 fighter jets tried to intercept a very large           |
| triangular metallic looking UFO with brilliant yellow lights on the   |
| right tip and red lights on the left tip. The UFO veered to left,     |
| turned back, and then reduced speed. Both jets disappeared inside the |
| UFO! The UFO then split into two and rose straight up vertically.     |

| 1991 -  There was both airborne radar contact and visual confirmation |
| of an echelon formation of three objects that flew over London,       |
| Ontario, Canada at 12:40 a.m. The case is rated as a high reliability |
| unknown by the Canadian UFO Survey group. (Source: Richard F. Haines, |

| 1993 -  Witnesses in Willow Creek, Humboldt County, California        |
