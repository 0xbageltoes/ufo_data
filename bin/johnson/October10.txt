| underneath a blue cigar-shaped object hovering 1.5 meters over a      |
| field in Rinckerode, Lower Saxony, Germany. The witness was a         |
| 42-year-old man named Hogl. They had thin legs, broad chests, large   |
| heads, and they wore rubber suits.They re-entered the craft via a     |
| ladder; the object then tilted to one side, and shot up and away at   |
| an angle. (Source: Illobrand von Ludwiger, Best UFO Cases--Europe, p. |

| Marville-Moutier-Brule, Eure-et-Loir department, France when he saw a |
| red ball of light above which was a greenish circular disc resembling |
| the cover of a washbasin, four meters in diameter. Inside the green   |
| dome he could see that there were four dark silhouettes. He was       |
| unable to advance towards the object, stopped by some unseen force.   |

| 1954 - At 6:30 a.m. Roger Thiriet, a jailer in the Ecouvres detention |
| center, was riding his motorcycle in Charmes-la-Cote,                 |
| Meurthe-et-Moselle, France when he suddenly saw an aluminum-colored   |
| object shaped like a plate, with a dome on top and two portholes. It  |
| was about two meters in diameter and one meter high. It took off      |
| immediately. (Sources: France Soir, October 21, 1954; Jacques Vallee, |

| 1954 - At 2:02 p.m. a math professor, Mr. Bon, observed a silvery     |
| disc about seven meters in diameter rise silently from a point about  |
| 250 meters to the side of the road in St-Germain-de-Livet, Calvados,  |
| France. Spinning, it dove towards the ground from an altitude of      |
| about 800 meters, then flew off horizontally at a dizzying speed.     |

| 1954 - Quarouble, Nord, France. At 11:30 p.m. a second landing with   |
| occupants was witnessed here by Marius Dewilde and his four-year-old  |
| son. A disc, six meters in diameter and about one meter tall, landed  |
| again on the railroad tracks. Seven little men about one meter tall   |
| emerged from the craft and spoke in an unknown language. The craft    |
| then vanished without noise or smoke. Traces larger than the first,   |
| and symmetrical, were observed. Dewilde refused to report the case to |
| the authorities. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the        |

| 1956 - At 10:30 p.m. three balls of light flew from north to south    |
| over Villamassargia, Sardegna, Italy and then circled an arriving 60  |
| foot long cigar-shaped object. There were several witnesses, and the  |
| sighting lasted 30 minutes. (Sources: Flying Saucer Review,           |

| 1957 - At 2:30 in the afternoon Mrs. Edward Yeager, who lived in a    |
| trailer on the Duanesburg Church Road in Schenectady, New York near   |
| Mariaville, saw a circular UFO go down behind a hill. Two minutes     |
| later it flew up again and was very bright. The next day she was      |
| feeding her animals and the animals ran away when the same or a       |
| similar object came down within two meters of the ground. Two dark    |
| little men came out of the craft and went into the woods. The object  |
| remained there for two minutes, then left. A search for the occupants |
| proved futile. A bus driver was reported to have seen two craft land  |
| in a nearby field at the same hour. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport |

| 1957 - Quebracoco, Brazil. On this night a naval officer, Miguel      |
| Espanhol and another man, were driving to Ceres, Goias State, Brazil  |
| when they saw a bright object that illuminated the countryside and    |
| flew down to ground level as their truck stalled. It was oval or      |
| saucer-shaped, over 150 meters in diameter and 40 meters deep, with a |
| dome supporting a long "aerial" with a red light on top. The bright   |
| light went off and the witnesses saw seven childlike beings, with     |
| long hair and luminous suits, who looked down at them for about three |
| minutes. The craft flew south and released a smaller disc, which flew |
| north. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of    |

| 1962 - A blue flash in the woods caused a tractor to stop running in  |
| Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires province, Argentina at 8:00 p.m. A        |
| nocturnal light lifted off from the ground and headed out to sea,     |

| 1966 - A person contacted the National UFO Reporting Center in        |
| Seattle to report that at around 9:00 p.m. in Live Oak, Florida a     |
| saucer-shaped object zapped energy from some powerlines while at the  |
| same time his pregnant mother received a mental message from the UFO  |
| not to pass on any information about the close encounter. (Source:    |

| 1966 - At 9:15 p.m. police officers Pastro and Thompson at Wanaque    |
| Reservoir in Wanaque, New Jersey observed a spherical object with a   |
| protrusion on one side emitting an extremely bright, blinding light   |
| that lit up the surrounding terrain. The UFO first hovered, and then  |
| moved around erratically at high speeds, making sharp turns and       |
| leaving a misty trail in its wake when it moved. (Source: NICAP UFO   |

| 1967 - At 12:45 a.m. Norman Cory was driving home in Lakewood,        |
| Colorado when he was flagged down by a tall man with a forked goatee. |
| The man was well over six feet tall, and was wearing a jacket with    |
| four gold bars on each shoulder. The man talked to the witness        |
| without moving his lips, presumably by telepathy. He asked where the  |
| North Star was, and what the date was; in response to the answer, he  |
| replied, "In your primitive time." He then asked what the witness had |
| in his mouth, and on being told it was a cigarette, he replied, "Oh,  |
| one of your primitive vices." He next asked about the car and said,   |
| "Oh, your primitive mode of transportation." When the witness asked   |
| him who he was and where he was from, the man replied, "I cannot tell |
| you now, but my colleagues and I will return." Then the man walked    |
| about four feet away from the roadside and vanished. Norman then      |
| heard a noise and looked up and saw hovering overhead a red object    |
| the size of a football field. With a whining noise it went straight   |
| up, and then was joined by two more objects, and all three shot       |
| away at a tremendous speed.  (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,  |

| 1967 - A forest fire lookout in Bow River Provincial Forest, Alberta, |
| Canada saw an oval object with a rim around the circumference and a   |
| green light on top. The light rotated, and when the object moved it   |
| turned white. The object hovered, then moved off and disappeared      |
| emitting four blue flames as it departed. (Source: London (ON)        |

| 1967 - At 7:00 p.m. three witnesses in Leek, Staffordshire, England   |
| using 7 x 50 binoculars saw a yellowish oval with a small dome on     |
| top, with a yellow light rotating around the dome. The object also    |
| had one red and two green body lights that pulsated on and off. As    |
| the lights pulsated, the color of the object changed from yellow to   |
| white. At 7:30 p.m. a similar object shot across the sky, stopped and |
| joined the first object (rendezvous). Both objects were gradually     |
| obscured by clouds. (Source: Roger Stanway & Anthony Pace, UFOs       |

| 1973 - At 3:00 a.m. two oddly shaped objects flew over a chemical     |
| plant in Yazoo City, Mississippi causing a power outage. At 6:00 p.m. |
| in Magnolia, Mississippi two witnesses, one named Brumfield, saw a    |
| round, shiny, metallic object on or near the ground. Something        |
| rectangular about the size of a small person emerged, perhaps a       |
| robot, and later re-entered, and the object took off. (Sources:       |

| 1973 - Fifteen objects with colored lights buzzed rooftops in New     |
| Lebanon, Ohio at 7:30 p.m. By 8:00 p.m. there had been at least 15    |
| different sightings of UFOs "covered with red, green and blue lights" |
| reported in southwestern Ohio, zooming about at tree-top level. Most  |
| sightings occurred between Dayton and Cincinnati, and were all        |
| classified as "unofficial" reports by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base |
| officials. None were detected on radar, apparently because they were  |
| flying too low. A New Lebanon Township, Ohio police officer reported  |
| his sighting shortly after 8 p.m. "He didn't want to say he saw it,   |
| but he said it," Montgomery County Sheriff's deputy Michael Sullivan  |
| reported. "The officer said it was oblong and covered with lights. It |
| appeared stationary in the sky about treetop level for several        |
| minutes until he tried to shine his cruiser spot light on it,"        |
| Sullivan said. "It then zoomed toward him and then shot straight up   |
| in the air... after he turned out his light...and disappeared."       |
| Sullivan said the UFO sightings lasted from a fleeting moment to      |
| twelve minutes. "They would be behind the trees and come up and fly   |
| away...as if you startled it or something," he said. A spokesman at   |
| Wright-Patterson AFB said there would be no attempt to investigate    |
| the sightings unless there was an "imminent danger." (Sources:        |

| another circular object that was reddish-pink in the center with      |
| rings of rainbow colors around its center. The circular or            |
| disc-shaped object with the rings of light was over the mountains;    |

| flew up into the sky and vanished. At sunset a local engineer, Raid   |
| A'anam, saw a black creature in the sky. He told police investigators |
