| 1948 - At 6:35 a.m. in San Martino, Lombardy, Italy bus driver        |
| Guiseppe Langiano and railway stationmaster Sr. Bavota saw a luminous |
| orange domed disc hovering about 10 meters above the ground at Fara   |
| Di Cigno which stopped 12 meters away from them. It was shaped like   |
| an inverted bowl, about 10-15 meters in diameter, and surmounted by a |
| transparent looking dome or “upside-down cup.” It was also emitting a |
| very bright beam of white light. A humanoid being floated down to the |
| ground from the object. He wore a stiff, metallic looking one-piece   |
| garment with heavy metallic gauntlets. He looked like a "big puppet"  |
| about 1.5 meters (5 feet) in height. He had "two round holes in place |
| of eyes.” When Sr. Langiano approached, it re-entered the UFO, which  |
| then took off. (Sources: Solas Boncompgni, UFO in Italia, p. 94;      |

| 1949 - In Dillon, Montana construction company owner Gosta Miller and |
| three others watched an unidentified flying object shaped like two    |
| plates attached face-to-face at 11:55 a.m. The object had a matte     |
| bottom and a bright aluminum top. The dimensions of the object were   |
| estimated to be 20-feet in diameter by 4-5 feet thick. It rocked or   |
| rotated in six cycles, descended, rocked, flew, and rocked. All of    |
| these maneuvers happened very fast. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project   |

| 1956 - A flying humanoid, described as a "silver-colored angel" was   |
| sighted flying north over a coal and iron plant in Birmingham,        |
| Alabama on this night. (Source: Alexander Mebane, Civilian Saucer     |

| 1962 - In Wurtland, Kentucky on the Ohio River at 9:50 p.m. EDT       |
| witnesses G.R. Wells and J. Lewis, using a 117x telescope, watched a  |
| small stationary object in the sky change in brightness and give off  |
| smoke. It remained in the same position for six minutes. (Sources:    |

| 1964 - At 9:00 p.m. Mr. R. Wold, a graduate student in anthropology,  |
| his wife, and two others in their car saw four huge red lights in a   |
| rectangular formation near the ground in Monticello, Wisconsin. There |
| was an intense white light above the four red lights, apparently      |
| attached to a large object that came to very near ground level,       |
| hovered, tilted, and flew off very fast as they were driving about    |
| two kilometers west of Monticello. The sighting lasted from three to  |
| four minutes. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns;  |

| 1965 - Two traveling salesmen were driving toward Fortaleza, Ceara    |
| State, Brazil at 11:20 p.m. when they saw something in the sky that   |
| looked like a bright red infrared lamp. It shined a beam of light     |
| down on their car. The object then descended just above the car, and  |
| the car then began to vibrate and its lights went out. They then saw  |
| another ray of light come down from the UFO onto their vehicle,       |
| whereupon the driver lost driving control and the vehicle skidded     |
| sideways and came to a stop. The red globe-shaped object then landed  |
| in front of the car, and two humanoids that resembled robots came out |
| from the UFO and began to approach. Both men got out; one had a rifle |
| that he fired at the entities. Suddenly there was a terrific          |
| explosion and the two men were blinded and could hear nothing.        |
| Fifteen minutes later they could see again, but the object and the    |
| two entities had already gone. (Source: Bob Pratt, UFO Danger Zone:   |

| 1968 - On this afternoon at around 1:45 p.m. Mrs. Mabel Walch and her |
| nephew, John were driving toward Newport by the shore of one of the   |
| Narrabeen Lakes in New South Wales, Australia. They saw a strange     |
| creature standing near the road in shallow water. The being was just  |
| over four feet tall and had a tough leathery dark gray skin, like an  |
| elephant. Its legs were round and thick. Its arms, or forelegs, were  |
| small, and as they watched it ambled out of the water with "a strange |
| shuffling walk, but quite fast." They only saw it briefly before it   |
| ran into the scrub. Mrs. Walch said "it's head reminded me of an      |
| anteater's trunk." The chin or probiscus was rigid and squared off at |
| the end, and "stuck down and out at an angle." It had no ears nor a   |
| tail, but it had small eyes. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, |

| 1968 - A schoolteacher named Mrs. Lietha was driving down the highway |
| with her son in Cochrane, Wisconsin when a red-orange object flew     |
| over and hovered above her car, causing the engine and lights to fail |
| as well as that of a second vehicle. The witnesses felt a sensation   |
| of weightlessness as well as heat from the object. Twenty minutes     |
| later a second vehicle interference case occurred in Waukesha,        |
| Wisconsin to a married couple named Blake. (Sources: (1) Brad Sparks, |

| 1968 - Late that same night in Itabara, Brazil several teenage girls  |
| were walking home when they encountered a tall man dressed totally in |
| black, who lept out of nowhere and flashed a beam of light at them.   |
| The figure then disappeared. Several days later two of the girls      |
| accosted by the stranger began to go into trances and speak in        |
| strange foreign tongues. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |

| 1975 - There were over 29 separate, independent UFO sightings and     |
| close encounters in Robeson, Hoke, Sampson, Bladen, Pitt, and         |
| Columbus counties in the early morning hours and again in the evening |
| centered on Lumberton, North Carolina. The first sighting occurred in |
| Lumberton at 1:45 a.m. on Highway 301 where a delta-shaped object the |
| size of a car was sighted by police officers hovering over a water    |
| tower. It then shot off to the north. At 2:05 a.m. two sheriff        |
| deputies in Hoke County pursued a delta-shaped object flying          |
| northeast toward Sampson County. At 2:20 a.m. a silent object with a  |
| searchlight flew over Highway 55 in Roseboro, North Carolina at 200   |
| feet altitude and lit up some pecan trees. At 3:30 a.m. a police      |
| officer on Highway 701 in Elizabethtown, North Carolina chased an     |
| object along Highway 701 before losing it into the cloud cover. That  |
| night at 10:30 p.m. a police officer named Godley in Grimesland,      |
| North Carolina sighted a disc-shaped object with red, blue and white  |
| lights that zigzagged through the sky. At 11:45 p.m. there were       |
| sightings north of Rowland in Robeson County and in Scotland County   |
| on Highway 71. At 11:47 p.m. a Sheriff's deputy named Lewis pursued a |
| V-shaped craft flying to the northeast toward Red Springs. (Sources:  |

| 1982 - At around three o'clock in the morning a woman schoolteacher   |
| in Bolingbrook, Illinois was awakened by a high pitched sound "like a |
| blender running in a box." She looked out at the cloudy, windy and    |
| cold weather conditions in her residential neighborhood and saw a     |
| bright blue domed disc-shaped object land next to some power lines.   |
| It lifted off and then landed a second time. The UFO had blue lights  |
| around the rim, and was only about 50 yards away. The blue light from |
| the object illuminated the area as bright as day. A street light went |
| out. The police received calls of power outages and blue flashes at   |
| the same time. (Sources: Fred Merritt, International UFO Reporter,    |
| July 1982, p. 6; UNICAT database, case 25, citing Fred Merritt).      |

| 1988 - A mother and daughter were awakened by a throbbing sensation   |
| and the sound of a tree falling in Gulf Breeze, Florida at 2:45 a.m.  |
| They looked out and saw a flying object only 50 feet above the        |
| ground, with a circle of orange "porthole-like" lights around its     |
| middle. A beam of light struck the mother, who had a strong feeling   |
| of being watched. The entire encounter lasted over two hours. The     |
| mother is also employed as a schoolteacher (see the other             |
| schoolteacher reports in 1968 and 1982 for similarities). (Source:    |

| 1992 - At around two o'clock in the morning in Cicero, Illinois a     |
| woman was lying in bed next to her husband when she heard her bedroom |
| window open, making a creaking sound. She then was unable to move.    |
| Moments later she saw three short humanoid creatures with chalky      |
| colored skin, big heads, and big eyes walking around her bed. They    |
| stood next to her. She was completely paralyzed and apparently her    |
| pet cat was also affected. She does not recall anything else, except  |
| that she awoke the next morning feeling empty. (Source: Albert S.     |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1992, case # 2159, citing Unsolved |
| UFO Sightings, Fall 1994).                                            |

| 1995 - At around three o'clock in the morning the witness was alone   |
| in his room in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany when several short     |
| gray entities appeared. Although frightened, he experienced           |
| telepathic communication with them and managed to blurt out "I love   |
| you, I love you!" The entities disappeared and three minutes later he |
| had an out-of-body experience in which he experienced himself sitting |
| outside his body as it lay on the bed. Suddenly he perceived a stream |
| of beautiful golden light pouring forth from the base of his spine.   |
| He believes that it was a "soul" the gray entities had injected into  |
| his body. After that he experienced a sensation of sublime happiness. |

| 1995 - On this afternoon several children playing at an elementary    |
| school in La Vega, Orocovis, Puerto Rico noticed a four-foot tall     |
| creature standing next to a tree nearby their playing field. The      |
| creature was gray colored with a large oval head and huge dark eyes.  |
| It seemed to be distracted, looking intently at the passing vehicles  |
| on a nearby road. It was moving its head rapidly from side to side.   |
| The frightened children quickly left the area, and when they returned |
| later the creature had gone. Later that same night a young man        |
| driving on State Route 155 on the outskirts of Orocovis, Puerto Rico  |
| was surprised to see a strange creature standing in the middle of the |
| road. The creature was described as gray in color, about 4 feet tall, |
| with a large oval shaped head and large black eyes. Momentarily       |
| stunned, he stepped on the gas in order to get away, but incredibly   |
| the short gray creature was able to run twice around the moving       |
| vehicle at terrific speed. Completely frightened, the witness sped up |
| some more and drove away from the area. Thinking he had hit the       |
| creature with his car, he looked back and saw it still standing in    |
| the middle of the road. It then ran quickly into the woods and        |
| disappeared. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |

| 1998 - Two men names Fisher and Schmidt took five photographs of a    |
| silent maneuvering silver ovoid or disc, that was oval on the top and |
| flat on the bottom. The sighting occurred on a clear day on the Pecos |
| River at Route 84 in De Baca County, New Mexico at 11:00 a.m. The UFO |
| was rapidly vibrating up and down. (Source: Nicholas Schmidt, MUFON   |
