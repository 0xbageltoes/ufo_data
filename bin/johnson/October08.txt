| balcony of the second floor of his house at 2:30 a.m. when he saw a   |
| luminous, white flying object stop in mid-air, only 20 meters away    |
| from him. Lights shone from the rear and the sides of the craft, and  |
| inside there was a small man dressed in black, wearing a mask or      |
| breathing apparatus that resembled the trunk of an elephant. "I was   |
| standing with both hands on the bar of my balcony, looking with       |
| astonishment at this strange object, when I suddenly felt as though I |
| were being drawn up toward the object by a magnet." Mr. Fili cried    |
| out in terror and woke up his neighbors. The object shot straight up, |
| emitting sparks, and it was lost to sight almost immediately.         |

| color from orange to red while doing so, then emitted red and blue    |
| sparks. The witness also thought she saw two beings by the roadside.  |

| 1981 - On this day at around eleven o'clock in the morning a famous   |
| color UFO photograph of a silvery disc-shaped object with a clear     |
| bubble dome was taken thirty miles north of Kelsey Bay on the eastern |
| side of Vancouver Island, British Columbia by Ms. Hannah McRoberts.   |
| The 25-year-old woman was traveling with family and took a photograph |
| of a mountain at the time and did not observe the UFO when she        |
| snapped the picture.The resulting photograph shows an object to the   |
| right of and above the peak and a plume of cloud. The photograph has  |
| been judged authentic by Dr. Richard F. Haines and Dr. James Harder,  |
| among others. (Sources: Gordon Creighton, FSR, December 1983, p. 16   |

| 1984 - At 7:40 a.m. a four foot tall furry being wearing a helmet was |
| seen on the ground in Prato Principato, Compania, Italy carrying a    |
| forked tool. A box-shaped UFO took off vertically and flew off        |
| rapidly to the southwest. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 261; |

| 1989 - At 11:00 p.m. Anna L was returning home with her husband in    |
| Primorskiy Kray, Vladivostok, Russia when she fell to the pavement,   |
| spinning and yelling in a panic, “Please don’t take me, I do not want |
| to fly away, leave me alone, don’t touch me!” Something invisible     |
| appeared to be pulling Anna by her arms and legs. Her husband tried   |
| to calm her and yelled at her that there was no one around. He then   |
| tried to pick her up, but to his surprise she proved to be unusually  |
| heavy and he was unable to lift her. A crowd gathered, including some |
| local militia, and the police thought her husband had struck her and  |
| they wanted to arrest him. At this point Anna calmed down and was     |
| able to rise from the pavement. In the morning she felt extremely     |
| depressed, and her temperature rose to 38.5 degrees. She then         |
| described what she believed had happened to her: She remembered       |
| walking with her husband when suddenly everything around her became   |
| black; the road, posts, and houses had all vanished and a black       |
| void surrounded her. From this void emerged three enormous figures    |
| over two meters in height, wearing silvery clothing. She next heard a |
| loud rumbling noise, resembling something that would be made by       |
| machinery. After approaching her the figures pulled her by her arms,  |
| but she resisted and began screaming at them. She finally began to    |
| fade out of consciousness, and her body seemed to disappear. She came |
| to the next morning. Doctors could find no bruises nor abrasions on   |
| her arms, and strangely her clothing did not have any traces of mud   |
| on them eventhough she had fallen in a puddle of water when she       |
| claimed to have struggled with the invisible entities. (Source:       |

| 1989 - At 11:05 p.m. a witness reported that a huge white light       |
| appeared over Londonderry, New Hampshire and changed color into       |
| a dull red, and then back to a dull white light. A second witness saw |
| that the light was actually a triangular object with a big            |
| rectangular white light on the back end and a red light near the      |
| apex. It moved slowly, making a roaring sound, and was definitely     |
| larger than a house. Its estimated altitude was 2000 feet and its     |
| distance 3000 feet. (Source: Cheryl L. Powell, MUFON investigation    |

| 1990 - Russian Air Force jet fighters were scrambled after radar      |
| contact was reported with two bogeys over T'Bilisi, Georgia at 11:22  |
| a.m. The pilots saw two cigar-shaped objects, the first one reported  |
| to be two kilometers long and the second one 400 meters long. These   |
| huge objects moved horizontally at great speed. There was both ground |
| and airborne radar contact with the targets, and the incident lasted  |
| 20 minutes. (Sources: Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1992, p. 72;       |

| 1992 - An ovoid UFO silently hovered over a park in Barnsley, South   |
| Yorkshire, England at 6:45 p.m. for 70 minutes. It shot away faster   |
| than any plane, according to the four teenage witnesses. (Source: UFO |

| 1992 - Late on this evening a woman reportedly had an abduction       |
| experience in Gardendale, Alabama. Leah Haley saw a moon-like         |
| object outside her house, and when she saw the real moon              |
| and recognized the second object wasn't it, a beam of light engulfed  |
| her and transported her onboard the craft. She then claims that she   |
| found herself in a "contemporary" looking room with tables adorned    |
| with crystal figurines. She also saw slips of paper underneath the    |
| figurines, with the names of other people to be abducted that night.  |
| A female, human-looking alien then came into the room. She had short  |
| brown hair and wore a red and gold blouse with black trim. She        |
| told the witness that her people "were trapped in a time dimension    |
| and needed our help to get out." From her limited recollection she    |
| recalled that the beings then performed some painful physical exam    |
| procedures on her that she was made to forget. (Source: Albert S.     |

| 1993 - A fifty foot in diameter disc-shaped object hovered over the   |

| 30 red lights and flew at treetop level, and made a sound like a jet. |
