| 1954 - There are 20 UFO reports recorded in UFOCAT for this day in    |
| 1954: one humanoid report from Michigan, one luminous daylight disc   |
| from Holland, and the rest were from France. |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - While driving to work in Dearborn, Michigan Lawrence Cardenas, |
| age 41, a laundry employee, saw 15 strange men wearing dark green     |
| uniforms along the side of the road to his right. They had cylinders  |
| on their shoulders, tight fitting skullcaps with pointed peaks in     |
| front, and heavy goggles. They were of medium height, and a taller    |
| man seemed to be their leader and giving them instructions. About 80  |
| meters away from them was a 4-meter high craft with colored lights,   |
| flickering on and off. The witness drove away as fast as he could.    |

| object landed on the ground. They started to approach the three-meter |
| long object when it took off from the ground with a whistling sound.  |
| The pointed section of the object was yellow; the rest of the object  |
| was reddish-brown. Two foot-like appendages extended to the ground    |
| from the fore section. (Note: Vallee           |

| 133.4 degrees azimuth, 55 degrees elevation. The observer first saw   |
| one object that was white or metallic in color, round in shape, and   |
| the size of the head of a pin. Four smaller objects, traveling        |
| very fast, then came out from the first object. The Las Vegas AFS     |

| 1968 - At around three a.m. Guy Lemargue, age 16, was walking with a  |
| friend on a small country road in Roncenay, Aude, France when they    |
| both saw, about 150 yards away, a disc-shaped red-orange luminous     |
| UFO, about 50 feet in diameter and feet in height, resting on legs.   |
| It had a row of portholes all around the edge. Beside it, several     |
| luminous entities of small stature were “maneuvering” with very       |
| strong lights sources in their hands, which they shone on the ground. |
| They walked or floated two feet above the ground, and sometimes made  |
| sudden gliding leaps of a hundred yards. One creature approached to   |
| within 15 feet of the teens, and they reported that they could see    |
| that its hands were shaped like pincers or crab-like claws. Realizing |
| that their presence had been detected, the boys ran away. (Sources:   |

| 1971 - At two a.m. Mr. Ron Foreman heard a loud noise outside         |
| followed by a "whoosh" come from outside his home in West Malling,    |
| Kent, England. His television cut out and the room lights went dim.   |
| He opened the back door and saw a seven foot tall "creature" standing |
| there, clad in a silver suit and wearing a transparent helmet. It     |
| "glided" away over a fence, but later returned with a second entity,  |
| surrounded by a haze of light. Foreman went for the police. (Source:  |

| 1972 - SAM missiles were fired upon a luminous orange sphere that was |
| at a very high altitude hovering over Hanoi, Vietnam in the broad     |
| daylight. It stayed in place for an hour and 20 minutes. (Sources:    |

| 1973 - The witnesses, Claude Champoux, Florent Papillon and a man     |
| called J. R. were camping near a lake--Lac-aux-Bleuets, Quebec,       |
| Canada--when they heard a loud engine sound coming from a nearby      |
| field. When they went to look the men spotted an oval-shaped,         |
| metallic object on the ground. The UFO was silvery in color and       |
| emitted flourescent-like orange lights that changed colors to blue,   |
| and red. A strange humanoid figure, metallic or robot-like in         |
| appearance, stood next to the object. It was wearing either a         |
| reflective metallic suit or was itself made out of metal. The being's |
| body emitted bright silvery flashes. While on the ground the object   |
| emitted a sound resembling that of a transformer. Soon the strange    |
| character disappeared inside the object, which then rose up, moving   |
| up and down like a yo-yo, it then accelerated and disappeared at high |
| speed. They estimated the craft to have been about 600 feet in        |
| diameter. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1973, |

| 1973 - At 9:30 p.m. a Franklin County, Ohio man found the landing     |
| site of an object he had seen hovering near his home earlier in the   |
| evening. The site was in a field of waist-high weeds about a          |
| quarter mile south of Hall Road, west of Outerbelt, Ohio. Weeds had   |
| been crushed to the ground in a semi-oval area 20 feet x 30 feet.     |
| There were no scorch marks. The object had swooped down in a zigzag   |
| pattern and dropped below trees. Several dozen other sightings were   |
| reported from the area. (Sources: Robert Gribble, UFO Reporting       |

| 1975 - At 3:30 a.m. two men, Philips and Brown, had a close encounter |
| with a domed disc-shaped object hovering over a dairy farm seven      |
| miles south of Corning, California and illuminating the dairy "like   |
| daylight". It emitted a bright red light, and made a humming sound.   |
| Cows fled from area. The UFO hovered for 3-5 minutes, then took off   |
| and was out-of-sight "in the blink of an eye." An inside occupant was |
| also seen. (Sources: Corning (CA) Daily Observer, October 16, 1975;   |

| 1980 - At one o'clock in the morning in Rosedale, Victoria, Australia |
| 54-year-old caretaker George Blackwell heard a screeching whistle,    |
| and then saw a 25 foot wide domed disc or top-shaped UFO              |
| withmulticolored body lights and a black tube appendage that landed   |
| on the ground at the cattle station called White Acres. He got to     |
| within 50 feet of it on his motorcycle before it took off with a wave |
| of heat and an explosive sound, showering down debris, and left a     |
| black ring on the ground at the landing site. In addition, 10,000     |
| gallons of water were missing from a nearby water tank. During the    |
| close encounter a horse galloped away and cattle bellowed, panicked   |
| and ran. Mr. Blackwell suffered from physiological effects including  |
| headaches and vomiting, and diarrhea that lasted for a week.          |

| foot long gray rectangular craft, 20 times the apparent size of the   |
| Moon. It was seen at an estimated distance of 1500 feet, and had six  |
| lights on the bottom. It was followed by 20 smaller glowing ovoid     |
| objects, and the air got cold as the UFOs passed over. At 9:10 p.m.   |
| in Gastonia, North Carolina a 45-year-old man was in his backyard     |
| closing up his shop when he saw a glowing oval or fat cigar-shaped    |
| object flying at 2,500 feet altitude that had three bands of a bluish |
| white corona around its mid-section. It had intense beams of light    |
| coming from the two ends. Five minutes later (9:15 p.m.) in Stanley,  |
| North Carolina a 38-year-old mechanic and his girlfriend were out     |
| stargazing when they spotted a bright, light yellow glowing           |
| cone-shaped UFO. It was surrounded by four misty white cigar-shaped   |
| nocturnal lights. Three minutes later (9:18 p.m.) in Moonville, South |
| Carolina three witnesses saw a large cylinder with an orange glow and |
| a yellow flame that flew overhead and to the east; it had 5 small     |
| lights around the object. (Sources: (1, 2, & 3) Donald M. Ware, MUFON |

| 1992 - At 10:30 p.m. an 81-year-old woman in Mount Katahdin Iron      |
| Works Park, Maine had a close encounter with an eight-foot            |
| wide circle of blinking lights at eye level near her window. The      |
| object was twice the apparent size of the Moon with a dozen lights.   |

| 1997 - Dr. Carlos Munoz and Enrique Bermudez were parked in an        |
| isolated wooded area near Punta Arenas, Chile at 11:30 p.m. They had  |
| stepped out of the car when they heard something moving close to      |
| them, and they could perceive small shadows nearby. They next saw a   |
| fluorescent tube of light in a vertical position, about 30 meters     |
| away. It was suspended about a meter from the ground. It was          |
| pulsating and was red andwhite in color. They ran to their car and    |
| grabbed a camcorder in a futile attempt to videotape the object. They |
| got back in their car and started driving away, when suddenly they    |
| heard a loud engine noise and a black sports vehicle with tinted      |
| windows drove past them at high speed. Simultaneously, their          |
| vehicle's instruments malfunctioned. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, case |
