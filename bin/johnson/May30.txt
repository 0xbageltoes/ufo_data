| 1940 - During the morning in Toledo, Ohio a dark ellipsoid object     |
| flew toward the northeast making a sizzling sound, then made a 90     |
| degree turn. Its flame-like color changed from red to orange and then |
| to yellow. (Source: Richard Hall: From Airships to Arnold: A          |

| 1953 - On this day a small bright blue UFO made irregular motions in  |
| the sky over Palmerston North, New Zealand. "Angel hair" fell to the  |
| ground. (Source: Leonard Stringfield, Situation Red: The UFO Siege,   |

| 1954 - Five men and a woman on the doorstep of a house in East        |
| Malvern, Victoria, Australia watched an orange, oval-shaped UFO       |
| appear in the sky at close range at 12:25 a.m. The UFO maneuvered in  |
| a downward curve and then pulled up. A cloud of yellow smoke and      |
| flame was seen at the rear. Three of the witnesses saw shapes that    |
| looked like human-shaped shadows inside the craft. (Sources:          |

| 1958 - At 9:20 p.m. a science writer in Ural'sk, Kazakstan, USSR      |
| watched as a red light made the start of a pattern to land at the     |
| south edge of an airfield, but then stopped, stood motionless for a   |
| few moments, made a 90 degree turn, stopped again, and after several  |
| minutes got smaller. A second red light joined the first, then they   |
| separated and silently flew away. (Sources: Lloyd Mallan, Official    |

| 1965 - While sunbathing on the roof of her lake cottage on Lake       |
| Mason, Wisconsin at around 2 p.m., Ms. Gorzelle, age 45, witnessed a  |
| shiny disc-shaped object approach in a straight line from over the    |
| lake. She described it as metallic, about 40 feet wide, and with a    |
| row of windows and a dome on top. The domed disc hovered over her     |
| cottage property less than 200 feet away, then landed on tripod       |
| landing gear that emerged from the underside of the craft. From her   |
| roof she was looking down on the landed object. In one of the windows |
| she was able to see an occupant. When the occupant saw her on the     |
| roof, he beckoned to another figure that appeared at a second window. |
| Both of them seemed to be rather short--under four feet tall--with    |
| large, baldheads, slits for mouths and small noses. They stared at    |
| her for what seemed to be a long time. The next thing she recalled    |
| was watching the object depart rapidly in the direction of the        |
| setting sun. There was a time lapse of at least four hours in her     |
| memory. Under self hypnosis, the witness was able to recall walking   |
| up to the UFO and being led up a stairway into the vehicle by the two |
| occupants. One of them held a small box that he opened, and inside    |
| the box was a dark-colored crystal that gave off a vapor or smoke. He |
| held it in front of her face and the witness jumped back, but when he |
| again passed it close to her face she discovered that the fumes were  |
| odorless. The next thing she remembers was being back on her roof     |
| watching the object depart. She had headaches following the incident. |
| She would have another UFO encounter three months later. (Sources:    |

| 1967 - Shortly before 8:00 p.m. an orange glowing mushroom-shaped UFO |
| zig-zagged over Highway 57, southwest of Palmerston North, New        |
| Zealand. It was humming and making a swishing sound. There were two   |
| witnesses to the close encounter, and the entire event lasted 12      |
| minutes. The same or a similar object was seen at Ohakea Air Force    |
| Base by two more witnesses a short time later. (Source: APRO          |

| 1967 - At around 3:00 a.m. a five meter long cigar-shaped object was  |
| seen at very low altitude over a farm in Ribeirao Pires, Sao Paulo    |
| State, Brazil. It had 4 legs for landing gear. A short humanoid was   |
| seen leaning against a small window in the craft, which shot away at  |
| an extremely fast speed. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database,   |

| 1969 - The witnesses were staying in a "caravan" camper on Cradle     |
| Hill in Warminster, Wiltshire, England and were out looking for any   |
| mysterious lights that might appear in the night sky. At 11:30 p.m.   |
| they spotted a crimson red, oval-shaped light flying over the area.   |
| It was completely silent. A short time later one of the witnesses     |
| noticed a luminous, cloud-like humanoid figure standing by a nearby   |
| gate. It appeared to be covered entirely by tiny pinpricks of white   |
| light. No facial features could be seen. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,  |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1969, case 901, citing Arthur Shuttlewood,  |

| 1971 - A woman was cutting grass for her rabbits in Dannes,           |
| Pas-de-Calais, France at 2:05 p.m. when she sighted a dark UFO in a   |
| large chalk quarry about half a mile away. The object was shaped like |
| an overturned basin and was hovering near the ground. Beside it a     |
| small being with a large head was moving about, and it looked like he |
| might have been collecting chalk samples. After approximately ten     |
| minutes he was "sucked up" into the object, which took off at once.   |
| No ground traces were found. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted          |

| 1974 - On this day a 200 foot long cigar-shaped object making a       |
| humming sound passed within 500 feet of a farmhouse in Regent, North  |
| Dakota. It caused static electricity and radio interference. (Source: |

| 1990 - A mother and her two young sons were resting at home in        |
| Calumet City, Illinois at 10:15 p.m. when they noticed a gray domed   |
| disc-shaped object hovering over a house across the street. The       |
| object was described as about 30 feet in diameter with bright white   |
| windows around its circumference. The windows were wider at the       |
| bottom than at the top, and a dark line seemed to rotate inside the   |
| windows. The object emitted a fuzzy white glow from its flat bottom.  |
| It then drifted slowly away toward the southwest. That same night the |
| younger boy had a strange dream-like experience. He found himself at  |
| the nearby schoolyard where he saw several landed gray domed discs. A |
| short gray-skinned being befriended the boy, then accompanied him     |
| back home. The boy remembers being told several "things" that he      |
| could not remember. (Source: Francis L. Ridge, Regional Encounters,   |
| p. 127).                                                              |

| 1993 - Bourgata, Israel - Hannah Somech awoke at three o'clock in the  |
| morning when she heard her dog barking. She got up and went           |
| downstairs to her kitchen and looked out to the garden through a      |
| glass door when she saw her dog literally fly through the air and     |
| slam against a wall. Shocked and terrified, she bravely opened the    |
| door but was confronted by an invisible wall: she could literally go  |
| no further. She next saw an eight-foot tall giant in bright           |
| coveralls. She thought it might be a robber when she heard a voice    |
| inside her head that said, "You think I am a thief?"                  |
|                                                                       |
| "What did you do with my dog!", she asked furiously. "He disturbed    |
| me, as you do now," the giant spoke telepathically, without moving    |
| its lips. "I could crush you, but I don't want to. Just leave me      |
| alone, I am busy." The woman ran back to her bedroom to wake up her   |
| husband, but when they both came downstairs the giant had             |
| disappeared. In the garden, they found huge footprints, 16 inches in  |
| length. After the encounter Hannah suffered from fatigue, headaches   |
| and muscle pain. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |
