| 1945 - On this afternoon Allied POWs on the ground watched a white,   |
| football-shaped object following a bomber at 18,000 feet between      |
| Heydebreck and Kedzierzyn, Poland. On the same day there was an       |
| unexplained skyquake in Louisville, Kentucky.  (Sources: (1) Jenny    |

| 1950 - At around 4:00 a.m. a radar blip was detected approaching the  |
| Kodiak Islands at 1,800 mph over Kodiak, Alaska, according to         |
| airborne radar. It then buzzed several planes and boats. A U.S. Navy  |
| plane failed to intercept the UFO because it was too highly           |
| maneuverable. It had two orange lights rotating about the center, and |
| made no detectable sound. (Sources: Bruce Maccabee, MUFON UFO         |

| 1951 - A saucer-shaped object hovered next to a test balloon 50 miles |
| southeast of Holloman AFB, New Mexico. It grew in dimensions, and     |
| flashed once every second. It flew off to the west. (Source: Loren E. |

| 1952 - At 12:20 a.m. a radar station at Murphy's Dome, Alaska tracked |
| a UFO moving at 1,500 mph at 23,000 feet. Three F-94s were vectored   |
| in. There were solid radar returns on the ground radar as well as two |
| airborne radars. At one point the short range radar stopped working,  |
| preventing anything being tracked close to the station. The third jet |
| approached to within 200 meters of the UFO, but pulled up for fear of |
| a mid-air collision. No radar malfunctions were found. (Sources:      |

| 1971 - Three bus company employees were towing a bus from East        |
| Budleigh to Exmouth, England when they saw three orange balls of      |

| 1971 - Two boys, Stewart and Lyle Leppke of Peabody, Kansas were      |
| doing their early morning farm chores at around dawn when they        |
| observed a lighted object in the cattle lot. When they flashed their  |
| light on it, they saw a diminutive figure less than two feet tall     |
| moving about near a UFO with small windows that was hovering just     |
| above the ground. They immediately went to the house to tell their    |
| mother who called the sheriff; but the UFO had departed by the time   |
| the sheriff got there. The boys said the object hovered a few feet    |
| off the ground, and when it departed it tipped to one side and then   |
| sped rapidly up and away. (Sources: Peabody (KS) Gazette Herald,      |

| 1971 - At 9:05 p.m. Richard Williams, his wife, and son were driving  |
| toward Willard, Ohio from the north when they saw a low flying object |
| that "looked like a bat" coming toward their car. "On the middle of   |
| each wing there seemed to be a rocket or a jet engine, and it had red |
| and white lights on each wing and on the tails." They thought at      |
| first it was a plane crashing. It was 25-30 feet in diameter and came |
| to within 100 feet off their car and then took off toward the east.   |
| There was a transparent "cockpit" in the front of the object, through |
| which could be seen the movements of some kind of humanoid creature,  |
| silhouetted by a flashing light behind it. Multiple reports of UFO    |
| sightings this night came from Tiro, Sandusky, and other sections of  |
| Huron County, Ohio around the same time. (Sources: Norwalk (OH)       |

| submitted to a physical exam, and allegedly had something             |
| implanted into her head. During the exam, the aliens were             |
| particularly interested in her hands and wrists. A tube was inserted  |
| into her body and she could feel fluid or drugs going through her     |
| arms. They communicated with her using telepathy, and told her that   |
| she would perform some important task in the future. (Source: Thomas  |

| 2002 - At 8:00 p.m. Robert La Marco and his family saw a very bright  |
| disk while driving to basketball practice in Hazlet, New Jersey. The  |
| UFO hovered, then shot off to the east at incredible speed towards    |
| the Atlantic Ocean. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell,     |

| 2003 - The witness had just left work and was driving home when he    |
| reached a place by a small lake in Prospect, Connecticut at 10:03     |
| p.m. He noticed someone walking along the road so he flashed on his   |
| high beams. He then saw the figure walk out from the side of the      |
| road, stop in the center for a second, then continue across. It was   |
| grayish in color and it was walking on two legs, but it ambulated     |
| like an ape walks, swaying as it walked erect. The feet were small    |
| with brownish-black areas on the side. When it reached the other side |
| it stopped and looked at the witness, waving its skinny arms. Lights  |
| appeared behind it. The man described the creature as around six feet |
| tall, with large, foot-long pointy ears. The eyes were dark black     |
| with no apparent nose. Although the weather was cold, the witness did |
| not see any condensed breath come from its small mouth. The mouth had |
| a red silver strip on top. As the witness drove by he looked back to  |
| see the creature still standing by the road, and the woods behind the |
| creature suddenly lit up like day. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,        |

| 2003 - Starting at 9:16 p.m. a bell-shaped UFO with four lights was   |
| viewed for 26 minutes over Crawfordsville, Indiana. At 10:00 p.m. a   |
| videotape was made of a round, red light that emitted a shower of     |
| lights in Oxnard, California. The object moved back and forth in the  |
| sky. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, January |

| 2004 - A lighted triangular craft was sighted flying low and slowly   |
| over traffic on I-35 in Olathe, Kansas at 6:45 p.m. An hour later a   |
| similar triangle was spotted over Deridder, Louisiana. (Source: Peter         |

| 2005 - Four discs flew east over the mountains in Rancho Cucamonga,   |
| California at 9:16 a.m.; they were shiny and reflective like polished |
| aluminum. A small propeller aircraft just south of the mountains      |
| started to approach the area and the four objects vanished            |
| immediately as the aircraft came into view. (Source: George A. Filer  |
