| 1950 - At Selfridge AFB in Macomb County, Michigan two radars tracked |
| an unusual object in the sky at 11:10 p.m. whose presence was         |
| confirmed with a visual sighting by a witness named Mattson. The UFO  |
| was visible for four minutes and made wide swings and abrupt turns.   |

| 1953 - A USAF F-84 fighter jet flying out of Luke AFB near Quartzite, |
| Arizona filmed 30 feet of 16mm gun camera film that showed a cigar or |
| fuselage-shaped object with a long contrail in a clear sky. The       |
| length of the object was estimated to be 100 meters, and the duration |
| of the sighting was seven minutes. Project Blue Book lists the        |
| explanation as aircraft, but UFO investigators Richard Hall and       |
| Jacques Vallee didn't agree with the interpretation. (Sources:        |

| a father and son were camping near a lake at Bowna Hume Weir, New     |
| South Wales when they saw a disc-shaped UFO with four windows on the  |
| ground not far away. Four humanoid figures could be seen between the  |
| object and a nearby fire. Their encounter lasted 45 minutes.          |

| 1966 - Several civilians in Oswego, New York reported that an object  |
| that flew toward the south slowly, hovered, and then came within 15   |
| meters of them. It finally flew off toward the southwest. (Source:    |

| Chicago Heights, Illinois at around 8 p.m. They changed color to      |
| orange and then to red just before fading from sight. They also       |
| appeared to be giving off sparks. (Source: Chicago American, March 4, |

| 1967 - A group of high school students came upon two glowing pyramid  |
| shaped objects sitting in the middle of the road in Plantation,       |

| 1967 - Mr. and Mrs. Fellows were driving toward Centre Sandwich, New  |
| Hampshire around midnight when they saw an illuminated clam-shaped    |
| object going up and down in the sky "like a yo-yo" near Red Hill. It  |
| was turning from white to greenish blue, and followed their car for   |
| 20 minutes until they reached Route 113. It left to the northeast.    |
| They reported feeling several "pinging" electric discharges as it     |
| left, and their dog was very nervous during the observation. It made  |
| an electric motor sound. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, April      |

| 1968 - A lawyer's home in Castelar, Argentina was flooded by a bright |
| blue light at 12:45 a.m., and their TV set went blank. A thunderous   |
| roar like a jet aircraft flying close by was heard next, and a ball   |
| of light was seen shooting off at a dizzying speed. (Source: Oscar A. |

| 1972 - At around one o'clock in the morning police officer Williams   |
| of Loveland, Ohio slowed his patrol car when he saw what looked like  |
| a dog by the side of the road. It stood up, and was tail-less         |
| creature with leather like skin and a face like a frog or a lizard, 3 |
| or 4 ft tall. It leaped over the guardrail and went down the          |
| embankment to the river. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,     |

| 1973 - Around noon in Kampala, Uganda on the shore of Lake Victoria   |

| 1974 - A delta-shaped object made complex light signals from both     |
| leading edges of the UFO was 6:30 a.m. in Avion, France. According to |
| the witness named Dejaeger, the object than shrank in size to a dot   |
| in the sky. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 143).             |

| 1975 - Four photographs were taken of two luminous balls,             |
| approximately 0.35 meters in diameter, over a hedge in Montsireigne,  |
| France at 10:30 p.m. They rose into the sky and were gone. (Source:   |

| 1976 - At four o'clock in the afternoon a 12-year-old boy named Ojeda |
| saw a 40-foot in diameter shiny disc in a clearing in the forest in   |
| Refrigerio, Brazil. It sat upon some type of metallic platform. Two   |
| beings in shiny suits, less than five feet tall, were seen outside    |
| making repairs. Blinded by a flash of intense light, he was captured  |
| and taken aboard the craft. The beings communicated with the boy      |
| using telepathy, and gave him a physical exam on an exam table. He    |
| had skin burns resulting from the flash of light. (Source: David F.   |

| 1976 - Three hours after the abduction of the 12-year-old in Brazil,  |
| a luminous green sphere with a luminous tail nearly collided with a   |
| French Air Force T-33 jet over Tours, France. The UFO climbed         |
| vertically, levelled out, came at the aircraft, and the two-meter     |
| wide sphere passed within 30 cm when it passed over the right wing.   |
| It didn't show up at all on radar. (Source: Dominique Weinstein,      |

| 1980 - Four family members of a family in Buen Consejo, Rio Piedras,  |
| Puerto Rico were awakened at midnight by noises on their patio where  |
| they kept caged rabbits. When they looked out they were stunned to    |
| see five strange looking beings inspecting the cages. Two of the      |
| beings were five feet tall and the others were three tall and more    |
| heavy-set. The tall thin creatures wore brown one-piece brown         |
| outfits, and had grayish skin with large ears, large eyes, and large  |
| flat noses with large thick lips. Their fingers were large and were   |
| connected by a thin membrane. Both carried a bright metallic-looking  |
| sphere in their right hands. The smaller beings were similar in       |
| appearance, except they had large bright medallions hanging from      |
| their necks and belts. A fifth witness later saw the same five beings |
| enter a landed disc-shaped craft on a roadway near the village.       |

| 1992 - At 6:40 p.m. in Warner, New Hampshire a mother and her son,    |
| age 10, saw lights in the sky when they turned a corner in the road.  |
| They stopped the car and went into a field to get a better view. They |
| saw a white triangular UFO flying through the sky, making a whirring  |
| sound. They continued to watch until the object passed behind and was |
| hidden by some nearby trees. (Source: MUFON investigation case files, |
| case no. 960507S).                                                    |

| 1992 - Thirty minutes later in the same county, the same or a similar |
| triangular object flew over nearby Bradford, New Hampshire . It had   |
| multi-colored lights and made a humming sound. That evening there     |
| were other UFO sightings in Salisbury, and Claremont, New Hampshire.  |
| At 7:50 p.m. a huge triangle with pulsating bluish-white lights was   |
| seen by a Mr. Cross flying just over the treetops along Rte 3-A near  |
| the I-93 overpass in Concord, Merrimack County, New Hampshire. He     |
| stopped his car and watched as the UFO flew overhead during a         |
| snowstorm, making a sound like increasing rain on a canvas tent.      |
