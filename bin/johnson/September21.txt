| 1950 - Provincetown, Massachusetts. At 9:52 a.m. an M.I.T. research   |
| associate and Air National Guard Major M. H. Ligda observed the radar |
| tracking of a UFO during an M.I.T. tracking of a flight of two USAF   |
| F-84 or F-86 jet fighters. The object's speed was calculated as 22    |
| miles/minute (1,200 mph), and it executed a turn of 11-12 Gs          |
| acceleration during the one-minute observation. (Sources: Project     |

| 1968 - At 10:30 p.m. a dark disc-shaped object with a series of       |
| square windows, rotating clockwise, moved slowly and silently through |
| the skies over Linton, Indiana.  It was half the size of a pea at     |
| arm's length, and its lights were large, three-quarters the height of |
| the object itself. (Source: Francis L. Ridge, NICAP investigation     |

| 1972 - Three witnesses were driving in Rougemont, Quebec, Canada at   |
| 12:30 a.m. when they witnessed a Saturn-shaped disc making pendulum   |
| movements in the sky, then landing on Mount Rouge. The object         |
| was 100-150 feet in diameter and had a row of oval windows. The       |
| driver, Mr. G. Poisson, flashed his car headlights at the UFO, and    |
| the object responded by diving and coming straight at them, passing   |
| only 30 feet overhead. (Sources: Wido Hoville, Canadian UFO Report,   |

| 1972 - At 5:40 a.m. in Santa Isabel, Cordoba province, Argentina Sr.  |
| Teodoro Merlo, age 56, a maintenance worker at the Ika-Renault car    |
| factory, unlocked and entered a company washroom and was surprised to |
| encounter a "man" nearly eight-feet tall sitting on the long          |
| washbasin. The being's complexion was very pallid, and he had a bald  |
| head with high, pointed ears. The giant wore a very tight-fitting,    |
| dark blue one-piece garment. He noticed the uniform was glove-tight   |
| at the wrists, and that the being held his right forefinger below his |
| nose. The figure suddenly vanished unaccountably from the washroom,   |
| in which the temperature was abnormally high. Lights in the building  |
| went on and off by themselves. Sr. Merlo later suffered eye           |
| irritation, repeated headaches, and back pain in his lumbar region    |
| for eight days. The witness reported that he again saw the face of    |
| the entity in a mirror on the bus the next day. (Sources: Oscar A.    |

| 1974 - In Huntsville, Ontario, Canada Oscar Magocsi, a Hungarian-born |
| radio technologist, claimed he encountered a landed disc-shaped       |
| object and came in contact with its occupants for the first time.     |
| They were human in appearance and said they called themselves "the    |
| Psycheans". He claimed to have been given a ride in their craft,      |
| flying over Lake Ontario, and was then transported to other worlds.   |
| At 9:20 p.m. in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada four teenage girls had a |
| ten minute close encounter with a UFO that caused them some lasting   |
| physiological effects. (Sources: (1) John Colombo, UFOs over Canada:  |

| 1978 - At 7:40 p.m. a young man was walking near a field in Cosenza,  |
| Calabria, Italy when the area was suddenly illuminated by a bright    |
| light and he could no longer see his surroundings. Shortly later, he  |
| saw an oval-shaped object resting on the ground on top of a nearby    |
| hill. A human-like figure stood by the object. It wore two            |
| antennae-like protrusions on its head. Frightened, he began to        |
| run away but fell down while four humanoids approached him, making    |
| huge, bizarre, bounding-like jumps. Next, he fainted, and when he     |
| awoke he again saw that the four 5-foot-tall entities were closer,    |
| wearing buttoned jackets, backpacks, and helmets with antennae. Their |
| hands appeared to be shaped like pincers. This frightened him and he  |
| fainted again, and when he finally woke up sometime later everything  |
| had vanished. Coincidentally, at around the same time (8:00 p.m.) a   |
| bright light approached an Italian Air Force F-104 jet over Piacenza, |
| Emilia-Romagna, Italy. It disappeared after three minutes. (Sources:  |

| degrees. The top one approached to within 450 meters distance, and    |
| hovered for three minutes. When accelerating a red glow was visible   |
| from the rear. During the encounter they experienced radio            |
| interference on their VHF mobile transceiver. (Sources: Richard F.    |

| humanoids wearing silvery outfits and large black boots briefly       |
| emerged. A smaller headless robot-like entity with small knobs on its |
| chest also accompanied them. Landing traces were reportedly found,    |
| including a 60-foot wide circle in which there were four depressions  |
| arranged in a diamond pattern. Each imprint was two inches deep and   |
| six inches in diameter. Holes in the ground looked as though someone  |
| had taken soil samples. The event was widely publicized around the    |
| world, although the facts of the case were greatly distorted.         |

| near Frunze, Kyrgistan. The UFO seemed to be rotating, and emitted a  |
| coherent cone of yellow light. When it touched down to the ground it  |
| set fire to a meadow, leaving behind four burned spots 135 feet       |
| in diameter. (Source: Michael Hesemann, UFOs: The Secret History, p.  |

| 1998 - At 2:00 a.m. a slow-moving, V-shaped UFO displaying red        |
| and white rapidly flashing lights, was seen passing overhead by       |
| several citizens and police between Nantwich and Crewe, Cheshire,     |
| England. Air traffic control at Manchester International Airport said |
| they had nothing on radar. (Source: Curt Sutherly, UFO Mysteries: A   |

| 1998 - Extension Forest Hills, Bayamon, Puerto Rico. On the night     |
| that Hurricane Georges struck Puerto Rico Iris Rodriguez was outside  |
| her home doing some washing when the winds began to pick up strength. |
| She went back inside her house at 8 p.m., and soon after she looked   |
| out her window and noticed a bright sphere of light making triangular |
| movements in the sky. The sphere descended lower in the sky and       |
| hovered above a neighbor's home. A few moments later a bright white,  |
| oval-shaped hole appeared in the center of the red light. Then a      |
| figure became visible inside the white light. The figure moved back   |
| and forth, apparently looking out. The witness described the figure   |
| as tall, thin, and man-like. It wore a tight-fitting gray colored     |
| outfit and his skin appeared to be also gray or pale. As the wind     |
| from the approaching hurricane grew stronger the witness lost         |
| interest in the object and its occupant, and eventually lost sight of |
| it. On the same night Gerardo Mendez of Bayamon, Puerto Rico had gone |
| out to pick up some trash bins in order to secure them from the wind. |
| Suddenly from behind a nearby tree a strange creature jumped out. It  |
| was described as short, hunched over, with a snout-like nose, thick   |
| black hair, and round black eyes. It had thin but strong legs, large  |
| pointy ears, and sharp fang-like teeth. The creature quickly hopped   |
| by the witness, stopping briefly to stare at him. It then hopped into |
| the nearby woods and was gone from view. That same night others saw   |
| speeding red balls of light over different parts of the island.       |

| 2007 - A 37-year-old service technician in Spencerville, Ohio stepped |
| outside for a cigarette before going to bed at 1:50 a.m. and sighted  |
| a pair of lights just over the horizon. It was a dark cigar-shaped    |
| object with two lights at both ends, larger than a normal aircraft,   |
| and it made no sound as it moved west-northwest                       |

| 2007 - An undisclosed witness had an apparent abduction experience    |
| with missing time beginning in the predawn morning hours in           |
| Lexington, Kentucky. He reported to the National UFO Reporting Center |
| that while out walking the dog at 4:30 a.m. the small dog "who never  |
| barks" began to growl and spasm uncontrollably. Then a white light    |
| appeared and a sensation of warmth came over him, and the witness was |
| knocked to the ground. When he awoke it was early afternoon, he was   |
| in a different location, his clothes were tattered, and he had        |
| several sore spots on his body including his anus.  At first he       |
| thought he must have been the victim of an automobile hit and run,    |
| but to his dismay his arms and legs had various burn marks of unknown |
| cause, and he suspects the cause may have been UFO related. The       |
| report form lists the shape of the UFO as a disc. (Source: Peter      |

| 2007 - At 4:13 p.m. a father and son in Bastrop, Texas were playing   |
| catch with a baseball when a silver, cigar-shaped object appeared out |
| of nowhere and hovered 1000 feet in the sky.It had two wings in front |
| and two wings in the back. It backed up, came forward, then went up   |
| and down in a controlled pattern, and then quickly disappeared into   |
| thin air. The sighting lasted 45 seconds. (Source: Peter Davenport,   |

| 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. At 8:00 p.m. in West Chester, Ohio a          |
| triangular craft with an array of bright lights glided silently near  |
| the treeline. At 8:25 p.m in Deer Park, Ohio an observer witnessed a  |
| triangular object with hundreds of bright yellow lights near          |
| Cincinnati. At 9:00 p.m. a "really big" craft was seen in Evendale,   |
| Ohio that came close but remained silent the whole time. (Source:     |
