| 1965 - At 1:30 a.m., while fishing in the Florida Everglades in       |
| Hendry County, Florida 45-year-old James Flynn noticed a shiny        |
| metallic, domed disc, some 75-100 in diameter, on the ground. His     |
| hunting dogs howled, and one dog tried desperately to escape from its |
| crate.  When he approached the object an unknown force struck him in  |
| the forehead and knocked him to the ground, causing him to lose       |
| consciousness. The wound to his right eye required medical attention, |
| and physical traces in the form of a circle of scorched sawgrass and  |
| other damaged foliage was found at the landing site. (Sources: NICAP  |

| 1966 - At 3:50 a.m. in Dexter, Michigan two police officers, Bushroe  |

| Lake Erie from Selfridge AFB in Michigan. The objects displayed       |
| extreme speed and maneuverability. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator,  |

| 1966 - In Southport, Connecticut a domed disc with a row of red       |
| lights paced a car along a country road, then swooped down and landed |
| on the road ahead of the car. It rose just in time to avoid a         |
| collision. (Sources: John Fuller, NICAP UFO Investigator, April 1966, |

| 1969 - At 7:50 p.m. a white barrel-shaped object with antennas        |
| hovered over a gravel pit in Malataverne, Drome, France and was       |

| approached the object he was struck by some type of force field and   |
| temporarily paralyzed. (Sources: FSR, November-December 1969, p. 32,  |

| 1969 - At 7:40 p.m. and again at 8:15 p.m. several separate witnesses |
| observed a red saucer-shaped object with antennas land on stadium     |
| grounds twice in Lins, Sao Paolo, Brazil. It was seen again over the  |
| next three days. (Source: Walter Buhler, FSR Case Histories, August   |

| 1971 - Two young men, Brian Scott and Nick Corbin, were in the        |
| Superstition Mountains, near Apache Junction, Arizona to gather       |
| snakes. During that night, at 9:06 p.m., they saw a light coming      |
| towards them over the mountains. As it approached they had a missing  |
| time memory loss, and their next recollection was that they were      |
| hastily leaving the campsite two hours later.                         |
|                                                                       |
| During a hypnosis session five years later Scott described how the    |
| object approached and hovered over them. It was emitting a purplish   |
| light from underneath, and he felt a "pulsating, pulling feeling" as  |
| the two men were lifted up into the craft. They were separated once   |
| they were inside, and Scott was led by a 7 foot tall entity down a    |
| corridor to a door which "shattered" when they entered through it. On |
| the other side was a small room filled with mist, where he            |
| encountered 4 or 5 similar beings, 7 foot tall and with grayish skin  |
| similar to that of a crocodile, and with 3 fingered hands. The room   |
| was cold and the mist emanated from vents in the floor.               |
|                                                                       |
| Scott was stripped and placed against a very brightly lit wall panel. |
| A machine directly in front of him appeared to "scan" him, and a new  |
| 9-foot-tall entity communicated with him telepathically and asked why |
| he was afraid. His mind was briefly transported to some other worldly |
| environment, presumably the being's home planet. The beings that      |
| examined him had huge ears, no hair, and slit-like mouths. Their feet |
| were elephant like, with three broad toes. When the examination was   |
| completed, Scott was reunited with his friend and they were both      |
| returned to the ground with no conscious memory of what had taken     |
| place. However, they both felt an unspecified terror to such a degree |
| that they immediately packed their gear and returned to town.         |

| 1992 - At one o'clock in the morning a disc-shaped UFO appeared in    |
| the skies over the Amazon Rain Forest city Ariquemes, Rondonia state, |
| Brazil. The silent three-meter wide disc came down to only three      |
| meters above the ground, and yellow light was seen coming from        |
| portholes in the craft. A power outage occurred, and several          |
| witnesses felt physically pulled toward the object. At the same time  |
| in the city of Mafra, Rondonia, Brazil a 15 m cigar-shaped object     |
| heading to the southwest makes a stop only one meter over a bridge,   |

| disappeared. (Sources: Patti Weatherford, Islander Pensacola, March   |

| 1994 - At 9:30 p.m. what looked like a B-17 aircraft rumbled by       |
| Mennecy, Hauts-Seine department, France. A long, silent,              |
| octagon-shaped craft hid behind some trees, and gave off beams and    |

| 1995 - Charles Little and his fiancée were driving in Joshua Tree     |
| National Monument, California at 11:30 a.m. when they noticed two     |
| objects hovering in the sky: one in front of the car and the other    |
| behind it. They apparently lost consciousness and came to two hours   |
| later. Later under hypnosis, Little remembered being inside a round   |
| object with several rooms, including a main control room with large   |
| windows and an examination room with a small table. They encountered  |
| three types of humanoids, short Greys with huge black oval-shaped     |
| eyes, some tall reptilian creatures, and short hooded humanoids.      |
| After their abduction Little found a mark on his upper thigh, and     |
| nodules behind his ears. Four years later his fiancée died of         |
| esophageal cancer, and Little believes the cancer was somehow related |
| to the incident. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |

| 1995 - At 7:10 p.m a large triangular object, radar tracked at 800    |
| feet altitude near St. Petersburg, Russia, was detected for 40        |
| minutes before it split into several pieces. A transponder number was |
| reported, and the speculation is that the object was using the code   |
| to pass unnoticed. At 7:40 p.m. a yellowish-orange domed disc with    |
| 6-7 bright lights was viewed through binoculars in St. Petersburg,    |
| Russia. When it stopped moving, a small, bright sphere of the same    |
| color burst out of it and flew off in the direction of Zelenogorsk.   |
| The large UFO then blinked out. At about the same time in Lomonosov,  |
| a suburb of St. Petersburg, a hovering yellow-orange light changed    |
| intensity, and then started to look like a Zeppelin with a tail. It   |
| rotated, and shot away in 2-3 seconds. It was estimated to be 1/5th   |
| the apparent size of the Moon. (Source: Boruch Michael S. Boruch,     |

| 1997 - At 1:03 a.m. a couple were in a park in Cote-St.-Luc, Quebec,  |
| Canada when they heard a loud whirring sound overhead and were        |
| engulfed in a white beam. They were unable to move. Overhead they     |
| saw, less than 50 feet above them, a silver disc-shaped UFO with      |
| multi-colored lights around the rim. They experienced an episode of   |
| missing time, their clothes were singed and they had skin burns. The  |
| woman also had a round scar on her head. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 1997 |

| 2003 - While pulling his car into the parking lot of the Behavioral   |
| Health Services Building in Winfield, Illinois the witness noticed    |
| three flashing objects coming down in the sky in front of the car. He |
| next noticed more dropping out of the the sky until there were        |
| several. Most had red and white flashing lights, with no visible      |
| wings, and did not make a sound. Some had blue and aqua lights. Some  |
| were triangular, some cigar-shaped, and some were like small boxes    |
| with four perpendicular lights. The witness brought several people    |
| out from the building, and they all watched the spectacle together.   |
| Also during the sighting, a bona-fide helicopter with multi-colored   |
| lights flew over. A few of these objects left a contrail. The main    |
| witness had spent seven years in the Air Force, and was confident     |
| these were not conventional aircraft. He called 911, and a Winfield   |
| police officer responded and watched them with him. The lighted       |
| objects also discharged balls of light every once in awhile, which    |
| also flew around. (Sources: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting   |
