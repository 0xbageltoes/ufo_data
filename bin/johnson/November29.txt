| 1896 - Over a hundred witnesses in Tulare, California watched an      |
| airship descend, then rise, and finally shoot off to the west toward  |
| Hanford, California. (Source: Loren E. Gross, The UFO Wave of 1896,   |

| 1950 - Between 5:00 and 11:00 p.m. radar targets were detected from   |
| Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Fighter planes were, scrambled but saw nothing. |
| However, at 7:00 p.m. there were Geiger counter detections in the     |
| restricted area of Oak Ridge that indicated an abnormal increase in   |
| alpha and gamma ray radiation that could not be attributed to any     |
| known source. Officials in charge of Oak Ridge security held a        |
| two-day meeting to discuss the "operational difficulties" of the      |
| early warning radar of the Air Defense Command at Knoxville. AFI was  |
| asked to investigate the situation and set up a separate radar set.   |

| 1957 - At 5:10 p.m. a small, 18 cm in diameter luminous ball circled  |
| very low over a road two miles north of Glencoe, Ontario. It then     |
| flew over a fence. It was seen by a single witness, a Mrs. Alderman,  |
| for approximately one minute. (Source: C. W. Fitch, APRO Bulletin,    |

| 1960 - At 6:38 p.m. two crew members of a USAF T-33 trainer sighted a |
| white light flying south of Kyushu, Japan. The object slowed down to  |
| pace the Lockheed jet trainer, and followed the plane for 10 minutes  |
| without making any sound. The case is listed by Project Blue Book as  |
| unexplained. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official    |

| object with a blinking red dome fly over the Cooper Creek area and    |
| come to ground level in Springhill, Nova Scotia, Canada. They         |
| observed portholes and a long bar with fingerlike devices emerging    |
| from an opening. Snow was blown away and bushes were flattened during |
| the near landing. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, January-February  |

| 1967 - At around 2:00 a.m. Percy McBride saw a flashing flying        |
| object, the size of a station wagon with two aerials, arrive from the |
| east and land in the woods near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada for 15  |
| minutes. It made a clicking sound and a noise similar to six radio    |
| receivers tuned to different stations. It had a square, boxlike       |
| protuberance supported by a pole underneath. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, |

| 1968 - At 4:10 a.m. two pilots flying over Mangamahu, New Zealand,    |
| Harding and Peddie, sighted three large red lights at each corner of  |
| a triangular formation of lights traveling together. No solid form    |
| was seen. They split up, one flew behind a ridge, the second hovered  |
| at ground level, and the third moved above the second light. Then the |
| first light came back and the three formed a triangle again.          |

| 1982 - In Botucatu, Sao Paolo State, Brazil Joao Valeiro da Silva     |
| was awakened at 1:50 a.m. by indigestion and a noise in his backyard. |
| He opened the door and went outside where a brilliant beam of light   |
| fell on him and he was confronted by three beings, each about six     |
| feet tall, who were wearing blue, tight-fitting coveralls with holes  |
| for their eyes and mouth. They approached him, holding their palms up |
| as if showing they carried no weapons. Despite the friendly gesture   |
| the witness fainted. Nobody missed him until early morning when his   |
| brother, Simeon, awoke at 5:00 a.m. and discovered him missing and    |
| signs of a struggle. His family found Joao lying outside, nude and    |
| unconscious, alongside his clothing in a rumpled pile. They rushed    |
| him to a hospital where he recovered two hours later. Although Joao   |
| did not remember being taken onboard a craft, he found himself seated |
| on a circular seat in what resembled a well-lighted hospital-like     |
| operating room, and the same beings who had confronted him at his     |
| door appeared again. They wore clothing, which looked as if it were   |
| made of rubber material, and talked to each other in an               |
| unintelligible language as they led him to a wall bearing an outline  |
| of a human form. The beings would look at the drawing and then at     |
| him, as if comparing the two. Then they left the room by passing      |
| through a wall. A naked female who looked human then entered the      |
| room. She had long hair, was deeply tanned or dark skinned, and       |
| looked to be about 20 years old. She carried a Y-shaped instrument    |
| about a foot long. As she grasped his head and touched his cheek with |
| the device he lost consciousness. He had a mark on his cheek, a       |
| scratch on his chest and an arm, and his wristwatch had stopped at    |
| 4:20 a.m. An interview with his family disclosed a "sickly smelling   |
| oily substance" had covered his nude body. Da Silva also complained   |
| that his genitals "were burning". da Silva had been troubled by       |
| poltergeist activity before the abduction, but it ceased. He later    |
| had several other adbuction experiences. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,     |

| 1989 - From 5:24 p.m. until 8:39 p.m. two members of the Gendarmerie, |
| driving in their patrol car just south of the city of Eupen, Belgium, |
| found themselves in the middle of a cat and mouse game with a UFO.    |
| The policemen described it as "a dark solid mass in the shape of an   |
| isosceles triangle." It carried three blinding white lights in each   |
| corner and had a pulsating red light in the center. Throughout the    |
| three hour incident they were in constant communication with their    |
| headquarters in Eupen. Greatly to their relief, the dispatch officer  |
| informed them that he too had seen the triangular object and that     |
| additional sightings were being reported by patrols in nearby         |
| communities. Indeed, 150 eyewitness accounts were gathered that       |
| night. Several witnesses mentioned hearing a sound that reminded them |
| of a ventilator. One policeman reported that he had also noticed      |
| "something at the back of the craft that was turning round, like a    |
| turbine." At 7:00 p.m. a close encounter occurred in nearby Voeren,   |
| Belgium, and at 7:10 p.m. two witnesses in Herbesthal, Belgium saw a  |
| dark delta-shaped object fly between and over houses. They could not  |
| actually see the surface of the craft it was so dark. (Sources: (1)   |

| 1993 - At 10:20 p.m. a square shaped object with four lights, one in  |
| each corner, passed low (400 feet altitude) over the heads of a       |
| four-man oil drilling rig crew four miles southwest of Aztec, New     |
| Mexico. It made no sound, and moved slowly. (Sources: UFO             |

| Valley, p. 200).                                                      |

| 1993 - Near the Eisenhower Tunnel in Colorado a couple were driving   |
| on a flat, straight portion of the highway when they noticed a bright |
| red star-like light moving slowly across the sky at around 11:00 p.m. |
| The light stopped and shot straight down below the horizon. Moments   |
| later the same object approached their car and then began pacing      |
| them, positioning itself directly overhead. The object paced their    |
| car for ten miles, and then shot away out of sight. A short while     |
| later they started hearing static on their car radio and when they    |
| looked behind they saw a fast approaching bright reddish-white light. |
| The UFO quickly closed with their vehicle and now could be made out   |
| as a glowing white, disc-shaped craft. The driver accelerated to 90   |
| mph but the object kept pace. As he watched in the rear view mirror a |
| figure appeared at the front of the object. The figure was very thin  |
| and had a large head with huge slanted eyes. The being's body was     |
| dark but its eyes were a bright yellow color. At this point the       |
| driver heard a voice in his head telling him that he would not be     |
| harmed, that "they" were only interested in studying him and his      |
| female companion. A period of "missing time" occurred shortly         |
| thereafter. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database     |

| 1998 - At around three a.m. a witness noticed a small, strange object |
| hovering above a dead tree in a wooded area of San Fernando, Cebu     |
| Island, the Philippines. There was a sudden flash of light, and a     |
| large balloon-shaped object with three illuminated triangular windows |
| became visible. Inside the window he could see a humanoid being with  |
| bright, crystal blue eyes. He heard a thundering voice speak to him   |
| in an unknown language; some of it sounded like "arc-ha-an            |
| rha-ehn-raxh ehn."  (Source:  Albert S. Rosales, 1998 Humanoid        |
