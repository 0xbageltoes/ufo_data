| 1951 - A young girl, who was to have other UFO encounters later in    |
| life, was playing in her garden in Withdean, East Sussex, England     |
| between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. when she saw a hovering disc-shaped object |
| with a transparent dome on top. Inside the dome she could see three   |
| men, and they appeared to be looking down at her. The domed object    |
| made a descent into the garden and three humanoids with bald, domed   |
| heads exited. The men wore khaki-colored outfits, and carried a weird |
| looking object. They floated toward the girl, then reversed           |
| direction, reboarded, and took off. Their exit was "like a film in    |
| reverse." (Source: Jenny Randles, Alien Contacts and Abductions, p.   |
| 65).                                                                  |

| 1953 -  At 1:50 p.m. U.S. Weather Bureau observer Stanley H. Brown in |
| Yuma, Arizona, using a theodolite, sighted a dull white, oblong       |
| object that was tracked flying straight up vertically, then leveling  |
| off and being joined by a second, similar looking object. The second  |
| UFO twice flew away and returned to the first. The two dull white     |
| objects maneuvered errratically, then in unison against the wind, one |
| degree apart. A thin mist was seen around the edges of the            |
| objects.After five minutes both objects were lost to sight behind     |
| some clouds. A Project Blue Book unknown. (Sources: Project Blue Book |

| 1954 - At 5:29 p.m. four air traffic controllers at Carswell AFB in   |
| Fort Worth, Texas sighted and tracked on radar a huge cigar-shaped    |
| object that flew without making any noise at 4,000 feet altitude.     |
| Separate blips on the radar screen parted and rejoined. The sighting  |
| lasted 10 minutes. (Source: Timothy Good, Above Top Secret, p. 281).  |

| 1955 - A woman on a moped saw four blue-green lights in the middle of |
| a vineyard in Cerat, Pyrennes-Orientales, France at 7:25 p.m. The     |
| lights were arranged in an arc, five feet above the ground. Two tall  |
| beings stood motionless nearby.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1965 - On or about this date several people in Torrent, Corrientes    |
| province, Argentina observed five luminous objects in flight at       |
| night. A transparent craft landed, and five creatures about two       |
| meters high, with one eye in the forehead and flashing helmets,       |
| emerged and tried to abduct one of the villagers. (Sources: Jacques   |

| 1973 - While driving from Iron Knob to Kimba, South Australia on      |
| Route One, Brian Hunt and his passenger, Miss Sharon Kinckler,        |
| observed a red light at 9:50 p.m. approximately 32 kilometers         |
| northeast of Kimba. It was in a clearing to the right of the road. As |
| they passed it, the two observed a red orange lighted area of         |
| rectangular shape, about 10 feet high by 5 feet wide, in which they   |
| saw a sharply defined man in a white spacesuit. The figure was of     |
| normal height and appeared to be of ordinary shape, but was suspended |
| some 2-3 inches above the ground. He floated into the middle of the   |
| lighted area some 2-3 feet above the base. Brian called this to his   |
| companion's attention as he accelerated past the scene, and Sharon    |
| was able to see the orange glow spread across the entire highway      |
| behind them. When they arrived at Miss Kinckler's home in Kimba, they |
| called the local police and a constable accompanied them back to the  |
| site. The light was gone and no traces were found. Two other          |
| independent witnesses were subsequently located by investigators. Mr. |
| Allen Degnor, a Ceduna truck driver who passed by the same area at    |
| 10.00 p.m. described essentially the same phenomenon. Mr. Max Inglis, |
| who had passed Brian and Sharon just before reaching the site of the  |
| strange phenomenon. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:    |

| 1977 - Basford, Staffordshire, England - At 2:25 a.m. an automobile    |
| club patrolman sighted a luminous orange object at some distance from |
| his car. His two-way radio had heavy static while the object was in   |
| view. There was simultaneous radio interference at the Stafford       |
| police headquarters. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving   |
| Vehicle Interference, case 407, citing Northern UFO Network News,     |

| 1977 - At 1:30 p.m. several schoolboys at Broad Haven school in       |
| Pembrokeshire, Wales saw a huge silvery object on the ground about    |
| 300 yards away from them in an adjoining field. David George, age 9,  |
| said it was making a humming sound, and looked like a saucer with a   |
| point on top. He saw a man with long pointed ears and wearing a       |
| silver suit standing next to it. Tudor Jones, age 10, Jeremy          |
| Passmore, age 9, and David Ward, age 10, also saw the being. David    |
| Ward said, "the people wore green--they had sort of cameras---and     |
| they had pointed ears." The landed UFO was still there at 2 p.m. The  |
| object was a seen third time, again in the same place for five        |
| minutes, by a total of 14 boys and one girl. Their drawings show a    |
| domed, disc-shaped object. The site where the UFO was seen was        |
| surrounded by a muddy swamp; no traces were found. (Sources: David F. |

| 1999 - Jorge Alfonso was walking his dog in Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro |
| state, Brazil at 8:30 p.m. when he noticed a bright light some        |
| distance away. Thinking that it was a car that had broken down he     |
| approached to offer assistance. As he got nearer the light he was     |
| surprised to see that it was an object about three meters in          |
| diameter. Through a doorway he could see a humanoid operating some    |
| type of controls. He approached to within 30 meters of the object.    |
| Two minutes later the craft rose slowly up and disappeared into the   |
| sky. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1999,      |
