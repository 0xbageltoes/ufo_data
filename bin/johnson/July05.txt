| 1933 - A huge circular object dropped down into the center of a       |
| formation of RAF fighter aircraft over Sussex, England. Two of the    |
| planes suffered engine failure and were forced to make emergency      |
| landings. One pilot suffered burns to his face and hands after his    |
| airplane passed close by the object. (Source: Richard Hall, From      |
| Airships to Arnold: A Preliminary Catalogue of UFO Reports in the     |
| Early 20th Century, p. 16).                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1947 - There are 59 UFO reports from across the United States and one |
| from Canada recorded for this day in UFOCAT. The geographical         |
| distribution of the UFO sightings is similar to the day before, but   |
| with many more reports from California and the Great Lakes. The       |
| majority of these reports were of flyovers by daylight discs. |
|                                                                       |
| 1947 - At 8:00 a.m. two discs zoomed in from the west over            |
| Sacramento, California. One banked sharply and headed north.          |
| According to one witness, it "seemed to stand on one edge as it       |
| turned." Both objects left vapor trails. (Source: Ted Bloecher,       |
| citing the Sacramento Bee, July 7, 1947).                             |
|                                                                       |
| 1947 - Albuquerque, New Mexico - Five discs flew toward the east over  |
| the city at 9 o'clock in the morning; one circled back over the city. |
| In the afternoon five witnesses saw a sphere maneuver in-and-out of   |
| clouds. (Source: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947: A Preliminary Report on   |
| the 1947 UFO Sighting Wave; Albuquerque Journal, July 6, 1947).       |
|                                                                       |
| 1947 - In Augusta, Maine at 1:15 p.m. local time, two witnesses,      |
| including the program director of WRDO Radio, saw twelve discs flying |
| rapidly in a straight line toward Bangor in a north-northeasterly     |
| direction. (Source: Daily Kennebec Journal, July 7, 1947).            |
|                                                                       |
| 1947 - At 1:00 p.m. in 1947 a party of surveyors in Payette, Idaho saw four  |
| silvery discs that each had a dark line in the center fly toward the  |
| northwest at an estimated speed of 800 km per hour. They were lost in |
| the clouds at an estimated altitude of 8,000 feet. (Source: Larry     |
| Hatch, U computer database, case 862).                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1947 - In clear sky at 3:00 p.m. in Anaconda, Montana a man saw six silvery  |
| objects fluttering as they flew toward the east. A woman, an          |
| independent witness, also saw the same three fluttering objects       |
| disappear over the horizon. Both witnesses called the police.         |
| (Source: Jan Aldrich, A Preliminary Report on the 1947 UFO Sighting   |
| Wave, p. 80).                                                         |

| 1947 - at 7:00 p.m. in daylight skies over Neapolis, Ohio a TWA       |
| flight crew saw a propeller-shaped object rotating slowly as it flew  |
| beneath the airliner. It was flying at an estimated speed of 200 mph. |
| (Source: Ted Bloecher, newspaper clipping dated July 6, 1947).        |
|                                                                       |
| 1965 - On this day at 6 o'clock in the morning a photograph was taken |
| of a flying disc-shaped object coming out of the Russian River near   |
| Kenai, Alaska. (Source: APRO Bulletin, November-December 1965).       |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - One hundred people in Clifton, England claimed to have seen a  |
| silvery disc-shaped object, about ten meters meters long, land in the |
| area. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia, A Century of      |
| Landings, case 852).                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1968 - North Adams, Massachusetts - A green light larger than a star   |
| was seen moving slowly through the sky. Through binoculars it looked  |
| like a green ball with a reddish trail. When an airplane approached   |
| it, the object "blinked out" and then reappeared after the plane was  |
| gone. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs Interplanetary Visitors, pg. 353).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - At 1:30 a.m. a landed UFO started a grass fire when it took    |
| off in King William's Town, South Africa. The object resembled a      |
| "sailor's cap." Some witnesses in a car attempted to pursue the       |
| object but it accelerated out of sight. At 9 p.m. an orange fireball  |
| made a huge arc through the sky and then came to hover over some      |
| trucks at the Witput railway station in Kraankuil, South Africa. At   |
| 10:15 p.m. a huge flying sphere hovered only seven meters in front of |
| a car in Vryburg, South Africa. It changed colors from red to green,  |
| gave off sparks, turned yellow, and was gone in a huge flash.         |
| (Sources: FSR, November-December 1972, p. 15; newspaper clipping,     |
| July 7, 1972; Data-Net Report, August 1972, p. 18).                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1976 - At 9 o'clock in the morning two brothers, 8-year-old Andy and  |
| 6 year-old Joel Rygh were playing in Gitchie Manitou Park, Iowa when  |
| they heard "strange noises followed by a grunting sound and then a    |
| whistle." When they looked in the direction of the noises they saw a  |
| seven-foot tall man standing behind a bush. He was wearing a shiny    |
| blue uniform. When the whistling sound became louder the boys ran to  |
| get their brothers Chris, age 11, and Tom, age 9. All four boys then  |
| saw a pulsating glowing domed object emerge from behind a large tree  |
| 50 yards away. The object was "about the size and shape of a large    |
| haystack." It hovered with a humming sound for five seconds, and then |
| sped away. Small oak trees that the craft hovered over were later     |
| found defoliated. (Source: Pat Miller, Sioux Falls (SD) Argus-Leader, |
| August 15, 1976).                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - On this night a bell-shaped UFO hovered just outside an        |
| apartment window in Forest Park, Georgia only five or six feet away.  |
| It was about 12 feet in diameter and made no noise as it moved        |
| silently over the next apartment complex. (Source: Edward Walters,    |
| UFOs are real: Her's the proof, p. 126).                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1980 - A large silent sphere dropped to the surface of Lake Navsjon   |
| north of Naveksvarn, Sweden at 11:50 p.m. It changed colors while on  |
| the surface of the lake. (Source: AFU Sweden).                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1984 - A disc with an orange halo hovered over a park in Cape         |
| Girardeau, Missouri at 9:38 p.m. at an estimated altitude of 1,000    |
| feet. It winked out after fifteen seconds. (Source: APRO Bulletin,    |
| February 1985, p. 8).                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1991 - A twenty-foot diameter crop circle was found in a wheat field  |
| in Medina, New York. (Source: Paul Ferrughelli, Computer Catalog of   |
| UFO Reports, 1988-1994, case 1109).                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1996 - Taking a break from work at 3:10 p.m., a 32-year-old woman in  |
| Mounds View, Minnesota stepped outside her workplace to do some bird  |
| watching when she saw a gray sphere high in the sky that traveled     |
| quickly across the sky for about two minutes. It was lost from view   |
| when still about 50 degrees above the northwest horizon. (Source:     |
| Greg C. Lang, MUFON case investigations file, case no. 961109bC).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1999 - When the witness turned the light on outside her shed in Ross, |
| Tasmania she noticed an orange glowing rectangular structure 200      |
| meters away beyond some trees. It was about the size of a house and   |
| was surrounded by vapor. It rose, tilted at an angle, and then just   |
| faded from view. There were no traces at the site. (Source: Keith     |
| Roberts, Tasmania UFO Information Centre, November 1999 web page).    |
|                                                                       |
| 2000 - At around 4 p.m. Robert Taylor, age 22, remembers being        |
| abducted near McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. He found himself    |
| inside a very misty room surrounded by a green aura. There were soft  |
| "chairs" and a long table in the center of the room. He met several   |
| aliens described as about six feet tall, with very long thin arms and |
| legs. The humanoids emitted a strange humming sound. He suffered from |
| bizarre physiological aftereffects soon after the incident. (Source:  |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2000, citing UFO Watch). |
