| 1950 - A huge sparkling saucer shaped object moved across the sky     |
| heading west over Westfield, Massachusetts on this day. It made a     |
| roaring sound as it flew. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History.   |

| 1952 - At 2:59 p.m. in Temple, Texas fifty to seventy-five gray-white |
| discs continually changed position within a flight formation. The     |
| UFOs tilted in unison every 12-15 seconds during the 3.8 minute       |
| sighting. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official       |

| 1952 - A man named Poprocky wrote to report that at 8:15 p.m. he      |
| watched five lights in the evening sky over Sharon, Pennsylvania that |
| looked like "a sideview of someone blowing smoke rings." (Source:     |

| 1956 - Two men saw a silvery, balloon-shaped craft about two meters in |
| diameter land in a field 100 meters away from them, about eight       |
| kilometers east of McKinney, Texas. They stopped their car to         |
| investigate, but the object took off at fantastic speed. (Sources:    |

| 1966 - At eleven o'clock in the morning in Clayton, Victoria,         |
| Australia numerous independent witnesses including dozens of          |
| schoolchildren and teachers from Westall High School watched a        |
| metallic disc-shaped UFO land in a nearby field, then take off again, |
| while several Cessna-type aircraft and other silvery "plane-like"     |
| objects circled the area. Some of the witnesses found a perfect       |
| circle of flattened grass on the ground, while others encountered     |
| military or government personnel in the area who warned them to stay  |
| away. Some witnesses said they saw a cow in the paddock where the     |
| object came down. The animal was reportedly to have been in such a    |
| distressed state that it eventually had to be put down. One student   |
| who arrived before the others was found in a dazed, trance-like       |
| state. Other schoolchildren saw the UFO on the ground and a normal    |
| looking man in white coveralls walking around it, telling everyone to |
| stay back. Another man appeared, this one wearing a dark uniform with |
| an emblem on it. One of the men was seen entering the object, while   |
| the other vanished. The object emitted a loud humming sound and then  |
| took off. (Sources: Bill Chalker, The OZ Files; Albert S. Rosales,    |

| 1967 - In a series of nightly encounters that began March 28th, in    |
| Conifer, Colorado on this night at 12:30 a.m. two lights appeared     |
| that looked like flashlights on a hill over the Davis ranch. The      |
| sister, K. Davies, saw a man in dark clothes and wearing a hood on    |
| top of the big hill, and later saw a lighted object hovering at the   |
| level of the horizon for a long time, that later ascended. (Source:   |

| 1967 - In the same state in Redvale, Colorado later that evening, a   |
| single witness saw an orange-colored UFO about 100 feet in diameter   |
| upon driving over a hill. The car's lights went out and the engine    |
| backfired but it did continue running. The witness felt increased     |
| heat, so turned the car around. However, the object started following |
| the car. Eventually it left the car and hovered over a store by the   |
| road. A second witness saw this portion of this event. (Source: Mark  |

| 1967 - At shortly after 9:00 p.m. a reddish-orange light paced a      |
| Canadian Pacific Western airliner flying near Edmonton, Alberta,      |
| Canada, and then sped away. The UFO was tracked on radar for 20       |
| seconds. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, March-April 1967, p. 11; Gene       |

| 1972 - A huge, dark cigar-shaped object flew toward the east slowly   |
| for 30 minutes over Vidauban, Var department, France at 2:30 a.m. It  |
| had lights on top and bottom, and flew without making a sound. It was |
| confirmed that no planes were up flying at the time. (Source:         |

| 1973 - At 11:30 a.m. a domed disc-shaped object with portholes and    |
| landing gear came down and landed in the woods four miles west of     |
| Ellsinore, Missouri. At the landing site were found three holes in    |
| the ground arranged in a triangle pattern, and some damaged foliage.  |

| 1973 - At 8:00 p.m. Mrs. Thompson of Charleston, Missouri saw         |
| egg-shaped object at treetop level after her TV set went off and on.  |
| She then saw a bright flash of light in her kitchen. (Sources: J.     |

| 1975 - At 2:00 a.m. two 18-year-old youths, Rod Seagraves and Mike    |
| Lewandowski, were driving west on highway A from Wausau, Wisconsin    |
| toward Athens when their CB radio stopped working. Mike saw a UFO     |
| about 1500 feet north of the road. It was flat on the bottom and      |
| dome-shaped on top, and was on or just above the ground. It shone     |
| with a pulsating silvery-gray light. In another five minutes of       |
| driving they saw what looked like a seven-foot tall "tree trunk" near |
| the road. It was about 100 feet away, and Mike saw it moving slowly.  |
| He then drove away toward the west. Reaching Wausau, they parked the  |
| car behind a restaurant and both fell asleep at around three a.m.     |
| When they awoke at 6:30 a.m. the car was in a different location in   |
| the parking lot, both were dirty, and a quarter of a tank of gasoline |
| was gone, which suggested to them that they had driven back to the    |
| location of the UFO, but had no recollection of doing so. In          |
| subsequent months Mike reported having trouble with his thinking, and |
| his memory was poorer than before the incident. (Source: David F.     |

| 1975 - A sighting at sea occurred on this day by the crew of the      |
| Japanese ship Shinto Maru, sailing off Singapore. The white, domed    |
| disc-shaped UFO skimmed the water, then ascended. (Source: Richard    |

| 1975 - At 5:15 p.m. five red lights in close formation came in over   |
| the Strickland farm one mile north of Pembroke, North Carolina at an  |
| estimated speed of 100 mph. They landed not far away, with smoke      |
| rising from the ground. At the landing site there were six burnt      |
| trees. (Sources: Ted Phillips, Skylook, December 1975, p. 16; Jennie  |

| 1975 - On this night in San Juan, Puerto Rico Willie Lopez, a disc    |
| jockey, was working in the penthouse studio of WBMJ atop the          |
| Darlington Hotel when he heard three knocks on the window of the      |
| terrace behind his control panel. There was no way for anyone to get  |
| out there without going through the studio, and Lopez had seen no one |
| come in. Curious, he went to the window and saw a "glowing figure"    |
| outside that ran and hid behind one of the columns atop the hotel     |
| structure. Nervous, he called the station manager Jose Manuel in the  |
| hotel. He then went back to the window and saw a luminous oval object |
| 40 feet wide, no more than 4 feet from the hotel tower, performing a  |
| slight rocking motion in the air. He was so stunned that he pulled    |
| the curtains from the curtain rod. Going back to the controls, he cut |
| into the music broadcast to describe to his listening audience what   |
| had just happened. About this time, Jose Manuel arrived at the        |
| studio. The disc jockey was in such a state of shock that he had to   |
| be taken to the hospital and sedated. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted    |

| 1977 - The witness, a woman in her thirties living on Rue Cleroux,    |
| Ste. Dorothee, Quebec, Canada was in her kitchen at seven p.m. when   |
| she saw a strong light come in her back window. When she raised the   |
| blind she saw a disc-shaped object with a dazzling, pulsating white   |
| luminosity, about 35 feet in diameter. It was hovering several yards  |
| above a tree 35 feet tall. It bore a pulsating red luminous domed     |
| cupola on top without windows. Around its lower periphery revolved    |
| yellow, green, blue, and red blinking lights. She heard a buzzing     |
| sound like a huge swarm of bees.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| After watching the UFO for perhaps 15 seconds, she ran to her         |
| bathroom and hid. Two minutes later the noise and the light ceased.   |
| She went out on the street in front of her house where she found a    |
| 13-year-old boy, Jos Madison, pointing a carbine at the sky. The now  |
| silent disc-shaped UFO was hovering 100 feet up in a tilted position. |
| Jos did not fire his gun, but called to his friend Alair Narby, also  |
| 13 years old. Jos's two sisters also joined them and watched the UFO, |
| which was now moving from place to place above the houses by jumps    |
| too rapid to observe. It then stopped in place for more than five     |
| minutes, during which Mrs. Madison came out and also observed it.     |
|                                                                       |
| Now after sunset, the UFO moved off toward the Nadon River, where it  |
| again dashed back and forth. The two boys followed it to the Nadon    |
| field by the river, in which there was a temporary pond formed by     |
| melted snow. They saw the UFO approach the river, flying very low,    |
| and it skimmed over the pond producing a loud sizzle of boiling       |
| water. It then landed behind a slight rise. It then emitted a very    |
| strident sharp sound. After four or five minutes a humanoid being     |
| appeared, visible from the waist up because of the terrain. He had a  |
| helmeted head, shiny red and metallic shoulders, and was seen from    |
| the rear. He appeared in front of the object. Above his head was a    |
| red light, apparently floating in midair. He looked to the right and  |
| left, then bent down and was not seen again. Shortly afterward the    |
| disc rose, lit up, and at an altitude of about 65 feet resumed its    |
| erratic movements. Darkness had fallen and the boys returned home,    |
| finally running because it seemed to them the UFO was following them. |
| They temporarily suffered partial deafness, perhaps from the UFO's    |
| noise. At least three families on the block experienced total         |
| interference with their TV reception during this time. At the landing |
| site different tracks and what appeared to be footprints were found.  |

| 1980 - Three bright spheres hovered low over a house in Lodz, Poland  |
| spreading a blinding light. Frightened, the couple living in the      |
| house locked themselves in and came out only the following morning,   |
| when the three spheres had gone. (Source: E. Russo, UFO Newsclipping  |

| 1986 - On this night at 8:45 p.m. a large disc-shaped ojbect was seen |
| over San Francisco, California. It split into two discs, then a third |
| disc joined the pair, making a V formation that flew off rapidly to   |
| the north. (Source: Robert Gribble, UFO Reporting Center, Seattle,    |

| 1994 - Early in the night at one o'clock in the morning a 60-foot     |

| 2000 - At 8:35 p.m. two bright green objects were seen shooting       |
| through the sky over Arlington, Texas with an orange object circling  |
| around the lead object. There were two other reports from Texas on    |
| this afternoon and evening as well. (Source: Peter Davenport,         |

| 2003 - At 4:50 p.m. a high altitude object was seen flying over       |
| Phoenix, Arizona. It stopped, started, made 90 degree turns, and      |
| reflected sunlight. It had no exterior lights. An airliner was seen   |
| passing below the UFO. Fifteen minutes later a spherical UFO came     |
| from the south, stopped, made some sharp turns, and flew off toward   |
| the east. (Source: UFO Magazine (USA), June 2003, p. 30, citing       |

| 2005 - In Oakdale, California a glowing orange-colored spherical      |
| object zigzagged across the sky at a high rate of speed at 8:40 p.m.  |
| It was completely silent.                                             |
