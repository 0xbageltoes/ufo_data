| 1967 - On this day a cigar-shaped object with bright red and white    |
| lights was sighted at Chemong Lake, Ontario. It made a humming noise. |
| At 6:45 p.m. in Orange, Massachusetts three witnesses saw a bright    |
| glowing object shaped like a "squashed egg." It hovered 100 feet over |
| a pond, and then shot off. It had a rotating red light on the bottom. |
| Five minutes later, at 6:50 p.m. a mass of very bright lights         |
| descended and hovered in Royalston, Massachusetts before moving out   |
| of sight on an upward course. The lights were brighter than the Moon, |
| which was visible during the sighting. At 9:33 p.m. Carol Watts had   |
| his second close encounter with UFO entities. An egg-shaped object    |
| stalled his truck as he was driving in Loco, Texas. Four beings,      |
| under five feet tall and with wrap around eyes, slit mouths, and      |
| white coveralls emerged and invited him aboard. He was given some     |
| kind of exam onboard the craft by a machine. (Sources: (1) Gene       |

| 1970 - At 12:15 a.m. a large glowing disc hovered over West Howe,     |
| England. A smaller saucer-shaped object flew in and joined it,        |
| touching the larger object. The UFOs then shot off to the northwest   |
| in sequence, first one, then the other. (Source: newspaper clipping,  |

| 1974 - At 2:30 a.m. Virginia Varela was awakened by a sound in her    |
| home near Santa Clara de Olimar, Argentina. When she looked out the   |
| window she saw "an indefinite figure which seemed to be covered by a  |
| light colored garment." It immediately disappeared. It left           |
| footprints of feet wearing boots. Later on she noticed a light and    |
| heard more noises. She next saw two shining points of light moving    |
| together across the sky. On the following two nights there were again |
| indications that someone had been around the house, and the hum of a  |
| motor was heard. Her cows panicked, and one was found dead. (Source:  |
