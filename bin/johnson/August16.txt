| 1897 - On this night at 12:40 a.m. a giant airship followed a train   |
| as it rounded a bend in the tracks around Heron Bay, Ontario, Canada  |
| and then flew off inland to the north >N inland. It had body lights   |
| and light beams. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case #    |

| 1947 - At 9:00 p.m. a globe of purplish light was seen in Timmins,    |
| Ontario, causing a car to stall. (Sources: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947: |

| 1953 - Claude Pasquier saw two discs flying very low and quite slowly |
| along a straight course in Tours, France at 8:30 p.m. They made a     |
| "hard" sound as they flew. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Anatomy of a Phenomenon,   |

| 1955 - Mr. Ernest Suddard, age 35, and his 13-year-old son were       |
| driving in a truck in Bradford, England at 4:00 in the morning when   |
| they saw what seemed to be a short human being about 1.20 meters (4   |
| feet) tall, dressed in skin-tight black clothes. It held its arms     |
| close to its sides, its feet close together, and walked by a series   |
| of jumps. On its chest was a silver disc perforated with holes. It    |
| turned off suddenly into a passageway and was lost from view. The     |
| witnesses were too amazed to follow. (Sources: Jack Ibson, Flying     |

| 1958 - A dozen people were out on Leman Lake in Switzerland in        |
| perfect weather at five o'clock in the afternoon when they saw a      |
| bright light coming down toward the lake. They stopped their boat as  |
| it came to hover about 15 meters above them. It was saucer-shaped, 10 |
| meters in diameter, and had a cabin with several windows showing on   |
| top. The outer disc below the cabin was spinning. As it came down     |
| toward the water, a noticeable current was created on the surface. No |
| noise or occupants were noticed. After several leaps in mid-air, the  |
| craft flew off at "unbelievable" speed. (Source: Jacques Vallee,      |

| 1960 - Eight geophysicists working in the Kazakstan Mountains near    |
| the Barakhudzir River, 18 kilometers north of Koktal, Kazakstan,      |
| U.S.S.R. saw a bright orange lens-shaped UFO at 11:00 p.m. The        |
| strange luminous body suddenly appeared over the mountainns on the    |
| east slope of the valley, moved north to south while keeping          |
| a constant speed and altitude. It went behind the mountain top, then  |
| re-appeared, flying off to the southeast. (Sources: Felix Zigel,      |

| 1960 - At 10:30 p.m. in Corning, California pilots and many other     |
| witnesses observed two long red ovoids, followed by a V-shaped        |
| boomerang. (Sources: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, p. 170; Paris    |

| 1961 - In Admiralty Bay, Antarctica four members of the crew of an    |
| icebreaker sighted an oval fireball that flew from the northeast to   |
| the southwest for 12 seconds at 6:15 p.m. The object split in two.    |

| 1965 - At midnight in Brough, Durham County, England three women      |
| reported that their sheep and cattle were agitated and noisy when a   |
| dark shape with two orange lights appeared in the sky. The close      |
| encounter lasted 75 minutes. (Source: Gordon Creighton, FSR,          |

|                                                                       |
| 1965 - A woman was driving home at 11:00 p.m. and was within a mile   |
| of her house in Sedalia, Missouri when she saw a light in a field     |
| with “smoke” around it. In a nearby ditch she noticed two large       |
| “birds,” one of which flew at her car. She arrived home at 12:25 a.m. |
| unable to account for the lapse of time. Under hypnotic regression    |
| she recalled that the “birds” in the ditch where in fact two entities |
| wearing spacesuits. One carried a sack on its back, into which the    |
| other was putting clumps of grass and soil samples. They were         |
| “bouncing up & down, their arms flopping at their sides” in a “stiff” |
| manner suggestive of robots. One started to come out of the ditch,    |
| slipped back, then emerged and stood in front of her; its helmet      |
| beginning to glow brilliantly. She could now see that its head was    |
| wrapped up in tape like a mummy, with only the eyes visible. It stood |
| slightly over five feet tall. At this point a football-shaped         |
| UFO landed on the road ahead of her car. Two beings with slightly     |
| pointed heads & “wrap around” eyes emerged from the object and opened |
| her car door. They conducted her inside the craft, assuring her       |
| telepathically that she would not be hurt. The air inside the UFO was |
| “heavy” and difficult to breathe. Once she was inside they flew the   |
| ship over a nearby field, which caused its interior lights to change  |
| from white to red. One of the entities, who did most of the           |
| communicating, appeared to be a scientist or doctor, and he wore an   |
| insignia of three rings on his chest. Another had a red lighting      |
| flash symbol on his uniform, and she took him to be the pilot. A      |
| third entity appeared to be a woman. All three stood 5’10” tall. The  |
| “doctor” put an object of some kind over her head, and she felt as if |
| something were going into her brain. A round black object was then    |
| taken out of the wall, and with it “pictures” were taken of her; the  |
| object glowed blue when the pictures were taken. On a screen on the   |
| wall appeared a pattern: seven vertical lines with markings between   |
| them, which she thought must be some type of tabular representation   |
| of her brain and body. Two more figures, about a foot shorter than    |
| the other three, made their appearance. These beings resembled        |
| “gnomes,” and they aroused fear in the woman. They appeared old       |
| because their foreheads were wrinkled. She was told by the "doctor"   |
| that they and the “mummies” came from different planets. Finally she  |
| was led back to her car; the UFO ascended, and then vanished while    |
| still at low altitude.  (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,        |

| 1967 - Pedro Jose Ramirez in Caracas, Venezuela reported seeing a     |
| four-foot-tall being with an oversized head and large eyes, abnormal  |
| teeth and mouth, and five fingers on his hands. The being was agile,  |
| lightweight, hoarse-voiced, and wore a shiny suit. He spoke Spanish.  |
| The entity told Ramirez that the Earth "was cracking and they wished  |
| to save it." (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue |

| 1967 - On the same day, in Antimano, Federal District, Venezuela      |
| 10-year-old Jose Gregorio Bouaci was in his bedroom in the early      |
| afternoon when he encountered a "little man" who tried to talk to     |
| him. The being was short, white skinned, and had an over-sized head,  |
| with no arms. The boy left his room screaming, saying that he had     |
| seen a Martian. He was so frightened he threw up. (Source: David F.   |

| 1968 - At six o'clock in the morning a chicken farmer named Mateu saw |
| a light hovering three feet above the ground in Sierra De Almos       |
| Tivissa, Terragona, Spain and he walked towards it. It was a very     |
| luminous hemispherical object. On the far side of it he saw about 100 |
| yards away and hurrying toward it, two creatures resembling octopus,  |
| about 3 feet high, with "4 or 5 legs," very light in color with a     |
| "thoroughly disgusting" appearance. The UFO left a large area of      |
| burnt grass, and "watches stopped 3 times at the site." (Sources:     |

| 1968 - For a three hour period beginning at around 11:00 p.m.,        |
| numerous witnesses in Hamilton, Ohio watched as a domed disc-shaped   |
| object moved over a dam, stopped, flipped over, then emitted five     |
| light beams downward, focusing into a single beam that swept the area |
| and reflected over Greenbriar Lake. The object reversed course, and   |
| finally flew away toward the south. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, |

| 1970 - At 12:30 a.m. the Hidalgo family of four, driving in a car     |
| between Aznalcazar and Pila, Sevilla province, Spain encountered a    |
| white foggy object hovering two meters over a field by the side of    |
| the road. The object flew away as they approached, and their car      |
| headlights became dim as it did so. The object repeated this retreat  |
| a few more times as the car kept approaching, then it rose into       |
| the sky and flew away. (Sources: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos,        |

| 1970 - Thirty minutes later, a 22-year-old woman in Puente De         |
| Herrera, Valladolid province, Spain heard a loud whistling sound      |
| accompanied by TV interference at one o'clock in the morning. Opening |
| the door to her house she saw a silvery Saturn-shaped object standing |
| on legs. On top was a transparent cupola bearing a bluish-white       |
| rotating light; and around its perimeter were other multi-colored     |
| lights. A few feet away stood a tall man dressed in a dark blue or    |
| black tight-fitting uniform. It had a close fitting hood of the same  |
| color with shining white wrist bands, anklets, and a buckle. The man  |
| was examining a nearby field of alfalfa. He then turned and took long |
| strides toward the UFO, which was approximately 30 meters from the    |
| witness. She closed her door, frightened about being discovered, but  |
| heard the intense whistling sound again as the object took off.       |
| Footprints were found in the area, and for several nights the site    |
| where the UFO had landed glowed at night. (Sources: J. Macias, FSR    |

| 1970 - At 4:45 p.m. a hemispherical metallic object landed near a car |
| in Puits-d'Edme, Yonne, France. The car engine and lights both        |
| failed. The car operated normally again after the object flew away.   |

| 1971 - Jan-Ove Sundberg was in the woods above Foyers Bay on Loch     |
| Ness, Scotland at around nine a.m. when he saw a grayish-black        |
| cigar-shaped object in a clearing in the woods. It was about 30 feet  |
| long with a curved standing portion at one end, so that it had the    |
| profile of a huge smoothing iron. Three grayish entities of normal    |
| human size then appeared out of some nearby bushes and stood          |
| together. They were dressed in what looked like diver's suits and     |
| helmets. They approached the object and entered it by a door in the   |
| upper part of the curved portion, the UFO then rose vertically to a   |
| height of 50 feet and then took off rapidly in a near-horizontal      |
| trajectory. Sundberg took a photograph as the last of the occupants   |
| was boarding. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:        |

| 1971 - At nearly the same time as the Loch Ness CE-3 encounter, three |
| adults and four children were in an isolated area on a Mediterranean  |
| beach in Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain when they suddenly noticed a |
| very tall figure that seemed to be trying to enter the water in a     |
| very clumsy manner. It was a very tall, well-built, and human like,   |
| but with very pale skin that seemed to lack any pores. It had a large |
| hairless head with a high forehead and large gray colored eyes. It    |
| wore a pair of green shorts and it walked towards the shore very      |
| stiffly, almost like a robot. It walked past the witnesses            |
| maintaining a straight steady gaze on them. The witnesses turned      |
| their heads for a second and when they looked back the being had      |
| completely vanished. There was nowhere he could have gone and he was  |
| nowhere in sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact        |

| 1971 - At 6:45 p.m. John R. Renz had just been relieved from guard    |
| duty at Francis E. Warren Air Force base near Cheyenne, Wyoming and   |
| had stopped at the mess hall for a beer. On his way back to the       |
| barracks he came upon an unlit area of the base at the concrete       |
| reinforced bridge, which crossed over Cow Creek. For some reason      |
| everything was unnaturally quiet around him. As he began to cross the |
| bridge and just before he got to the middle of it, a paralyzing sound |
| resembling loud heart beats became evident. Simultaneously the area   |
| around the bridge lit up like midday. There was also a heavy          |
| breathing sound present, and the bridge began to sway in a wave-like  |
| motion and then settled down. Frightened, he began to run toward the  |
| other end of the bridge, but before he reached it he realized that he |
| had dropped his tobacco pipe and went back to retrieve it. The bridge |
| was still lit up and the loud sounds persisted. He found his pipe and |
| stooped down to get it. When he looked up he was stunned to see a six |
| to seven foot tall being standing there, only three feet away from    |
| him. The being had a medium build as far as the torso, but its head   |
| was much larger than normal and it had long arms. It appeared to be   |
| wearing a wet suit. The hood and body suit were one unit. The eyes    |
| were covered with a one-piece face mask that went across both eyes,   |
| as if it was some kind of blast shield, but the nasal area joined in  |
| with it. From the nose there was a silver gray tube that stretched at |
| least a half a foot long and went straight into the chest area. The   |
| silver gray tube was ribbed and looked like a tracheal tube. The      |
| hands consisted of three long fingers that ended in claws. The feet   |
| were three toed and did not appear to have any heels. When Renz       |
| looked up to the being's face, he was almost in a full standing       |
| position. The being raised its right, three-fingered hand and         |
| motioned for him to come closer. Instead, Renz turned and ran. His    |
| next recollection was of coming up on a military jeep and being       |
| picked up by two soldiers, still on the base. There was a seven-hour  |
| period of missing time.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| Years later, under hypnosis, Renz remembered being inside some kind   |
| of object in a cockpit along with the being. The being spoke to him   |
| telepathically. He remembered descending through clouds of vapor that |
| had a reddish brown tinge. The craft then flew in between two huge    |
| mountains: there was no vegetation anywhere and it looked like a      |
| rocky desert. He next remembered following the being through a huge   |
| door into the side of a mountain tunnel and entering a small room. In |
| this room there was a table that floated in mid-air. The walls and    |
| floor of the room were a silver-gray color. On the floating table     |
| there was the carcass of a creature. The creature on the table had a  |
| larger than normal head and a face resembling that of a wasp. The     |
| eyes were large, like wasp eyes, and had slits inside that looked     |
| like pupils. It had what looked like multi-lens eye coverings, and it |
| had a small jaw and a slit-like nose. The creature was about four to  |
| five feet in length and looked to have an exoskeleton. Its color was  |
| tan to brown with a bluish gray tinge. The humanoid creature gave off |
| an unbearably foul odor, resembling a rotten egg sulphur smell. It    |
| had three fingers on its hands and at the elbows there was a sharp    |
| concave shaped spike at least six inches long. The mouth was gaped    |
| open and the teeth were like small shark teeth. A clear liquid with a |
| reddish substance was dripped on the table.                           |
|                                                                       |
| The tall being then told the witness to leave the room. Outside the   |
| room he saw a saucer-shaped craft with a wide front end and a round   |
| tapered tail. The whole craft sat on two pillars, rectangular in      |
| shape with at least 50 feet between them. The being told him to go    |
| inside and sit in the left seat. On what appeared to be a control     |
| panel Renz saw numerous strange symbols. There was a sound like a     |
| powerful electric motor and the craft took off. Later he recalled the |
| craft attacking a large mountainous area resembling a beehive. He     |
| could see numerous creatures inside. They appeared to be scrambling   |
| back and forth. There were a couple of hundred of them and they       |
| appeared to be the same as the insectoid humanoid that was on the     |
| floating table. The craft landed in the destroyed complex where he    |
| remembered seeing a live creature with the face of a wasp that was    |
| wearing a dark cape or cloak. Within its cloak it was carrying three  |
| small insect creatures at least a foot long. Their heads were         |
| triangular in shape with large eyes. The tall humanoid shot and       |
| killed the creature and the little ones. Renz was then taken back to  |
| the Air Force base. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact      |

| square-shaped head, "like a machine", luminous buttons, and fiery     |
| eyes. "The specter faced him, but he could not see its head, although |
| he noticed small flames burning around its feet." The witness invited |
| the "visitor" home for a drink, but it turned and sped off into the   |
| veldt at high speed, "emitting flames and smoke." He later had        |
| headaches and pains in his legs. (Sources:Natal Mercury, August 23,   |

| 1973 - At four a.m. young Cinzia Giomi and 10 other people were       |
| returning from a show onboard a small passenger bus, when between     |
| Casalincontrada and Chieti, Italy they saw a bizarre figure almost    |
| six meters tall, leaning against a light pole. The being was human    |
| looking but very tall and thin. It wore a shiny white smock-like      |
| outfit and wore tall white boots. It had long white hair and a dark   |
| complexion. The witnesses were able to see the figure close up, at a  |
| distance of only two meters. The bus stopped in order for the         |
| witnesses to get a better look, but the figure quickly faded away,    |
| leaving behind a strong sulfur like odor and a consistent             |
| whistle-like sound. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact      |

| 1974 - Shortly after 7:30 p.m. three boys, ages 9 and 10, in Port     |
| Coquitlam, British Columbia saw a buzzing, multi-colored disc-shaped  |
| object land. It approached very suddenly from the sky and made an     |
| undulating motion as it came in to land. It landed with a blast of    |
| hot air, and gave off blue sparks during the process. An animal       |
| reaction was noted: their cat was frightened and ran away. The UFO    |
| had the outline of a door, and stood on three legs; it had a square   |
| at the top, and was 20 feet wide. Circular patches were found on the  |
| ground at the landing site. The entire close encounter lasted ten     |
| minutes. (Sources: Alan Landsburg, In Search of Extraterrestrials, p. |

| 1975 - At 4:30 a.m. Mr. & Mrs. Paquet were walking on the outskirts   |
| of their village of Forrieres, Luxembourg Province, Belgium on their  |
| way to work when they noticed ahead of them on the road a dark 1.20   |
| meter tall human-like figure with a well-proportioned body. It        |
| suddenly vanished in plain sight when the man, thinking it might be   |
| his son, attempted to approach it. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted    |

| 1976 - At around four o'clock in the morning Dean Anderson and Wayne  |
| Schutte were working on golf course maintenance when they both        |
| noticed an orange “craft” as it dropped down into a culvert on the    |
| golf course at Peninsula State Park in Egg Harbor, Door County,       |
| Wisconsin. Anderson, who was riding a lawn mower, saw by its powerful |
| headlights a figure first standing, and then running on the golf      |
| course, so he pursued him on his riding mower. He saw that the man’s  |
| helmet lit up and his belt first start glowing reddish, but           |
| then glowed green, yellow, pink, and orange, while the antenna on his |
| helmet flashed bright red. Anderson had now closed to within ten feet |
| of him, and could see that he was about seven feet tall and had a     |
| long nose. Suddenly, an energy beam shot down in front of the mower,  |
| causing it to stop, and the figure next turned around and looked at   |
| Anderson. Within a few seconds a small “scout ship” descended and     |
| opened a 3 foot by 3 foot door, which had flashing panels of light    |
| inside. The tall figure floated up into this doorway, and “the craft  |
| glowed bright blue, red, and orange and then took off.” The           |
| footprints of the man were measured to be 20 inches long, 8 inches    |
| wide, and five feet apart where he had been running. (Sources: Keta   |

| 1976 - On this night on Denslow Hill, Hamden, Connecticut two         |
| 14-year-old teenagers, Grey and Barnett, saw two very short humanoid  |
| beings shuffling rapidly across the road. They wore purple-colored,   |
| luminous, one-piece suits and their waists were only 20-22 inches     |
| above the ground. When the boys followed them a bright white,         |
| lemon-shaped UFO blinked on and took off into the air, only 15 feet   |
| away from the boys. (Source: UFOCAT, James P. Barrett case            |

| 1980 - Frank Scott and another soldier were ordered to go by jeep, to |
| a location outside of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia where a UFO had  |
| recently been seen. They arrived there at around two o'clock in the   |
| afternoon, and observed a long cylindrical craft hovering close to    |
| the ground. The object was at least 170 meters long, and broad as     |
| well, and it emitted a buzzing sound that made the air vibrate. The   |
| craft was also emitting a beam of light towards the ground, and       |
| within the beam they could see a small humanoid being descending to   |
| the ground. The humanoid descended to the ground alone. Both men      |
| remained in the jeep, armed with their side arms, and watching the    |
| spectacle. Their weapons suddenly became disabled, as if welded       |
| together. Then there was a terrible noise, and Scott lost             |
| consciousness. He awoke much later in his base infirmary, not knowing |
| how he had gotten there. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |

| 1997 - At 5:20 a.m. a luminous rectangular craft was seen by two      |
| witnesses near the shore in the town of Cullera, Valencia province,   |
| Spain. It had two sections, was coverd with lights, and hovered for   |
| 50 minutes. It flew off to the south-southeast. (Source: Lumieres     |

| 1999 - At 2:20 p.m. three independent witnesses in Berks County,      |
| Pennsylvania observed a silver, double convex saucer as it flew over  |
| toward the south. At 5:45 p.m. it was seen again, this time flying    |
| north in Butler County, Pennsylvania. A married couple described it   |
| as a dull-gray metallic disc, like two quarters on edge. It was first |
| seen flying in the west at high altitude, and then made a sharp 90    |
| degree turn to the north. (Sources: Joseph Trainor, UFO Roundup,      |

| 2001 - Videotoape. A good-sized flying triangle with several white    |
| lights was sighted and videotaped at about 10:00 p.m. in Floriston,   |
| California. It had a bright red strobing light as well as the several |
| white lights, and was the size of a Boeing 727. It flew over the      |
| mountain range to the northeast, stopped, turned off all lights for a |
| few seconds, then lit up again and came straight back overhead        |
| without making a banking turn. It made no noise, even though it was   |
| close. The videotape is about 30 seconds long. (Source: George A.     |

| 2004 - While out photographing a meteor shower at 1:30 a.m. two men,  |
| Mike and Lance, both 23, sighted three triangles flying in a circle   |
| over Palmdale, California, spinning at fantastic speeds, that then    |
| stopped and disappeared. During the sighting Mike called his          |
| girlfriend on his cell phone, and while talking the cell phone died.  |
| Then the digital camera they had, which had been fully charged, died  |
| and would not work, with the message "battery dead". Yet when they    |
| got home both the phone and the camera worked, and when the camera    |
| was placed in its charger the message "full charge" appeared. The     |
| triangle craft were estimated to be flying at 20,000 feet, and were   |
| the apparent size of a quarter at arm's length. The triangles had a   |
| semi-spherical shape to them, and both men saw high definition shapes |
| in the crafts' bodies. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell,  |
