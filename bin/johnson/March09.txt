| 1977 - A cigar-shaped, metallic object appeared in the sky over       |
| Nelson, Lancashire, England at 3:10 a.m., so the two witnesses        |
| stopped their car for a better look. The UFO had lights at either end |
| that were changing color and the entire object was surrounded by a    |
| gray mist. The witnesses heard a sound they described as being like   |
| the tide coming in and going out. As the object came quite close,     |
| their car's engine stopped and the headlights dimmed. After five      |
| minutes, the object flew off and the car could be restarted. Both of  |
| the witnesses came down with headaches shortly after the sighting.    |

| 1991 - Shortly after midnight a UFO pursued a couple named Silva in   |
| their car on a highway south of Fortaleza, Brazil. The domed disc     |
| emitted heat and made a humming sound. It left, returned, left again, |
| then returned a second time and dropped a transparent two-meter wide  |
| ball that blew up in front of their car, only six feet away. They     |
| believe the UFO intended to harm them. (Sources: Jerome Clark, UFO    |

| 1992 - At twn p.m. two women walking home near a lake in Hamar,       |

| domed craft with a triangular bottom. Inside were two figures. They   |
| had long hair, large slanted eyes, and penetrating stares. (Sources:  |
