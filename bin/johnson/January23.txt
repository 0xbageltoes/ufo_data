| causing the lights to pulsate. (Source: Ivan Sanderson, Invisible     |

| 1965 - Williamsburg, Virginia - At 8:40 a.m. cars stalled near the     |
| intersection of US Highway 60 and State Route 614. A 31-year-old      |
| businessman named Mains, whose car had stalled, observed a            |
| mushroom-shaped object hovering over a nearby field about four feet   |
| off the ground, 500 feet away. It was metallic gray and about 75-80   |
| feet tall. There was a red-orange glow coming from the near side, and |
| a bluish glow from the far side. Soon the object rose slightly and    |
| then accelerated horizontally speeding off towards the west, making a |
| noise like a vacuum cleaner. The sighting duration was 25 seconds.    |

| when they saw a disc-shaped object land 200 yards away from them.     |
| Upon closer investigation they found the object to be 75-100 feet in  |
| diameter and 25 feet in height. A door slid open and a seven-foot     |
| tall being appeared. He called to them by name, and conversed with    |
| them via telepathy. He said his race was from another star and that   |
| 400 American citizens are actually from his race. (Source: David F.   |

| 1973 - On this evening a teenage girl driving on Interstate 85 in     |
| Gaffney, South Carolina noticed that the radio reception of her car   |
| radio was mysteriously blocked. Then she noticed a yellow oval-shaped |
| object with "white lights blinking on and off and going around on its |
| bottom". The UFO followed the traffic on I-85. (Sources: Rodger       |

| 1974 - The entire village of Llandrillo, Wales heard a loud explosion |
| that was preceded by violent shaking of the ground. Running outside,  |
| many people saw blue and orange lights floating in a circle around    |
| Cader Mountain east of the village. Police and RAF personnel were in  |
| the area quickly and cordoned off access to a supposed crash site on  |
| the barren hilltop. A nurse, telephoned by the police, was on her way |
| up the mountain to the crash site with her daughters when she saw     |
| something sitting on the ground ahead of her. It seemed to be intact  |
| and was very large, circular and glowed orange. She and her daughters |
| got to within a few hundred feet of teh object when the police and    |
| military showed up and told her to leave. According to UFO researcher |
| Tony Dodd, a retired military man using the name of "Robert Prescott" |
| told him that he and some others had been assigned to transport two   |
| crates from the crash site to the top secret military weapons         |
| research facility at Porton Down near Salisbury, England. According   |
| to Prescott, military personnel opened the crates and found two       |
| humanoid bodies about 5 to 6 feet tall, and so very thin they were    |
| almost skeletal in nature. Other units allegedly transported live     |
| aliens from the "crash" site. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid   |

| 1976 - At 1:30 a.m. in Lompoc, California a nurse driving not far     |
| from Vandenburg Air Force Base had a close encounter with a 50 foot   |
| long ovoid UFO. Her car radio went wild, and she felt like she had    |
| been hypnotized. Near Vandenburg AFB (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer |

| 1976 - At 5:15 p.m. a 17-year-old witness had gotten off the bus in   |
| Bolton, Lancashire, England and was returning home to her housing     |
| development. She then saw an object with two lights, one amber and    |
| the other red, over the Rumsworth Reservoir. The object suddenly      |
| streaked toward her and came to hover directly over her. The metallic |
| looking UFO was about 25 feet in diameter and shaped like an octagon, |
| with one amber light and a flashing red light. It had a curved base   |
| and a flat top. It rotated on its axis, and the witness's teeth       |
| vibrated as if ultrasonic sound waves were emanating from the object, |
| causing her pain in her mouth. Also, pressure on her shoulders        |
| knocked her down, and she attempted to scream but was unable to. She  |
| ran home terrified. Later under hypnosis it was revealed that she had |
| suffered a 45 minute period of missing time and could vaguely recall  |
| an abduction experience. She could only recall being inside a room    |
| with a tall blond or albino woman who wore a long gown. She was told  |
| by this woman “not to be afraid” and felt that information was being  |
| inserted into her brain at high speed. She was also given several     |
| apocalyptic messages.(Sources: Jenny Randles, FSR, May 1976, p. 32;   |

| 1977 - This humanoid encounter began at 12:30 a.m. when a penetrating |
| sound and bright lights coming from the sky awoke the villagers of    |
| Santa Rosa, Lara State, Venezuela. A circular UFO with intense        |
| multicolored flashing lights, emitting waves of heat, circled the     |
| small community and landed on the banks of the Turbio River, causing  |
| panic. Two small human like figures, walking stiffly, could be seen   |
| moving about inside the object "slowly and in a robot like fashion"   |
| for the next five minutes. When a crowd of people armed with          |
| flashlights approached, the object took off when someone shone a      |
| flashlight on the object's interior. It left behind a 12 foot wide    |
| burn mark, landing gear imprints, and a "greasy granular material" on |
| the ground. (Sources: Mark da Silva, FSR, June 1977, p. 13; David F.  |

| 1978 - A dark brown hat-shaped object was seen hovering over the      |
| beach in Colares, Para State, Brazil at 11:30 p.m. It had two legs    |
| that were visible, looked transparent, and had a bottom that          |
| reflected a greenish blue light. Its estimated distance was 400       |
| meters, and it was in view for 10 minutes. At 11:53                   |
| p.m. a reddish-yellow light flew over Belem, Para, Brazil from north  |
| to south at 900 feet altitude. It traveled at a medium speed 1000     |
| meters away, with a trajectory curving to the left. It made no sound, |
| and the duration of the sighting was one minute. On the same day an   |
| object was filmed with a Canon Super 8 movie camera in Rio            |
| Laranjeira, Para, Brazil using Extachrome film. It looked like a      |
| fried egg or a domed disc. (Source: Bob Pratt, Operacion Prato, pp.   |

| objects land nearby and three men wearing tight-fitting silvery       |
| outfits and large helmets came out. There was a sudden whirlwind that |
