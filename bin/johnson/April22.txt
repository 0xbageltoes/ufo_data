| 1897 - John M. Barclay of Rockland, Texas was intrigued when his dog  |
| started barking furiously at 11:30 p.m. and he heard a high-pitched   |
| noise. He went outside and saw a flying object circling five meters   |
| above the ground. It was elongated with protrusions and blinding      |
| lights. It went dark when it landed. A man who told him his purpose   |
| was peaceful met Barclay and requested some common hardware items to  |
| repair the craft. He paid with a ten-dollar bill. The craft took off  |
| "like a bullet out of a gun." (Source: Houston Post, April 22, 1897). |
|                                                                       |
| 1897 - On or about this same night Frank Nichols, who lived two miles |
| east of Josserand, Texas and was one of its most respected citizens,  |
| was awakened around midnight by the noise from a machine. Looking     |
| outside, he saw a heavy, illuminated object land in his wheat field.  |
| He walked toward it but was stopped by two men who asked permission   |
| to draw water from his well. He then had a discussion with a          |
| half-dozen men who were the crew of the strange craft. He said they   |
| told how it worked but he could not follow the explanation. (Sources: |

| California coast. Smoke was seen to rise from where it landed, but a  |
| search yielded no results. At 11:00 p.m. in Hot Springs, Arkansas a   |
| ten-foot diameter sphere chased men on foot and in their car. It      |
| dodged a beam of light that was directed at it. (Sources: Project     |

| 1955 - At 7:45 a.m. a ten-meter diameter Saturn-shaped sphere flew    |
| slowly over a road in Tintinara, South Australia, then made a         |
| ninety-degree turn. It then sped away to the northeast. (Sources:     |

| 1957 - A flaming cone or disc-shaped object, five-meters in diameter, |
| hovered over a vineyard in Palada, France. It was witnessed by Mr. &  |
| Mrs. Firmin Bason. The vines thrashed about as the object spun        |
| wildly, and the object then rose rapidly with a loud roar and shot    |
| away toward the northeast. The low level whirlwind produced by the    |
| object created magnetic effects. The encounter lasted five minutes,   |
| and was followed by a police investigation. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, |

| 1964 - Marie Morrow and two other people were driving west on a       |
| highway at 9:00 o'clock in the evening. When they were 20 kilometers  |
| east of Lordsburg, New Mexico the entire area became illuminated as   |
| bright as day by a bluish light. Then a disc-shaped object buzzed     |
| their car, coming to within three meters of their roof. It made a     |
| whining sound, then flew north. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, May 1964, p. |

| 1966 - Edward Vojtko, a music teacher, and his wife saw a red light   |
| in the sky at 12:15 a.m. while driving home from a late night         |
| teachers meeting in Alliance, Ohio. They were near the golf course    |
| traveling north, about five miles west of the town, when the object   |
| silently moved towards them, revealing itself to be a large disc with |
| a dome on top. It was dark with a white light on top, 45 feet in      |
| diameter, and with a row of rotating red lights. It came closer and   |
| hovered only 40 feet away. Frightened, they drove off at high speed   |
| and it pursued them. After two minutes it broke off and went behind   |
| some trees. (Sources: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr., UFOs: A New Look, p. 8; |

| 1966 - At 2:00 a.m. Dr. Eula Page, a psychologist, was driving home   |
| from Texas with her two children and a friend when she noticed a      |
| luminous object as big as the moon darting back-and-forth across the  |
| highway. She had just crossed the Red River bridge into Oklahoma near |
| Thackerville when she noticed she had driven directly underneath it   |
| so she stopped the car. It descended and hovered close to the car.    |
| The UFO was luminous and lens-shaped, more than twice the length of   |
| her station wagon. It was surrounded by a spherical framework that    |
| was revolving around it. On one side of the disc was a long window    |
| through which four human-looking occupants could clearly be seen.     |
| They had slanted, "Oriental" shaped eyes and were wearing tight       |
| fitting, silverly gray uniforms. Her daughter said that one was a     |
| woman. Standing outside the car, Dr. Page watched the UFO for about   |
| 20 minutes. A "force field" around the craft made it difficult for    |
| her to breathe, and a hot wind blew from the sphere that smelt        |
| "electrical." Finally another car approached, and the UFO quickly     |
| moved away toward the river.They felt a hot wind from the UFO as      |
| well. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of  |

| Thirty minutes later near Randlett, Oklahoma two teenagers saw a      |
| large disc-shaped craft swinging back and forth over I-35. Four       |
| human-looking occupants are clearly observed inside through a         |
| transparent opening. The area around the witnesses was brightly       |
| illuminated and there was a smell of ozone in the air. (Sources:      |

| 1966 - At 9:30 p.m. two witnesses reported a 10-meter long,           |
| cigar-shaped object hovering vertically over Chauvigny, Vienne,       |
| France. They saw two solid, coherent light beams retract inside the   |
| object. Finally, it shot away fast. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,   |

| 1966 - An orange sphere was seen flying over the coast at Figueira da |
| Foz, Portugal at nine p.m. local time. At 3:30 p.m. CDT--within an    |
| hour of the sighting in Portugal--a flying saucer flew down the main  |
| street of Bagley, Minnesota at a low altitude, jumped over a school   |
| bus and landed on the outskirts of town. Four beings of small stature |
| got out of the UFO, seemed to do some work on it, got back in and     |
| then took off. (Sources: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos case            |

| 1966 - At 9:00 p.m. EDT a plate-shaped UFO flashing multi-colored     |
| lights was observed low over a school in Beverly, Massachusetts for   |
| 30 minutes by ten youths. The UFO made a humming sound and created    |
| television interference. It hovered just thirty feet over the Beverly |
| High School building. There were intense, flashing blue, green, and   |
| red lights racing around the perimeter of the object, as well as a    |
| soft white light. Estimated to be about the size of a car, it tilted  |
| and flew away. (Sources: Raymond E. Fowler, case investigation files, |

| 1975 - On this day Professor Hernandez met a woman named "Lya" who    |
| claimed to be an extraterrestrial near Querataro, Mexico. They drove  |
| together in a car to an isolated area where he had had previous close |
| encounters. They parked and walked about 100 meters on foot to a      |
| saucer-shaped craft about three meters in diameter. Lya took out a    |
| small, handheld device, and an opening on the craft became visible.   |
| They got inside and embarked on a journey. Hernandez soon realized    |
| that he is orbiting the Earth, and he was able to see several         |
| satellites in outer space. There conversation was mostly about        |
| ecological concerns and the coming climatic changes. They talked      |
| about changes to the ozone layer, deserts, forests, etc. Lya told him |
| that the aliens insisted that all nuclear tests must come to a        |
| complete halt. Hernandez was later brought back to his vehicle. He    |
| was then told that their group of aliens was leaving Earth, and was   |
| going to be replaced with a more aggressive extraterrestrial race,    |
| who would be mostly responsible to forced human abductions and animal |
| mutilations. Professor Hernandez mysteriously disappeared on February |
| 2, 1984 and has never been heard from again. (Source: Albert S.       |

| 1976 - At 11:10 p.m. in Elmwood, Wisconsin police officer George      |
| Wheeler encountered a huge, 250-foot wide, silvery                    |
| lens-shaped UFO hovering only 100 feet above the ground and just 500  |
| feet away from his car. It had an orange-white light on top and six   |
| blue windows, landing gear. He could see movement of figures moving   |
| around inside the craft. When the UFO flashed a blue color his car's  |
| headlights, motor, and two-way radio failed. He was stunned by the    |
| flash and experienced a lapse of consciousness. He didn't remember    |
| anything else until someone stopped and asked him if he need help. He |
| was hospitalized from April 23 to April 27. Another independent       |
| witness, Frederickson, saw a UFO land that night in Elmwood. There    |
| was also TV interference reported in the area. (Sources: Eau Claire   |

| 1977 - At 12:30 a.m. John Baxter, age 15, was walking home from his   |
| girlfriend's house along a road off Farm Street, 1.2 miles from the   |
| previous night's humanoid sighting, when he saw a short, ape-like     |
| creature with a very large "figure-8" shaped head on Miller Road in   |
| Dover, Massachusetts. Its eyes looked like two lighter circles in the |
| center of its head. A sketch of the creature matched the one made the |
| night before by a 17-year-old man who saw the creature on top of a    |
| stone fence next to Farm Street. There was a third sighting of the    |
| creature the following night by two teenage girls driving down a road |
| in Dover. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue |

| of theiur car. After a few minutes it climbed, and shot off to the    |
| southwest. The sighting lasted a total of 5 minutes. (Source: Allan   |

| 1984 - Four witnesses near the shore at Saltfleet, Lincolnshire,      |
| England reported seeing a domed disc with a transparent dome that     |
| made several wide loops over the coast. It shone spotlights on a      |
| trailer park, buzzed the witnesses, and then rose vertically.         |
| It hovered at a 45 degree angle for two minutes. Their dogs were      |

| 1989 - At 9:22 p.m. two witnesses on a balcony in St. Louis, Missouri |
| witnessed an orange BOL (ball of light) in the east. Then, the object |
| appeared in front of the witnesses, between buildings, only 150 feet  |
| away. It was described in the report as disc-shaped, without tapered  |
| edges, with an orange dome on top, an orange stripe around the        |
| mid-section, and a black bottom with many blue lights underneath (see |
| sketch below, credit Francis L. Ridge). The witnesses ran into the    |
| street and watched the object fade away westward. The total           |
| observation was from 20-30 seconds. It made a "whoosh" sound.         |

| 1990 - At 10:00 p.m in Cuincy, Nord, France two observers witnessed   |
| three colored lights in the shape of a triangle. Three more lights    |
| joined the first three to form a hexagon; a metallic structure was    |

| 1990 - On April 22, 1990 seven reports of flying triangles were       |
| submitted to SOBEPS, along with a more unusual report by two factory  |
| workers in Basecles, southwest of Brussels, Hainaut, Belgium. They    |
| were in their factory courtyard shortly before midnight, when         |
| suddenly they saw two enormous spotlights illuminate them and their   |
| surroundings. A huge trapezoid platform moved very slowly and         |
| silently above the chimney, and covered the courtyard (100m x 60m).   |
| It was grayish in color and had a total of six lights, and structures |
| on bottom that looked like "an aircraft carrier turned upside down."  |

| 1991 - In Ahwahnee, Madera County, California a 53-year-old man       |
| spotted nocturnal lights in a precise formation suggesting a domed    |
| disc with portholes and rim at 8:30 p.m. The object ascended from     |
| behind a mountain, then hovered over the top of the mountain          |
| before descending across the face of mountain. It was gone when the   |
| witness returned after fetching his camera. It probably descended     |
| into a canyon. (Sources: T. David Spencer, MUFON UFO Journal, April   |

| 2003 - At 4 p.m. Fire Chief Ezequiel Alvarez reported seeing a tall   |
| hairy humanoid, about 1.80 meters in height, in Rosario De La         |
| Frontera, Argentina. It moved very quickly and emitted loud inhuman   |
| screams. The creature apparently killed three dogs using its clawed   |
| hands. A local teacher reported finding a strange hairy cadaver on    |
| the side of the road, somewhat resembling the hairy humanoid but much |
| smaller, and he noticed that it had testicles resembling those of a   |
| human being. He did not stop to pick up the body but drove on.        |
