| 1951 - A metallic disc-shaped object, looking like aluminum, appeared |
| to stand motionless in the sky when it was sighted by two military    |
| pilots flying between Orange and Aspres Buech, France at 10:37 a.m.   |
| in a French Air Force Vampire jet. It then accelerated away. (Source: |

| 1955 - A cigar-shaped craft zoomed over the town of Anita, Iowa at an |
| altitude under 1000 feet at 9:47 p.m. It was luminous with a white    |
| and blue glow, and red exhaust. It made a hissing sound. The file on  |
| the case is missing from the US Air Force records. (Sources: Project  |
| Blue Book files counted in official statistics, June 1955; Jacques    |

| 1964 - A miner, R. A. Donoso, driving a car 20 kilometers from Arica, |
| Chile saw a strange machine land. It was 10 feet long and 3.5 feet    |
| wide. Two fair-skinned men emerged from the craft. They spoke in a    |
| mixture of Spanish and English, and asked for water. Donoso took some |
| water from his car radiator for them and they left. The UFO left by   |
| ascending vertically into the sky. (Sources: Gordon Creighton, The    |

| 1964 - At 11:10 p.m. a 25 foot in diameter domed disc with a red      |
| light on the bottom hovered 20 feet away and at only 20 feet above    |
| the ground of a 20-year-old man name Angelos in Lynn, Massachusetts.  |
| It gave off a vapor and made a whining noise. The man was temporarily |
| paralyzed during the encounter, which lasted over a minute. (Sources: |

| 1965 - On this evening a bluish 40-foot disc-shaped object with       |
| illuminated portholes was seen in Smithfield, Queensland, Australia.  |

| 1967 - On this evening a couple in Lexington, Michigan who reported   |
| seeing strange lights on Lake Huron told the Sheriff Department that  |
| they spotted an object resembling a "submarine with what appeared to  |
| be a Russian insignia" as well as what seemed to be figures of men    |
| dressed in frogman's suits. The woman shone a light towards in the    |
| direction of the craft and it submerged. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,  |

| 1971 - Tony Wilkens, a young military Vietnam veteran, told Alton,    |
| Illinois police that at 8:55 this evening a 50-foot "velvet silver"   |
| UFO with radiating green lights hovered outside his second story back |
| porch. Two humanoid occupants of the craft "made contact" with him by |
| mental telepathy, and they reportedly gave him a formula that would   |
| provide "the universe at his fingerprints," which he wrote out for    |
| the police. The UFOnauts also invited him to take a ride in the UFO,  |
| but he refused. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:      |

| 1973 - A man and his daughter were driving near West Bend, Wisconsin  |
| when they sighted a low hovering disc-shaped object with several      |
| transparent windows. Humanoid figures could be seen behind the        |
| windows. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1973,  |

| 1981 - A physicist watched an uneven line of six orange UFOs fly      |
| silently by the town of Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China at 7:00 p.m.   |
| (Source: Wendelle Stevens & Paul Dong, UFOs over Modern China, p.     |

| 1982 - At around 9:30 p.m. a fireball with an odd shape flew rapidly  |
| toward the power plant in Romeoville, Illinois. It stopped and        |
| hovered, then flew away fast toward the west. (Source: Larry Hatch, U |
| computer database, case #14404, citing MUFON UFO Journal, issue       |
| #177).                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1984 - On a partially cloudy day, at 4:12 p.m., 20 nautical miles     |
| east of the Straits of Gibraltar in the Mediteranean Sea the crew of  |
| the tanker Gori watched a disc-shaped object maneuver and pace their  |
| ship. The 25 meter in diameter disc had a rotating red dome, and a    |
| rosy neon glow from what looked like a cylindrical "tailpipe". The    |
| UFO was gleaming with a grayish metallic shine. The lower portion of  |
| the craft had a precise round shape, its diameter no more than twenty |
| meters. Around the lower portion of it they also observed "waves" of  |
| protuberances on the outside plating.                                 |
|                                                                       |
| The base of the object's body consisted of two semi-discs, the        |
| smaller being on top; they slowly revolved in opposing directions. At |
| the circumference of the lower disc Globa saw numerous shining,       |
| bright bead-like lights. The seaman's attention was centered on the   |
| bottom portion of the UFO. It looked as if it was completely even and |
| smooth, its color yellow like that of an egg yolk, with three         |
| pie-shaped spots, and in the middle of it they discerned a round,     |
| nucleus-like stain. At the edge of the UFO's bottom, which was easily |
| visible, was something that looked like a pipe. It glowed with an     |
| unnaturally bright rosy color, like a neon lamp. The top of the       |
| middle disc was crowned by a triangular-shaped something. It seemed   |
| that it moved in the same direction as the lower disc, but at a much  |
| slower pace. Suddenly the UFO jumped up several times, as if moved by |
| an invisible wave. Many lights illuminated its bottom portion. The    |
| crew of GORI tried to attract the object's attention using a signal   |
| projector. By this time Captain Sokolovky was on the deck with his    |
| men. He and his Second-in-Command watched the object intensely.       |
| However, the UFO appeared to be distracted by another ship,           |
| approaching at the port side. It was an Arab dry cargo ship, on its   |
| way to Greece. The Arabs confirmed that the object hovered over their |
| ship. A minute and a half later the object changed its flight's       |
| trajectory, listed to the right, gained speed and ascended rapidly.   |
| The Soviet seamen observed that when it rose through the clouds,      |
| appearing and disappearing again, it would occasional shine in the    |
| sun's rays. The craft then flared up, like a spark, and was gone      |
| instantly. (Sources: Sergey Romanov, International UFO Reporter, May  |

| 1991 - At around 6 p.m. the two witnesses had gone into the woods     |
| outside the Gainesville Job Corps Center in Gainesville, Florida. As  |
| they were walking towards a campsite, one of the men stopped and      |
| claimed to have seen two "werewolf" like beings float by. The other   |
| witness did not see this. They continued walking until they spotted a |
| saucer-shaped object on the ground. They advanced towards the object  |
| slowly when it suddenly disappeared. An uncontrollable fear then took |
| hold of them and they began running away from the area. One of the    |
| men looked over his shoulder to see a tall, dark, large-headed being  |
| wearing a dark robe with its hand folded in front of it. The men did  |
| not stop and did not return to the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,  |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1991, case # 3189, citing Peter Davenport,  |

| 1993 - An orange nocturnal light paralleled a car into Colborne,      |
| Ontario at 8:30 a.m. Two small lights were accompanying the orange    |
| light. They made no sound as they flew. (Source: UFO Newsclipping     |

| 1994 - At 5:30 p.m. Karen Manning was busy cooking in her second      |
| floor apartment in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and had  |
| kept the window opened in order to keep an eye on her children        |
| playing outside. Suddenly everything went very quiet and the children |
| were nowhere in sight. Dashing downstairs, she found the four         |
| children huddled together inside the apartment entrance. They told    |
| her they had seen a large disc-shaped craft flying low over the       |
| nearby highway. It was shiny-gold in color and emitted a whistling    |
| sound. The object had windows, through which they could see two blond |
| haired females looking out. These two women had panicky expressions   |
| on their faces and appeared to have tape covering their mouths. The   |
| children also saw a humanoid figure standing at a door-like entrance  |
| to the object. He was described as greenish in color with long        |
| pointed ears. He also had a third eye in the middle of the forehead   |
| that emitted a blue light. A beam of light descended from the craft   |
| and chased one of the girls, lifting her six inches from the ground.  |
| She also heard a voice inside her head. The craft then moved away in  |
| a northwesterly direction. The children felt extremely hungry after   |
| the incident. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database   |
