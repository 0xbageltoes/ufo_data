| 1949 - A yellow, rocket-shaped object flew within 100 feet under an   |
| airplane that was flying four miles southwest of Parkersburg, West    |
| Virginia at 2:45 p.m. The rocket had what looked to be fins. (Source: |

| 1952 - Several witnesses watched a 20 foot diameter disc hover over   |
| Camp Drum near Watertown, New York at 6:00 p.m. It circled the base   |
| making a sound like a "dynamo." (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A      |

| 1954 - A disc-shaped object descended and landed along the banks of   |
| the River Marne in Joinville-le-Pont, France at 9:20 p.m. Two         |
| humanoids about 1.10 meters tall exited the machine. Their faces were |
| covered with hair. A beam of light paralyzed both of the witnesses,   |
| and one of the humanoids approaches the witness with the initials     |
| M.P. and tore off his trousers. The short humanoids then boarded      |
| their machine, which rose vertically and disappeared at high speed.   |

| 1957 - Shortly after 11:00 p.m. a white luminous sphere landed in a   |
| field 700 yards away from the house of Mr. & Mrs. Aellig in Alliance, |
| Ohio. Eleven or twelve men, all seven feet tall, walked through the   |
| cornfield, wearing gray diver suits. One walked between the house and |
| their garage. The encounter lasted 18 minutes. (Source: David F. Webb |

| 1959 - At 11:20 p.m. a gray disc-shaped objects with lights,          |
| estimated to be six meters in diamete, hovered while spinning         |
| counterclockwise near Akron, Ohio. It appeared to spin in a clockwise |
| direction when rising in altitude. It eventually landed in a field.   |

| 1965 - At ten o'clock in the evening Dr. George Walton, a physical    |
| chemist with a Ph.D., and his wife witnessed two round white objects  |
| that flew side-by-side in the sky over Rodeo, New Mexico. The objects |
| flew at 30 to 50 feet above the ground, on a collision course with    |
| the witnesses' car, then moved parallel to the road and paced their   |
| car at 50-80 mph for six minutes. The object changed to a blue color. |

| 1967 - In Buret, Belgium at 7:00 a.m. two witnesses watched as two    |
| chrome colored saucers exited a fog bank 100 meters away. They were   |
| 20 meters in diameter. They emitted red satellites balls of light,    |
| then flew off to the west. (Sources: Jean Luc Vertongen, Inforespace, |

| 1970 – At 8:20 p.m. Mr. Don McTrow reportedly saw a green, domed      |
| object "half the size of a cabin" near Banff, Alberta, Canada. It had |
| four windows through which two human looking beings could be seen.    |
| The object emitted a high-pitched sound and was in view from five to  |
| six minutes. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue |

| 1970 – In Jessup, Pennsylvania a 16-year-old boy was returning home   |
| from a high school football game at ten o’clock at night when, three  |
| blocks from his home, he sighted a disc-shaped UFO. It was            |
| silver-aluminum in color and approximately 1,000 feet in length. It   |
| had a turret on top surrounded by a row of windows. The underside had |
| three large spheres, with a central flat disk. It was glowing white.  |
| The sky was clear and the object moved silently across the night sky  |
| in an easterly direction. While deciding whether to report this       |
| incident or not, the witness was peering out his kitchen window and   |
| sighted a large black limousine. He could see it quite clearly        |
| because there was a street lamp directly across the street from his   |
| house. Four occupants were in the vehicle. Two were seated in the     |
| front, and two in the back. Each had on dark suits and hats similar   |
| to those worn in the 1940's. They sat in their vehicle, motionless.   |
| They returned for the next several evenings. There was no verbal or   |
| physical contact with the strangers. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,      |

| 1970 - Thirteen-year-old David McTrow of Banff, Alberta, Canada saw a |
| green, domed disc "half the size of a cabin" at 8:20 p.m. Inside the  |
| craft could be seen two human-like beings. The UFO emitted a          |
| high-pitched sound. It was visible for 5-6 minutes. (Source: Gene     |

| 1971 - At two a.m. Benito Miranda, a 24-year-old truck driver, was    |
| driving on Highway 40 west of Itaperuna, Minas Gerais, Brazil when he |
| perceived a strong beam of reddish light, coming from something that  |
| blocked the road ahead of him. He lost control of his car, and it     |
| slowed down and stopped despite his best efforts. He got out of his   |
| car and saw an object about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle on the    |
| road. A door opened in the object and three diminutive beings, less   |
| than two feet tall, jumped down from it. They wore coveralls with     |
| "Roman type" helmets, and carried dazzling lights. With a yellow beam |
| of light they levitated him 150 feet from the ground, where he was    |
| floated for about 15 minutes. When the headlights of an approaching   |
| car came into view he was gently lowered back down to the ground, and |
| the object and its occupants vanished. He drove back to Itaperuna and |
| reported his close encounter to the police, who sent him to SAMDU     |
| Hospital to be examined. An independent witness, the driver of the    |
| approaching car, reported witnessing the event. (Sources: Irene       |

| 1971 - The first sighting of a tall, hairy creature to occur on this  |
| day in Wantage, Oxfordshire, England happened at 5:30 a.m., but no    |
| details are available. Later that same day Miss Linda Milne saw a     |
| tall, hairy creature enter some woods near the old Wantage canal. Two |
| 14-year-old boys said they were chased by it, that when they threw    |
| stones at it it ran towards them. They scaled a fence to get away,    |
| but the creature did as well. Later, they observed a disc-shaped      |
| object take off from a field in the same field. At the time there     |
| were many reports of UFOs in the area. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted   |

| 1971 - There were a number of sightings from across China on this     |
| day. In Xuchang a luminous object spiralled in a counterclockwise     |
| spin in the northwestern sky. It descended to a lower altitude, rose  |
| again, then shot away to the west. (Source: Wendelle Stevens & Paul   |

| 1975 - A member of the U.S. Air Force, at home on leave in Mountlake  |
| Terrace, Washington was awakened by barking dogs at 5:50 a.m. He saw  |
| a bright red sphere about a foot in diameter hovering 12 inches off   |
| the ground in front of his parked car. Beside it stood a man about 6' |
| 5" tall. The witness next heard a high-pitched, beeping sound that    |
| made him feel as if he were going to faint. He awakened his wife and  |
| the beeping sound immediately stopped. When they looked again the     |
| sphere and the figure were both gone. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted    |

| 1976 - At 11:00 p.m. between Mildura and Karrawinna, Victoria,        |
| Australia four witnesses watched red lights near the ground in a      |
| field. They hovered for one minute over their initial position,       |
| 50-100 feet above the ground, then drifted to the east gaining        |
| altitude; they then hovered again, and finally vanished. A distant    |
| rumbling was heard just after their disappearance. Three days after   |
| the sighting of the low level lights, a 21.6 meter (71 foot) circle   |
| of dried grass was found in the paddock were the straw had been blown |
| or sucked off. (Sources: International UFO Reporter, December 1976,   |

| 1977 - At midnight a man who had had a close encounter with a         |
| bright multicolored object the previous night, was again driving      |
| on the same highway on his way to San Juan, Puerto Rico when he began |
| hearing voices in his head. He stopped his car and flagged down a     |
| passing police officer, and he was taken to the local police station  |
| in Pedro Avila. When he felt better he left and again headed off      |
| towards San Juan, but after a few minutes he once again began to hear |
| voices, so he stopped the car and suddenly a bright light appeared.   |
| There was a brilliant flash, and a three-foot tall figure encased in  |
| light appeared. The witness felt dizzy and got out of his vehicle. He |
| felt a strange attraction to the little man and could not             |
| stop himself from approaching. The humanoid carried two loops in his  |
| right hand, and something resembling a flashlight that emitted a      |
| brilliant golden yellow light. The figure also radiated a blue aura   |
| that at times would briefly turn golden. The little man pointed to a  |
| nearby hovering light, and then entered it, which vanished abruptly.  |
| The man suffered from severe neck pain after his encounter. (Source:  |

| 1978 - On this afternoon in Ostuni, Apulia, Italy two observers       |
| watched a disc-shaped object make a whistling sound at 25 meters      |
| altitude. It maneuvered, made a descent and wobbled. It shot off to   |
| the south toward a NATO base. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer        |

| 1979 - In a farming region of Talco, Chile a peasant out plowing the  |
| fields encountered a landed disc-shaped craft. A tall humanoid        |
| emerged from the object and briefly chased the peasant. The humanoid  |
| caught up with the farmer, placing its hand on his shoulder. Later    |
| the farmer was treated at a local hospital for second and third       |
| degree burns on his shoulder, apparently caused by the humanoid's     |
| touch. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1979,    |

| 1979 - At 5 p.m. two witnesses at Lake George in Rochester, New York  |

| 1980 - Elias Seixas de Mattos and two of his friends were returning   |
| to Rio de Janeiro in a truck. At 10:28 p.m., when they had reached a  |
| point on the road near Conceicao de Araguaia, Goias State, Brazil the |
| driver felt a sensation like a cold liquid on his body, and heard a   |
| voice in his head telling him to go to a certain spot. The other two  |
| men saw a flash of light hit the hood of the truck. All three of them |
| then saw a luminous object on the ground about a mile away. Sr.       |
| Seixas got out of the vehicle and attempted to film the object, while |
| the other two men panicked and ran from the truck. A short while      |
| later Elias, feeling drowsy, talked one of the other men into driving |
| the truck. They next experienced the vehicle behaving in a strange    |
| manner, perhaps because it was being levitated, followed by a period  |
| of missing time. Later under hypnosis, Elias recalled floating into a |
| fiery red, cigar-shaped object with flashing white lights. Inside, he |
| entered an egg-shaped chamber attached to a large white circular room |
| with tables and machinery. A seven foot tall being, described as      |
| wearing a tight fitting, yellow coverall outfit that covered his      |
| entire body and head except for his face, operated the machinery. The |
| being had large, slanted, lilac colored eyes, a long nose, a large    |
| lipless mouth, long arms and hands, and very pale skin. He wore a     |
| belt with a circular buckle that had colored lights. An invisible     |
| barrier apparently prevented the witness from approaching the being.  |
| Seixas was submitted to several medical examinations on top of an     |
| exam bed-like apparatus. At one point the aliens connected some type  |
| of equipment to his head and chest. In addition, blood and sperm      |
| samples were taken from him. He remembered seeing two human like      |
| beings, one black, the other white, who resembled identical twins;    |
| they wore tight-fitting gray uniforms. The beings told Seixas that    |
| their point of origin was within the star cluster of Ursa Minor, and  |
| that they had bases on the planet Mars. (Sources: Irene Granchi, APRO |

| 1998 - At 4:40 a.m. the witness was driving his truck along his paper |
| route in Sunrise Beach, Texas when as he rounded a corner he saw a    |
| disc-shaped craft with green and orange lights hovering about 25 or   |
| 30 feet above the ground. He also briefly saw a 4 foot 8 inch tall    |
| figure apparently standing on the object that quickly disappeared     |
| from sight. When the truck started to slow down there was a very      |
| bright flash of light. The witnesses was momentarily blinded and when |
| he was able to focus again the object had disappeared. (Source:       |

| 1998 - At 8:00 p.m. two women driving north on Interstate 95 near     |
| Brattleboro, Vermont noticed several bright headlights approaching    |
| from behind. Three or four cars sped by the witnesses, who were doing |
| about 70 mph. The cars appeared to be traveling together. As the      |
| first car passed them, the headlights of the car directly behind it   |
| illuminated the interior. The witnesses then saw in the back seat of  |
| the front car a lone entity sitting erect. It looked tall with a huge |
| head on a spindly neck. Its color was pasty and it looked like a lot  |
| of veins covered its head. These cars drove at such a high speed that |
| they could not catch up with them. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,        |

| 2001 - While driving shortly after 6:00 p.m. near Canberra, ACT,      |
| Australia, a man and woman, Hans and Fiona, saw a combination of low  |
| flying, bright white lights. The two outer lights were round and      |
| bright, while the inner lights were dimmer. The sighting lasted 15    |
| seconds. (Source: Australian UFO Research Network, ufoinfo.com).      |

| 2002 - A close encounter in which one of the witnesses shot at the    |
| up-close, hovering UFO with his pistol occurred in the early morning  |
| hours on this day in Naxcivan, Azerbaijan. The main witness reported, |
| "My friends own an Internet café, and I closed up late that night. It |
| had been raining, but the rain stopped as I left the café at 3:30     |
| a.m." It was a very dark night, and when he looked up he saw a huge   |
| disc-shaped object, 500-600 meters in diameter, hovering overhead. It |
| was so close that it blocked the rain. He saw one man shoot his       |
| pistol at it about eight times, and the UFO started to move away,     |
| where upon it started to rain again. "The police came and arrested    |
| the man. I'm 100% sure this was a UFO." (Source: George A. Filer &    |

| 2002 - At 8:30 p.m. a white, V-shaped object hovered over Whitehorse, |
| Yukon Territory. It was seen to rotate and then descend. The incident |
| lasted three minutes. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 2002 Canadian UFO       |

| 2002 - A missing time incident also occurred at 8:30 p.m. local time  |
| in Grapevine, Tarrant County, Texas. The witness reported that he was |
| driving when he was approached by blinking lights on a circular UFO.  |
| This was followed by a period of missing time, and when he recovered  |
| consciousness he and his car were not in the same location as when    |
| the CE-4 experience began. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO     |

| 2003 - Two dogs showed fear as a mysterious, large dark object was    |
| observed for five minutes overhead in Marstons Mills, Massachusetts.  |
| At 8:20 p.m. the witness reported that the sky above him appeared to  |
| be a solid black, with no stars showing, nor light of any kind, and   |
| the black void was seen changing its shape. There was no sound        |
| reported, either. (Sources:  Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting  |

| 2008 - At 2:45 p.m. a metallic, disc-shaped object hovered in the sky |
| over Roscoe, Illinois for 30 seconds, and then shot off. It left      |
| behind a slight trail, but it also was gone in seconds. (Source:      |
