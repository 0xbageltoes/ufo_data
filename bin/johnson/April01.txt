| 1897 - The whole town of Everest, Kansas saw an object fly in under   |
| the cloud cover. It came down slowly, then flew away very fast to the |
| southeast. When directly over the town it swept the ground with a     |
| powerful searchlight. It was seen to rise up at a fantastic speed     |
| until barely discernible, then to come down again and sweep low over  |
| the witnesses. At one point it remained stationary for five minutes   |
| at the edge of a low cloud, which it illuminated. All said they could |
| clearly see the silhouette of the craft. (Source: Jacques Vallee,     |

| 1948 - At 9:55 a.m. a ten meter wide silver half disc maneuvered in   |
| the sky over Manila in the Philippines and made a number of           |
| ninety-degree turns. Lt. Meyers of the U.S. Air Force was leading a   |
| flight of four F-47S Thunderbolt  fighters of the 67th Fighter        |
| Squadron and was flying south at 1,500 ft altitude when he saw a      |
| half-moon shaped "flying wing" or crescent about 30 feet wide and 20  |
| feet long, with a small dorsal fin. It was flying on a northerly      |
| heading at about 1,000 feet three miles to his east. It made a 90°    |
| left turn and leveled out on a westerly heading accelerating rapidly  |
| to vanish in five seconds. There was no trail. Estimated terminal     |
| velocity was about 11 miles per second or 39,000 mph. Radio           |
| interference was reported at the time. (Sources: U.S. Air Force       |

| occupants left the craft. The witness was paralyzed by a beam of      |
| light. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 3317).         |

| 1959 - Horst Raps returned to the previously appointed site in        |
| Lampertheim, Germany where he had encountered a UFOnaut on March 29th |
| and found the hovering blue-violet disc-shaped craft and the tall     |
| humanoid waiting for him. This time he was invited onboard the UFO,   |
| and supposedly taken on an otherworldly ride to another planet in the |
| Alpha Centauri system. There he encountered various races of people,  |
| who allegedly lived in dwellings shaped like cupolas and cultivated   |
| multicolored flowers. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |

| 1963 - At 3:30 p.m. Mr. A. Mostaccieli in Chileno Valley, California  |
| reported seeing cattle panic and run when several small beings got    |
| out of a disc-shaped UFO. They caught a calf and took it on board the |
| craft, then collected some plants. He also reported a scorched area   |
| 10 meters wide. The local sheriff considered the report a practical   |
| joke. (Source: Petaluma Argus Courier, April 1, 1966; John A. Keel,   |

| 1966 - At midnight, Darlene Underwood and her mother of Liberty,      |
| Missouri saw two luminous objects land on a hill nearby their house.  |
| They watched them them through binoculars, and described them as      |
| egg-shaped and about the size of a large car. They then saw the       |
| shadows of one or two human-looking figures, and heard the beings     |
| shouting at each other loudly in a foreign, unintelligible language.  |
| After this they heard the sound of a pig squealing. Next, a point of  |
| green light issued from one of the objects, and they both took off    |
| and flew away rapidly. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,      |

| in Conifer, Colorado at 1:30 a.m. a light like a flashlight came      |
| halfway down a hill on the Davies ranch. Rancher D. F. Davies fired   |
| ten .38-caliber bullets at it and it disappeared. At 2:30 a.m. Randy  |
| Davies, who was still awake, saw a man with a light walk past the     |
| ranch house, so he ran outside calling to him. The light went out and |
| the man ran away. At 3:30 a.m. Louise Davies looked out the window    |
| and saw a man in the yard, who wore dark clothes and a mask that      |
| covered his face down to his shoulders. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted  |

| when they spotted a huge cylindrical object hovering just above their |
| heads. The object was 15 meters in length and was reddish in color.   |
| The craft then shone a beam of white light towards the ground and a   |
| short figure materialized within the light on the ground. The         |
| witnesses watched from about 600 meters away as this short being went |
| back and forth within the lighted area, then floated back up into the |
| object and disappeared. The craft then became brighter and rose up    |
| quickly, disappearing from sight in the darkness. (Source: Albert S.  |
