| 1948 – At 11:05 p.m. U.S. Air Force pilot Halter and radar operator   |
| Hemphill in a propeller driven P-61 "Black Widow" night fighter       |
| tracked up to six objects on radar over Fusuoka, Japan. The six       |
| bogeys were seen on the radar by Hemphill, and his radar picked up    |
| the targets five miles ahead of the plane. Only one of the bogeys was |
| seen visually. It was a dull or dark object, shaped like a bullet or  |
| dirigible with a flat bottom and with a heel-shaped clipped tail end. |
| Pilot Halter attempted to close on the visual object, but it          |
| dove below the F-61, then reappeared, and finally took off with a     |
| burst of speed. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official |

| 1950 – In Oak Ridge, Tennessee at 3:20 p.m. Atomic Energy Commission  |
| Troopers Rymer, J. Moneymaker, and Capt. Zarzecki sighted two shiny   |
| silver objects shaped like bullets. They dove in the sky leaving a    |
| smoke trail and one vanished. The other hovered at a low altitude     |
| only 50 feet away, then left and returned several more times, but     |
| somewhat further away. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in   |

| 1954 – Near the community swimming pool in Saint-Assiscle, Perpignan, |
| France Damien Figueres, age 56, was walking with his dogs when a red  |
| luminous sphere landed 30 meters away. A humanoid being in a diving   |
| suit got out and walked around it. The dogs barked at him. The being  |
| then boarded the craft and it flew away in silence. (Sources: Jacques |

| 1954 – In Boaria, Italy a farmer was leading his cows to a pond when  |
| he suddenly saw an object fly over his house. The cows panicked and   |
| ran away, knocking a girl to the ground, while the object emitted a   |
| burst of light. The farmer ran to the house and then fainted. Three   |
| other persons saw the craft depart. It was dark in color but          |
| surrounded by short blue and yellow flames. It was egg-shaped, flew   |
| at 15 meters above the ground, and emitted intense heat. The little   |
| pond was found desiccated, and haystacks caught fire as it flew over  |
| while the cattle suffered burns. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to |

| 1954 – At 7:50 p.m. at the Courbessac Airfield in Nimes, France a     |
| yellow, cigar-shaped object with brilliant portholes, 30 m long, 6 m  |
| diameter, was seen on the ground. Figures with helmets covering their |
| heads could be seen inside. A sort of haze was observed at both ends  |
| of the craft. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century |

| Starting on this date in 1954 and for the next two nights, fifty      |
| objects with illuminated bottoms were seen flying very fast in a      |
| V-formation on successive nights over Kingfisher, Oklahoma at around  |

| 1954 – While driving at night in Fouesnant, France truck driver Rene  |
| Le Viol saw a flat craft, -shaped like an inverted plate, fly very    |
| low toward the sea. A second disc followed shortly afterward. Both    |
| emitted a red glow. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the     |

| 1954 - At 9:00 p.m. a cigar-shaped object landed in Saint Privat,     |
| Vallongue, Lozere department, France. It took off vertically making   |
| a whistle sound and blazing red in color. (Source: Jean Sider,        |

| 1955 - In a forest east-southeast of Wissembourg, Bas-Rhin, France a  |
| huge, 400 meter long UFO was seen flying only six meters over some    |
| oak trees by a witness while driving on highway D3. It had 76         |
| porthole-shaped windows in three rows. (Source: Lumieres dans la      |

| 1966 - Jerry H. Simons had a close encounter with an orange domed     |
| disc-shaped object while driving at Split Rock Pond, New Jersey at    |
| 4:30 a.m. The UFO emitted a brilliant light beam. The engine and      |
| lights of his car died, and although the engine restarted             |
| spontaneously there was permanent damage to the mechanics.  His       |
| physiological effects included chronic illness, fatigue, anorexia,    |
| weight loss, weakness, and chills. (Source: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr.,   |

| 1968 - Driving across the desert near Kingman, Arizona with a         |
| hitchhiker at around 3:00 a.m., Michael Watts saw a "falling star"    |
| that stopped in midair, and then shot back up into the sky. The two   |
| men then stopped the car and got out to investigate a distant light   |
| source on the ground. When they walked up to it the light on the      |
| ground proved to be four lights, one of which took off into the air.  |
| Nearby they could dimly see two four-foot-tall beings with large      |
| heads and abnormally long arms, and heard a sound like digging. The   |
| hitchhiker then suggested they go back to the car for a gun, and the  |
| figures vanished. Other maneuvering lights were then observed. Then   |
| something sounding like a train passed by at a distance: it had a     |
| string of lighted windows in which silhouettes of passengers sitting  |
| up inside were visible. After this, a dark lens-shaped object having  |
| a flat dome on top and a row of pulsating multi-colored lights around |
| the edge approached them quite closely. As the dawn approached and it |
| became possible to see better, the remaining lights on the ground     |
| could be seen to be connected to a palely lit cigar-shaped object.    |
| Watts believes he may have experienced a memory lapse at this point.  |
| Cloven footprints were found at the site where the beings had been    |
| seen. The hitchhiker could not be identified and was therefore        |
| unavailable for an interview by the investigators. (Sources: Michael  |

| 1973 - A man in Omro, Wisconsin was awakened sometime after midnight  |
| by a brief, high-pitched sound. His bedroom was lit up by a bright,   |
| orange-red glow, and he saw three 4-5 foot tall humanoids             |
| materialize. They had baldheads; grayish white wrinkled skin and      |
| rounded ears. They moved mechanically. The witness passed out and     |
| then came to on the floor, propped against the wall, unable to move.  |
| The entities were examining him with an oval object that showed the   |
| bones of his legs when it passed over them. He had a severe headache  |
| and passed out again as a being reached toward him. He awakened       |
| toward dawn on the floor. He found the lights were left on the        |
| bedroom, and the bed sheets folded neatly back. (Sources: David F.    |

| 1973 - Late on this night a female witness and her sister observed a  |
| huge light maneuvering over Connersville, Indiana. The light darted   |
| across the sky and began to descend near them. She ran up to the      |
| craft and remembered seeing three large windows. In one window stood  |
| a very short humanoid with protruding eyes and four fingers on each   |
| hand. He wore a tight-fitting outfit with a hood. Other people had    |
| gathered to see the UFO and stood around as if in a trance. The       |
| witness was taken inside and glided around with the short humanoid    |
| next to her. She remembered seeing two other humanoids sitting at a   |
| control panel, and three cubicles as well as beautiful curved walls   |
| inside the craft. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| 1973 - Awakened by the barking of their dogs late on this night, a    |
| farm family living near Berea, Tennessee saw lights from a UFO in the |
| woods. Mr. James Cline saw a being with a glowing white head cross    |
| the road 50 feet away from him. Claw-like tracks were found in the    |
| dirt road later, as well as "landing marks" two feet long by 12 feet  |
| wide where the UFO had been. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted          |

| 1974 - In Ramona, California five young people from the Overfelt and  |
| Nelson families saw a round UFO making a humming noise maneuver in    |
| the sky for several minutes, and then land. Many types of animals (a  |
| horse, a dog, a goat, chickens, and a cat) reacted to the landed      |
| object. Compass deflection was reported, as well as TV and radio      |
| interference. (Sources: George D. Fawcett, Official UFO, August 1975, |

| 1976 - Paul Bennett was playing with five friends near Westfield      |
| Grove in Wrose, Yorkshire, England at around 7:30 in the evening when |
| he saw “a little black creature about two-foot tall” standing at the  |
| edge of the road. The short humanoid creature then ran with little    |
| short paces across the road and up Westfield Grove. Its head was      |
| “squashed” like a tomato, and it had no feet or toes; its legs        |
| extended straight to their extremities; similarly, its thin arms were |
| lacking hands and fingers. There were no facial features visible,     |
| neither ears nor hair. None of the other boys appeared to have seen   |
| it, and most of them made fun of Paul when he told them. One of them, |
| Michael McDermott, did assist Paul in a search for some evidence of   |
| the little creature, and they found a set of 30 small circular        |
| footprints leading from a puddle along the route taken by the being.  |
| McDermott claimed he heard a faint whistling sound and someone        |

| 1976 - Driving home from friend's apartment near midnight in the      |
| suburbs of Burgoberbach, France, an 18-year-old woman had a close     |
| encounter with a disc-shaped object that made no sound. The UFO had   |
| two rows of lights: the top row was red and the bottom row was white. |
| There was no moon nor stars visible in the sky at the time. (Source:  |

| 1977 - In Colares, Para State, Brazil Raimundo Galvao Trindade, age   |
| 36, saw an orange light outside in the sky at 4:00 a.m. He next felt  |
| as if he had been pricked by a needle in the leg from a beam of       |
| energy. His subsequent symptoms included weakness, a headache,        |
| dizziness, and a red area on his thigh. (Source: Bob Pratt, Operacao  |

| 1977 - At 8:00 p.m in Zugliano, Veneto, Italy a huge luminous         |
| disc-shaped object descended into a field, and then stayed on the     |
| ground for several minutes. A metallic noise was heard, and the       |
| object suddenly took off. (Source: Maurizio Verga, ITACAT).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - At 7:30 a.m. the witness, a 50-year-old important Communist    |
| Party politician, was alone in a wooded area in Jaraba, Zaragoza,     |
| Spain attempting to photograph some eagle nests, when suddenly all    |
| sounds in the area ceased. He then began walking and next heard a     |
| weak whistling sound. He started to feel nauseated with a metallic    |
| taste in his mouth, and his wristwatch felt hot to the touch. When he |
| turned around, he saw in clearing a 5 meter metallic dome-shaped      |
| craft whose perimeter was which surrounded by small antennae like     |
| protrusions. Next to the object stood two very tall men, 1.90 meters  |
| in height, with blond hair wearing blue-gray outfits and wide belts.  |
| One was leaning over a metallic tube apparently stuck on the ground.  |
| The other carried a box with a small sphere on top. The one holding   |
| the tube motioned to the witness to approach. The man felt a wave of  |
| heat as he approached to within 20 meters, so he stopped              |
| and frightened, yelled at them. He heard his own voice in a           |
| strange, weirdly distorted manner. The two UFOnauts then walked back  |
| over to the object and got aboard. The whistling sound now            |
| intensified and the witness felt an electric shock on the back of his |
| neck and strange vibrations on the ground. The craft lifted up and    |
| flew out of sight while the whistling sound increased. He managed to  |
| take a photograph of the object as it departed, and a hole was found  |
| in the ground at the scene. UFO investigators found the witness to be |
| well qualified but uncooperative, seeking to avoid publicity.         |

| 1997 - Duncan, Oklahoma - At 2:15 a.m. the witness suddenly awoke      |
| feeling a strange presence in his bedroom. An odd feeling swept       |
| through his body, forcing him to close his eyes. His next memory was  |
| of being awake at 5:15 a.m. with a strange presence still in the      |
| room, and he once again felt forced to close his eyelids. When he     |
| woke up in the morning he was able to recall standing naked in an     |
| oval-shaped metal room with small windows in the top right hand       |
| corner. Directly behind him there was a large door where the two oval |
| walls met. In the middle of the room there was an odd looking         |
| operating table with two needle devices on robotic arms sticking out  |
| of the side. This was the only apparent object in the room.           |
|                                                                       |
| Afraid, he began banging on the large door demanding to be let out.   |
| He could hear voices in the background. He was then told by an angry  |
| male voice, in his head, to either lay down on the table or someone   |
| he loved would get hurt. He did as he was told. He was then asked to  |
| lay down in such a manner that his left lower back was exposed to the |
| two needles. At the base of the needle there was a triangle-shaped    |
| piece of metal and two rectangle designs on both sides. He was then   |
| told by a friendly female voice that he would feel no pain but would  |
| feel his legs go numb, and would feel paralyzed and unable to move.   |
| The robotic arm moved closer to his back and plunged the needle into  |
| his back. He felt the clear liquid being injected into his body. He   |
| then felt paralyzed, and after a minute the needle device began       |
| sucking instead of injecting. It then moved back and the second       |
| needle performed the same operation. He woke up the next morning      |
| feeling some pain in his lower back with a triangular shaped imprint  |
| on it. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1997,    |

| 2000 - There were two apparent abductions involving missing time in   |
| the United States on this day, and they both were reported to the     |
| National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle by the percepients. The      |
| first was in Del Valle, Texas and occurred at around 2:30 a.m. A      |
| woman was awakened by a loud noise that seemed to be getting louder   |
| and approaching her house from above, as if a flying object was       |
| coming down in a vertical descent. For some reason she continued to   |
| stay in bed, terrified and shaking but unable to move. She suddenly   |
| became aware of a presence, and when she turned her heard she saw     |
| several figures in the room: two of them took hold of her shoulders,  |
| one on each side. She then felt warm and was stood straight up. Next, |
| she was floated across the floor and out the front door, accompanied  |
| by a bright white light. The beings were short with large             |
| heads, large black eyes and long dangling arms. Her next memory was   |
| being back in her bedroom at 4:30 a.m. She again heard the loud       |
| noise, but this time it seemed to be leaving the area. She also       |
| noticed a strong odor in the room that went away after a few moments. |

| 2000 - The second apparent abduction and missing time experience      |
| occurred at eleven o'clock that night in Martins Ferry, Ohio. A man   |
| was sleeping when he was jolted awake by the sound of the bedroom     |
| window being pried open. When his eyes came into focus, he saw two    |
| figures already inside the room and a third coming inside. The        |
| figures appeared to be slightly luminous. The terrified witness could |
| not speak, and began to sway back and forth on his bed. One of the    |
| figures then became dark and apparently approached the witness. He    |
| now felt hands around his mouth, and was lifted up. He then became    |
| unconscious, and could not remember anything else of the incident.    |
| The next day his neighbor mentioned something about seeing a strange  |
| object on the ground in a nearby field. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,   |

| fellow crew members to a bogey at the 5 o'clock position while flying |
