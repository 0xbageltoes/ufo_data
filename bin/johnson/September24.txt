| 1952 - The crew of a USAF B-29 bomber, flying near Charleston, West   |
| Virginia at 3:30 p.m. reported seeing a lot of bright, metallic       |
| particles or flashes, up to three feet in length, stream past their   |
| aircraft for 15 minutes. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in |

| 1954 - At nine o'clock in the morning two women, Mrs. Geoffroy and    |
| Miss Gazelle Fin, independently witnessed a dark gray disc, six       |
| meters in diameter, in a clearing in Becar, near Diges, Yonne,        |
| France. A man of normal height was seen standing close to it. He wore |
| dark clothes and some kind of cap. Miss Fin came within 30 meters of  |
| the craft and said that it looked like the man was repairing it.      |
| Traces were found on the grass. (Sources: Le Parisien, September 28,  |

| 1954 - At 10 o'clock in the morning Cesar Cardoso and three others    |
| saw two individuals, 2.5 meters (8.3 feet) tall emerge from a landed  |
| craft in Almaseda, near Castelibranco, Portugal. They were dressed in |
| shiny uniforms, and were gathering flowers, shrubs, and other         |
| vegetation and putting it in a shiny box. Before they took off they   |
| seemed to be inviting the witnesses aboard, but their language was    |
| not understood. (Sources: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers Uncensored,  |

| 1954 - At sometime before 3:00 p.m. in Bayonne, Pyrenees-Atlantique,  |
| France three metallic ovoid objects hovered in a triangular formation |
| for over one minute, then flew away fast. At 3:00 p.m. a fast silent  |
| cigar-shaped object crossed the sky slowly over the Vichy stadium,    |
| Allier, France and was seen by many. These are two of the defining    |
| sightings of the Bayonne to Vichy (BAVIC) orthotenic line discovered  |
| by Aime Michel and confirmed by Dr. David R. Saunders.(Sources: Aime  |

| 1956 - Two 10 meter wide disc-shaped objects were observed at 300     |
| meters altitude in Gibston, Tennessee at 5:30 a.m. One hovered while  |
| the other rocked back and forth. They both had a dark circle around   |
| their rims. They suddenly shot off to the east. (Source: Loren E.     |

| 1966 - At 9:20 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. Burwood were driving between         |
| Tilshead and Shrewton on Highway A360 in Wiltshire County, England    |
| when  their car headlights and engine died. A red misty light         |
| descended and landed behind their car. It was 15 feet in diameter and |
| only 30 feet away. When another car came around the corner it         |
| vanished. (Sources: T. Burwood, Flying Saucer Review,                 |

| 1968 - At 9:00 p.m. a 56-year-old woman in Cedeira, La Coruna, Spain  |
| saw a bright light coming from Ponteiro, and she later observed two   |
| tall men walking on the road toward her. There were “lights of        |
| changing color visible on their faces.” Frightened, she ran to her    |
| nearest neighbor's home. A sailor went out to investigate but found   |
| nothing. However, an investigator later found “a burned area,         |
| irregular but about two meters in diameter" at the supposed landing   |
| site. (Sources: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, FSR, May-June 1973,     |

| 1969 - An architect named Breeus in Zellik, Belgium watched two       |
| silent, glowing delta-shaped objects stop in mid-flight at 8:10 p.m.  |
| A dog barked furiously during the five minute encounter.              |
| The flourescent UFOs hadedges lit by bluish-white light, red          |
| underparts, and created fiery exhaust trails. (Sources: FSR,          |

| 1973 - On this evening two patrolmen in Fort Wayne, Indiana saw an    |
| unidentified light while checking on a UFO report from a woman from   |
| Churubosco. The object moved slowly. Authorities at Baier Field were  |
| notified, who reported that no aircraft were in the vicinity nor had  |
| any balloons been launched, but they also observed the object in the  |
| western sky. (Source: Skylook, issue 72, p. 15).                      |

| 1974 - At 12:10 a.m. near Eggardon Hill between Newport and Bridport, |
| England a motorist reported that the interior of his car became cold  |
| and there was a loss of power resulting in no acceleration, plus the  |
| lights dimmed for four seconds. He witnessed a bluish circular tube   |
| with blurred edges that zigzagged as it rose, and was gone from view  |
| in 15 seconds. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle |

| 1974 - Two men at Rock Lake, south of Wheatland, Wyoming saw 35       |
| silver disc-shaped objects approach making a droning noise as they    |
| flew to the north at 4:40 p.m. The objects stopped and hovered over   |
| the lake. One object tilted, circled, and then ascended. The entire   |
| event lasted 35 minutes. (Source: APRO Bulletin, December 1975,       |

| 1978 - At the army barracks near Biela Lake, Carpathia, Romania the   |
| witness of a humanoid encounter the previous night was out with a     |
| friend checking an animal trap when they ran into another soldier who |
| suddenly cried out, pointing to a tall dark figure on a nearby hill.  |
| The being was standing next to an oil tank. The three men retreated   |
| to their barracks, then came back out, noticing that the being was    |
| still there. One of them walked towards the figure holding a club in  |
| his hand, and attempted to strike at it, but was somehow unable to    |
| hit it. That soldier suddenly fell over backwards. The being then     |
| bent down and examined him for a few moments. The other two heard a   |
| strange sound coming form the being and saw something flash in its    |
| hand. They wanted to assist their friend but were unable to move.     |
| When the being finally disappeared and they were able to move they    |
| went to check on their friend. He was unconscious and half of his     |
| body appeared softer than the other half. His face and hands were     |
| red. That night other soldiers saw weird dancing egg-shaped lights on |
| top of the hill, and strange marks were found on the barrack window   |
| blinds the next day. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact     |

| 1982 - At 6:00 p.m. three witnesses in a rescue boat in Braviken Bay, |
| Ostergotland, Sweden had their navigational radar go crazy when their |
| boat was caught in the wake of a very large object that dove into the |
| ocean from the sky. (Source: Andre Liljegren, AFU Sweden, issue #     |

| 1987 - A 16-year-old farm boy and high school student, Tirn Kendall,  |
| was driving at 35 mph down a road in Corydon, Indiana when he noticed |
| a bright blue light behind him. Within seconds the Saturn-shaped UFO  |
| proceeded to pass him and moved in front, then tilted right to avoid  |
| hitting a house, powerlines and trees. The object went straight       |
| ahead, and then shot straight up, paused and finally accelerated out  |
| of sight. When the UFO passed the car there was a slight stall to the |
| engine, and the headlights and dashboard lights dimmed for a few      |
| seconds. The UFO was about the size of a car, had a greenish-yellow   |
| glow, antennae, and multicolored (red, orange, blue and green) lights |
| on the rim. There was a bright blue light in the center of the bottom |
| dome and antennae on both the top and bottom domes. The close         |
| encounter lasted 15 seconds. (Sources: Francis L. Ridge, Regional     |

| 1988 - At 8:00 p.m. a 400 meter long fiery cylinder flew at low       |
| altitude over the tundra near Bruderovskiy-Raspadok in the Asiatic    |
| region of Vladivostok, Russia. It left behind a white vapor trail.    |

| 1989 - At 10:30 a.m. a Mr. Kugatov in Voronezh, Russia witnessed an   |
| airship-like elliptical object that flew rapidly toward the east,     |
| then reversed direction. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, |
| Volume II:  A Thirty-Year Report, p. 155; Jacques Vallee, UFO         |

| 1992 - At around six o'clock in the evening several villagers         |
| in Pedrera, Sevilla, Spain, including a woman named Paca and two      |
| local boys, were walking up a hill when Paca suddenly felt chills and |
| felt compelled to go to a nearby olive grove. The others followed     |
| her. When she entered the olive grove she suddenly felt as if her     |
| feet were fixed to the ground and she was unable to move from the     |
| spot. Moments later a luminous figure appeared, hovering about 10     |
| meters away in front of an olive tree and suspended on a bright       |
| glowing "cloud" 25 cm above the ground. The figure was described as a |
| female wearing a blue dress with a white blouse and an intense sky    |
| blue scarf on its head, which is classically similar to descriptions  |
| of apparitions of the Virgin Mary. She saw what appeared to be 12     |
| small lights hovering over the figure's head. Another witness,        |
| standing directly beside Paca, was not able to see anything.          |
| According to Paca the figure had extremely beautiful facial features, |
| but was somewhat pallid. The hair was light brown in color and its    |
| eyes were "caramel" colored. She suddenly became able to move again,  |
| but when she attempted to approach the glowing figure it seem to      |
| vanish, but when she stepped back it would reappear again. This       |
| disappearance-reappearance of the apparition was repeated several     |
| times. During the encounter the area suddenly became cold. Paca again |
| became paralyzed and was unable to speak, and one of the other        |
| witnesses, a young woman, fell to the ground and went into a trance.  |
| The young woman began speaking in a slow deliberate manner, repeating |
| the words, "Pray for peace in the world." A strong rose-like          |
| fragrance then permeated the area. The apparition moved in slow       |
| motion, and it never moved its arms or legs or made any facial        |
| gestures. Its body was described as thin and child-like, and was only |
| about one meter in height. It never once spoke to any of the          |
| witnesses present. The two local children, Cristina and Sergio, who   |
| were present at this time, were to have another encounter two weeks   |
| later. Around the same time and in the same area, witnesses observed  |
| what they called a "procession of monks" walking in single file in a  |
| field. They wore black smocks and cowls that covered their faces      |
| completely. Others saw a tall heavy set man, described as wearing a   |
| brown monk's outfit, with sandals and walking with a large cane. He   |
| had a long dark beard, never spoke to anyone and seemed to be in      |
| a trance. Three days before these encounters a local power failure    |
| had occurred and a huge white light traversed the area, leaving       |
| behind a luminous wake. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact  |

| 1992 - A woman abductee from Springfield, Missouri recalled being     |
| onboard a craft in the early morning hours, and apparently witnessed  |

| removal around the jaw of the cow. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,        |

| 1995 - In the early hours after midnight Edson Roberto Marcelo, age   |
| 29, was driving along a road near his city of Santa Barbara D'Oeste,  |
| Sao Paulo State, Brazil when he noticed a very bright light by the    |
| side of the road. A beam of light suddenly illuminated his car, and   |
| Edson felt a wave of heat and quickly blacked out. When he came to he |
| found himself several kilometers from where he had seen the light,    |
| and 40 minutes of missing time had transpired. Very shaken and with   |
| irritated eyes, he next drove to the home of a friend. The next day   |
| he found several unexplained marks on his wrists and his ears were    |
| buzzing. Upon inspecting his vehicle he noticed that parts of the     |
| steering wheel had apparently been melted. Later, he vaguely          |
| remembered being inside a room with smooth walls and of lying on top  |
| of a table. There he remembers being given a telepathic order         |
| instructing him to forget the whole episode. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U |

| girl and a boy, spotted a four-foot-tall sky-blue figure marching     |
| through a cornfield near their school not far from Georgeville,       |
| Pennsylvania. The creature was reportedly striding across the         |
| clearing, swinging its arms back and forth like a soldier. It had     |
| long arms that ended in three fingers. It also had a tube-like        |
| appendage coming from the top of its head and dangling down its back. |
| Its skin color was light blue and it had a black "thing" that         |
| appeared to be an eye but lower than normal, where a nose should have |
| been. They watched the entity for about nine minutes. (Sources:       |
