| 1897 - Judge Lawrence A. Byrne of Texarkana, Arkansas was surveying a |
| tract of land when he saw a peculiar object anchored on the ground.   |
| "It was manned by three men who spoke a foreign language, but judging |
| from their looks one would take them to be Japs." (Source: Jacques    |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 185).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1897 - According to the Houston Post, two men reported that they had  |
| discovered a landed airship near the town of Kountze, Texas. It was   |
| cigar shaped, 50 feet long and 20 feet wide. They talked to the two   |
| human occupants of the airship, named Jackson and Wilson, who were    |
| allegedly repairing a punctured "air compartment." (Sources: Houston  |

| 1954 - On this evening a three meter wide glowing ball of light       |
| circled a house in Pearcy, Arkansas slowly, stopping at irregular     |
| intervals. It then dove at a man walking in the yard. When he tried   |
| to put a spotlight on it, it would dodge the beam every time. There   |
| were six male witnesses, and the encounter lasted 20 minutes.         |

| 1959 - At 12:10 a.m. a luminous disc flew over a pasture in           |
| Bradenton, Florida and stopped two kilometers away from the           |
| witnesses. It emitted a beam of light that searched the ground for a  |
| couple of minutes, then it flew away toward the south. (Source: Loren |

| 1964 - A nine-foot in diameter lens-shaped UFO with a dome hovered    |
| six feet above the ground in Rivesville, West Virginia at 7:30 a.m.   |
| making a humming sound. It extended a three-foot wide cylinder to     |
| ground, and a black figure, three to four feet tall, with painted     |
| ears and a tail emerged, collecting grass and dirt samples. The       |
| creature got back in the craft and it took off vertically. The        |
| witness was a woman named Ms. Frederick. (Sources: Ted Phillips,      |

| 1966 - At around 2:00 a.m. a 60-foot long cigar-shaped object with    |
| multiple legs for landing gear and a light beam, making a roaring     |
| noise, landed on the Johnson farm in Clarinda, Iowa. It illuminated   |
| the area surrounding it with a red color, and cattle on the farm      |
| bolted and ran in response to the object's presence. It left behind a |
| smell like ozone and deep impressions in the ground, with 20          |
| imprints. (Sources: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr., Strange Effects from      |

| 1966 - At 2:15 in the afternoon in Bingham, Maine Miss Kim Baker, a   |
| 6-year-old girl, saw a shiny metallic, lens-shaped object, 18 feet    |
| wide, descend and land a few yards from her in a field. It had red    |
| lights on each side, a flashing green light on top, and a rectangular |
| window through which she saw a man's face. He winked and smiled at    |
| her, and said something she could not hear. He had a "bubble" on his  |
| head that he took off before speaking. He then stood up, and she      |
| could see that he was wearing "shiny white" clothing with numerous    |
| black buttons on his chest. Then the object took off again. At the    |
| site her parents found a circular area of crushed pussy willow        |
| bushes, about 15 feet in diameter. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted      |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1966-20, citing |
| Richard Bonenfant; Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database       |
| 1966).                                                                |

| 1971 - At 8:30 a.m. Mrs. French, a school teacher in the mountains of |
| Kempsey, New South Wales, Australia sighted a fiery orangish-red ball |
| of light that showed white and trailed behind it a very long          |
| cigar-shaped object, flying from the east to the southwest. As the    |
| same time, to the northwest of Kempsey in Collambatti Rail, New South |
| Wales three 13-year-old boys with the last names of Fuller and        |
| Donnelly saw a silvery ovoid UFO with four legs or landing gear fly   |
| overhead. The legs had what looked like landing pads at the ends of   |
| them, and the object gave off flames and exhaust. It may have landed  |
| remotely. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, May-June 1971, p. 4; Eileen        |
| Buckle, FSR Case Histories, December 1971, pp. 1-2, citing the        |

| 1974 - A UFO with green, red and white lights engaging in complex     |
| maneuvers over Warden Hill was sighted by 64 students in Luton, Essex |
| County, England on this night. A second object had three blinding     |
| white lights, and appeared to land. At the suspected landing site     |
| large scorched areas and marks were found in the grass, with lumps of |
| a black clayish material also found lying around. (Sources: Ted R.    |
| Phillips, MUFON Conference Proceedings: 1975, p. 105; Ted R.          |

| 1976 - A man was reportedly abducted for four hours by a UFO that     |
| landed in a pasture in Quixada, Ceara State, Brazil at 5:00 a.m. Soon |
| after the abduction experience his mental and physical health quickly |
| deteriorated, and now he is described as completely mindless by his   |
| fellow villagers. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Confrontations: A         |

| Zone: Terror and Death in Brazil--Where Next?, p. 153; Richard H.     |

| 1976 - At 11:15 p.m., while half the town of Matapozuelos, Spain was  |
| watching a reddish oval shaped craft maneuvering overhead,            |
| 14-year-old Fidel Hernandez Rolla was playing with some friends in a  |
| field outside of town, when they saw the reddish spheres slowly       |
| descend and land on a nearby field. All of Fidel's friends fled in    |
| panic, so he was left behind alone. With a mixture of fear and        |
| curiosity, Fidel approached the object and then crouched behind a     |
| stonewall to watch the enigmatic craft. Suddenly a row of lights      |
| became visible inside an opening in the craft. Fidel was able to see  |
| numerous multi-colored lights, monitors and other unidentified        |
| apparatus inside the craft. The craft was topped by a crystal dome    |
| and inside the dome several very tall, human-like figures could be    |
| seen moving about. He then saw three tall man-like figures appear     |
| from behind the object, not very far from his location. The humanoids |
| were over two meters tall and wore tight-fitting white uniforms with  |
| belts and boots. They all had light blond, shoulder-length hair.      |
| Their faces were human-like but with large almond-shaped eyes. In     |
| single file the three tall beings walked to a potato field where      |
| several pounds of potatoes were stacked high in a pyramid. After      |
| looking at the potatoes for a few seconds, the beings then stared at  |
| the witness. At this point Fidel heard unintelligible words inside    |
| his head, as if the humanoids were attempting to communicate with him |
| telepathically. A few seconds later the beings suddenly vanished in   |
| plain sight. At the same time, the object rose up from the ground     |
| emitting a steady buzzing sound. As the object disappeared into the   |
| distance, several additional towns people arrived to see the object   |
| disappear into space. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |
| Database 1976, citing Iker Jimenez, Enigmas Sin Resolver).            |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - At around 1:00 a.m. Mrs. Pauline Coombs, age 31, and her       |
| husband Billy, age 36, were watching television at their Ripperston   |
| farm near Little Haven, Dyfed, Wales when they saw a silver-suited    |
| figure outside their window. Pauline had seen it first, but she said  |
| nothing about it to her husband until he himself saw it. "It must     |
| have been over seven-foot tall, because we could not see its face."   |
| It was described as three feet wide, surrounded by a luminous glow.   |
| Its box shaped helmet framed a dark square area in which no face was  |
| visible. They called the BUFORA investigator Randall Jones Pugh, and  |
| the police immediately, but the figure had gone before they arrived.  |
| Mrs Coombs and her family had been involved in two other UFO          |
| incidents prior to this encounter. (Sources: Hugh Turnbull, FSR, June |
| 1977, p. 6, citing Western Telegraph, April 28, 1977; David F. Webb & |
| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1977-23,    |
| citing Randall Jones Pugh, for BUFORA).                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - In Dover, Massachusetts shortly before midnight Will Taintor,  |
| age 18, was driving Miss Abby Brabham, age 15, home. At a point 1.2   |
| miles east-northeast of the Baxter sighting the previous night, they  |
| saw a small figure crouching on all fours, facing their car, in the   |
| lefthand lane of the road. It looked like a hairless, beige-colored   |
| small ape, but with a very large, oblong-shaped head. It had two      |
| large round eyes in the center of its head, which glowed green in the |
| car's headlights. No nose, ears, or tail could be seen. They drove    |
| past within eight feet of the creature, which Abby observed closely   |
| for about five seconds. Her companion, occupied with driving the car, |
| only glimpsed it briefly. Neither of them knew of the other earlier   |
| sightings at the time. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,        |
| HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1977-22 (A1724), citing   |
| Loren Coleman, Joseph Nyman & Walter Webb; Jerome Clark, Fate, March  |
| 1978, p. 50).                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - Mrs. Castro was driving on Highway 101 in Goleta, Santa        |
| Barbara County, California at 7:30 p.m. when her car engine lost      |
| power, and her car radio went off. A bright light in the sky made a   |
| "zinging" sound, then dimmed to reveal four revolving green and blue  |
| lights on the UFO, estimated to be about 10 meters in diameter. The   |
| close encounter lasted three minutes. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO    |
| Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, p. 72).                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1980 - At 7:40 p.m. on this evening Sr. N. Sayago was driving his car |
| on the outskirts of the city of Santa Rosa, La Pampa province,        |
| Argentina when he noticed something falling from the sky near some    |
| high-tension power lines. His vehicle suddenly stopped and could not  |
| be re-started again. He next felt a chilling breeze at this heet. He  |
| looked up and saw a very tall being gesturing at him. He was          |
| approached by two of these seven foot tall creatures, who he          |
| described as seven feet tall, with webbed hands, long pointed ears,   |
| protruding mouths, and almost no hair. They both wore shiny, almost   |
| luminous black diver suits. Their faces resembled very gaunt skulls,  |
| with hollow eyes and no visible noses. The beings moved their lips    |
| but did not speak. One of them took his hand with both of his cold    |
| hands, and Sr. Sayago beganto feel weak and dizzy. He then passed     |
| out. When he awoke he and the car were ten blocks away from where the |
| encounter had taken place. He was hospitalized for a nervous          |
| breakdown. (Sources: UFO Newspaper Clipping Service, June 1980, p. 9, |

| 1993 - On this day, during a heavy concentration of UFO sighting      |
| reports in the State of Fortaleza, Brazil, a man named Jose Ernani    |
| claimed to have encountered a being of light during prayer at a local |
| grotto in Vila Peri. He described the being as female, about 19-years |
| old, with finely chiseled features, a pink complexion, a heart shaped |
| mouth, and long brown wavy hair. Her eyes were of a "penetrating"     |
| blue color. She wore a silky dress with a short sash about four       |
| inches wide. On the sash he could see two ingrained faces. Ernani     |
| interpreted the being as an apparition of the Virgin Mary. (Source:   |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1993, HC# 2701, citing   |
| Reginaldo de Athyayde, FSR).                                          |

| 1995 - On this afternoon Sr. Reynaldo Ortega, a resident of           |
| Naranjito, Puerto Rico saw a gigantic bird-like creature standing on  |
| the roof of his house. Sr. Ortega had gone to look for a small goat   |
| on his property, because an epidemic of unexplained animal deaths and |
| mutilations was ongoing. He described the winged creature as between  |
| three and four feet tall, with the body and dark plumage of an eagle, |
| a thick neck, and piercing red eyes. The nightmarish raptor had an    |
| even more peculiar characteristic: instead of a beak it had what      |
| looked like the muzzle of a wolf. The creature ignored Ortega and     |
| flew away. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database      |
| 1995, citing Scott Corrales, Chupacabra and Other Mysteries).         |
|                                                                       |
| 2000 - At 6:40 p.m. a mathematician flying on a commercial airliner   |
| from Denver, Colorado to San Jose, California saw a "circular silvery |
| object with a rounded top" speed by several thousand feet below him   |
| somewhere over northern Nevada. He was able to calculate that the     |
| domed disc-shaped craft would have had a diameter of 55 feet, and a   |
| speed of about 3,000 mph. (Sources: Peter Davenport, National UFO     |

| 2001 - A man in Salmon Arm, British Columbia awoke to a noise outside |
| his door late at night and saw a blue glow enter his bedroom. He next |
| heard a loud buzzing sound, and then his entire body went completely  |
| tingly and numb and he was overcome by an intense sensation of fear.  |
| He found himself unable to move or speak. At this point he noticed    |
| two short shadowy figures that had appeared, almost dancing around    |
| his bed, while he was attempting to move. He managed to blurt out     |
| "get out" and the figures and the light vanished. (Sources: Geoff     |

| 2001 - At 4:10 p.m. in Caronno Pertusella, Piedmont, Italy two        |
