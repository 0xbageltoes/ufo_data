| 1947 - At 11:30 a.m. 47,000 people in a new football stadium in       |
| Managua, Nicaragua saw several silver saucers descend, spin and hover |
| for several seconds; then they shot straight up and away. (Source:    |

| 1948 - South of Nevada, Missouri a witness first heard a whirring     |
| sound at 4 p.m., then saw a large disc-shaped object hovering. Two    |
| small objects dropped from the disc and flew away to the southwest.   |
| The disc then flew off toward the northeast. (Source: Larry Hatch, U  |

| 1952 - during the Korean War, two Americans flying in a T-6         |
| aircraft over Pyongyang Sector CT 7943 at 1:07 p.m. local time saw a  |
| 10 foot diameter silver sphere below their plane. It flew north for 5 |
| miles, then made a 180 degree turn to the south and climbed in        |
| altitude. When the plane banked toward the UFO, it banked into a      |
| left-hand orbit around the aircraft. (Source: Richard Haines,         |

| Also in 1952, a elliptical blue-white light was spotted from an Air   |
| Force B-47 bomber over Wichita, Kansas at 20:25 p.m. It had an orange |
| or red tail, and moved erratically. The case is listed as a Project   |
| Blue Book "unknown." At 6:45 p.m. a ring of colored lights, rotating  |
| counter-clockwise, was sighted at 400' altitude north of Frederica,   |
| Delaware. (Sources: Project Blue Book, case 2224; Loren Gross, UFOs:  |
| A History 1952: November-December, p. 23).                            |

| 1954 - In Augusta, Maine 10 gold circular objects flew slowly in a    |
| vertical V formation at a low altitude at four o'clock in the         |
| afternoon. The civilian witness was named Gallant, and the sighting   |
| lasted three minutes. This is a Project Blue Book case classified as  |
| "unidentified". (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official |
| statistics, case # 3326; Don Berliner, The Blue Book Unknowns, p.     |
| 24).                                                                  |

| 1957 - In 1957, at 2:00 in the afternoon, cars stalled when their drivers    |
| attempted to approach a 200' diameter metallic UFO hovering 300' over |
| an aerodrome in Cachoeira, Brazil. East of Viking, Minnesota, at      |
| 11:45 that night, a parked car was buffeted by a flying disc, 100     |
| yards away. The occupants of the car heard and felt tapping           |
| underneath the car. (Sources: NICAP files; Loren Gross, UFOs: A       |

| 1959 - The witness, a young man who was on leave from the Army, had   |
| been driving on U.S. highway 99 near Marysville, California with two  |
| friends when he suddenly found himself onboard a hovering,            |
| bluish-white craft. His two friends had apparently been put to sleep  |
| and were not disturbed. The witness was taken by six four-foot tall   |
| humanoids with large human like eyes to a room that had many          |
| instruments, and was given a medical examination. The beings wore     |
| silvery gray outfits with a dark triangle-like insignia on their      |
| chest. They glided above the floor instead of walking. The witness    |
| was later deposited back in his vehicle unharmed. (Source: Albert S.  |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1959, case # 196, citing Nick H.   |
| Edwards, CUFORN Bulletin, November-December 1988).                    |

| 1963 - Peter Valko and Jim Keosian ran toward a strange object that   |
| appeared about to land in Bloomingdale, New Jersey, but it            |
| "vanished." (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century   |
| of Landings, case 587).                                               |

| 1966 - Two duck hunters in a boat offshore of Beverly, Massachusetts  |
| saw a cigar-shaped object hovering over the Beverly Farms area around |
| 7:15 a.m. (Source: Ray Fowler, UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors, p. 342.).        |
|                                                                       |
| 1966 - Newell Partridge was sitting at home at 10:30 p.m. in Salem,   |
| West Virginia when suddenly the TV blanked out. A very fine           |
| herringbone pattern appeared on the tube, and at the same time the    |
| set started making a loud whining noise, increasing to a high pitch,  |
| peaking and then breaking off, as if on a musical scale, sounding     |
| like a generator winding up. Outside on his porch, his dog Bandit     |
| began wailing. Partridge picked up a flashlight and went out in the   |
| yard to investigate. The dog was sitting at the end of the porch,     |
| howling down toward the hay barn in the bottom. Partridge shined the  |
| light in that direction, and it picked up two red circles or eyes,    |
| which looked like bicycle reflectors. There was something about the   |
| eyes that was difficult to explain. They were huge and plainly        |
| visible at a distance of 150 yards. As soon as the flashlight picked  |
| out the eyes his dog Bandit snarled and ran toward them. A "cold      |
| chill" swept over the man and he felt a wave of fear, which kept him  |
| from following the dog. That night he slept with a loaded gun beside  |
| his bed. The next day he went looking for his dog with a friend. They |
| found tracks, and at the approximate position of the "eyes" he found  |
| a large number of dog tracks. The tracks were going in a circle, as   |
| if the dog had been chasing its tail. Then the tracks vanished, the   |
| dog was never seen again. At around 11:30 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. Steve     |
| Mallette and Mr. and Mrs. Roger Scarberry reported that their car was |
| followed in Point Pleasant, West Virginia around 11:30 p.m. by a gray |
| "bird-like creature" six to seven feet tall and with a ten foot       |
| wingspan. When the car headlights struck the creature its eyes, about |
| two inches in diameter, glowed red. It finally scurried into a field  |
| and disappeared. (Sources: UPI press dispatch in the Cleveland Press, |

| 1967 - At 3:30 p.m. a slender delta-shaped object, shiny and metallic |
| in appearance, was sighted by a BEA pilot at high altitude in flight  |
| over Florence, Italy. It had a notch in its shortest edge. (Sources:  |

| 1969 - Three people in Corral de Bustos, Argentina observed a         |
| luminous object approach their car at great speed around 2:30 a.m..   |
| As it passed over the road close to the car the car tachometer needle |
| fell to zero rpms. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving     |
| Vehicle Interference, p. 48).                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1969 - The witness was at his window in Nancy, France at 5 p.m.       |
| awaiting the arrival of some pigeons that he customarily fed. He      |
| spotted a transparent cupola with two heads visible inside that was   |
| behind a nearby chimney. He initially had no reaction, but when he    |
| turned back to look out the window a short time later he saw the UFO  |
| fly slowly from behind the chimney. It was a gray metallic disc with  |
| a transparent dome on top. It had many lights resembling car          |
| headlights visible around its circumference. He exclaimed, “But it’s  |
| a saucer!” and heard a voice whisper outside his ear: “Yes, it is a   |
| saucer, do not be afraid, it was necessary that you see it.”          |
|                                                                       |
| The two beings inside the dome then looked at themselves, and then    |
| turned their heads towards the witness while smiling at him. Their    |
| heads then disappeared from inside the objec, and at that same moment |
| two other UFOs, identical to the first, also with visible figures     |
| inside transparent domes fly over the roofs about 70 meters above     |
| him. The first object joined the other two and all three flew towards |
| the north. The witness tried to notify his neighbors but found        |
| himself in a kind of stupor with his face and hands swollen and a red |
| bump on his forehead. A red scar on his forehead was still visible    |
| when last examined by investigators in 1978. (Source: Albert S.       |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1969, case # 2418, citing M.       |

| 1973 - On this night in 1973, a UFO was seen from the air near Managua,      |
| Nicaraugua by helicopter and airline pilots, and was also seen by     |
| ground observers. It had blue and green flashing lights, and was      |
| tracked on radar. (Source: Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters,      |
| p.038-18).                                                            |

| 1973 - A bus driver in Catavi, Bolivia reported encountering a little |
| man no more than 30 centimeters in height at the house of a family    |
| named Siles. He explained that the little humanoid spoke four         |
| languages and was interested in meeting "important officials". He ate |
| raw meat, carrots and the family kept him in a small cage. Another    |
| local woman reported seeing two strange humanoids when she looked     |
| inside one of the windows of the Siles family. She described the      |
| being as having elongated heads with fish-like eyes. They wore shiny  |
| metallic, silvery outfits. When the beings spoke they appeared to     |
| emit an "electronic"' buzzing sound. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,      |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1969, citing La Razon, Buenos Aires,        |

| 1974 - At 5:30 p.m. a woman was tending to some animals on her farm   |
| near Castelleale, Emilia-Romagna Province, Italy when she noticed     |
| that some of the chickens and rabbits were acting panicky, running    |
| around strangely, and staring upwards. She glanced up and saw on top  |
| of her house, at roof top height, a "man in a spacesuit" sitting on a |
| 0.6 meter wide box-like object that was swinging back and forth,      |
| apparently looking for something. The man was described as tall,      |
| heavy set, and wearing a shiny one-piece uniform with green, red, and |
| white markings and large square boots. He wore a helmet with a visor  |
| that covered his face. He appeared to be dark complexioned. The man   |
| sat on the object, holding a rod like device rocking slowly to and    |
| fro. He then moved slowly towards the east where a vivid white light  |
| hovered. When she saw the light she immediately felt a wave of heat   |
| coming from it. The humanoid then flew slowly towards a nearby        |
| cemetery, followed closely by the bright light. He appeared to circle |
| the area several times before disappearing from sight. (Sources:      |
| Verga Maurizio, ITACAT database; Albert S. Rosales, 1974 Humanoid     |
| Sighting Reports database, case # 796, citing Gianfranco Lollino,     |
| FSR, Volume 32, issue 4).                                             |
| 1975 - a disc-shaped UFO rose from the sea near a large radio antenna |
| in Marseille, France. It circled, then made a 90 degree turn to the   |
| south and flew out to sea.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1975 - Also in 1975, a red flying object approached a car driven by a Mrs.   |
| Prichard with three passengers in Pacific, Missouri, then ejected     |
| several white balls of light (BOLs). The metal of the car was         |
| magnetized after the encounter. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit,      |

| 1978 - A circular green object was sighted by military fighter pilots |
| while flying over eastern Washington State. Also, a brilliant green   |
| ovoid UFO was sighted that night near the ocean shore in Innisfail,   |
| Queensland, Australia. The witness was a 24-year-old man named        |
| O'Brien. He described the UFO as being only 100 feet away from him    |
| and having blurred edges. As he watched, the glow surrounding the     |
| object became elongated. (Sources: Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO  |
| Encounters, p. 42-07; Australian Centre for UFO Studies Catalogue of  |

| 1978 - An electronics worker in his twenties was driving his car in   |
| East Islip, New York on this same night at 6 p.m. when a flash of     |
| light led to a period of unconsciousness. Later than night he         |
| recalled in flashbacks that five beings came to his car and pushed    |
| down the window. They then took him somewhere, examined him and       |
| walked him through a strange, unusual environment. His next conscious |
| memory was of sitting by the road nowhere near his car. His clothes   |
| were in disarray, his shoes untied, and his shirt buttoned            |
| improperly. At first his memory was so impaired that he could not     |
| even remember the name of his wife or his telephone number. (Source:  |

| 1989 - In Gulf Breeze, Florida on this date in 1989, in the evening around 9 |
| p.m., a beige colored cigar-shaped object was sighted. In was         |
| estimated at 20-40 feet long, and disappeared behind some trees. On   |
| the same night, in Shoreline Park, Florida, an unusual circular       |
| depression was found in tall grass. It had a clockwise swirl.         |

| 1990 - In 1990, south of Rosedale, Oklahoma, at about 6 a.m. a silent        |
| 35-foot diameter disc was encountered at a very low altitude. It had  |
| white lights on the side, and the rim was spinning. It emitted a blue |
| beam of light. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, February 1993).            |
| On this night in 1991 a group of coon hunters in Marshall, Arkansas   |
| saw a tremendously large boomerang-shaped UFO, the size of three      |
| football fields. It had bright pulsating white lights. Three large    |
| red lights separated from the UFO and flew away. The men fled in      |
| fear. Also on this night at about 8 p.m. a West Virginia coal miner   |
| was driving on US highway 460 in Tazewell, Virginia. He saw a silent  |
| metallic ovoid UFO, 40-50 feet in length, glide into a cloud.         |

| 1993 - In 1993, near Baltimore, Maryland, on US highway 74, a house-sized    |
| ovoid UFO nearly ran a car with a single witness off the road at 7:45 |
| p.m. After buzzing the car the UFO hovered, then shot up into the     |
| sky. Earlier that afternoon, in Gulf Breeze, Florida, Ed Walters      |
| videotaped a UFO lurching up into a cloud. In Matthews, North         |
| Carolina, a driver reported that another silent UFO dropped down in   |
| front of his car at about 5:15 p.m. It hovered, then moved off.       |

| woman whose home is near Dallas, Texas found herself in an unknown    |
| location with three short, gray-skinned humanoids who were "talking"  |
| to her, probably using telepathy to communicate. These Grey beings    |
| were about three to four feet tall, and told her that Armageddon      |
| would not be what most people think it will be. At the same time,     |
| there were several tall beings standing off to the side, and they     |
| seemed "in charge," quietly observing everything. (Source: Albert S.  |

| UFO with an elongated bottom, a light on each end, and an orange      |
| light in the middle, flew toward the northwest. In five minutes it    |
| came back heading southwest. When over the city all the lights        |
| started to spin around, and the light on the right side veered off    |
| from the main body.(Source: George Filer, MUFON UFO Journal, January  |

| 2002 - On this day in Lonquimay, La Araucania Province, Chile a       |
| circular scorched imprint 30 meters in diameter was found on the      |
| ground. There were burned patches in the grass, and scorched tree     |
| trunks. Inside were four smaller circles, equidistant apart, that     |
| were not scorched but free of snow. The radiation level was high. The |
| Chilean military bars entry to the site by civilians. (Source: UFO    |
