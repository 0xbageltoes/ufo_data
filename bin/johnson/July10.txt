| 2:32 in the afternoon, a perfectly round, grayish-white UFO paced a   |

| bottom was the color of lead. It moved east, crossed a highway,       |
| tilted upward, moved to the right, accelerated and disappeared into   |
| the clouds after 3-5 seconds. The disc made a swishing sound.         |

| It had lit portholes. They watched it for two minutes as it took off. |

| blinded by the light. The engine of his car failed but the headlights |
| stayed on. He estimated the UFO was two meters in length and had blue |
| protuberances. It disappeared, then reappeared over a ditch.          |

| 1973 - At 8 p.m. a supervisor at the Goshen, Indiana rubber plant was |
| called outside by one of his men who had been smoking a cigarette.    |
| The man pointed up and to his left, and they both saw an unidentified |
| craft moving very slowly from the northwest to the southeast. There   |
| were a number of downward slanted windows in the craft and they could |
| see several humanoid figures moving about inside. Some appeared to be |
| peering down out of the windows. The background behind the figures    |
| was red, making the figures look like silhouettes. The unusual thing  |
| about the craft was that it made a bobbing motion as it moved.. They  |
| watched the UFO for about 10 minutes until it drifted out of sight.   |

| 1977 - At one o'clock in the morning a chicken farmer in Pinheiro,    |
| Brazil was walking to town to catch a bus. A bright greenish blue     |
| light appeared and swooped down from the sky to chase him. It circled |
| back and came to hover above some nearby woods, and he could now make |
| out a V-shaped craft. He shone his flashlight at it and was suddenly  |
| struck by a light beam from the craft that knocked him down, creating |
| a tingling sensation before he lost consciousness. At one point he    |
| awoke briefly to see several men staring at him. They examined him in |
| silence. He finally woke up several hours later, and felt terrible    |
| pains throughout his body that prevented him from working for two     |
| months. (Source: Bob Pratt, UFO Danger Zone: Terror and Death in      |

| 1978 - A carload of residents were parked at the local railroad       |
| crossing near Bellville, Ohio around 10 p.m. when they noticed a huge |
| dark figure with red glowing eyes that appeared to be in a slumped    |
| position standing over the tracks. The frightened witnesses fled the  |
| area and later notified the police. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,       |
