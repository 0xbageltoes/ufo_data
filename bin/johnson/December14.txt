| 1943 - A pilot over Naples, Italy had a dogfight with a bright light  |
| that climbed much faster than his aircraft, a RAF Beaufighter with    |
| the 255th fighter squadron. (Source: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947        |

| 1950 - A group of teardrop-shaped UFOs was picked up on multiple      |
| radar units for ten minutes near the Oak Ridge Nuclear facility in    |
| Tennessee at around 4 p.m. (Source: Bruce S. Maccabee, MUFON UFO      |

| 1953 - In 1953 in England at 5 p.m. GMT many city residents saw a            |
| dagger-shaped object with many bright colors pass over Exmouth, Devon |
| handle-end first. (Source: George Gibbons, The Coming of the Space    |

| 1954 - Three gray disc performed aerobatics over the city of Campinas, Sao   |
| Paulo state, Brazil on this afternoon in 1954. One of the UFOs peeled |
| off, dove low over the roof of a local woman's house, and dropped a   |
| liquid substance "like silver rain." Chemical analysis revealed that  |
| the solidified material was 90% tin with other alloys. (Source:       |

| 1963 - Two men driving at 1:00 a.m. in France, Messrs. Muller and     |
| Immelman, found the countryside suddenly illuminated all about them   |
| and saw an object 15 meters in diameter flying toward their car. The  |
| UFO had intensely bright orange and blue lights and emitted sparks as |
| it approached. They stopped the car and jumped out as it dove as them |
| five or six times, at one point hovering for two minutes just 15      |
| meters above them, making a humming sound. It then flew away.         |

| 1970 - Waking up in his house at 1:30 a.m., a man in Bucharest,       |
| Romania saw a vivid red light in the sky and heard a pulsating,       |
| humming sound. He ran to his window and saw a policeman running       |
| toward his car, which suddenly started. A whitish-blue sphere of      |
| pulsating light was hovering over the car, then it suddenly           |
| disappeared. The whole event lasted less than one minute. (Sources:   |

| 1971 - Yates and Schiller in Waikerie, South Australia saw a six-foot |
| tall humanoid with a "lumpy" body and surrounded by an aura of light  |
| float through some trees, 20 meters away. The creature had large      |
| pointed ears, a nose like a dog, and no eyes or mouth that were       |
| visible. This happened at 11 o'clock at night. (Source: Keith         |

| 1973 - At 9:43 p.m. in Paso Robles, California a solid red beam of    |
| light from a black cone-shaped UFO hit the ground, throwing up dirt.  |
| The cone then moved into an amber sphere that began to emit a vapor   |
| of some kind. The sphere then took off at a sixty-degree angle up     |
| into the sky. Two six-foot tall "robots" with crinkly skin were seen  |
| on the ground where the beam had hit. (Source: Ann Druffel, Skynet.)  |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - At least nine separate close encounter events occurred on this |
| date around the world. The first three occurred in Italy. At four     |
| o'clock in the morning a four-meter wide cone-shaped object was seen  |
| hovering only three meters from the ground in Rome. It had a row of   |
| illuminated portholes, and three beams of light came from its bottom. |
| At 4:30 in the afternoon in San Vito del Normanni, Italy a witness    |
| reported seeing flying spheres in the sky for 15 minutes; one of the  |
| objects descended to the ground. An hour and ten minutes later, a red |
| dome-shaped object was sighted on the ground in Mogoro, Italy. The    |
| object was bright enough to illuminate the clouds and the surrounding |
| area, and it produced a smoke that didn't dissipate with the wind.    |

| 1978 - That same pre-dawn night in New England a Dublin, New Hampshire       |
| resident driving in Hancock saw a green, cigar-shaped object          |
| traveling at high speed at treetop level flying toward the east, from |
| the area of Highway 101 toward Hancock. (Source: UFO Newsclipping     |
| Service, February 1979, p. 3).                                        |

| 1978 - In Brewer, Maine a local resident named John felt an           |
| overwhelming compulsion to go out. He got dressed, got in his car,    |
| and drove away leaving his young daughter alone at home at 1:30 a.m.  |
| John drove in a daze along Route 9E, a very desolate stretch of road. |
| All of a sudden his car's motor went completely dead and he coasted   |
| to a stop. His battery wasn't dead because his headlights remained    |
| on. He tried unsuccessfully to re-start the car. He then heard a very |
| loud crackling noise. He turned to his right and slightly ahead of    |
| his car was a huge, long dark rectangular object, about 50 feet from  |
| the road. It was hovering 30 feet above the ground. As soon as John   |
| saw it a rectangular portion on the front end lit up and shone a soft |
| green light through his front windshield. John felt a strange         |
| tingling sensation, like "pins & needles." He also felt himself sink  |
| into a trance. He remained fully aware but could not move a muscle.   |
| Strangely, his initial fear upon sighting the huge object had         |
| disappeared, and he now felt calm and unafraid. The soft green light  |
| abruptly changed color to a reddish pink and began pulsating first    |
| slowly, then faster and faster. He then heard a voice say: "Do not be |
| afraid. We will not harm you. We are from the 17th star." The lights  |
| then slowed down and John heard the voice say, "We will return." He   |
| felt a strong conviction that this statement was true. The lighted    |
| rectangle suddenly blinked off, and John heard a strange clicking     |
| sound again. The UFO then backed away and rose at an angle. On his    |
| way home he felt very cold. The next morning he noticed his skin      |
| peeling around his nose, forehead, and from the back of his ears. He  |
| suffered severe headaches after the incident. (Sources: David F. Webb |

| 1978 - In Illinois in the early evening hours two close encounters    |
| occurred. At 5:30 p.m. two 12-year-old girls in Park Ridge who were   |
| tobogganing in the city park saw a saucer-shaped object with a row of |
| flashing red lights on the top and bottom and flashing yellow lights  |
| in between. It had 3 balls on the bottom. It hovered for 20 minutes,  |
| and then made a semi-circle in the sky before leaving. On Highway 116 |
| in London Mills at 7:00 p.m. a tubular-shaped craft hovered and       |
| circled a car being driven by two teenage girls. The craft circled    |
| the car "close enough to have touched it." It had two parallel tubes  |
| and one perpendicular tube but no windows. It took off fast toward    |
| the east. The father of one of the girls, Ralph Brashear, reported    |
| the incident to the police. (Sources: George Eberhart, A              |

| 1978 - In Sarandi del Yi, Uruguay, a UFO with bright red lights       |
| suddenly appeared and started to circle the car driven by Mr. La      |
| Bandera and his two passengers. It circled at a distance of only 10   |
| meters (33 feet). It changed color to a deep green when it crossed    |
| the highway and made a steep climb into the sky. (Source: UFO         |
| Newsclipping Service, March 1979, p. 14).                             |

| 1978 - Finally, in Pomeroy, Washington a large UFO paced a car with   |
| three women inside. The object had two transparent blue lights and    |
| followed them to one of their homes. It circled around their car      |
| once, and then sped off to the west. (Source: George Eberhart, A      |
| Geo-Bibliography of Anomalies; Pomeroy East Washingtonian, December   |

| 1997 - In Saguache County, Colorado in the San Luis Valley a witness  |
| reported seeing a large triangular craft hovering over a field at     |
| 3:00 a.m. It moved slowly over the house and then over some grain     |
| silos. It then came back over the house and shone a beam of whitish   |
| blue light out of its center. Something like a small figure was taken |
| up inside the beam. Lights around its edge flashed in rhythm when it  |
| left. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1997,     |
| case # 2874, citing Christopher O'Brien).                             |
| 1997 - Noel Chandler of Hart Canyon, New Mexico had seen a round      |
| glowing UFO over his horse shed in the evening of December 13th.      |
| Also, for several of the preceeding nights he would hear three loud   |
| thumps on the house, but when he checked all around outside no cause  |
| could be found. While in bed this night at 2:30 a.m. he became aware  |
| of a bluish white light beam from an outside source. Next a figure    |
| appeared but with no real distinguishing features, except it had very |
| large eyes--about the size of horse's--a small mouth, and small       |
| nostril-like holes. He found he was unable to move or talk. He heard  |
| a voice in his head that told him that "they" were here to collect a  |
| sperm sample. Soon a tube with a ball on the end, about 1/2 inches in |
| diameter and six inches long, appeared and scanned his body. The tube |
| was placed over his pubic hair just above the penis on the left side. |
| A needle was then inserted and his left testicle was drawn up into    |
| his groin. He felt no real discomfort or pain. The needle and tube    |
| were removed and taken into a floating sphere. Moments later another  |
| form came down from the light, like floating in a horizontal          |
| position. It was a female with funny-looking hair on her head. The    |
| needle and tube came out of the sphere and she inserted it into her   |
| navel. Then, telepathically, she informed him that their society was  |
| dying out because they could not reproduce. They were increasingly    |
| becoming sterile, but by introducing new blood lines and clones they  |
| were hoping to regenerate their society. Their gestation period is    |
| reportedly only three to four months. Soon the bluish light started   |
| to "close in" at the bottom and the beings were gone. However, a      |
| strange smell lingered. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact  |
