| 1953 - At 3:15 p.m. a silver disc-shaped object silently zig-zagged   |
| to evade US military jets over Dietrich, Idaho. It then shot off      |
| toward the west at a very high altitude. Project Blue Book lists the  |
| explanation for the encounter as due to a weather balloon. (Sources:  |

| 1954 - At 11:15 a.m. a rotating top-shaped object, with beams of      |
| light streaming from its portholes, was seen by several on board an   |
| airliner flying near Barquisimeto, Venezuela. Radio contact with the  |
| control tower was interrupted when the plane's radio operator tried   |
| to tell the airport about the UFO. The UFO was green with a red strip |
| in middle, and descended very rapidly. (Sources: Dominique Weinstein, |

| 1957 - A woman named Salter was driving in an uninhabited part of     |
| Georgetown, Connecticut around ten p.m. when she encountered a        |
| five-meter long cigar-shaped object close to the ground on the left   |
| side of the road. It had several portholes, half a meter in diameter, |
| that were lit by a yellow light. She saw shadows moving about inside. |
| After a short while the UFO took off going straight up. (Source:      |

| 1964 - At 2:00 a.m. a woman in Gum Creek, South Australia awoke to a  |
| bright light in her room. She saw a man approximately five feet four  |
| inches tall with a red face and a big nose in her room. He held a     |
| black box that buzzed when he pointed it at her. He also wore a       |
| helmet, green coveralls, and a brown jacket. She sank back into her   |
| bed and fell asleep. She later became a UFO contactee. (Sources: Bill |

| 1965 - At 10:45 p.m. several people witnessed a large, seven-meter    |
| diameter disc-shaped UFO ascend from the beach in South Brighton, New |
| Zealand. It emitted a whistling noise as it rose up, and dogs in the  |
| area behaved in a highly agitated manner. Flattened dune grass was    |
| discovered at the landing site. (Sources: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr.,     |

| 1967 - Numerous witnesses saw UFOs with flashing lights and domes     |
| maneuvering in the sky over Piggott, Arkansas. Small satellite        |
| objects and merging objects were seen during the event. Dogs reacted  |
| by barking. (Source: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr., Strange Effects from     |

| 1977 - At 9:30 p.m. several children at a youth camp in Tasmania,     |
| Australia at Seven-Mile Beach observed a stationary, dome-shaped      |
| object hovering near the beach. The object then moved behind some     |
| trees, partially obscuring it. On the dome was a row of windows       |
| through which at least two of the children reported seeing a thin     |
| humanoid figure with a round head. It seemed to be moving back and    |
| forth behind the window. One child described the object as similar to |
| two plates placed edge to edge, with flashing yellow white lights     |
| along the edge and a red light on top of the dome. The object         |
| disappeared from view behind the trees. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted  |

| 1981 - At 9:40 p.m. a luminous ovoid object maneuvered at 30 meters   |
| altitude in Ross, Tasmania and paced a car. When the car approached a |
| hotel, it shot straight up and out of sight. (Source: Keith Roberts,  |
| UFO Research Australia Newsletter, May 1982, p. 6).                   |

| 1983 - At 1:10 a.m. a 28-year-old woman observed a very large         |
| metallic, cylindrical flying object with structural detail up close   |
| while driving on a highway near Mobile, Alabama. She could see 20-30  |
| occupants inside through the windows. They appear to pay no attention |
| to her, although she feels a sense of euphoria during the event. She  |
| had earlier had dreams of a UFO abduction encounter including a       |
| physical exam. (Sources: Ed Brown, APRO Bulletin, May 1984, p. 1;     |

| 1984 - Mr. Jonsson was driving home in Tingsryd, Sweden at around     |
| 1:00 a.m. when he saw a disc-shaped object 80 meters across and some  |
| 5-10 meters above the road ahead of him. He got to his home, got his  |
| camera, and went back to the site of his encounter. His car stalled,  |
| and he recalled seeing several beings who attempted to abduct him. He |
| had nearly two hours of missing time. An independent witness verified |
| seeing the UFO. (Sources: Doris Graziano, APRO Bulletin, June 1985,   |

| 1994 - Six witnesses, including a Mr. Giulo, observed a strange       |
| humanoid wandering around on the nearby rocky shore in Ancona, Italy  |
| at 9:00 a.m. The humanoid was described as about 1.5 meters tall and  |
| wearing a tight-fitting black coverall that covered his entire body   |
| including his unusually long feet. The face was elongated with two    |
| huge round eyes that had round black pupils. The creature appeared to |
| be wearing earphones and a helmet with a thin protruding antenna on   |
| one side. It seemed to stagger as it moved slowly. After ten minutes  |
| it rose up, slowly and vertically, into the air, disappearing from    |
| sight quickly. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database  |
