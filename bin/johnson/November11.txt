| 1956 - At around 10 pm. in the town of Vaddo, near Stockholm, Sweden  |
| a car's engine and headlights died when a gray, elliptical flattened  |
| sphere came down over the road in front of the vehicle and landed     |
| nearby. There were two witnesses inside the car, Mr. Edberg and Mr.   |
| Sjoberg. A three-sided piece of metal about the size of a matchbox    |
| was found at the landing site. Metalurgical analysis revealed that it |
| was 94.86% tungsten. (Source: Illobrand von Ludwiger, Best UFO        |

| 1960 - On this night four witnesses in Warminster, England, including |
| among them three men in the British military, saw an object that      |
| seemed about to land, but then took off again. It flew off toward the |
| north, leaving a trail of sparks and blinding them by its brilliance. |

| 1965 - A UFO was seen on the ground near a farm gate in Mogi Guacu,   |
| Sao Paulo state, Brazil at around 9 p.m. by a woman and her grandson. |
| Two dwarfs were beside the object, picking up leaves and twigs, and   |
| examining a mare that stood docile by the fence. A green colored beam |
| then made a sound like an explosion, causing the two witnesses to     |
| flee in panic inside their farmhouse. (Sources: Flavio Pereira, APRO  |

| 1966 - On this night a married woman named Kathleen saw a             |
| Saturn-shaped UFO with many brightly lit windows from her kitchen     |
| window in Arlington, Indiana. The UFO was only 50 feet away. A        |
| muscular looking man and two women were seen inside the craft. The    |
| man stared directly at the witness. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted      |

| 1973 - On this evening in Greenville, South Carolina a                |
| three-foot-tall dwarf dressed in light brown coveralls got into a cab |
| and told the driver to take him to Greasy Corners, a local            |
| intersection. The dwarf's head was featureless except for goggles or  |
| large eyes. He wore gloves and gold boots with gold buttons on the    |
| chest. The being paid for the fare with a dollar bill, which had the  |
| backside of the bill colored yellow. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted    |

| 1978 - A woman was driving through a wooded area in Savigny Le Sec,   |
| Cote D'Or, France at 12:15 a.m. when she saw a long light gray object |
| on the ground nearby. About ten short figures were walking around the |
| object. The beings had large bright eyes, large noses, no necks and   |
| wore light gray coveralls. The witness became frightened and drove    |
| away from the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact      |

| 1978 - Late in the evening four witnesses traveling by car near Bragg |
| Creek, Alberta on a snowy night noticed a bright white light          |
| approaching their vehicle. As it got closer they could see that it    |
| was a huge object resembling a hovercraft. It had numerous lighted    |
| square windows. One witness was able to see several human-like        |
| figures standing behind the windows. At one point the witnesses       |
| became disoriented and there appears to have been some time loss. One |
| of the witnesses heard what appeared to be music coming from inside   |
| the craft. No other sound was detected. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,   |

| 1995 - Zacapa, Guatemala - During a spate of bizarre animal killings   |
| in the area, Alicia Fajardo encountered a strange winged creature on  |
| her property at around one o'clock in the morning. She described it   |
| as about four feet tall, with large bat-like wings, huge oval-shaped  |
| eyes, and a large mouth with huge protruding fangs. It was covered    |
| with dark hair and had a tail and claw-like feet. The creature flew   |
| away in an upward spiral emitting a strange humming sound. (Source:   |

| 1995 - On this night in El Rosario, Puerto Rico farmer Elliot         |
| Feliciano fired his gun at a large creature that jumped the fence     |
| surrounding his home. He described the creature as between 3 to 4     |
| feet tall, endowed with large eyes, and having what appeared to be    |
| wings. Others reported a brilliant, round object flying over the      |
| area. A large goat was also found dead and mutilated in the area.     |
