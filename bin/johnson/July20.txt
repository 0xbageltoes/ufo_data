| 1945 - At 10:50 a.m. a fast moving, silent cigar-shaped object flew   |
| over Houdain, France. Its surface was glowing, it had flames shooting |
| from its front, and it left no contrail. (Source: Lumieres dans la    |

| 1950 - In Porto Novo, Brazil Mr. Campello and several others driving  |
| together in a car saw two large, silvery objects by the side of the   |
| road, one on a hill, the other on flat ground. They were about 50     |
| meters away from each other. They drove to within 600 meters of the   |
| objects, which flew away at "an incredible speed," causing a rush of  |
| air that rocked the car. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to         |

| 1952 - At 1:05 a.m. at Andrews AFB in Maryland five witnesses         |
| visually observed three red-orange objects moving erratically around  |
| the sky. During the evening USAF radar operators at the weather tower |
| tracked ten UFOs for 15-20 minutes at Andrews AFB, Maryland. The      |
| objects approached the runway, scattered, and then made sharp turns   |
| and reversals in direction. (Source: NICAP case investigation files,  |

| 1954 - Two men were chased by a UFO near Oslo, Norway when they had   |
| stopped their car to look at it. After the sighting a watch stopped   |
| working and the paint on their car changed color. (Source: Jacques    |

| 1955 - In the afternoon a farmhand in Edison, Georgia saw a four-foot |
| tall, hairy little gray man without clothes emerge from some nearby   |
| woods and walk along a fence. The dwarf was visible for 25 minutes    |
| before he returned to woods. (Sources: Atlanta (GA) Constitution,     |

| 1956 - At three o'clock in the morning a brilliant light was seen in  |
| the sky over Long Beach, California. It appeared to be a              |
| saucer-shaped craft with wires around the edges. The wires seemed to  |
| be rotating while the disc flew eastward. At 4:30 a.m a photo was     |
| taken of a light seen east of Wichita, Kansas. There were several     |
| reports from this area, but most of them appear to be                 |
| misidentifications of either Mars or Venus. Three witnesses in        |
| Panorama City, California independently claimed to have observed a    |
| huge, ball-shaped object from which three beings emerged. They were   |
| nearly two meters (6.6 feet) tall, had long, blond hair, and wore     |
| tight, green suits. (Sources: Loren Gross, The fifth horseman of the  |

| 1959 - A UFO was seen flying over a mountain in Papua New Guinea at   |
| around 6 p.m. At 10:15 p.m. a bright white cigar-shaped object flew   |
| south over the Woomera missile test range in South Australia. Many at |
| the military base as well as in the town saw it, and the newspapers   |
| carried the report widely. (Source: APRO Bulletin, September-October  |

| 1961 - While flying in a DC-3 over Houston, Texas at eight o'clock in |
| the morning Trans-Texas Airlines Capt. A.V. Beather sighted two very  |
| bright white lights or objects. They flew in trail formation for 30   |
| minutes. There is a vague report from ground radar that the UFOs were |
| picked up on radar. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook           |

| 1964 - Mr. J.J. Winkle in Littleton, Illinois reported to the Air     |
| Force that at 4:45 a.m. he observed a 60-foot diameter flying object  |
| with a round top and flat bottom. It had a long acetylene-colored     |
| flame shooting downward from underneath the object. It flew straight  |
| and level, made a half loop, then rose up in the sky. The duration of |
| the sighting was about one minute. (Sources: Project Blue Book files  |

| 1965 - At 3:00 a.m. Carlos Videla Zamudio, a hotel guest in Chanaral, |
| Atacama province, Chile was awakened by a loud noise, looked out the  |
| window, and saw an intense red object about 10-12 meters in diameter  |
| land on the isolated beach. It was shaped like a mushroom or a top,   |
| was lighted from inside, rested on the ground silently, flew up to 30 |
| meters, and disappeared at fantastic speed. After four or five        |
| minutes it took off with a "violent noise" and disappeared. (Sources: |

| a chromium-looking, egg-shaped craft standing on metal legs, with a   |
| transparent upper part. A blond pilot, wearing plastic coveralls and  |
| small boots, seemed to be studying a piece of paper. Inside the craft |
| was another man seated before an instrument panel. Shortly thereafter |

| 1965 - After 11:00 p.m. a motorist in Chesterville, Ontario, Canada   |
| encountered a domed UFO with antennae from the sides, hovering just   |
| above road. He treid to speed past it, but the object accelerated to  |
| keep up with the car for about a minute at speeds approaching 100     |
| mph; it then climbed away out of sight. (Source: Chesterville Record, |

| 1967 - At midnight a sparkling cloud seen over Pyle, England revealed |
| itself to be a metallic saucer-shaped object on closer approach. It   |
| was spinning and made a noise like a jet plane. It vanished while     |
| still in sight. (Source: APRO Bulletin, November-December 1967, p.    |

| 1967 - Pedro Petrelli of Guernica, Argentina heard a loud noise like  |
| a burst of wind from a hurricane and saw a bright object pass over    |
| his house at night. It seemed to be about seven-meter in diameter,    |
| circular or disc shaped, and was observed to be spinning. Some twenty |
| people in the vicinity saw it. It stopped and hovered over some       |
| nearby trees and threw off some metallic fragments. The next morning  |
| two trees showed cuts at a height of five meters, and a third tree at |
| three meters. On the ground were found fragments of what seemed to be |
| burnt wood, but the inside looked like fused glass. Chemical analysis |
| of the fragments established the presence of sulphur, copper and      |
| silicon that had been subjected to a heat of more than 1600º Celsius. |

| 1967 - At 9:15 p.m. EDT Mrs. Elizabeth Douglas had tripped and fallen |
| on her lawn in Titusville, Florida and was just getting up when she   |
| saw a UFO about 200 feet away about 60-70 feet above the ground. It   |
| was a sixty foot in diameter, gray bell-shaped object, with an        |
| intense light coming from five square windows. In the fourth window   |
| was a thin humanoid figure with an egg-shaped head and a featureless  |
| face. It had long arms that were raised. She viewed the entity for    |
| about two minutes. Mrs. Douglas's daughter Ingrid joined her, and     |
| also saw the UFO as it moved away, but did not see the occupant.      |
| Ninety minutes later at 10:45 p.m. EDT a round green light was seen   |
| hovering over the radio transmission tower of WHP Radio in            |
| Summerdale, Pennsylvania. The object turned red, descended to around  |
| 200 feet above the ground, and an intense white light came on. It     |
| flew away behind the treeline toward the northwest. (Sources: NICAP   |

| 1968 - At 12:30 a.m. three 14-year-old girls at a summer camp on Lake |
| Kaarna, Estonia were sitting outside eating when they saw a           |
| bright light descend overhead and join up with a cigar-shaped craft   |
| that had just appeared. The objects soon disappeared. Moments later,  |
| after the witnesses had gone inside their cabin, they saw a bright    |
| orange bus-shaped object on the ground about 50 meters away. It was   |
| surrounded by dazzling beams of orange yellow light, which suddenly   |
| dimmed and the object began emitting a green blue light. It had a     |
| blue green stripe around it and seemed to shrink in size, and after a |
| few minutes the witnesses heard a buzzing sound and the object        |
| disappeared behind some bushes. One of the witnesses ran to where the |
| object had been and saw a small human-like figure that had feminine   |
| features; the figure was standing where the object had been, and she  |
| seemed to be wearing a shiny silvery ribbon across her chest. The     |
| being suddenly rose up into the air and vanished. The next day        |
| strange ground markings were found at the site. (Sources: Juri Lina,  |

| 1968 - A man on a hiking trip near Cluj-Napoca, Romania was scanning  |
| the field with his binoculars at eleven o'clock in the morning when   |
| he noticed four bizarre looking humanoids standing on a field. The    |
| humanoids were standing around apparently inspecting the area except  |
| for one that appeared to be lying prone on the ground. These human    |
| like figures appeared to be naked or topless as if sunning themselves |
| in a beach. As he watched, five minutes later a large gray balloon    |
| shaped object appeared above some trees. It was flying in a west-east |
| direction and appeared to be about 25 meters in diameter. At one      |
| point the object ejected a small sphere that descended in a vertical  |
| parabolic trajectory disappearing behind the trees. Soon 4            |
| bell-parachute shaped objects appeared and descend over each of the   |
| humanoids covering them completely, each of the humanoids raised      |
| their arms as if waiting to be covered by the objects. The parachute  |
| like objects then disappeared along with the humanoids. The witness   |
| described the humanoids as about 1.40 meters in height, of a robust   |
| build with short muscular legs and over-developed calves. Their skin  |
| was dark reddish in color and their hair was dark and swarthy. Their  |
| heads and faces were peculiar since they had dog or canine-like       |
| characteristics. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |

| 1969 - On this night John Fairfax, a trans-Atlantic sailor sailing    |
| alone, saw two star-like objects, ten times brighter than Venus. Both |
| rose in the sky, then separated, one flying off at a low altitude,    |
| the other climbing higher in the sky; both vanished suddenly. On the  |
| same night a discovery was made of five unmanned ships west of the    |
| Azores. Two of the ships had capsized but the other three were        |
| totally undamaged despite the disappearance of all passengers and     |
| crew. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, July-August 1969, p. 7; Ivan T.        |

| 1974 - The fire lookout at Satus Peak in Yakima County, Washington    |
| recorded seeing an unexplained ball of light for twenty minutes       |

| 1975 - On a cloudy evening at around 10:00 p.m. an enormous           |
| disc-shaped object shot huge beams of energy at four witnesses in Bay |
| Village, Ohio. It was estimated to be at an altitude of one thousand  |
| feet and made no sound. It also reportedly had legs or landing gear.  |

| 1982 - In the middle of the afternoon a local cattleman in Vejer de   |
| la Frontera, Cadiz, Spain was on his motorcycle using a seldom        |
| traveled road when his motorcycle came to a stop and would not start. |
| He then walked to what he thought was a tanker truck a hundred meters |
| away, but when he got to about 30 meters away from it he saw two huge |
| human-like figures standing in the middle of the road. They wore      |
| shiny metallic armored suits and fishbowl-like clear helmets. One     |
| stood near a wire fence and was looking at the cattle in the nearby   |
| field. The beings then walked back to the object as if in slow        |
| motion. They entered the object through an open hatch, which took off |
| silently towards the north. Ground traces were reportedly found at    |
| the site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1982, |
