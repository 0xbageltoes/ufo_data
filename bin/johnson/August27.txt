| had rectangular windows and made a whistling sound. (Source: Lumieres |

| 1952 - At 12:30 a.m. in Lumberton, North Carolina a 30-foot wide      |
| saucer-shaped craft landed after hitting a chimney. A little man      |
| about 70 cm tall (2.3 feet) emerged. The witness asked if he was hurt |
| but he did not answer. He re-entered the craft and it took off with a |
| whistling sound. At 5 o'clock in the morning a disc circled in the    |
| sky over MacDonald, Manitoba. It was gone in one second after the     |
| airport tower beacon hit it. (Sources: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers |

| 1954 - In Woodside, California a mystery explosion was followed by an |
| asphalt fire at 4:15 p.m. A rectangular area 70' x 270' on Portola    |
| Road was engulfed in the blaze. Metal pellets were found. (Source:    |

| 1954 - At 10:30 p.m. in Boston Creek, Ontario a wingless, circular    |
| UFO was seen by Bill Supa, an employee of the Caswell Construction    |
| Co. It landed about two kilometers away from him. He approached to    |
| within 300 meters before it took off and flew away. The grass had     |
| been flattened where it had rested. (Source: Harold Wilkins, Flying   |

| originated from the object during the three-minute sighting. (Source: |
| Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).                         |

| 1956 - An hour later, at 10:55 p.m. a domed disc with a transparent   |
| dome twirled like a top only four feet above the ground over a        |
| backyard in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The witness, a married woman, felt |
| a cold wind. The object ascended rapidly into the sky. No traces were |
| found. (Source: Civilian Saucer Intelligence-New York Newsletter,     |
| September 1956, p. 8).                                                |

| 1959 - Two ship captains sailing in the Charlotte Islands off the     |
| coast of British Columbia saw a pillar of white light shoot up into   |

| 1966 - There were multiple radar trackings and visual sightings of a  |
| silvery UFO over Stuttgart, Germany this night. The UFO changed shape |
| as it flew. Two F-102 jets gave chase, but it ascended into outer     |
| space. (Source: APRO Bulletin, July 1966, p. 1).                      |
|                                                                       |
| 1968 - Maria Josa Cintra, who worked at the Clemente Ferreira         |
| Sanatorium in Lins, Brazil was awakened by a noise early in the       |
| morning. At the front door was a "foreign-looking" woman of normal    |
| height, wearing light-colored clothes, and a headdress exposing only  |
| her face. She spoke in an unknown language, and handed Marie a mug    |
| and a glass bottle covered with beautiful engravings. Maria filled    |
| them. The woman said something like as "Rempaua," and went out to a   |
| bright, pearl-like sphere, that took off with the sound of wings.     |

| Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: a Century of Landings, case      |

| 1969 – At 10:10 p.m. eleven people were watching for UFOs on Cradle   |
| Hill in Warminster, England when they saw something like a "burning   |
| bush" on the ground about 600 yards away, in a place called           |
| "Kidnappers Hole." Christopher Trubridge and Robert Coates ran        |
| towards it. The light went out, but when they got near the spot       |
| Christopher saw a figure about seven feet tall in the moonlight,      |
| about 100 feet away. It was dressed in a tight-fitting shiny black    |
| suit, with a gold sash or "bandoleer" over one shoulder. It also had  |
| long, dark golden hair that fell to its shoulders and had bright      |
| eyes. The eye color was impossible to determine in the moonlight, but |
| it had a “rather feminine” set of features and a not unattractive     |
| face. She was motionless, with one arm upraised. The witnesses could  |
| not approach any closer than about 30 yards, overcome by fear. Fear   |
| mixed with another impossible to describe emotional response caused   |
| both men be beat a hasty retreat. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted         |

| Arthur Shuttlewood and Ken Rogers The Warminster Triangle; Cosmos,    |

| 1973 - On this night a woman in Greensburg, Pennsylvania reported     |
| seeing a large boomerang shaped craft hovering over a heavily wooded  |
| area in Beech Hill. When her husband went out to investigate he       |
| encountered a large hairy, biped creature with a wolf-like face. He   |
| shot at it with his gun with no apparent effect. (Source: Albert S.   |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1973, case # 1872, citing Paul G.  |

| 1978 - A private plane flying over Massachusetts Bay, 10 miles        |
| north-northwest of Provincetown, Massachusetts had a near collision   |
| with a 18-foot diameter silver disc at 1:40 in the afternoon. Ground  |
| radar confirmed the presence of the unknown craft. (Source: Raymond   |

| 1987 - Three aeronautical engineers in Wuxi City, Jiangsu province,   |
| China watched a point of light spiral across the sky at 9 p.m.        |
| leaving a trail of light. At 10:15 p.m. in Hangzhou, Zhejiang         |
| Province, China the airport tower personnel saw a small ball of light |
| hover 300 meters from the end of the runway. (Source: Timothy Good,   |

| 1993 - At 4:45 p.m. 30-foot long football-shaped object flew over a   |
| tree 100 meters away from the witness in McDonald County, Missouri    |
| making a humming sound. Farm animals were frightened by the object.   |
