| 1897 - In the far eastern reaches of Siberia several people witnessed |
| a round UFO flying toward the northwest. It was seen for five minutes |
| in Antsiferova, Russia. (Sources: Luminieres dans la Nuit, issue #    |

| 1952 - Mr. and Mrs. Ted Hollingsworth of Tucson, Arizona sighted two  |
| groups of three large, flat, shiny objects at 11:40 a.m. north of the |
| city. The daylight objects flew in tight formations: the first group  |
| slowly, the second group faster. The sighting lasted for 2 minutes.   |

| 1954 - At 4:45 p.m. a silver bullet-shaped object was seen in the sky |
| by over a thousand people including military witnesses near the       |
| Ciampino Airport, ten miles outside of Rome, Italy. It rotated from a |
| horizontal orientation to vertical with the point down. It had an     |
| estimated altitude of 2500 feet and a speed of 150-180 miles per      |
| hour. It left a luminous vapor trail and was tracked on radar. At the |
| same time in Pitigliano, Italy in Tuscany two hunters, Bacherini and  |
| Formiconi, heard a series of detonations and then saw a round white   |
| craft moving slowly with lateral oscillation as it advanced. It blew  |
| toward the southwest. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the   |

| 1954 - At 7:15 p.m. a cigar-shaped object was seen through a 25x      |
| telescope and was witnessed by at least 11 people in                  |
| Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dome, France. It was black with a luminous   |
| tail, and the trail was exceptionally luminous. (Source: Aime Michel, |

| 1954 - Between Cenon and Vouneuil, France at 10:30 p.m. Yves David,   |
| age 28, met a being in a diving suit who made friendly gestures. The  |
| being was very small and had a voice "inhuman and incomprehensible."  |
| The witness could not move throughout the encounter. He saw the       |
| creature enter a three-meter wide by one-meter tall object sitting on |
| the road, and it took off "like lightning." It cast a greenish light  |
| as it did so. (Sources: Le Figaro, September 30, 1954; Aime Michel,   |

| 1955 - Pine Bush, New York. Mr. and Mrs. Bordes of New York City were |
| fishing at night when they heard a loud splash and a "gurgling        |
| sound." They then saw a pink, iridescent, mushroom-shaped object rise |
| about 70 cm out of the water, then sink back into the reservoir.      |
| Later, they saw the object again. It was about five meters long and   |
| surrounded by turbulence. After it took off it reversed direction     |
| several times without turning around and finally flew away at a high  |
| rate of speed. (Sources: Arthur Constance, The Inexplicable Sky, p.   |

| 1966 - Mr. and Mrs. Ronald MacGilvary of Cranes Beach, Massachusetts  |
| saw a golden-white, luminous cigar-shaped object resting on the beach |
| at 4:45 a.m. It had two or three bright lights that flew in and out   |
| of the craft. They moved around with an up-and-down skipping motion.  |
| It left after an hour. (Sources: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:             |

| 1967 - At around 2:00 a.m. An anonymous witness observed an           |
| eight-foot tall humanoid in a wooded area near Langley, British       |
| Columbia, Canada. It was reported to be pink colored and covered with |
| scaly skin. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |

| 1975 - At 8:20 p.m. two women in their fifties were driving on a      |
| highway in Watertown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts when they       |
| briefly glimpsed a large humanoid creature. They noticed that as they |
| were traveling they were the only vehicle in the road, and there      |
| was total silence in the area. Suddenly, a very tall gray figure with |
| bits of white hair appeared in front of the car. It had luminous      |
| oblong shaped eyes and what appeared to be white whiskers. The        |
| humanoid figure seemed to be in total "control" and had a "majestic"  |
| air to him. It also had a long tail that narrowed towards the end.    |
| The driver swerved to avoid hitting the creature, and temporarily ran |
| off the road, so they did not see the humanoid depart.(Source: CUFOS  |
| case files, report dated May 6, 1976).                                |

| 1976 - In Wingen, New South Wales, Australia at 3:30 a.m. a round,    |
| bright object with an intense blue glow passed only 12 feet over a    |
| car. The car engine stopped and the lights went out, and the          |
| speedometer needle jumped about even though the car was stationary.   |
| The driver, a 30-year-old man named Ryan, felt an intense heat from   |
| the object, and his watch stopped working. He also reported that his  |
| flashlight wouldn't work, even though it had new batteries. The UFO   |
| made a low humming sound. Trouble with the performance of the car     |
| persisted after the event. The close encounter lasted two minutes.    |

| 1978 - At the Maatsuyker Island Lighthouse, Tasmania, Australia       |
| electrical power failed twice at 9:20 p.m. when a big glowing light   |
| flew by south of the island. It was seen by four men at the           |
| lighthouse, including the main witness, a 47-year-old man named       |
| Burns. (Source: Australian CUFOS Files, case file NA781219).          |

| 1978 - In Torrita di Sienna, Tuscany, Italy at 8:15 p.m. two          |
| witnesses watched a bright sphere descend over the area the same time |
| a electrical blackout occurred. Shortly after that a motorist, Sr. R. |
| Faralli, a 25-year-old man driving a Fiat 127, was on his way home    |
| when his engine and lights went out, then a bright red object         |
| descended over the road just ahead of him and hovered. It was a domed |
| disc, hat like in shape. He found he was paralyzed and could not      |
| move, as he watched a panel open and two humanoids emerge and float   |
| towards his vehicle. They were five feet tall and wore green          |
| coveralls and helmets with aerials and face masks, and they floated   |
| about four feet above the ground. They circled the car and appeared   |
| to inspect it. Their skin also appeared greenish. They re-entered the |
| UFO, which took off with a flash of light and an explosive sound. The |
| witness suffered eye irritation. (Sources: Roberto Pinotti,           |

| fireball near the M.V. Strathdee, a Romanian registry ship sailing in |
| the South Atlantic at the geographical coordinates -11.62 S 33.47 W.  |
| According to the article in the MUFON UFO Journal, it flashed rays of |

| 1984 - In Goshen, Connecticut a row of lights paced car on a rural    |

| into a U-shaped, and then into a delta.  They seemed to be part of    |
| one UFO, changing shape. (Source: George C. Andrews,                  |
