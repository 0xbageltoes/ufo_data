| Alabama sighted three discs zip across the sky toward the west. One   |
| stopped for five minutes, and then shot up vertically, the other two  |
| continued on westward. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer database,    |

| 1955 - Andy Florio sighted a disc-shaped object at least 100 feet in  |
| diameter while driving near Tucson, Arizona. It made a humming sound  |
| and had bluish-green lights on its top and amber lights around the    |
| rim. He stopped his car when his car radio failed, his headlights     |
| dimmed, and the car lost power and slowed to 12-15 mph. The UFO       |
| swayed back and forth while hovering and shot a beam of white light   |
| at the witness, burning his elbow and bubbling paint on the car. Mr.  |
| Florio also felt heat and a tingling sensation. After the sighting    |
| the car was checked by a mechanic, and was found to have a defective  |
| battery, a dead radio, and only three spark plugs were still firing.  |

| 1966 - A dark oval-shaped object carrying two bright red flashing     |
| lights was seen by three independent groups in the same area of       |
| Rehoboth, Massachusetts at different times, beginning at 8:15 p.m.    |
| One group saw it hover over a road, then descend slowly into a wooded |
| area. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, case file, report dated April 2,    |
| 1966).                                                                |

| 1966 - A 90-foot long oblong object landed near a highway in Pecos,   |
| Texas. It stayed on the ground for five minutes. On the same night in |
| Suffolk County, New York in communities such as East Hampton and      |
| Napeague, there were numerous reports of oblong-shaped craft          |
| hovering, maneuvering, and then flying out to sea. These reports were |
| accompanied by electromagnetic effects that interfered with           |
| automobile ignitions, lights, and radio and TV reception. At ten      |
| o'clock in the evening in Montauk, New York Mr. Field's 1965 Ford     |
| pickup truck experienced total engine failure when the driver came up |
| to the top of a rise in the road and encountered a cigar-shaped       |
| object low over the sand dunes. After losing power Mr. Field allowed  |
| his car to roll backward away from the UFO. The engine restarted. The |
| UFO took off, circled, and flew out over the ocean. At about the same |
| time the police station in Oswego, New York received many calls over  |
| a two-hour period reporting UFOs. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator,   |

| 1966 - At the same time as the New York reports a man waiting in a    |
| parked car on the Ohio University campus in Mansfield, Ohio saw a     |
| round UFO with two lights land nearby. A door in the craft opened and |
| he could see a "very thin" child-sized standing in the doorway. The   |
| object rose, moved toward him, rose again, then disappeared.          |

| 1966 - Mrs. Gillem and her four children were driving through farm    |
| country nine miles north of Lewisburg, Indiana at 10:35 p.m. when     |
| they observed a reddish-white oval-shaped UFO approach the car. A     |
| pulsating sound came over the car radio and increased in frequency    |
| when the UFO got close. The UFO changed color to blue, and then       |
| pursued their car for several miles. (Source: Project Bluebook files  |
| counted in official statistics, Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia,  |
| case 740).                                                            |

| 1967 - On this night near Peterborough, South Australia a car's       |
| engine failed and the two male witnesses then saw a disc-shaped       |
| object rise from a field by the road. The object gave off a blue and  |
| violet glow. It rapidly disappeared into the sky. A few minutes later |
| another disc shot up from another field, emitting sparks the color of |
| a blue mercury-vapor lamp. After the second UFO had gone the car      |
| could then be restarted. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the      |
| Southern Hemisphere, p. 178; Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving    |

| 1974 - At 9.30 p.m. in Hombreiro, Spain a blinding light came from a  |
| hovering, ovoid-shaped UFO. The car engine quit and the lights went   |
| out. The object flew away making a whistling sound, and the car then  |
| functioned normally. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Catalogue |
| of 200 Type-I UFO Events in Spain and Portugal, case 180).            |
|                                                                       |
| 1976 - Miss Roseti da Silva, a 23-year-old college student, was       |
| blinded by a beam of white light from an unseen flying object in      |
| Quixada, Brazil. The energy beam sapped her strength and she lost     |
| consciousness. She was hospitalized with burns and nervous            |
| exhaustion. (Sources: Richard Hall, MUFON UFO Journal, August 1976,   |
| p. 19).                                                               |

| 1978 - At shortly after 7:00 o'clock in the morning in Albury, New    |
| South Wales, Australia a chrome colored cigar-shaped object hovered   |
| over a nearby hillside, casting a shadow on the ground. A second      |
| stingray shaped object swept through the sky in a slow arc and came   |
| to a position beside the larger object. There was an eerie, abnormal  |
| silence that persisted over a mile-wide area. (Source: MUFON UFO      |
| Journal, March 1978, p. 6).                                           |

| 1978 - A "flying boxcar" covered with lights crossed a field and      |
| buzzed a car at low altitude in Pompey Center, New York after 10:00   |
| p.m. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, June 1978, p. 5).                       |

| 1981 - A metallic sphere descended from the sky at a 45º angle and    |
| stopped over a house in Magny, France at 11:20 a.m. It then shot      |
| straight up and away. A check with authorities showed there were no   |
| scheduled balloon releases at that time. That evening there were      |
| reports from pilots from all over Pennsylvania at the same time that  |
| a pilot reported seeing a rocket or cigar-shaped object southwest of  |
| Philadelphia at 11:50 p.m. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, October    |
| 1981).                                                                |

| 1982 - An ovoid or "submarine"-shaped object flew over a car in       |
| Charlottesville, Virginia at 11:15 p.m. It then hovered over the      |
| road, made a U-turn, and then paced the car for 15 blocks. It flew    |
| away toward the north. (Source: International UFO Reporter, November  |
| 1983, p. 4).                                                          |

| 1990 - There were at least three reports of nocturnal lights from     |
| Belgium on this night between 11:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. In Ramilles,  |
| Belgium at 11 o'clock in the evening several lights flying in a       |
| perfect equilateral triangle zigzagged through the sky toward the     |
| southwest. At 11:30 p.m. in Jodoigne a triangle of nocturnal lights   |
| were seen kilometers apart. F-16 jet interceptors were scrambled and  |
| pursued the lights. Also at 11:30 p.m. a sphere that seemed to grow   |
| wings was seen in the sky over Jaunchelette, Belgium. Three lights in |
| a huge triangle were also reported. (Source: FSR, December 1990).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1993 - A Dauphin helicopter, flying to the east of Mullingar, Ireland |
| at ten minutes past midnight, encountered an unexplained light in the |
| sky. It flashed on and off for two seconds, then became two white     |
| lights that flew from the northwest to the southeast. (Source:        |

| 1993 - At 12:30 a.m. at the RAF Shawbury air base in England, a      |
| meteorological officer saw a triangular UFO, larger than a            |
| Boeing-747, zigzag in the sky at great speed, making a humming sound. |
| It swept the countryside with a powerful beam of light. At the same   |
| time in Rugeley, England a family had a close encounter with a UFO    |
| that made a humming sound. They thought the object was going to       |
| crash, but instead it vanished. At RAF Cosford an aviation expert     |
| timed the flight of a UFO seen traveling between Haverfordwest and    |
| Pembrokeshire. He calculated its speed at 1100 mph. According to Nick |
| Pope, the UK Air Ministry's representative responsible for tracking   |
| UFO reports at the time, zigzagging UFOs were also reported flying    |
| over Devonshire, Cornwall, and Somerset Counties at this time.        |

| 1993 - Kadima, Israel - At three o'clock in the morning Aviva Carmel   |
| felt drawn to leave her bed and go outside. There she witnessed a     |
| silver metallic craft land: first the front end touched down, then    |
| the rear. She estimated the size and shape of the craft to be similar |
| to an "orange storage tank" or fruit silo, about sixty feet in        |
| circumference. She approached the landed craft to investigate and     |
| when she got to within twenty feet she saw one of the crew. He was    |
| 2.5 meters tall and wore silvery foil coveralls that clung tightly to |
| his body like a second skin. He also wore a helmet with a tinted      |
| visor that prevented her from seeing the being's face. Later the      |
| following day Carmel ventured back into her backyard and saw the      |
| imprint of the craft. It was a circle 22 feet in diameter formed from |
| still living vegetation. Plant life outside the imprint area had      |
| died. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1993,     |

| 1995 - A woman watering her garden at 10:25 in the evening in Saltos  |
| Coll, Puerto Rico noticed a three-foot tall humanoid standing 75 feet |
| away from her. The being had a round head, long thin arms, large      |
