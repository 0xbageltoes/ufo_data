| 1958 - At 11:15 a.m. on Sunday, June 1st, a silent "unknown aircraft" |
| with no identifying markers crashed into the Alta fjord, Norway. At   |
| the impact site, 70 meters deep, a column of water rose up. The       |
| aircraft resembled a twin-engine delta-winged jet. The witnesses were |
| Bjorn Taraldsen, Nils M. Turi, Kate Julsen, and Rasmus Hykkerud. When |
| others arrived half an hour later all they found were a number of     |
| dead fish. The frigate KNM Arendal and the submarine KNM Sarpen,      |
| along with divers, searched for the aircraft fruitlessly for over a   |
| week. The Arendal, however, did get a sonar reading of a mobile       |
| object. (Source: Ole Jonny Braenne, International UFO Reporter,       |

| 1966 - On or around this day two Ontario residents had a chance       |
| encounter with a disc-like UFO hovering close to the dark waters of   |
| Lake Ontario. The object, which had rows of lights flashing around    |
| its perimeter, took off rapidly as the witnesses approached it in a   |
| motor boat. The incident was reported to NICAP by Richard Plewman.    |
| Plewman, a former RCAF Flight Lieutenant and pilot instructor, was    |
| cruising with a friend, Jack Grant about 2-1/2 miles offshore of      |
| Clarkson at about 10:30 p.m. While proceeding in a NE direction, the  |
| men noticed some lights like headlights on the water ahead. They      |
| continued talking, and approaching the lights at a moderate speed,    |
| not suspecting anything unusual. When they got to an estimated        |
| distance of 3/4 to 1 mile, the lights slowly rose with a "swish,"     |
| emitting a low "pulsating hum." Plewman and Grant could now see a     |
| disc with a bubble-type dome on top and a flat bottom, casting an     |
| oval reflection on the lake surface. A row of bright yellow lights    |
| encircled the dome, blue-green lights around the lower perimeter.     |
| After hovering briefly, the UFO took off at high speed disappearing   |
| "Like a light bulb turned out." Plewman said the perimeter lights     |
| clearly outlined the dark object, the colors changing from dull white |
| to fluorescent tones as the UFO started to rise. (Source: NICAP UFO   |

| 1967 - A yellow-orange disc-shaped object with three legs and windows |
| allegedly landed in Santa Monica near Madrid, Spain at 11 p.m. Ground |
| traces included three holes in the ground and burnt grass at the      |
| landing site. The holes were rectangular in shape and 15 cm x 30 cm   |
| in size. An aluminum colored powder and some mysterious tubes were    |
| also discovered. An object, said to be lens-shaped, was photographed  |
| 30 minutes earlier in San Jose de Valderas, Spain. The photo shows an |
| "H" insignia on the bottom of the craft. The photograph, however, is  |
| regarded by many UFO investigators as a hoax. (Source: Antonio        |

| 1967 - John Norton, age 7, of Richmond, Virginia had to be taken to a |
| hospital after observing a disc-shaped, buzzing object, the size of a |
| Volkswagen, with green and red lights, which landed in a clearing at  |
| 11:30 p.m. and took off "like lightning." (Sources: NICAP UFO         |

| 1970 - A teacher on the beach on Padre Island, Texas sighted a cloud  |
| cigar, that is, a cigar-shaped flying object surrounded by an         |
| artificial cloud, low overhead at about 1:00 p.m. It had a pulsing    |
| glow, and made a sudden hissing sound. It shot off in a vertical      |
| ascent. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator,  August 1970, p. 1).         |

| 1972 - The principal witness, along with her mother and two friends,  |
| were driving to the village of Collage near Molong, New South Wales,  |
| Australia at around 8:00 a.m. As she sat in the back seat she looked  |
| out the window to her right and noticed a large bright shiny object.  |
| It was saucer shaped with a dome on top, and along side of it on the  |
| left was a very tall person dressed in an outfit that glowed the same |
| as the ship. Another similar figure was walking towards the road (the |
| craft was about 30 meters away from a fence line, which was 5 meters  |
| from the road). A third figure was standing on the right side of the  |
| object near a dead tree. All three had on the same clothing with      |
| helmets with black visors. She described the aliens as being very     |
| tall, approximate eight feet in height. As the car drove she noticed  |
| that they seemed to be collecting items from the ground. She also     |
| noticed that the one walking towards the road seemed to have turned   |
| his helmet and look at their vehicle as it drove off. The witness     |
| never told anyone else in the car what she had seen. (Source: Peter   |

| 1975 - At about 1:30 a.m. a woman was walking around a corner of a    |
| major highway on the outskirts of the town of Villarrasa, Huelva      |
| province, Spain when she encountered a large object with red, green,  |
| and white lights in the middle of the road. Standing next to the      |
| object were three very tall human looking beings, who wore bright     |
| white uniforms and square helmets. They seemed to be moving their     |
| arms around. The witness became frightened and ran home. Around the   |
| same time another witness in a different part of town sawa large      |
| domed disc with green and red lights, or or near the ground only 15   |
| meters away. Next to the round object stood three very tall men       |
| wearing helmets. Each helmet had a green light on it. The men were    |
| next seen walking around the object. This witness also became afraid  |
| and left. When he looked back, he saw the UFO lifting off from the    |
| ground. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1975 Humanoid Contact Database,   |

| 1981 - In Cavan, South Australia a former radio booster station saw a |
| huge whitish-blue ball of light, the size of a house, on the right of |

| 2013 - At about 10:05 p.m. on Saturday evening a women and her        |
| 3-year-old child had just pulled out of a convenience store on U.S.   |
| Route 30 in North Huntindon Township, Westmoreland County,            |
| Pennsylvania, and turned left toward Greensburg. As she drove along   |
| she noticed a large object hovering over the highway. She said out    |
| loud, "What in the world is that?" Her youngster in the backseat      |
| responded, "Look mommy, a flying iPad in the sky!" She looked around  |
| and noticed there were no other cars on the road. She was quite       |
| concerned and stopped, about 150 feet away from the hovering craft.   |
| The object was completely silent and hovered approximately 60 feet    |
| above the roadway. She described it as looking "mostly                |
| rectangular...like the gondola of a blimp without the blimp." It      |
| extended over the east and westbound lanes, and was estimated to be   |
| about 55 feet long, and 35-40 feet tall.                              |
|                                                                       |
| The witness described the object as two-tiered. The top section had   |
| five sets of green lights. There were three individual lights in each |
| set, and the five sets were all evenly spaced and not blinking. The   |
| green color was brighter than the green of a traffic light. The       |
| bottom section was smaller; it contained two long solid red lights    |
| ther were placed side by side. These lights were steady and gave the  |
| impression of looking like brake lights, but they were huge. The      |
| woman called her mother on her bluetooth cell phone. She asked her    |
| mother if she had any explanation of what she was looking at, but as  |
| she drove under it the digital dashboard display, her cell phone      |
| signal, and her FM radio all blacked out. The witness attempted to    |
| take a photo with her iPhone, but the camera function wouldn't load.  |

| She accelerated down the highway to get away from the object. About   |
| half a mile away she looked back and could no longer see the object.  |
| The digital displays all returned to normal, her radio came back on,  |
| and she was able to make cell phone contact again with her mother as  |
| she approached the Adamsburg exit. When she got home she discussed    |
| what had happened with her family, and they urged her to draw a       |
| sketch of the object while the even was still fresh in her memory.    |
