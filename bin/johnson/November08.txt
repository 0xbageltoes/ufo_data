| 1954 - At 1:00 a.m. a man in Croydon, London, England was  outside    |
| looking after his rabbits when a small disc-shaped object flew over.  |
| The next day he became sick to his stomach and ended up in the        |
| hospital. (Source: Jenny Randles, Alien Contacts and Abductions, p.   |

| 1954 - At 10:30 a.m. a crowd of about 150 people jumped barriers to   |
| get closer to a luminous craft that had landed in the stadium in      |
| Monza, Italy. The object rested on three legs and had a dome emitting |
| a blinding white light and supported an antenna. Two small figures    |
| dressed in white and gray, wearing transparent helmets, were seen.    |
| They spoke with guttural sounds. One of them had a black face with    |
| sort of trunk. When a man sicced a boxer dog onto the dwarfs, the     |
| animal turned around and bit him. The object rose with a shrill sound |
| and vanished rapidly. Probable fabrication according to Italian       |
| researchers on the Project 1947 list. (Sources: Harold Wilkins,       |

| 1954 - At 6:00 p.m. a number of people in the Vacheresse Forest in    |
| Voussac, France reported seeing a luminous sphere land at the edge of |
| the forest and then become dark. The next morning, an investigation   |
| disclosed that an area 4 or 5 meters in diameter had no leaves, while |
| the ground elsewhere was covered with them. The earth seemed to have  |
| been dug up. (Sources: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers Uncensored, p.  |
| 238; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p.   |
| 243, case 332).                                                       |

| 1954 - At dusk in La Tessoualle, France Andre Chaillou felt           |
| pricklings in his hands, "in spite of his gloves," when a blue disc   |
| came close to his motorcycle and his electrical system failed. He was |
| unable to move or articulate a word for several minutes. As soon as   |
| the blue light was turned off, he started again and went near the     |
| light when it reappeared 200 meters away. He saw the object, a cone   |
| 5.5 meters in size, rise vertically with a soft whistling, then fly   |
| horizontally to the north. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to       |

| 1956 - A UFO flap covering the states of North Dakota, South Dakota,  |
| and Minnesota began on November 8, 1956. The sightings occurred       |
| during nearly every hour of the day and night and continued until     |
| December 2, 1956. More than 85 separate sighting reports from some 60 |
| different localities were received from this three state area. Due to |
| the unusually large number of reports, it was possible in some        |
| instances to determine that the same UFO or UFOs were seen in widely  |
| separate places. At other times the sighting reports suggested that a |
| large number of different objects were aloft at the same time.        |
|                                                                       |
| The flurry of UFO reports began with a sighting in Dickinson, South   |
| Dakota. Farmer Laudie Dvorak was driving into his farmyard about 8:30 |
| p.m., on this date when he glanced up and saw what at first appeared  |
| to be a falling star, off to the north. But in a few seconds it       |
| seemed to be "right in front of me." He thought it might be an        |
| airplane, but it wasn't. "It went too fast," Dvorak said, "even for a |
| jet - maybe 800 to 1000 miles per hour. It was just a streak through  |
| the buttes as it approached from the north and traveled in a          |
| southerly direction." (Source: Bob Gribble, Looking Back November     |
| 1956, National UFO Reporting Center website).                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1956 - While the UFOs were busy over the northern Plain States they   |
| surprised a few people in southern Florida as well. About nine a.m.   |
| on November 8th, several witnesses in Coco Beach, Florida observed    |
| two UFOs move in behind an F-100 jet fighter. Through 7x50            |
| binoculars, and also with the naked eye, they watched as the jet      |
| moved across the sky at about 1250 miles per hour. The UFO came up    |
| fast and the jet pilot made a tight turn, but couldn't catch the      |
| object. It was learned later that the same object was seen earlier    |
| pursuing a rocket launched from Cape Canaveral.                       |
|                                                                       |
| About two hours after the UFO pursued the jet and rocket, a           |
| mysterious object which apparently played tag off the tip of Florida  |
| for several minutes before shooting into space at 4000 miles per hour |
| was reported by a Pan American World Airways radar expert. Donald     |
| Freestone said he picked up the UFO while testing weather radar       |
| equipment in the FAA shops at Miami International Airport. Surprised  |
| by the unexpected target return on the screen, he called fellow       |
| employees. Six of his colleagues confirmed the finding. None knew     |
| what it was. "I didn't believe in such things before," said           |
| Freestone. "But after this happened, I got some books and read up on  |
| it. Now I'm convinced it was something that is out of our experience, |
| so far as aircraft is concerned."                                     |
|                                                                       |
| Freestone said the UFO was "four to five times larger than any        |
| aircraft observed in the past." It appeared to be egg-shaped or       |
| oval-shaped, and to have a double pattern resembling an hourglass or  |
| figure eight. The radar expert said he was working on a Bendix RDR-lA |
| weather radar which FAA uses in some planes to spot bad weather       |
| ahead. It is capable of "seeing" storms and thunderstorms 150 miles   |
| in the path of planes. With the radar at "zero tilt" - that is,       |
| pointed straight out, Freestone first saw the UFO. "It appeared at    |
| approximately 65 miles southwest of Miami, at an altitude of between  |
| 7000 and 8000 feet. It disappeared and reappeared several times. I    |
| found that by turning the antenna tilt up, it could be brought back   |
| on the screen. It disappeared once at 70 miles and reappeared at      |
| about 55 miles, then moved back to 70 miles. The speed was estimated  |
| at 550 to 650 miles per hour."                                        |
|                                                                       |
| "It then moved in to 50 miles and remained stationary for two to      |
| three minutes. Then it began going off in the south-southwest         |
| direction it had come from. One time it was noticed that the target   |
| moved 20 miles in about six sweeps or rotations of the antenna, which |
| rotates at a speed of 20 times a minute. (Calculations indicate that  |
| this showed a flying speed of about 4000 miles per hour.) The object  |
| was last observed at about 100 miles from Miami, still moving         |
| south-southwest. It was on the radar screen for about 20 minutes from |
| 11:15 a.m. to 11:35 a.m. From the returns the target appeared fairly  |
| large, being four to five times larger than any normal aircraft. It   |
| had a definite shape and moved on a definite course. Homestead Air    |
| Force Base, south of Miami, Florida was placed on an "alert status."  |

| 1957 - In Edinburgh, Scotland fourteen people, including Mrs. Maty    |
| Home, reported to the police that a disc-shaped object followed their |
| truck, dived toward it, came within 20 meters of them, and then left  |
| toward the sea, leaving a double vapor trail. (Source: Jacques        |

| 1957 - At 2:00 a.m. a cigar-shaped object, 70 meters long, was        |
| observed less than seven meters above the ground in Sloanville, New   |
| York. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of      |

| 1957 - At 2:30 p.m. Hank Mollohan and eight other persons saw an      |
| elongated object land in Holly, West Virginia. It was 12 meters long  |
| and had several portholes from which fire and smoke appeared to be    |
| coming. It swung at low altitude and then dropped to the ground.      |
| People seemed to be moving around outside the landed UFO, but the     |
| witnesses were driven away by a hard rain. (Sources: Alexander        |

| 1957 - On the same night Paul Rutledge saw an object 16 meters long   |
| flying over his garage in Waterloo, Iowa. The top part was bright and |
| there were two figures visible inside. (Sources: Alexander Mebane,    |

| 1959 - On this morning a cigar-shaped UFO followed a gasoline tanker  |
| truck for miles in Austin, Texas. It dropped down and sprayed         |
| the highway with fog. Later, it was realized that the driver had      |
| experienced approximately 40 minutes of missing time. (Source: Larry  |

| 1967 - On this night a humanoid creature described by police as a     |
| "mini-skirted" vampire reportedly terrorized locals on the beach      |
| along the Amazon River in Manaus, Brazil. Several people who were     |
| attacked described the creature as looking like a blond haired woman  |
| with sharp pointed teeth, wearing a mini-skirt and black stockings.   |
| Two small round marks were said to have been found near the jugular   |
| vein of a child that was bitten. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid |

| 1968 - At 8:05 p.m. a metallic looking lenticular disc "like two      |
| round basins placed face to face" Swooped down over the town of       |
| Taguatinga, Brazil near Brasilia. It had lights and portholes around  |

| 1973 - At 12:30 a.m. a motorist driving on I-10 east of Blythe,       |
| California observed a circular object in the sky with red, green, and |
| amber lights that moved up-and-down and side-to-side. (Source:        |

| 1973 - Joan Scofield reported that her family dog was greatly         |
| agitated when her family of six observed two low flying, brilliant    |
| red lights that flew over their home in Falmouth, Nova Scotia and     |
| circled back at 6:15 p.m. (Source: Donald Ledger, Maritime UFO Files, |

| 1974 - Jose Maria Cravero and another aviator observed a UFO at close |
| range close to Talavera Air Base near Badajoz, Spain three days       |
| earlier. On this night Sr. Cravero returned to the site and witnessed |
| a strange, evasive human-looking entity walking along the side of the |
| road near the UFO landing site. The being had slanted eyes, no nose,  |
| and was wearing a brown jacket, black trousers, and what looked like  |
| a "Roman helmet" on his head. The body was tall and slender, but he   |
| could tell no further details about the beings arms or legs. Cravero  |
| was impressed by the furtive, evasive nature of the being. (Source:   |

| 1975 - Two F-106 fighter jets were scrambled out of Malmstrom Air     |
| Force Base in Great Falls, Montana at 7:45 Z. At 2:53 a.m. local time |
| a visual sighting of at least one low level noctural light was made   |
| by the Sabotage Alert Teams on the ground. The radar target was at    |
| 300 feet altitude, and the weather station reported no anomalous      |
| propagation. Targets would turn out their lights whenever the jets    |
| approached. (Sources: US Air Force Air Command Center report dated    |

| 1975 - At 1:00 a.m. campers in the Catskill Mountains, New York had   |
| an abduction experience with one hour of missing time. Campers at the |
| Pepactin Reservoir in Ulster County first saw a luminous "sled" with  |
| hoops on top descend. "Rabbits" approach tent (screen memory?). 60    |

| 1975 - On November 1st a mineralogist walking near Vauchingnon,       |
| France happened upon some peculiar tracks in the grass of the         |
| prairie. These circular tracks were six inches across and nearly an   |
| inch deep, as if made by a heavy biped taking long strides, which ran |
| for some distance. He wanted to photograph them, but because it was   |
| getting late in the afternoon he decided to come back later. He       |
| returned with a friend on this afternoon. Before they located the     |
| tracks they saw two quasi-human figures about five feet tall, dressed |
| in dark blue or black, emerge from a copse of woods 50 meters away.   |
| These beings had very long arms and were taking extraordinarily long  |
| strides. They began to ascend a very steep slope, and the             |
| mineralogist's friend ran after them, but the beings climbed the      |
| slope so quickly that they easily escaped from view and were lost in  |
| some bushes ont he hill. The main witness reported that no human      |
| athlete, in his opinion, could have duplicated their performance. A   |
| few seconds later a white station wagon with dark painted windows     |
| came into view on a little traveled road further up the slope, then   |
| took off again at high speed. Immediately afterwards, a small blue    |
| car did exactly the same thing. Although the bushes blocked their     |
| view, the witnesses believed that these two vehicles had picked up    |
| the humanoids. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Blocher, HUMCAT:          |

| 1975 - At 8:20 p.m. Strategic Air Command reported a UFO 20 miles     |
| southeast of Lewistown, Montana. It was an orange-white, disc-shaped  |
| object. NORAD radar was unable to get a height check. (Source: Fund   |

| 1976 - At 3:30 p.m. an engineer was driving with three other people   |
| in Givet, Ardennes, France when they spotted what appeared to be a    |
| landed, domed, disc-shaped object. It was hovering on three legs 30   |
| meters away. It had a flat bottom and a transparent dome or cupola    |
| which showed the "busts" of two large heads. They stopped the car to  |
| observe the object, but were hit by a blast of heat as the object     |
| departed. The object had been hovering just above the ground, never   |

| 1979 - On this day a round, silvery object with flashing lights was   |
| seen by two women at a bus stop in Pentland Hills, Borders, Scotland. |
| It briefly hovered, then shot off at high speed toward Dechmont Law.  |
| At 5:50 p.m. five women in Livingston watched a circle of lights that |
| slowly rotated. At 7:50 p.m. a dome shaped UFO was seen at 400 meters |
| distance in Bellsquarry, Livingston, Lothian, Scotland. It glowed     |
| white with pulsating blue and red lights on either side. The two      |
| witnesses watched it for several minutes. (Source: Ron Halliday, UFO  |

| 1981 - At around 3 p.m. a 15 meter long metallic ovoid landed 15      |
| meters away from six teenagers in Praglia, Liguria, Italy. The six    |
| boys were racing dirt bikes near a lake when one of them fell and hit |
| his head. Two of the boys went to assist him, when suddenly a bright  |
| green light was seen descending over the surface of the lake. Inside  |
| the light appeared to be a gray metallic, oval-shaped craft that      |
| descended on telescopic like landing gear near the witnesses. A door  |
| became visible, and a tall, human-looking UFOnaut emerged. His arms   |
| seemed to be extended up into the air. He wore losse fitting, silvery |
| coveralls. His arms appeared to be very long, and his feet resembled  |
| oval appendages. The being seemed to have no neck, and a triangular   |
| shaped head with normal looking eyes. The humanoid proceeded to walk  |
| towards the lake, and then to walk on the surface of the water. A few |
| moments later he walked back into the object, which took off at high  |
| speed, disturbing the surface of the lake. (Sources: Albert S.        |

| short Grey humanoids with large black almond-shaped eyes. The beings  |
| took flesh samples from her legs and back, leaving scoop marks. She   |
| was returned safely to her bedroom. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,       |

| 1995 - On this night Mr. J. Curran of Polbeth, Bathgate, Lothian,     |
| Scotland watched and videotapted as an orange circle in the sky       |
| polymorphed into a delta-shaped UFO, then back into a sphere.         |
| Photometric analysis suggests that the circle showed an out-of-focus  |
| object. Later, John S., age 45, of West Lothian, Scotland saw what    |
| looked like "a new type of ship. It looked like a giant Frisbee"      |
| between the Forth Canal and the Clyde Canal. The occupants were like  |
| the Greys, except their eyes were rounder. He had previously been     |
| involved in an abduction experience. (Source: Ron Halliday, UFO       |

| 2004 - On this evening Terry McDonald, driving home in Crane River,   |
| Manitoba, Canada had a bright light closely following his truck. His  |
| truck engine intermittently lost power over the course of one         |
| kilometer. A Kenora, Ontario resident saw a saucer-like object        |
| hovering only 18 meters above the ground. He observed the saucer for  |
| nearly an hour before it moved fairly slowly across the treetops.     |

| 2004 - A man named Triguez was staying overnight at his grandmother's |
| house in Lavaderos, Hormigueros, Puerto Rico when he awoke at four    |
| a.m. and looked out the window to see a strange oval-shaped craft on  |
| the ground in a nearby field. The craft appeared crystal like in      |
| appearance and had small lights around the edges. It emitted a        |
| strange sound and greenish flashes of light. He observed the object   |
| for awhile, and then noticed an opening in the object which had       |
| become visible, from which he briefly saw a figure descend down what  |
| appeared to be steps. He could not make out any other details. The    |
| craft soon vanished. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2004 Humanoid        |
