| 1952 - Inyo, Kern County, California. Two couples, looking through a  |
| 5x telescope at 10 p.m., observed a large, round object, which went   |
| through the color spectrum every 2 seconds. It flew straight and      |
| level for 15 minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO     |

| 1954 - Foussignargues, France. At "Revety," people on a bus saw a     |
| reddish light with a halo come down from the sky at 2:30 a.m.. Later  |
| Mr. and Mrs. Louis Roche noticed a softly glowing red object on the   |
| ground a short distance from their house, but were afraid to approach |
| it. It remained there for several hours. It was described as "a sort  |
| of glowing tomato, with antennae on top." (Sources: Jacques Vallee,   |

| 1954 - Perpignan, France. A college student saw a circular object on  |
| the ground this afternoon. Two beings came out of it, then reentered  |
| the craft and left. The witness was reportedly in a state of shock.   |

| 1954 - Four children in Premanon, France came outside of their home   |
| at 8:30 p.m. because their dog was barking furiously. They saw a      |
| large object on the ground and a small being they thought was a       |
| "ghost" in their yard. Raymond Romand (or Rolland), age 12, threw     |
| stones at the intruder. (Sources: Aime Michel, A propos des Soucoupes |

| 1965 - A physicist employed by the U.S. Air Force sighted a sharply   |
| defined, brillian white ball of light in Andover, Massachusetts at    |
| 7:28 p.m. He first thought it could be a meteor, but it did not burn  |
| out when he stopped to watch it. It moved faster than any known       |
| conventional aircraft. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:              |

| 1971 - On this night Len Delman, a lorry driver, saw what he took to  |
| be a man in a white suit in the road directly ahead of his truck      |
| while driving near Banbury, Oxfordshire, England. He slammed on the   |
| brakes and came to a halt, believing he may have hit the man. He      |
| jumped out and went behind his truck, but found no one. Coming back   |
| around to the front of his vehicle he saw in the headlights a         |
| "spaceman," 7-8 feet tall, with big, staring eyes 8-12 inches apart   |
| and extending around the sides of its head. It had a pack on its back |
| from which two tubes led to the head. When Delman honked his horn     |
| repeatedly the "thing" jumped three feet in the air and ran across    |
| the road, then leapt over a hedge. Two other lorry drivers came upon  |
| the scene, and together they watched a disc-shaped object take off    |
| from the field where the figure had disappeared. (Source: David F.    |
| Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case      |
| 1971-26, citing J. D. Llewellyn, FSR, Vol. 18 # 1).                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - At 11:13 p.m. Enrique Moreno was delivering documents to the   |
| Ika-Renault factory in Santa Isabel, Cordoba, Argentina when the      |
| fluorescent lights in the engineering room went on and off three      |
| times. There was an accompanying noise like that of a turbine lasting |
| for several seconds. Driving his motor runabout outside the plant he  |
| briefly glimpsed "a sort of rainbow very near the ground," but        |
| thought no further of it until he suddenly encountered a tall figure, |
| glowing a bluish green, moving among a pile of chassis beside his     |
| route. As he approached within 30 meters the figure swung around, in  |
| a stiff mechanical way, to face him, and at the same time his engine  |
| faltered then quit when he came opposite the being.                   |
|                                                                       |
| This humanoid figure, strongly built and about 7.5 feet tall, had     |
| eyes like yellow light bulbs, large pointed ears, a square chin, and  |
| a slit-like mouth. The face appeared pale green, but this may have    |
| been do to a reflection from the clothing, a one-piece luminescent    |
| bluish-green tight fitting coverall with a broad silvery belt. Moreno |
| felt an intolerable humming in his ears, a sensation of heat, and     |
| itching over his entire body. There was also the smell of burning     |
| oil. His arms and legs were paralyzed. After 30 seconds of this       |
| confrontation, his motorcycle shot off to the left seemingly under    |
| its own volition at high speed, and the witness was returned to the   |
| Security Office without his conscious control. He arrived there at    |
| 11:30 p.m., but his wristwatch had stopped at 11:13 p.m., leaving 15  |
| minutes unaccounted for. Moreno was in a highly agitated state, and   |
| subsequently suffered nausea and pains in the neck, as well as a      |
| burning sensation in his eyes. At the encounter site two rectangular  |
| "footprints" 8 inches x 16 inches were found and the soil there was   |
| warm to the touch. (Sources: Oscar A. Galindez, FSR, November 1975,   |
| p. 21; David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid    |
| Reports, case 1972-28, citing Dr. Oscar A. Galindez).                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - At 11:30 p.m. independent witnesses, one a woman with the      |
| surname of Quiroga, saw near the local Ika-Renault auto plant in      |
| Santa Isabel, Cordoba, Argentina a luminous object which picked up a  |
| tall humanoid entity. It did so by means of a solid beam of blue      |
| light. It somehow levitated or took the being up through the tube of  |
| light and into the UFO. Others saw a luminous object rising up into   |
| the sky from the vicinity of the auto plant. (Source: Oscar A         |
| Galindez, FSR, November 1975, p. 21).                                 |

| 1973 - At around 5:30 p.m., while picking mushrooms in the woods on   |
| Mont Real in Bedarrides, Vancluse, France, the witness observed a     |
| four-foot-tall dwarf standing at the edge of the clearing some 100    |
| feet away. As he grabbed something from the ground a second           |
| identical-looking being joined the first one from the woods beyond.   |
| They looked human and wore beige coveralls that covered up their      |
| wrists and neck; their feet were obscured by high grass. Their arms   |
| were slender and their hands normal. Each wore a black beret on his   |
| head. Thinking they were children, the witness called out to them,    |
| whereupon they laughed aloud, then turned and fled into the brush     |
| behind them. A few seconds later, the witness saw a dull bluish-gray  |
| oval-shaped object, about five meters wide, rise up beyond the trees  |
| and ascend to a height of 20 feet, making a slight whistling sound.   |
| There it paused briefly, then departed toward the northeast rapidly   |
| and in total silence. At the landing site, a bush and some grass had  |
| been flattened, suggesting that the UFO had been hovering a foot or   |
| so above the ground. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher: HUMCAT:   |

| 1973 - Two girls were standing outside in Beaver County, Pennsylvania |
| at 9:30 p.m. when an eight-foot tall being covered with white hair    |
| and with red glowing eyes ran into the woods nearby. The humanoid was |
| carrying a large luminous sphere in its hands. The girls ran off      |
| hysterically into their house. The father of one of the girls then    |
| went into the woods in search of the creature and stayed there for    |
| over an hour. When he returned he refused to talk about what he had   |
| seen in the woods. During the period of time he was in the woods      |
| several people watched a silvery object hovering over the woods. At   |
| one point it emitted a beam of light into the woods. (Source: Stan    |
| Gordon, MUFON UFO Symposium 1974).                                    |

| 1978 - At 8:00 p.m. two witnesses watched an object with pulsating    |
| red lights fly low over some pine trees in Prcirovnik, Poland. The    |
| object was oval shaped and appeared to descend into the woods. In the |
| woods, a mushroom picker encountered three short beings dressed in    |
| black one-piece suits with flippers on their feet. On their chests    |
| they wore a yellow emblem with a red dot, and on their heads they     |
| wore tight-fitting black helmets. The beings were greenish in color   |
| and had pointed ears, red slanted eyes, and pronounced cheekbones.    |
| They gave off a strong chlorine-like odor. (Source: Albert S.         |

| 1989 - A woman was called by her granddaughter to look at something   |
| unusual outside at 4:20 p.m. She stepped out of her house near        |
| Tillamook, Oregon and was confronted by an object resembling an       |
| inverted toy top, hovering just above the ground. It was 20 to 30     |
| feet in diameter and had a flat bottom and a bright yellow-white      |
| light shining at both ends. The woman approached to within 30 feet of |
| the craft when a door opened revealing a blond human-like entity of   |
| average height with fair skin and blue eyes. He was wearing a silvery |
| coverall uniform. The woman then noticed at a window next to the door |
| a large hairy, Sasquatch type creature apparently seated and only     |
| visible from the chest up. The woman stared at the object and beings  |
| for a few minutes, and then the UFO suddenly vanished from plain      |
| sight. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1989,   |
| case #116; MUFON UFO Journal, April 1990).                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1989 - Several children playing at a local park in Voronezh, Russia   |
| first observed a pinkish glow approaching in the sky at 6:30 p.m. As  |
| it came overhead they could see that it was a deep red, ball-shaped   |
| object. The object flew around in circles for a few minutes and then  |
| left. When it returned it hovered briefly, and then descended very    |
| close to the ground. A hatch opened and a heavy set figure emerged.   |
| The being moved very slowly and looked around, he had a very small    |
| head resembling that of a doorknob, set in between its shoulders. It  |
| had three luminous eyes, the middle one moving around like"radar." On |
| its chest there was a shield-like object. The being then closed the   |
| hatch and the object landed gently on four legs. The hatch opened     |
| again and three huge humanoids with small knob-like heads stepped     |
| out. These wore silvery coveralls and bronze colored boots. A strange |
| robot-like creature accompanied the giants. All four of them walked   |
| around the object several times. A beam of light came out of the      |
| chest of one of the beings and struck the ground, creating several    |
| luminous triangles that later faded away. At one point the craft and  |
| beings became briefly invisible but then reappeared. One of the boys  |
| screamed in fear. Then one of the beings looked at the boy and        |
| pointed a tube at him. A luminous beam came from the tube and hit the |
| boy, which made him disappear. The boy later reappeared after the     |
| beings and the objects had gone. Subsequent information revealed that |
| on of the craft's hull and on the landing prop of another craft was   |
| the letter or symbol "Zhe," reported to have been similar to the      |
| "UMMO" insignia reported in Western Europe in the 1970s. (Source:     |
