| black-and-white motion picture film was made showing a large          |
| disc-shaped craft hovering in a searchlight beam; it emitted five     |

| object resting by the side of the road in San Giovanni Vesuviano,     |

| 1954 - A farmer named Carmelo Papotto in Tripoli, Libya saw a flying  |
| craft descend to ground level at 3:00 a.m. It hovered about 50 meters |
| away, making a sound like that of an air compressor. It was an        |
| egg-shaped machine with six wheels and complex machinery. The top     |
| half was transparent and flooded with a bright white light. Aboard    |
| were six men in yellowish coveralls; they looked human and had on     |
| facemasks. When he touched part of the craft he got a strong electric |
| shock. One of the occupants motioned for him to stay away. For the    |
| next twenty minutes the witness was able to observe the six men,      |
| apparently busy with their instruments. Reliable investigations were  |
| made. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of     |

| 1954 - On this afternoon baker M. Lelu was in his vehicle on Route    |
| 101 in Trondes, France and had come to a bend on the road when he     |
| spotted two phosphorescent points of light near a glade. He           |
| approached the area, thinking it was another car, when he saw a tall  |
| blond haired man standing immobile in a nearby field. Thinking that   |
| the figure might be an extraterrestrial he drove away from the area   |
| in order to get additional witnesses. Later, the harassed owner of    |
| the field claimed that the mysterious blond figure was merely a       |
| Polish farmer, but this was never confirmed. (Source: Albert S.       |

| 1954 - Mrs. Boeuf was coming out of her farmhouse in the evening in    |
| St. Hilaire-des-Loges, Vendee, France when she saw a luminous disc    |
| hovering in the sky and called to her family. When everyone saw the   |
| object come closer they locked all the doors and spent a sleepless    |
| night inside. They did not observe the object's departure, but        |
| noticed an unnatural silence that pervaded the area. (Sources:        |

| 1965 - James Townsend, age 19, a radio announcer for KEYL Radio, had  |
| a close encounter with a UFO and three creatures at about 7:15 p.m.   |
| on a road about four miles east of Long Prairie, Minnesota. As he was |
| driving around a curve in the road he saw an upright, rocket-like     |
| object straddling the road. It was about 30 or 40 feet high and about |
| 10 feet in diameter, resting on legs or fins. His car engine stalled, |
| the lights and radio went out, and he slammed on the brakes and       |
| stopped twenty feet in front of it. His first thought was to knock it |
| over with the car so he would have some evidence, but the engine had  |
| already stalled. Then he got out with the idea of trying to push it   |
| over by hand.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| "When I got to the front of my car, three creatures that looked like  |
| individual tin cans on tripods, and were six inches tall, came from   |
| behind the rocket. They didn't have eyes that I could see, but I knew |
| they were looking at me. I stopped. I didn't have any desire to get   |
| closer. There was no sound--just dead silence. It seemed like ages as |
| we looked at each other. Then they went up into the rocket, which had |
| a bright colorless light glowing out of the bottom. There was a loud  |
| hum. The rocket went up and disappeared. When the light on the bottom |
| went out after it was in the air, my car radio and light came on, and |
| my engine started without having to touch the starter."               |
|                                                                       |
| Townsend said his car had an automatic transmission and he had placed |
| the selector lever in "park." Townsend said his heart was pounding    |
| and his legs were like rubber. He drove at high speed back to Long    |
| Prairie to report his close encounter. Townsend said the craft took   |
| off, looking "just like a flashlight that is turned on and then       |
| lifted up from the table with the light at the bottom." That night    |
| several hunters in the Long Prairie area claimed to have seen a       |
| strong light above them that lit up the ground. Other hunters         |
| reported seeing a lighted object circle around and around in the sky  |
| over their farm. (Sources: Bob Gribble, Looking Back October 1965,    |

| 1966 - In Adelaide, South Australia at 2:30 a.m. a bright oval-shaped |
| object with a cone shape beneath it hung stationary in the sky at     |
| 20-degrees elevation above the horizon. It glowed a bright            |
| orange-yellow color. A "sodium-light" yellow colored object flew      |
| toward the northeast over Burnside, South Australia at 8:25 p.m.      |
| After four minutes of flight it slowed down and turned toward the     |
| north. It descended, gained speed and was gone by 8:35 p.m. (Source:  |

| 1969 - A dark or invisible object with lights fore and aft hovered    |

| 1972 - An odd humming sound was heard in Balboa Park in San Diego,    |
| California. Although he couldn't see anything, the witness took       |
| photographs of a canyon in the direction from which the noise         |
| originated. On the developed photographs there was an image of an     |
| ovoid object. (Source: Contact UK; UFO Register, volume 9, 1978).     |

| 1972 - At around 6 p.m. a yellow and red bullet-shaped UFO approached |
| an airliner that was flying 160 miles northeast of Churchill,         |
| Manitoba. There was a very intense beam coming from in front of the   |
| object. and exhaust with orange sparks coming from the rear. The      |
| airliner's radio failed to work during the encounter. Finally, a fog  |
| appeared from nowhere, obscuring the object. There were 15 witnesses, |
| including 40-year-old Daryl Brown. The encounter lasted three         |
| minutes. (Source: UNICAT database, case #492, citing Jeff Holt, UFO   |

| 1973 - In the morning in Russell Springs, Kentucky a woman            |
| encountered two three-foot tall, reddish-skinned humanoids who were   |
| near her house. The beings were first seen in her carport, and they   |
| walked around the side of the house and entered a washtub-shaped      |
| craft sitting on the ground, which then rose over the house and       |
| disappeared. The little men were reddish and walked as if on tiptoes. |
| The ground was disturbed where the craft had been sitting. (Sources:  |

| 1973 - Angel hair residue fell on Midway, Texas and was analyzed by   |
| the University of Texas. The residue was consistent with Dictyna      |
| spider web, but the sample did contain some rare elements such as     |
| zinc and lanthanum, so it could have resulted from the mixture of     |
| crebellate spider web with some other mystery substance. (Source:     |

| 1973 - On this night near Dobson, North Carolina David Simpson's car  |
| engine stopped and the headlights went out when an oval-shaped UFO,   |
| 12 feet wide by 8 feet high, landed near his car. A humanoid with     |
| eyes "like balls of fire" peered through his window. Afterwards the   |
| car's engine and lights came back on spontaneously without his having |
| to touch the ignition switch. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,  |

| maneuvers, and then over Sligo changed course and sped away. (Source: |
