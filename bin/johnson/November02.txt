| 1885 - Scutari, Albania (then called Uskudar, a part of Ottoman       |
| Turkey). At dawn a luminous object circled the harbor at an altitude  |
| of 56 meters for 90 seconds. It illuminated the entire town with a    |
| bluish-green glow. It made several circles above the ferryboat pier   |
| then plunged into the sea. (Sources: Ivan Sanderson, Invisible        |

| 1951 - At 7:15 a.m. an American Airlines DC-4 passenger plane was     |
| followed by a bright green glowing cigar shaped object east of        |
| Abilene, Texas. The object paced the airliner for about one minute.   |
| It then burst into pieces that looked like red fireballs, which       |
| scattered in all directions. (Source: Donald E. Keyhoe, Aliens from   |

| 1951 - Later that same night, two forest observers were driving in a  |
| canyon 50 kilometers north of the Mojave Desert in California when    |
| they saw around 11 p.m. a disc-shaped flying object in the southwest  |
| sky. They estimated the diameter to be about 30 feet. It was          |
| blue-green in color, with well-defined edges, but surrounded by a     |
| glow of same color. Stopping their jeep, they signaled to the object, |
| which approached to within a few meters, then flew away, seeming to   |
| play with them. Eventually it vanished "like a magician's trick."     |

| 1954 - A green disc landed on a farm near Viomenil-Bataille, France   |
| at 6:15 a.m. It left no physical traces, but there were independent   |
| witnesses to the event, who reported seeing a second disc fly over    |
| heading quickly to the west. (Source: Jean Sider, Dossier 1954 et     |
| l'Imposture Rationaliste, p. 125).                                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - At 10:30 a.m. Maurilio Braga Godoi left the Santo Amaro,       |
| Brazil streetcar terminal and started to walk home. The area was      |
| deserted at that hour, and when he arrived at a street corner he was  |
| surprised to see a large circular object sitting in an empty lot      |
| between two houses. The UFO was 90 to 120 feet in diameter and        |
| surrounded by a strange bluish-red or violet glow. Curious, he        |
| decided to investigate and approached. He soon realized it was much   |
| larger than he originally thought and became somewhat apprehensive.   |
| It was like nothing he had ever seen before and he thought about      |
| going to the police to report it. He felt like running but felt       |
| rooted to the ground. He tried to call for help but no sound would    |
| come from his mouth. This strange sensation persisted for awhile but  |
| finally left him. Godoi noticed that there was an open sliding door   |
| in the object, and he went in. He saw a large circular room           |
| illuminated by a soft light. He saw no lamps. There was no one in     |
| sight and the craft seemed to be deserted. At the center was an oddly |
| shaped table and on it were charts and maps. One of these was a map   |
| of the South American continent and it had a glowing or               |
| phosphorescent quality. Upon closer examination he noticed little     |
| mushroom-shaped symbols scattered about the map.                      |
|                                                                       |
| He had just finished scrutinizing the map when he looked up and       |
| confronted three men. They seemed normal in appearance except that    |
| they were less than five feet tall. They had dark brown skin, short   |
| black hair, and were dressed in one-piece garments like an overall,   |
| which were light gray in color. Each wore a belt around his waist     |
| which appeared to support an object that Godoi worried might be a     |
| weapon. They made no move toward Godoi, but stood staring at him,     |
| occasionally conversing among themselves in an unknown language. He   |
| noticed that the "K" sound was repeated quite often at the beginning  |
| of words more than other sounds.Bynowhisfear had returned and he      |
| tried to converse with them to convince them that he meant no harm,   |
| but they were expressionless and continued to stare at him intently.  |
| He suddenly became aware that, without intention, he was backing out  |
| of the craft, literally dragging his feet backwards one step after    |
| another. They made no attempt to stop him. When he reached the door   |
| he jumped to the ground and started to run away. When about 30 feet   |
| away he turned to look back and saw that the craft was now hovering   |
| about 30 feet above the ground, having at the bottom center a         |
| spinning "screw without end." The UFO climbed silently at high speed  |
| with a violet glow around its edges. The witness was examined by      |
| several psychiatrists in Sao Paulo who concluded that he showed no    |
| signs of mental illness. The case is listed as an "unknown" by the    |
| Brazilian Air Force. (Source: Coral E. Lorenzen, Flying Saucer        |
| Occupants, pp. 198-199).                                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1957 - Five kilometers west of Canadian, Texas military and civilian  |
| witnesses reported seeing a submarine-shaped object at 3:30 a.m. It   |
| was red and white, two or three times as long as a car, and at ground |
| level. It was about three meters in height. A figure was seen         |
| standing near this object, and there was something else that          |
| witnessed to a white signal flag. When a car stopped in the vicinity, |
| a flash of light from the object coincided with the sudden failure of |
| the car's headlights. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A |
| Century of Landings, case 418).                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1957 - Beginning at 10:50 p.m. in Levellend, Texas "...a number of    |
| motorists and police officers in different localities encountered at  |
| close range a luminous egg-shaped object estimated at about 200 feet  |
| in length. Several reports confirmed that when the object passed at   |
| close range car engines and lights failed. One report described how   |
| two men driving a truck watched as the object came near. The lights   |
| and engine failed, then the object passed directly over the vehicle   |
| with a sound like thunder and a rush of wind. The truck rocked from   |
| the blast and a lot of heat was felt. Later there were reports of     |
| apparently the same luminous object on the ground and taking off in   |
| other areas near Levelland. Reports of vehicle interference followed  |
| a similar pattern, with engines and lights returning to normal on the |
| departure of the object." (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to        |
| Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 419).                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1966 - In Parkersburg, West Virginia Mr. Woodrow Derenberger, a       |
| travelling salesman, saw a dark object ahead of him on the road. It   |
| was flat on the bottom and rounded on top. As he stopped the object   |
| came to within 20 cm of the road surface, and a man of dark           |
| complexion, dressed in a shirt and ordinary trousers that were both   |
| shiny blue in color, came out. He smiled at the witness who then      |
| thought that he received a telepathic message. The message described  |
| a hypothetical "other world" and suggested that the observation be    |
| reported to authorities. The man also promised to return. Several     |
| people who drove by the witness reported seeing a man speaking to     |
| him, as well as a strange vehicle nearby. (Source: Jacques Vallee,    |
| Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 804).                |
|                                                                       |
| 1966 - During the evening Mrs. Mark deFriend, age 32, saw an object   |
| at ground level in front of her car in El Campo, Texas on this rainy  |
| night. It would leave the road and fly over the fields from time to   |
| time. The greenish-blue object flew back in front of her car, and     |
| then was lost to sight behind some trees. (Source: Jacques Vallee,    |
| Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 803).                |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - A woman working in her kitchen late on this night in Point     |
| Pleasant, West Virginia heard a loud squeaking sound coming from      |
| outside. She looked out and saw a huge shadow spread across the       |
| grass, and then a figure described as tall, man-shaped, and gray in   |
| color appeared. It glided quickly across a field and disappeared into |
| the woods. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database      |
| 1967, case # 1405, citing John A. Keel, The Mothman Prophecies).      |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 9:30 p.m. two 23-year-old Navajo Indians, Guy Tossie and    |
| Willy Begay, were driving south of Ririe, Idaho when they were        |
| blinded by a flash of white light. Their car engine stalled and came  |
| to a stop and immediately ahead of them, hovering just five feet off  |
| the ground, they saw a domed disc-shaped UFO 6-8 feet in diameter and |
| perhaps three feet thick. On top was a transparent bubble dome,       |
| occupied by two small entities. The dome flipped open and one of the  |
| occupants floated out and to the ground, then approached the car.     |
| Through the UFO's flashing lights the men were able to see that the   |
| being was no more than three feet tall, and bald with ears set up     |
| high on his head. His facial skin looked scarred and wrinkled, "like  |
| a cantaloupe." His eyes were round and showed no pupils, and his      |
| mouth had lips so thin as to be barely visible. They saw no nose. He  |
| was wearing tight fitting coveralls and carried a pack on his back.   |
|                                                                       |
| To their horror, the being opened the car door and seated himself     |
| behind the wheel. Both of the men slid over to the right as far as    |
| they could as the car was towed, or driven, off the highway and out   |
| into a field of wheat stubble. As soon as the car's motion stopped a  |
| terrified Tossie jumped out of the right side of the car, and began   |
| running to the farmhouse of William Hammon a quarter of a mile away.  |
| As he ran, he found his shadow preceding him, as though a bright      |
| light were shining on him from behind. In the car, Begay cowered in   |
| the right side of the front seat as the little being attempted to     |
| communicate with him, twice saying something incomprehensible in a    |
| high, chirruping voice. Getting no response, the being got out of the |
| car and joined the second being, and then the two floated into the    |
| UFO which took off and zig-zagged into the sky as it departed.        |
|                                                                       |
| Ririe, Idaho Close Encounter - 1967                                   |
|                                                                       |

| At the Hammon farmhouse Tossie banged on the door screaming for help. |
| The farmer and Bob his son admitted him, and it took a period of time |
| to calm him sufficiently to get his story. By the time they           |
| accompanied him back to the field the object had departed and Begay   |
| was found in a state of near shock in the front seat. The farmer had  |
| to escort the youths by car their fear was so great. There were       |
| attendant sightings in the area, and cattle had been reportedly       |
| "spooked" on several farms that night. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted   |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1967-112,       |

| 1968 - During a thunderstorm, a medical doctor in southern France was |
| awakened at 3:55 a.m. by his crying 14-month-old son. He saw two      |
| luminous objects outside his house, and observed them coming close    |
| together and merging into one, about 180 meters away from his window. |
| A vertical beam of light was aimed at him for a second as the object  |
| tilted, and then the display vanished with a flash, leaving a slowly  |
| dissolving cloud. Persistent nightmares and various physiological     |
| phenomena, including identical triangular shaped red marks appearing  |
| on both the father's and son's lower abdomens, were later recorded.   |
| (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia, A Century of Landings,  |
| citing Aime Michel).                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1971 – A famous UFO close encounter leaving physical evidence         |
| occurred on this day at a farm one mile northeast of Delphos, Kansas. |
| Sixteen-year-old Ron Johnson was tending the family sheep with his    |
| dog at around seven p.m. when he saw a mushroom-shaped UFO appear in  |
| the night sky. The object was covered with multicolored lights on its |
| metallic surface. It hovered only a few feet above the ground only 75 |
| feet away from him in a sheep paddock. Ron estimated the craft's      |
| diameter at 6-8 feet.                                                 |
| The teenager tried to get a closer look but under the brilliant       |
| luminance he was not able to make out any additional details. He      |
| described the craft as making a loud sound, "like an old washing      |
| machine which vibrates." The glow from the bottom of the UFO          |
| increased as it began to shoot up into the sky. Ron was temporarily   |
| blinded by the brightness of the craft as it ascended. After he       |
| regained his sight and composure, he ran back to the family house to  |
| alert the others. The bright glow was now high in the sky, as it      |
| began to vanish from sight altogether.                                |
|                                                                       |
| Three family members came running around the side of the house to get |
| a glimpse of the unusual object. They were shocked to see a glowing   |
| ring on the ground, right under where the craft had hovered. Ron’s    |
| mother touched the surface of the ground around the glow, and said it |
| "felt strange, like a slick crust, as if the soil was crystallized."  |
| Her fingers went numb, like she had been given a local anesthetic.    |
| Seeing nothing else of the craft, the family finally went to bed for  |
| the night.                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| (Continued.) At dawn the family returned to the sight of the glowing ring and to   |
| their surprise, it was still there. The inside and outside of the     |
| ring were damp from a rain shower, but the ring itself was completely |
| dry. The ring had a crusty appearance, as though the rain had simply  |
| run off. Slightly over a month later, after a snow fall, the white    |
| ice had melted both inside and outside of the ring, but the ring      |
| itself maintained the snow drift. Investigators experimented with the |
| ring by removing snow from a section of it and pouring water on the   |
| exposed part. The soil would not allow water to pass through.         |
|                                                                       |
| Further experimentation showed the ground under the ring to be dry to |
| a depth of one foot. The ring itself was composed of a whitish        |
| substance, which was sent for laboratory analysis. The lab findings   |
| found that there were fibers in the soil of an organism called        |
| Actinomycetales actiniomycete nocardia, which is an intermediate      |
| organism between bacteria and fungus, and is “often found together    |
| with a fungus of the order Basidomycetes, which may fluoresce under   |
| certain conditions...” One possible interpretation is that            |
| high-energy stimulation triggered the spectacular growth of the       |
| Nocardia and of an existing fungus, and caused the latter to          |
| fluoresce.                                                            |
| Phosphorous may also have been baked out of the soil and may have     |
| been the substance that numbed Mrs. Johnson’s fingers when she        |
| touched the ground. The experience of Ron Johnson is still considered |
| one of the best documented "ground trace" UFO cases on record.        |
