| 1953 - At one o'clock in the afternoon a metallic dome shaped UFO     |
| maneuvered five feet above a hayfield in Santana dos Montes, Minas    |
| Gerais State, Brazil. Two 5.1 foot tall men jumped out. They had a    |
| shining ball on each of their square-toed shoes. There was a third    |
| occupant visible in the hatchway of the craft. One of the men had a   |
| cylinder that it pushed into ground, and withdrew. They then got back |
| into the craft and it flew away. The witness, Sr. M. Ramos Bessa, had |
| a severe headache after his close encounter. (Source: Coral & Jim     |

| six silver discs flew overhead, leaving a trail of red vapor. Some    |
| citizens were panicked. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to         |

| 1959 - At 1:30 p.m. a six-foot long shining cigar-shaped object flew  |
| over Adelaide, South Australia. It gave off a red glow. It was        |
| followed shortly by a six-foot square object, spinning and shining    |
| brightly in the daytime sky. At 8:00 p.m. another cigar-shaped UFO    |
| hovered over Dover, Ohio at 40 meters altitude. It was large, silent, |
| and had red, green and white lights on its surface. At about the same |
| time or shortly after eight p.m. a round orange object flew south of  |
| Rochester, New York. It made a crackling noise as it flew. A          |
| nocturnal light exited from the larger craft, and flew off quickly to |
| the west. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the Southern            |

| 1967 - At two o'clock in the morning a woman professional secretary   |
| driving down a road in New Richmond, Indiana had a close encounter    |
| with a bright, domed disc-shaped UFO. She described the object as     |
| looking like an inverted mushroom; it hovered over her car as she     |
| drove for 10-15 minutes. Her forward motion slowed, and she could not |
| make her car accelerate to get out from under the UFO. The object     |
| finally made an odd maneuver in the sky and flew away. (Source:       |

| 1967 - On this day in 1967 a strange little man entered the county           |
| courthouse in Athens, Ohio and asked for directions. He was           |
| fascinated with a ballpoint pen, as if he had never seen one before.  |

| 1968 - At five o'clock in the morning Ms. Emma Grimble, an early      |
| riser, was sweeping the upper hallway of her guest house home in      |
| Ashtabula, Ohio when she heard a commotion downstairs near the        |
| tenant's mailboxes. Yelling "Get away from those mailboxes!" she      |
| rushed downstairs but was dumbfounded to see two little men, greenish |
| yellow in color, clambering around the boxes and attaching themselves |
| to the wall by "suction cups on their hands and feet." They glistened |
| like metal, possibly wearing flexible, tight fitting metallic         |
| clothing. At her appearance the two little creatures rushed out the   |
| front door. She heard quite a loud scrambling around, as if there may |
| have been five or six of them. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted        |

| 1971 - On this night three small, fuzzy, round objects moved near a   |
| bridge and hovered over it as a car approached in Aberdeen,           |
| Washington. The engine of the car stopped, the radio had heavy        |
| interference, but the headlights remained on. The three objects,      |
| which were only about two feet in diameter, then rose slightly and    |
| drifted down the river quite slowly. The car could then be restarted. |

| 1973 - At 10 p.m. on this night in Blacksburg, South Carolina on      |
| Highway 43 a metallic domed disc chased a car at a very low altitude. |
| The car's headlights dimmed during the sighting. (Source: newspaper   |

| 1975 - There were several close encounter reports on this day for     |
| 1975 in Tasmania, over the English Channel, in Argentina, and in the  |
| U.S. Midwest. At 8:30 p.m. in Cape Girardeau, Missouri physicist      |
| Harley Rutledge and his wife had a close encounter with a 20-foot in  |
| diameter, semi-convex glowing domed disc, that rose from behind some  |
| trees. There was a dim yellow light coming from its dome. (Source:    |

| 1977 - At 9:30 a.m. a 24-year-old woman and her young sister were     |
| doing the wash next to their rural home that was near Carapito Beira  |
| Alta, Portugal. They saw on top of a nearby hill a strange looking    |
| bulky figure that was dark and motionless. It resembled an            |
| eight-foot-tall box with a round head on top and legs that appeared   |
| too thin towards the bottom. A strange sound, resembling several dogs |
| barking into a microphone, seemed to emanate from the figure. The two |
| witnesses became afraid and locked themselves in their house. They    |
| next heard a sound like someone was dragging something outside on the |
| sand path that encircled their house. The sound stopped at the edge   |
| of a nearby pine grove. This was too much for the 24-year-old woman,  |
| who suffered a nervous collapse. Investigators found a small          |
| radioactive spot at the foot of the hill, plus other ground traces in |
| evidence. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1977, |

| 1978 - The Stovold family was driving between Cadnam and              |
| Fordingbridge, in Hampshire, England in the late afternoon when they  |
| spotted a turreted disc-shaped object hovering just 300 feet over the |
| heath a short distance away. It had lights on the top of its dome.    |

| 1979 - At 11:15 p.m. a couple was crossing a roadway in Mirabello,    |
| Italy when they noticed a red beam of light on the ground. They got   |
| into their car and drove closer to get a better look. As they         |
| approached they perceived a strong burning smell, an odor like burnt  |
| human hair. The light resembled a pulsating vertical bar, red in      |
| color encircled by a round halo. As they got even closer they saw a   |
| human like figure walk in front of the light, and moments later a     |
| second figure walked from the opposite direction. As a result of the  |
| intense cold the witnesses had to leave the area. As they drove away  |
| they observed a similar but larger light on the ground in front of a  |
| nearby orchard. The light slowly pulsated. Again the witnesses had to |
| leave because of the cold weather. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales,       |

| 1979 - Mindalore, South Africa                                        |
|                                                                       |
| [Sketch of 1979 Mindalore, South Africa sighting]                     |

| 1979 - There were two incidents involving missing time or abductions  |
| on this day. The first occurred in Mindalore, South Africa. A man and |
| a woman were driving in foggy conditions near a mine at 11:50 p.m.    |
| They saw a gray cone-shaped craft with four legs that had landed, and |
| then experienced a 20-minute lapse of time, but they did recall       |
| witnessing humanoids associated with the craft. (Source: Cynthia      |
| Hind, MUFON UFO Journal, March 1979, p. 3).                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1979 - The second experience also occurred while driving. Mr.         |
| Filiberto Cardenas, age 45, was driving on Okeechobee Road just north |
| of Miami, Florida with three family friends when the car engine       |
| suddenly failed. He and another man got out of the car to check under |
| the hood when a large luminous object emitting a humming sound        |
| descended over the vehicle. The witness vanished in plain sight of    |
| the others, apparently taken up into the object by a beam of light.   |
|                                                                       |
| He was found dazed two hours later and 16 miles away from the         |
| original location by a police officer. Later he recalled being taken  |
| up and blacking out. He found himself onboard the object and three    |
| human-like beings all dressed in tight-fitting white suits took him   |
| to an ocean front setting where they opened a "lock" on a rock and    |
| entered through a tunnel beneath the sea. The beings were of average  |
| height, wearing outfits that covered their heads with winged          |
| snake-like emblems on their chests.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| They spoke to the witness in Spanish and mainly spoke about coming    |
| wars and disasters. He was led to a seat made out of stone and given  |
| a liquid to drink that tasted like honey. A huge door then opened in  |
| front of him and several persons came out. Cardenas began feeling a   |
| strong pressure in his chest and at this point an individual          |
| approached him and told him he was welcomed. The individual appeared  |
| totally human and spoke with a South American accent. Indeed this man |
| told Cardenas that he was from earth but had lived with               |
| extraterrestrials for a while now.                                    |
| He was then taken through a corridor into what appeared to be a great |
| city. He then entered a small room where he was suddenly sucked into  |
| the wall, which then flipped over and became a bed. Paralyzed, he was |
| unable to move and noticed several figures moving around him. As a    |
| light blinded him something was inserted into his ear. From the wall  |
| there emerged what looked like several arms ending in suction cups    |
| that covered his body. He felt no pain but could not move.            |
|                                                                       |
| After the examination he was taken to another room. There he saw a    |
| tall seat and on it was a tall man wearing a cape; he also saw        |
| numerous consoles and monitors. He was shown images of three pyramids |
| joined by a thin ray of light. Cardenas apparently slept several      |
| times and was awakened and given several tablets to eat. In another   |
| room he saw several human like figures wearing gray coveralls. In     |
| another room he saw a large gathering of people in what he thought    |
| was a "party".                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| Soon he was taken into another room where he saw a large rocket-style |
| ship in which he was taken along with three other humans. He was made |
| to sit on a suction-like seat. After a short trip he was made to exit |
| and given something to eat. He last saw the object disappear into the |
| distance. He was found disoriented by a police officer in an isolated |
| section of the city. A medical exam found 108 tiny pricks on his      |
| body. Days after the encounter he suffered from severe sweating,      |
| extreme thirst, extreme temperature changes, and a strong sulfur like |
| smell followed him, he also suffered from memory loss, decreased      |
| sexual appetite and strange time altering episodes. (Sources: Miami   |
