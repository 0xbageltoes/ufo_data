| family's fields in Coldwater, Kansas when he saw a little man no      |
| bigger than a 5-year-old child a few meters away from him. He had a   |
| long nose and long ears and seemed to fly or glide as he moved toward |
| a saucer-shaped craft hovering just two meters above ground. It       |
| "opened up" and the creature "popped inside." The craft became        |
| luminous and shot out of sight. Unusual traces were found by police.  |

| domed disc-shaped object approached to a close range, and then his    |
| engine coughed, sputtered, and finally died. There was a blue light   |
| coming from the translucent dome on the object. The witness also      |
| received an electric shock, and suffered temporary paralysis. He      |
| could not move or speak, and his body tingled like he had received an |
| electric shock. The buzzing diminished as the object descended and    |
| landed in a swampy area near some houses. The witness also experience |
| strong static electricity throughout the next day. (Sources: Mark     |

| he saw a mushroom-shaped craft on a playing field. It had a cupola on |
| top, and a guillotine-like door that slid up. The boy started to      |
| flee, but a voice in Portuguese told him, "Don't run away." He next   |
| saw two tall men, two meters in height, dressed in green              |
| tight-fitting uniforms. They told him not to be afraid and to return  |
| the next day, or "otherwise we will take your family." They had a     |
| greenish skin tone, and round eyes that were set wide apart.          |

| 1969 – At 5:00 p.m. a young boy saw a small silver object land close  |
| to him outside the town of Beauharnois, Quebec. Through a small hatch |
| two small, green colored humanoids emerged, these moved like robots   |
| and appeared to gather rocks and plants before returning to the       |
| object. The object then took off. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales,        |

| the West Palm Beach International Airport by FAA air traffic          |
| controller C. J. Fox and tracked for about an hour. NORAD was alerted |
| and at approximately 6:00 a.m. two F-106 jet interceptors were        |
| scrambled from West Palm Beach Airport, Florida to intercept the      |
| glowing UFO, but the object disappeared from the radar scopes shortly |
| before the jets arrived. FAA watch supervisor George Morales viewed   |
| the object through binoculars and described the object as silver      |
| white in color and cigar shaped. Officials at Miami International     |
| Airport also tracked the strange object. (Sources: NICAP UFO          |

| 1972 - At 10:45 p.m. two witnesses southeast of Sandoval, Illinois    |
| saw a UFO moving toward their car, about 45 feet up in the air. It    |
| had green and blue hazy lights and a huge red flickering light        |
| on top. It passed directly overhead, then came back and circled the   |

| saw a bright orange luminous object shaped like a truncated cone      |
| hovering at low altitude about 200 meters off the road, almost        |
| directly over an electric power station. The upper edge seemed jagged |
| and had sparkling antenna-like protrusions at either end. The object  |
| was dazzling to look at and seemed to be vibrating slightly. As they  |
| pulled abreast of the power station the object's luminosity           |
| diminished and it flew away, rising gradually in a slight curve and   |
| disappeared. (Sources: Dennis William Hauck, MUFON UFO Journal,       |

| miles west of Belden at around 10:00 p.m. when an object descended on |
| the highway ahead of him, directing a light beam on the road surface. |
| It looked like a tank with treads but without guns. As the witness    |
| stepped out of the car, a door opened on the object and a man stepped |
| out. He seemed normal, was dark haired, of normal height and wore     |
| white pants and a white shirt. He spoke to the witness by name, in    |
| perfect English, then re-entered the object, which rose up in a       |
| brilliant column of light emitting a high pitched whine as it left.   |

| Italy watched a sphere with luminous rays as it hovered for ten       |
| minutes over the ocean, then shot away fast. (Source: Lumieres dans   |

| 1979 - On this night a beam of light shone through the witness's      |
| bedroom window in Oakenholt, Wales and she suddenly felt dizzy. She   |
| then felt herself being levitated through some form of a tunnel and   |
| encountered two aliens in a field. A huge craft hovered nearby and a  |
| beam of light lifted her inside. The interior of the craft consisted  |
| of one large room with three other alien beings and an almost human   |
| appearing girl of about 19 years of age. The room contained a         |
| portrait of an older being, apparently a leader. After a 30 minute    |
| otherworldly trip the beings showed her an alien zoo with many        |
| bizarre animals. The beings communicated with the witness and then    |
| said goodbye, whereupon she then found herself back in her bed again. |

| 1979 - Two women in Canoga Park, California witnessed a disc-shaped   |

| 75-100 feet away and at 75-100 feet altitude. It had two rows of      |
| steady blue lights on the underside, with 11 lights in each row. The  |
| object was described as blacker than black. Its speed was very slow,  |
| moving at about 15 mph. (Source: Michael Rigg, MUFON field            |

| 12-year-old son. (Sources: Carol & Rex Salisberry,MUFON field         |

| 1998 - At a little before sunset two women were sitting on the        |
| balcony of a house belonging to one of them, at Markou Mousourou      |
| Street in the Metz neighborhood of Athens, Greece opposite Ardittos   |
| hill. They saw a small black object in the sky about one kilometer    |
| away. They first thought it might be a helicopter but it made no      |
| sound. When the object approached, they saw it was a humanoid figure  |
| in a standing position. It flew closer and the flying humanoid turned |
| its body once in the direction of nearby Zappeio park and then once   |
| in the opposite direction, without changing speed or posture. It      |
| started coming down and seemed to land somewhere inside the forest on |
| Ardittos hill. They thought that the flying creature was wearing      |
| something like an "astronaut suit" because from time to time the      |
| sunset light gleamed on it. After landing the figure went up the hill |
| by making some small mechanical "hops," until it reached a point just |
| below the crest. It did not bend its knees when it hopped nor did it  |
| move its arms. After ten minutes the creature transformed itself into |
| a "bright spot" and then vanished. During the incident, there was a   |
| strong wind blowing but the movement of the creature's flight was     |
| steady. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1998,   |

| 2003 - At ten o'clock in the morning a dark grey disc-shaped object   |
| hung 100 feet over the water at the Wivenhoe Dam in Brisbane Valley,  |
| Queensland, Australia on a clear day. The water below the disc was    |
| being agitated by the UFO's presence. The craft took off at an angle  |
| at an incredible speed. The sighting lasted ten minutes and was       |
| witnessed by a Mr. & Mrs. Thompson. (Source: Australasian Ufologist,  |

| 2005 - A cigar-shaped UFO flew to the south over Guaynabo, Bayamon    |
| province, Puerto Rico at 7:06 a.m. It was the size of a commercial    |
| jet, but had no wings. Its polished silver surface reflected the      |
| sunlight. It was lost from sight when the craft passed into           |
| some cumulus clouds.Duration of the sighting was 15 to 20 seconds.    |

| 2007 - At 10:30 p.m. a round orange light descended from the sky over |
| Saint-Anaclet, Quebec, Canada, then stopped. It flew off after 90     |

| 2009 - At 10:15 p.m. a man who wishes to remain anonymous was driving |
| north on Hudson Drive, Stow, Ohio on his way to work when he spotted  |
| a 9 to 10 foot tall solid black entity standing on the southbound     |
| side of the road, near the Rte 8 overpass and just north of the local |
| Applebee's restaurant. It was only about fifteen to twenty feet from  |
| his vehicle as he drove by. The creature had no discernable head or   |
| facial figures. Looking back in his rearview mirrow the entity was no |
| longer visible, and the entire sighting lasted only about five        |
| seconds. The witness became extremely upset, and he had uncontrolled  |
| watering of his eyes; he tried to call his wife on his cell phone,    |
| but it would not work, either from the programmed address book or     |
| with manual input calling. He kept getting "call failed", which had   |
| never happened before. The cell phone failed to connect all the way   |
| to the I-271 entrance ramp, a distance of 8-10 miles. The following   |
| day, on his way home from work, as he neared the Rte 8 overpass, this |
| time driving over the bridge, his eyes began to tear up               |
| uncontrollably again until he got beyone the bridge, when his eyes    |
| began to clear up.  (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2009 Humanoid         |
