| 1949 - Over the town of Winchendon, Massachusetts a cigar-shaped UFO  |
| emitted a cloud of smoke. It flew from the northwest to the southeast |
| slowly, and then disappeared. The sighting lasted 15 minutes and the  |
| report was made by two men named Peckham and Clements. (Sources:      |

| 1949 - Southeast of Lexington, Nebraska three ovoid objects, about    |
| four meters in size, flew toward the northeast at 6:40 p.m. Two of    |
| the objects left trails of sparks. There were five witnesses, and the |
| report was made by someone named Wolfe. (Sources: Project Blue Book   |

| 1952 - In the Atlantic Ocean 400 miles NNW of the Azores Islands.     |
| 11:16 p.m. The pilot, copilot, engineer and aircraft commander of an  |
| USAF C-124 transport plane reported observing two distinct green      |
| lights to the right and slightly above the C-124 at 11:16 p.m. At one |
| point the lights seemed to turn toward their aircraft. The lights     |
| alternated leading each other during the aerial encounter, which went |
| on for more than one hour of observation. (Sources: Project Blue Book |

| 1954 - Hearing her dogs barking and howling at 2:30 p.m., Ms. Lucette |
| Leboeuf of Chabeuil, Drome, France saw what first resembled a         |
| "scarecrow" in a cornfield. After approaching to within eight feet    |
| she saw it to be a "diving suit" of transparent plastic, 3.5 feet     |
| high. A little man with large eyes was inside, resembling "a child in |
| a plastic bag, with eyes larger than human eyes." She could see no    |
| arms on the creature. When he began waddling toward her she fled. A   |
| flat, circular four meter wide disc was seen to rise up making a      |
| whistling sound and fly away toward the northeast. An eleven foot     |
| wide circle of crushed foliage was found at the site. Ms. Leboeuf was |
| in a state of shock and was in bed for the next two days. (Sources:   |

| 1954 - A disc-shaped object maneuvered around the sky and then        |
| hovered over a radio station on a mountain peak in Col-de-Chat,       |
| Savoie department, France at 5:14 p.m. There were 15 witnesses, and   |
| the sighting lasted at least 4 minutes. A photograph was taken.       |

| 1954 - One minute after the radio station sighting a short humanoid   |
| in a diver suit was seen by a Mr. Guyard at the Challes Airport in    |
| Savoie department, France. The being waddled quickly toward and got   |
| into a saucer-shaped craft. A ten-foot circle was found at the        |
| landing site. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight   |

| 1959 - On this night a Russian military aircraft reportedly spotted   |
| from the air the crash site of a large disc-shaped craft not far from |
| Moscow, Russia. The object appeared to be smoldering and it was       |
| shattered with one large piece broken off. The largest section of the |
| craft was transported by helicopter to a nearby airfield at           |
| Aktyubinsk. It was badly damaged by some kind of explosion and fire,  |
| and the inside was completely charred. Noticeable radiation was       |
| detected at the crash site, where among the remaining wreakage was    |
| discovered the fragments of the body of a dwarf humanoid, perhaps 80  |
| cm tall. Fragments of the craft were transported to different secret  |
| scientific research locations and the body was allegedly taken to an  |
| underground bunker in Moscow. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |

| 1962 - On a farm near Capay, Glenn County, California at 9:45 p.m. a  |
| man named Gray sighted a silent ovoid object hovering just eight      |
| meters above an alfalfa field. It had blunt ends. It ascended to a    |
| higher altitude and then flew away toward the southwest. (Sources:    |

| 1963 - At 4:20 a.m. a police officer and eight others in Sunnyvale,   |
| California observed a gray disc-shaped object with a central bright   |
| spot, moving on a westerly course at high speed. (Source: Richard     |

| 1967 - In the middle of the afternoon a woman was alone in her house  |
| in Seaford, Long Island, New York when she heard a loud humming sound |
| coming from outside. Looking out the window, she saw a hovering       |
| silvery disc-shaped object, perfectly smooth without any visible      |
| openings. While she was watching her doorbell rang. When she answered |
| the door she was confronted by a tall dark woman wearing a shimmering |
| long gray gown. The woman asked her some questions, apparently        |
| confusing her for somebody else. She then asked for a glass of water  |
| and salt, claiming that she had to take a pill. When she left she     |
| walked away into the bushes, and moments later the humming sound got  |
| louder then the disc rose up and shot up into the sky. (Source:       |

| 1967 - That night at the Da Baleia Hospital, Minas Gerais, Brazil a   |
| sixteen-year-old boy named Diniz had a humanoid encounter with a      |
| being from a disc-shaped UFO. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,                |

| 1973 - A Spanish Air Force Mirage jet was flying at 20,000 feet 24    |
| nautical miles offshore of Valencia, Spain at 8:24 p.m. when an       |
| intensely white UFO paced their aircraft briefly. The two Spanish     |
| A.F. captains said that the object changed color from white to red,   |
| and matched their descent from 20000 feet to 7000 feet. A weak radar  |
| return matched the maneuvers of the UFO described by the pilot.       |
| (Source: UNICAT, case # 822, citing Spanish Air Force).               |

| 1973 - The main witness was a young woman who was walking through a   |
| local park in Actinolite, Ontario, Canada along with some friends     |
| during the evening when a strange heavy mist enveloped the area. They |
| saw what seemed to be a silvery glow coming from the center of the    |
| mist. and the witness felt strongly attracted to it. As she got       |
| closer she saw a beautiful silvery object on the ground. She          |
| described it as a "starship." She went inside the object and saw      |
| several of her friends being led towards different sections of the    |
| craft. She was taken to a large circular room of a transparent blue   |
| color with two transparent doors at each end. The occupants of the    |
| UFO were all apparently human or human-like beings and beautiful in   |
| appearance. Through a large window she saw a woman sitting at a       |
| communications console. The witness sat on a chair in the center of   |
| the room and ate from a bowl of fruit on a table. A man entered the   |
| room and walked into what appeared to be a circular shower stall and  |
| removed some dirty coveralls. When the stall lit up the man then      |
| emerged wearing shiny clean coveralls. The witness felt that she had  |
| experienced some type of mind control onboard the object, which       |
| changed her life. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact        |

| 1973 - On this night a local DJ and four others saw a tall creature   |
| with pointed ears, a hooked nose, a gray face, and red glowing eyes   |
| in the woods along highway 701 in Sidney, North Carolina. It was      |
| dressed in a brown shirt, black pants, and wore a small brown cap and |
| some kind of medallion on its chest. It walked with a limp and was    |
| missing one hand. Someone fired five or six shots at the creature     |
| with no apparent effect. (Sources: David F. Wedd & Ted Bloecher,      |

| 1974 - At ten p.m. on a farm in Lynchburg, Ohio two men watched a     |
| hovering UFO pulsing different colors. The witnesses shone a light on |
| the UFO, and the UFO beamed back a red beam of light. Their dogs were |
| frantically barking during the encounter, which lasted about five     |
| minutes. (Sources: Leonard Stringfield, CUFOS case files; Leonard H.  |

| 1975 - In Asservent, near Maubeuge, France a very large disc-shaped   |
| object was watched by some 12 witnesses at 9:30 p.m. This disc was    |
| only 20 meters from the ground. A cone-shaped object detached from it |
| and rose vertically. Eight photographs were taken. (Source: Richard   |

| 1977 - At 7:36 a.m. a woman named Cater was driving by a pasture in   |
| Minehead, England near Kilve on highway A39 in Somerset with she      |
| noticed fog and a floating gray, egg-shaped mass above a hedge. The   |
| cows in the nearby field were acting very disturbed. Her skin         |
| prickled as if she had entered an electrostatically charged energy    |
| field and she heard a humming sound. When she checked the time 12     |
| minutes had passed but it seemed it should have been a much briefer   |
| experience. (Source: Jenny Randles, Time Storms: Amazing Evidence for |

| 1977 - At 8:10 p.m. five silent disc-shaped object flew along some    |
| power lines in Griselles, France. One of the UFOs shot away very      |
| quickly. An electric oven stopped working when the UFOs approached.   |

| 1978 - At 12:05 p.m. a domed disc giving off a dim glow through       |
| openings around its perimeter was sighted by a 19-year-old female     |
| grocery worker driving near the Lunn River in Strongsville, Ohio. The |
| sighting lasted over two minutes, during which there were 15 seconds  |
| of FM radio static and her car's lights went out for one second. When |
| the UFO flew close to the witness's car she reported it felt like     |
| someone was watching her. (Sources: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports       |

| 1978 - On this night Alejandro Hernandez and his 13-year-old son had  |
| gone for a drive southeast of Santiago, Chile. Hernandez felt an odd  |
| sensation that slowed the car down. When he looked out the car window |
| he saw a hovering UFO nearby. A hatch opened on bottom of the object  |
| and their vehicle and its two occupants was elevated up into the      |
| craft. Inside, five short humanoid beings surrounded by a bright      |
| light approached them. One of them spoke in a metallic voice and      |
| ordered them to exit the vehicle. Once outside the car they saw       |
| numerous devices with red and orange lights. When they asked the      |
| UFOnauts where they were from, they remained silent but all pointed   |
| upwards. After ten minutes both witnesses were deposited back on the  |
| ground. There apparently were other witnesses to their abduction.     |

| 1979 - At 5:00 p.m. a witness in Monsey, New York watched a           |
| saucer-shaped craft hover above some nearby power lines. The craft    |
| emitted a soft humming sound and was about 35 feet in diameter. On    |
| the bottom of the object there was a ring of rotating colored lights. |
| On the upper section was a circular row of windows, and at the top    |
| was an antenna like projection. The witness stood about 80 feet away  |
| and was able to see shadowy figures appearing at the windows. The UFO |
| then flew straight up and away at incredible speed. (Source: Albert   |

| 1980 - In Blythe, Riverside County, California at 2:26 p.m. a         |
| luminous Saturn-shaped UFO passed directly over the house of a        |
| 20-year-old female witness. The craft flew slowly, stopped briefly in |
| in the west, and finally shot straight up out of sight. The witness   |
| was badly frightened, and claimed to have a headache and sore-throat  |
| from her encounter; her symptoms were gone the next day. (Source:     |

| 1989 - A young witness saw an object with portholes on the ground in  |
| Voronezh, Russia at 7:00 p.m. A figure more than three meters tall    |
| emerged from it. The entity had two large eyes on its head and a red  |
| light on top. On its chest it had a silvery disk with three round     |
| spots of different colors. Below that it had a rectangular box that   |
| protruded out. The being also wore large silvery boots. (Source:      |

| 1996 - A man was lying in his bed in Cowen, Webster County, West      |
| Virginia when, at 2:39 a.m., he heard a loud noise resembling an      |
| approaching train. It was so loud that the house shook. Next, there   |
| was a bright light that lit up the sky, and it moved over his house   |
| to hover over the porch. Looking out his bedroom window, he saw a     |
| dark figure standing outside on the ground. Terrified, he closed his  |
| eyes, and when he opened them he found himself floating above the     |
| hedge outside his house. Looking up, he saw an arrangement of red,    |
| blue, yellow, and white lights on the bottom of the UFO. In the       |
| middle of the object there appeared to be a glowing door-shaped       |
| entrance. He screamed and lost consciousness. He only remembers       |

| 1996 - In Valley, Alabama a farmer photographed a dark thimble-shaped |
| UFO at 2:30 p.m. His dog howled and ran off. Later, unmarked copters  |
| were seen following the UFO. (Source: Joseph Trainor, UFO Roundup,    |

| 1997 - In Penuelas, Puerto Rico Ivan Rivero Morales and several other |
| witnesses watched an object flying around a nearby mountaintop for    |
| about an hour starting at around 10:00 p.m. It then landed on the     |
| summit. The intensity of its light diminished to a soft amber glow,   |
| which it retained throughout the duration of its landing. With the    |
| aid of binoculars and telescopes, the witnesses watched a number of   |
| tall beings walking around for another hour. They were described as a |
| greenish color with large oval-shaped heads, black eyes, pointed ears |
| and protruding bellies. The beings re-entered the craft and its       |
| brilliance increased, and it then vanished in a matter of seconds.    |

| Taylorville, Utah beginning at 9:15 p.m. MDT. They moved slowly and   |
| then hovered, staying in straight lines. A low humming sound was      |
| heard during the event, which lasted for about an hour. At about the  |
| same time, at 8:21 p.m. PDT, 4 or 5 rectangles connected by a thin    |
| filament were seen moving over Wheeler Springs in Ojai, California.   |
