| 1950 - At 9:00 a.m. a U.S. Air Force F-86 Sabre jet had an encounter  |
| with a flat oval-shaped object near Plymouth, Massachusetts. The      |
| object was light brown in color, climbed away from the jet, and at    |
| 28,000 feet turned and flew away. At 8:25 p.m. a huge reddish-orange  |
| disc passed a TWA DC-3 airliner being flown over South Bend, Indiana  |
| by the crew named Adickes, Manning, and Hinshaw. The UFO approached   |
| the plane from below and behind, overtaking the aircraft, then moved  |
| rapidly away when the pilot attempted a closer approach. (Sources:    |

| 1960 - Mr. N. N., a painter, was driving from Slagelse to Naestved,   |
| Denmark at around 3:00 a.m. when his car engine and lights died. His  |
| car stopped twenty feet from a green glowing thirty-foot wide domed   |
| disc. The object was shaped like two bowls edge-to-edge, had a        |
| shining stripe of light around its center, three portholes, three     |
| legs for landing gear, and a central column. It also made a humming   |
| sound. Four three-foot tall entities in luminous green costumes       |
| emerged. Their uniforms had three dark vertical marks on the chest.   |

| 1961 - On this morning a bluish green oval object, the size of a      |
| jetliner, landed on Lake Onega in Karelia, Russia and broke through   |
| the ice. It was heading toward the east when it came down and created |
| a trench 50 feet long and 10 feet deep in the lake bed. There was a   |
| great deal of disturbed mud, and odd fragments were also found at the |
| site. The sample residue was analyzed and showed the presence of the  |
| elements magnesium, aluminum, calcium, barium, and titanium. There    |
| were at least 25 witnesses to the crash landing. (Sources: Jacques    |

| 1998 - At 8 o'clock in the evening Ursulina, the main witness, and    |

| State, Brazil when they heard a noise that sounded like someone       |
| trying to open the rear door to their house. Their cat was also       |
| acting very agitated. Her husband, Francisco, went to investigate     |
| while Ursulina remained behind in bed praying. Soon she heard a sound |
| resembling a radio being tuned and then a bright blue light invaded   |
| the bedroom. Looking towards the door of the bedroom she saw a        |
| strange creature standing there. She described the entity as being    |
| about 1.5 meters in height, with a huge head not in proportion to the |
| rest of the body, wide shoulders, a very thin waist, and long         |
| dangling arms. It was hairless, had huge black eyes, a small lipless  |
| mouth, and little "bumps" where the nose should have been. She        |
| described the clothing as a brown tight-fitting coverall, with belts  |
| and boots. The entity stared intently at Ursulina. Despite her terror |
| she managed to ask the entity what it wanted. She heard an            |
| unintelligible reply and then screamed for her husband. At that same  |
| instant the creature ran out the door and disappeared down the        |
| corridor. Her husband apparently was able to see the figure run from  |
| the bedroom. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |
