| 1947 - According to files released by the FBI through FOIA requests   |
| in the 1970s, at 10:40 a.m. at least two crescent-shaped objects      |
| zig-zagged past a military aircraft twice while the plane was flying  |
| near Guam over the Pacific Ocean. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, December   |

| 1947 - At around nine o'clock in the morning R. L. Johannis of Raveo, |
| Italy saw a 10 meter wide, red domed, disc-shaped object with an      |
| antenna on top, on the ground across an ice field. There were two     |
| dwarfs less than three feet tall near the craft, wearing dark blue    |
| coveralls with red collars and belts. They had oversized heads and    |
| greenish toned faces. Their eyes were huge, without eyelashes or      |
| eyebrows but surrounded by some kind of ring-like muscle. The beings  |
| had greenish hands with eight talon-like fingers. They wore something |
| similar to crash helmets. When he waved his ice axe at them in a      |
| friendly gesture, one of the beings discharged a thin puff of smoke   |
| or "vapor" at him which knocked him down, and the witness started to  |
| suffocate, feeling at the same time a strong electrical               |
| discharge. (Sources: Solas Boncompagni, UFO in Italia, Volume I,      |

| diameter, metallic saucer with legs landed on a farm in Voghenza,     |

| gestured to each other. They later got back aboard and took off,      |
| flying off toward the northeast. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer     |

| she was left with scratches and brushes. A shiny round object was     |
| seen in the sky across the river a few minutes later. (Sources:       |

| buzzed a Varig Airlines C-47 flying near Joinville, Santa Catarina    |
| province, Brazil. It caused temporary disruption of the performance   |
| of the engines and the electrical system. The reception of the        |
| airplane's radio was suddenly interrupted when the red disc           |
| approached the plane, while the cabin lights also dimmed. (Sources:   |

| 1965 - On this day on the banks of the river in Cruzeiro, Santa       |
| Catarina province, Brazil, a little man only 28" tall, introduced     |
| himself to a fisherman named Joao do Rio as a UFOnaut. He had large   |
| luminous eyes, and spoke perfect Portuguese. He gave Sr. do Rio an    |
| "unearthly" metal. The metal was given to the national railroad car   |
| factory for analysis. At 8:00 p.m. that same evening a motorist had a |
| close encounter with a black, 90-meter-wide domed disc, which hovered |
| silently over a highway southwest of Itabira, Minas Gerais province,  |
| Brazil. The craft hovered just 1.2 meters above the surface of the    |
| road, and it followed the contours of the terrain when it departed.   |

| 1965 - At around 10:00 p.m. two youngsters, Marc & Luc Lafreniere,    |
| were in their home in Ville Lemoyne, Quebec, Canada when a strong     |
| light attracted them to the window. Looking outside they saw a large  |
| oval-shaped craft floating just above the ground. A tall humanoid     |
| figure with long dangling arms, and wearing a silvery jumpsuit, stood |
| in front of the craft. The being walked towards the house and touched |
| the front door briefly, and then returned to the craft, while the     |
| terrified witnesses hid in their room. They did not dare look to see  |
| the craft or the alien depart. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1965       |

| 1965 - At 11:00 p.m. five people driving in a car in Salto, Uruguay   |
| heard a loud hum and saw a UFO land directly in front of their car,   |
| causing the engine to stall. Its brilliant white luminescence changed |
| colors from red to yellow and green. The object itself, a leaden      |
| metallic color, stood nine feet high and was as wide as the road.     |
| Three beings inside the craft, who looked human, were illuminated by  |
| an interior green light and could be seen moving around inside the    |
| craft. Finally, with a burst of orange flame, the object rose         |
| vertically into the sky and vanished. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted    |

| Brunswick, Canada an unidentified woman from St. Charles, New         |
| Brunswick reported sighting a similar figure in the woods near the    |

| with the encounters. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |

| altitude near the shoreline, then divided into two parts. One part    |
| rose into the sky, while the other dropped down into the sea.         |

| the Greengate Mall two men taking a short-cut behind the Mall         |
| observed a huge, gorilla-like creature run across the                 |
| railroad tracks. The creature was said to be about 40 feet away, and  |
| the presence of a strong odor at the same time was noted. A           |
| bloodhound team searched the area, but found nothing. A cigar-shaped  |
| UFO was seen in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that same night at 9:35 p.m. |

| 1999 - At 11:30 p.m. Sr. Attilio B. of Bassano del Grappa, Italy had  |
| gone out to the field next to his home in order to relieve himself    |
| when he noticed some nearby multicolored lights coming from a field   |
| behind him. Investigating more closely, he saw a very large circular  |
| object hovering about two meters off the ground. The craft was        |
| somewhat turtle shaped, and was about 30 meters in diameter. The top  |
| part of the object was completely transparent, so much so that it     |
| appeared almost "invisible". The lower part consisted of a green      |
| platform that had a hollow central section, like a donut. He could    |
| not see any instruments inside the craft, but he could see five       |
| occupants inside a well-lit white dome. He described them as short in |
| stature, about 80 cm tall, with large heads. According to the         |
| witness, their heads somewhat resembled those of donkeys, because     |
| they had extremely long faces and their heads were covered with short |
| black, curly hair. They had large round black eyes about 5 cm in      |
| diameter that were very close together. Their noses were large and    |
| "potato" like. Their mouths were large and wide, resembling those of  |
| a monkey, with large meaty lips. On each side of their heads were two |
| large pointy ears, like those of a wolf. Their skin was light brown   |
| in color and their hands had six digits. As the witness watched, one  |
| of the humanoids made a gesture, which he interpreted as a salute.    |
| The humanoids wore tight-fitting yellow outfits that went up to their |
| short necks. Their footgear resembled pointy sandals, similar to      |
| those worn by "Gondoliers." He continued his observation, feeling a   |
| sense of "joy and tranquility." He believed that the humanoids were   |
| gentle and kind. One of the humanoids seemed to be counting some      |
| yellow paper-like objects resembling banknotes. The whole incident    |
| unfolded in complete silence. After about a minute and a half, the    |
| object lifted up vertically, disappearing from the area at very high  |
| speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1999 Humanoid Reports database,    |

| 2001 - Starting at 10:45 p.m. and for the next 15 minutes, twelve     |
| white objects were seen performing maneuvers over Strathroy, Ontario, |
| Canada. They were first seen in a triangle, which then formed into a  |
| circle, and they performed aerial aerobatics for the next several     |
| minutes. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 2001 Canadian UFO Survey Report,     |

| 2009 - A huge triangle-shaped object with spectacular lights was seen |

| around 10 p.m. According to the witness, it was at a low              |

| 500 feet away. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting       |
