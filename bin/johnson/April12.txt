| 1897 - A few days before the crescendo in a wave of "airship"          |
| sightings across the United States and Canada, there were 65 reports  |
| of "airships" on this day, including 25 in Illinois alone. Below are  |
| summarized two of the more interesting close encounter cases.         |
|                                                                       |
| 1897 - Nilwood, Illinois - At 2:30 p.m. on the property of Z.         |
| Thacker, 19 kilometers north of Carlinville, an unknown object        |
| landed. Before Edward Teeples, William Street and Franklin Metcalf    |
| could reach it, the craft, which was shaped like a cigar with a dome, |
| rose slowly and left toward the north. (Source: Jacques Vallee,       |

| 1897 -  At 6 p.m. a large crowd of miners in Girard, near Green       |
| Ridge, Illinois saw an unknown object land three kilometers north of  |
| Green Ridge and 4 km south of Girard. The night operator of the       |
| Chicago and Alton Railroad, Paul McCramer, stated that he came close  |
| enough to the craft to see a man emerge from it to repair the         |
| machinery. Traces were found over a large area. The object was        |
| elongated like a ship, with a roof and a double canopy. It left       |
| toward the north. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A     |
| Century of Landings, p. 182, citing the Chicago Times-Herald, April   |

| 1952 - North Bay, Ontario, Canada. At 9:30 p.m. Royal Canadian Air    |
| Force Warrant Officer E. H. Rossell and Flight Sgt. R. McRae sighted  |
| a round amber object that flew fast, stopped, reversed direction, and |
| climbed away at a 30-degree angle during the two-minute observation.  |
| They said it with terrific speed, twice the speed of an F-86.         |

| 1953 - At 10:31 local time an unidentified target appeared on the     |
| radar scope at Torbat Airport, Newfoundland, Canada. It was on a      |
| magnetic course of approximately 270 degrees. One of the radar        |
| operators looked outside and saw what he thought was a B-29 aircraft, |
| but when the object disappeared, he returned to the radar set and     |
| observed the object make a 180 degree turn 8 miles west of the        |
| airport. If fade from the radar scope 30 miles away in a northeast    |
| direction. (Source: www.nicap.org/waves/1953fullrep.htm citing Dan    |

| 1953 - At 3:10 p.m., while flying over Sweetwater, Nevada in a USAF   |
| C-47 transport 80 miles southwest of Reno, USAF Major Padelford, Lt.  |
| White and Lt. Cripe, the pilot, co-pilot, and navigator, sighted 9-10 |
| flat, darkish metallic discs flying against the terrain. They were    |
| flying enroute from Long Beach to Stead AFB, NV at an altitude of     |
| 10,500 feet. They described the discs as having fuzzy edges, as they  |
| flashed beneath their aircraft descending. The co-pilot took control  |
| of the C-47, and turned to the right in a tight 300 degree turn for a |
| better view of the objects. The objects were then picked up           |
| unassisted by two more members of the crew. The objects were observed |
| in a right turn of greater radius than that of the C-47, and at a     |
| lower altitude. The object were observed for approximately 120        |
| degrees of their turn, and disappeared on a heading of 300 degrees.   |
| The observers were unable to estimate the speed of the objects        |
| because of the distance and the objects'' large radius of             |
| turn. (Sources: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. 1953: March-July, p. |

| 1953 -  At 10:00 p.m. miners in Coniston, Ontario, Canada watched as  |
| a glowing cigar-shaped object hovered over their smelter in a light   |
| wind. Over the next several minutes in began to shrink and it changed |
| color. The duration of the sighting was 20 minutes. (Source: APRO     |

| 1957 - At 8:00 a.m. an odd cone-shaped UFO descended to the side of   |
| highway N562 in Figanieres, Var, France, causing the engine of the    |
| witness's car to stall. Vegetation at the site was later found to be  |
| dead. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, August 1972).                   |

| 1958 - On this night university professor Dr. Garron and his wife     |
| were in Tabladitas, Jujuy Province, Argentina when they watched a 30  |
| meter luminous object descend to ground level. It had a halo; it      |
| turned and flew off to the east. (Sources: Uriondo Oscar A. Uriondo,  |

| 1960 - LaCamp, Louisiana. At 9:00 p.m. Monroe Arnold, a physical      |
| scientist, saw a fiery-red disc that made a rumbling sound and        |
| exploded four or five times while flying through the sky for two to   |
| three seconds.  It plowed through trees, struck the ground, bounced   |
| nine times, and resulted in explosions and flames. It left behind     |
| nine ground scars. An analysis of paint samples from the explosion    |
| proved inconclusive. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO     |

| 1966 - At 7:45 p.m. EST witnesses in Dorchester, Massachusetts        |
| reported a low-flying oval object with a dome on top and colored      |
| lights around its perimeter, circling over a schoolhouse and bobbing  |
| up and down. There was a coincident power failure (EM effects) in     |
| nearby Roxbury. At 10:00 p.m. EST an elongated elliptical (or         |
| cigar-like) object with a bright red-orange light at each end was     |
| seen hovering off Route 24 in Brockton, Massachusetts. (Sources:      |

| 1967 - In Toronto, Ontario, Canada at 8:15 p.m. four lens-shaped      |
| discs with flashing lights on their rims circled a group of about 20  |
| witnesses. Two of the object shot away on approach of an airplane.    |
| There were also sightings in Rice Lake, and Scarborough, Ontario and  |
| a close encounter in Richmond Hill, Ontario. (Sources: NICAP files,   |

| 1967 - In North Granby, Connecticut at 8:30 p.m. three witnesses saw  |
| a glowing, red-orange, bowl-shaped object emitting a "painfully"      |
| bright light. It made rapid motions for five minutes, and a rod       |
| extended from object. It shot away. (Sources: NICAP files; Richard H. |

| 1967 - Also at 8:30 p.m. six members of a team doing underwater film  |
| work for ABC News saw five bright white lights in formation while     |
| near the Coastal Keys Highway off of Key Largo, Florida. The lights   |
| pulsated bright-and-dim on a half-second cycle, and maneuvered around |
| each other as they passed overhead at about 200 feet altitude. The    |
| witnesses, in two 16-foot boats in windy weather with choppy waves,   |
| included a former aircraft carrier pilot, two former submarine        |
| sailors, and a boat captain guide. (Source: Letter to Herb Roth, May  |

| 1967 - At 8:59 p.m. in Phoenix, Arizona a close encounter occurred    |
| when a bell-shaped object buzzed a car with three witnesses; it       |
| banked, turned, and then flew away. The engine of the car was         |
| affected. (Sources: Project Blue Book files; Mark Rodeghier, UFOs     |

| 1967 - At 9:00 p.m. in Vienna, West Virginia two blobs of light       |
| maneuvered over the TV towers of WTAP-TV; a truncated cone of light   |
| searched the ground. (Source: APRO Bulletin, May-June 1967, p. 11).   |

| 1967 - At 10:10 p.m. in Hackettstown, New Jersey near a fish          |
| hatchery, five witnesses including a police officer had a UFO         |
| encounter lasting over an hour that involved an animal reaction. They |
| watched a revolving object with a red light in the middle, green      |
| lights on both ends, and white lights on the bottom. The object left  |
| a white trail, and it started and stopped many times, becoming all    |
| white when not moving. (Source: Berthold E. Schwarz, FSR, March 1971, |

| 1968 - A cluster of multicolored lights hovered, blinking red to      |
| orange to blue, in Hamilton, Massachusetts at 10:15 p.m. They shot    |
| upward out of sight. (Source: Raymond Fowler, UFOs: Interplanetary    |

| 1969 - At noon several Swedish Air Force personnel sighted seven      |
| balloon or disc-shaped UFOs; the objects hovered over Rissala AFB,    |
| Sweden and there was reported to be radar confirmation of the         |
| sighting. (Sources: Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p.  |

| 1969 - A former-schoolmistress was exercising her dog in some fields  |
| between Bridgeworth and Shrewsbury, England at about 6:30 p.m. when   |
| she observed a top-shaped object on the far side of a hedge, It stood |
| about three meters high and was resting on gray colored legs. Around  |
| the object she saw three beings about the size of 11-year-old         |
| children. They had pear shaped heads and appeared to be lacking       |
| hands. They wore black outfits with white belts. Despite their        |
| apparent lack of hands they were collecting samples from the ground   |
| that they placed on the side of the object. The specimens seemed to   |
| disappear into the solid craft. The woman's dog fled the scene at the |
| outset of her encounter. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,     |

| 1973 - At 10:30 p.m. An orange ball of light was observed from a      |
| Cessna 150 by physicist Harvy Rutledge and one other witness at 2500  |
| feet flying southeast of Piedmont, Missouri. The orange ball of light |
| appeared on the slope of Clark's Mountain, and disappeared when the   |
| aircraft turned toward it. A simultaneously identical light appeared  |
| to their right. When the aircraft banked again, the object turned and |
| then shot straight up. The acceleration was estimated at 330 G's.     |
| Also, a glowing ball or disc-shaped object was chased by two          |
| experienced pilots in a Piper Cherokee over Farmington, Missouri, the |
| same night and at the same time as the Piedmont incident. The object  |
| gave off heat waves, and made no noise. it outdistanced the plane     |
| with a tremendous burst of speed. (Sources: Charles J. Oswald, St.    |

| 1977 - Shortly before 11:00 a.m. a woman in the city of Oxelosund,    |
| Sweden heard a shrill whistling sound. A brown, four-meter diameter   |
| disc hovered 100m over a water tower. It had an antenna with a sphere |
| on top. It hovered in place for four seconds. When the UFO departed a |
| strong noise was heard causing windows to vibrate. It left toward the |
| southeast. (Sources: UFO Information Sweden, May 1977, p. 17; Bertil  |

| 1977 - On this night in Herbrandston, Dyfed, Wales there was a red    |
| glow in the sky when an 11-year-old boy reported seeing a figure 50   |
| meters away dressed in a silver diver suit, wearing a large helmet    |
| and with a square, featureless face. The being drifted through a      |
| closed gate on a country lane. (Sources: Hugh Turnbull, FSR, June     |

| 1977 - At 3:30 p.m. two young girls walking under a highway overpass  |
| by a canal in Tucson, Arizona and were following a path up a small    |
| hill when they saw a UFO hovering above some nearby brush. The craft  |
| was dark gray, metallic, and shaped like a drum. It had four to six   |
| long spider like legs hanging from its bottom. The UFO rose slowly    |
| and disappeared towards the southeast following a curved path. From   |
| out of some bushes beneath where the object had been hovering, a      |
| thin, human-like figure emerged. It had long brown hair and was       |
| wearing a blue top and dark pants, but it also wore strange looking   |
| boots. Behind the thin figure five other shorter figures appeared.    |
| The group walked briskly away in single file, towards the desert and  |
| into the distance where they could no longer be seen. (Source: Albert |

| 1977 - at 11 p.m. in Henschen, Indiana a couple were driving to their |
| trailer home and had to make a stop to change their baby's diaper. As |
| the husband looked for a diaper in the car he glanced out a window    |
| and saw a twelve foot tall hairy creature with fierce glowing red     |
| eyes. The creature uttered some guttural sounds and made an apparent  |
| aggressive move towards the car. They drove off quickly, but the      |
| creature chased their vehicle as they attempted to flee. It pounded   |
| angrily on their car and dented it, flinging its arms up and down.    |
| The following night the couple saw a similar creature perched near a  |

| 1981 - In a remote farm area of Goodhue, Minnesota a civil engineer   |
| and his wife encountered a two-foot diameter aluminum-like disc as    |
| they drove by just 40 feet away. In the early afternoon R. E. Schenk, |
| age 56, and his wife were driving south on Highway 58. At about 1:30  |
| p.m. they saw the small disc, shaped like two saucers, one inverted   |
| on top of the other. The object was hovering just a few feet off the  |
| road about 40 feet away, with sunlight reflecting off its surface.    |
| Surprised by what he had seen, the former Navy pilot turned and drove |
| back. He and his wife then saw the object at an estimated 2,000-4,000 |
| feet altitude. It climbed rapidly through the sky, and disappeared in |
| the distance, headed in the direction of Minneapolis. The weather was |
| clear, and visibility unlimited. It was a bright, sunny day.          |

| suddenly appeared. She described it as semi-transparent, and it wore  |
| a bright green neon belt and a green ring. The entity was examining a |
| box when the witness made a sudden move, and the being then touched   |
| its belt and vanished in plain sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1989 - An 11-year-old boy in Webster, Massachusetts saw a             |
| cigar-shaped object rise out of a lake. It was brownish-black and 15' |
| long. (Source: Robert Gribble, Paul Ferrughelli, Computer Catalog of  |

| 1992 - Driving in the desert on US Highway 180 near Deming, New       |
| Mexico a man was listening to his CB radio when the radio suddenly    |
| sent silent. He next noticed a patch of white light shining on a rise |
| over the left side of the road. He then heard a voice in his head     |
| that told him to "watch out for the smoke." Thinking it had been the  |
| CB radio, he tried to reply but got no answer. Next, he saw what      |
| looked like a huge luminous cloud which created what looked like a    |
| curtain across the highway. He drove into the grayish-white mist for  |
| about an hour. He stopped his vehicle and walked across the road and  |
| to a ditch, but he was still unable to see anything. Suddenly, he     |
| became paralyzed, and saw the approach of two beings about 5 feet     |
| tall. Each being got on either side of him and place a firm grip on   |
| his forearms. The beings had long bony fingers. They then led him to  |
| a shiny metallic craft, shaped like a flattened arch with rounded     |
| ends. A rectangular opening appeared in the side of the craft. He     |
| experienced amnesia about what happened next. The next thing he       |
| remembers is sitting back in a chair inside the craft, feeling dizzy  |
| and numb. He was briefly left alone before two beings entered the     |
| room. One was a male with a round, oval face and oval black eyes. The |
| second being was a female, similar in appearance to the male being.   |
| The witness was then led to a dimly lit room, and place in a          |
| reclining position on a chair. He felt a buzzing sensation on his     |
| face, and felt as if a small object was being inserted into his nose. |
| He was then released and led outside, and floated horizontally to his |
| vehicle. He resumed his drive and the vapor-like fog quickly          |
| dissipated. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2002 Humanoid Contact         |

| 1994 - Farm animals in Granville, Tennessee were reported to be       |
| unusually calm after a rectangular object passed at a low altitude.   |
| It had a white light at two corners, and trees hid the other two      |
| corners. The object was dark, but the space between the two lights    |
| blocked the stars; it was bigger than a house, and made a low rumble. |
| The altitude was estimated to be 100 feet and the distance 500 feet.  |
| It moved very slowly. When the object vanished from sight, there was  |
| a sudden flash of white light and the rumbling sound ceased. The      |
| animals' calmness persisted afterward.  Animals involved were 5       |
| goats, 4 dogs, 9 geese, 40 chickens, at least one cow and a horse.    |

| 2004 - In Citrusdal, Western Cape, South Africa two witnesses were    |
| walking home at 9:30 p.m. when they saw a flying triangle craft       |
| moving very slowly through the sky. It had a yellow light at each of  |
| the three points, and in the middle of the craft was a blue and red   |
| light that went on and off and circled each other. "My grandmother an |
| I stood there for about 4 minutes watching the craft, and then I went |
| home." The witness told her father about it, and he became a third    |
| witness, but he could only make out a faint light in the sky. The     |
| grandmother had seen a similar craft several nights before. (Source:  |

| 2005 - A blue oval-shaped object was seen in the afternoon sky in     |

| 2008 - In Sonora, California a man saw what he descibed as a "Grey    |
| translucent being" studying the flowers in his garden. He had arrived |
| back home from work after parking the car in the garage and had       |
| walked to his front door, when he was amazed to see what looked like  |
| "a typical grey alien being in my garden." It was translucent and not |
| completely solid, and about five feet tall. It seemed incredibly thin |
| and had a very pointed chin. It appeared to be studying the plants,   |
| and from this point on he has no certain recollection of the events   |
| that followed. It didn't appear to be interested in him. He had two   |
| memories of walking into his house. One is where he walked in and     |
| went straight to bed; the other is where he alerted the dogs and made |
| them check outside, which they didn't want to do. His wife had been   |
| working until 7 a.m. and was in bed asleep when he arrived. The next  |
| day he had no recollection of any of this. It wasn't until some 20    |
| hours later that he remembered what he had seen. He told his wife as  |
| soon as he saw her, and she thought he was insane...fornot mentioning |
| it sooner! The other strange thing was that he didn't feel afraid at  |
| all to go out in the dark garage or garden. He did not see any UFO or |
| craft on this night, but had seen many previously. The following      |
| evening he did see a large white light sweep across the sky while     |
| walking the dogs. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting    |

| 2008 - Several members from the UFO group “Ovni Merida” were          |
| conducting a “night vigil” in an isolated field at about 350 meters   |
| from the road in Baca, Merida, Mexico. It was a cloudy night with     |
| little moon. At around midnight one of the men saw what appeared to   |
| be a pair of red eyes at about 100 meters away in a field. The eyes   |
| were shiny and the men immediately thought it was a dog, but it did   |
| not bark, move, or approach them, and it suddenly disappeared. Two of |
| the men walked over to the site, but failed to locate any tracks or   |
| ground traces. As they looked around, the same pair of red shiny eyes |
| appeared again, about 100 meters away in another field. The eyes      |
| vanished and then would appear again another 100 meters away in       |
| another field; this went on for several minutes. The men again failed |
| to find any footprints or traces. Soon, they rejoined the others, and |
| heard a loud galloping sound like that of a horse; immediately after  |
| that they heard the sound of huge wings flapping overhead, and this   |
| caused one of the men to scream in fright. One of them managed to see |
| a large pair of dark wings disappear into some nearby brushes. Two of |
| the men went to investigate, one armed with a powerful flashlight and |
| the other with a canister of tear gas. They approached the bushes but |
| they failed to find anything. Later, when the group was again         |
| together, one of them who had gone to investigate reported that he    |
| had seen a shadowy, two-foot tall figure walking in the brush. The    |
| figure, whatever it was, seemed to be walking hunched over.           |
| Terrified, he asked the other man to return to camp. (Source: Albert  |
