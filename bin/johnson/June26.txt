| 1947 - In the afternoon on this day, nine shiny discs with fins flew  |
| over La Grande, Oregon, weaving in-and-out of formation. There were   |
| also four separate daylight disc sightings in Utah between 7:00 and   |
| 8:00 p.m. in the following locations: Cedar City, Logan, and Diamond  |
| Fork Canyon. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer database: Salt Lake    |

| 1952 - In Celina, Ohio at 1:30 a.m. a married couple saw a glowing    |
| but dark colored disc fly over the town slowly toward the south, at a |
| low altitude. It flew with a slight tilt, and made no sound. (Source: |
| Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 2259).                         |

| 1952 - Later that day in Pottstown, Pennsylvania a procession of discs flew  |
| by. At 11:50 p.m. two objects flew side-by-side in tandem-one had     |
| steady lights and the other had flashing lights. Fifteen minutes      |
| later two more passed over in the same configuration. After another   |
| fifteen minutes a single object flew over. (Source: Project Blue Book |
| files counted in official statistics, case 1351).                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1959 - At 6:45 p.m. at Boianai Mission on Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea |
| an Anglican missionary named Father Gill and 37 others watched four   |
| luminous figures on top of a low, hovering, disc-shaped UFO. It was   |
| circular with a wide base and a narrower upper deck, and had four     |
| tapering legs, two at each end, on the bottom. A shaft of blue light  |
| that shone upwards at a 45 degree angle was witnessed part of the     |
| time. The four figures on top of the craft were surrounded at a       |
| little distance by an aura of luminescence. "If wearing clothes, they |
| were very tight-fitting," reported Father Gill. One of the beings     |
| waved back in an apparent response to hand waves from the witnesses.  |
| The UFO also wobbled in response to flashlight signals. Thirty        |
| minutes later an oval-shaped craft with portholes was seen            |
| maneuvering over Giwa, Papua New Guinea. The UFO made a series of     |
| moves and stops, and made a "whoomp whoomp" noise. (Source: Charles   |

| 1959 - Earlier that same day Mr. Taylor, a 22-year-old man living in  |
| Whitefield, Greater Manchester, England observed two tall men walking |
| down Alexander Avenue. They were dressed like motorcyclists, stood    |
| over six-feet tall, wore tight fitting trousers and heavy boots, and  |
| had long blond hair. They turned a corner and when Taylor quickly     |
| followed, the men had already vanished into thin air. (Sources: Peter |

| 1962 - Verona, Italy -- After observing a flying disc earlier that     |
| night, Luisa Peregozzo awoke to an intense cold feeling and saw out   |
| her bedroom window a semi-transparent being with an enormous          |
| baldhead, surrounded by a green light. It was extending huge hands in |
| her direction. The air in the room remained cold throughout the       |
| entire episode. (Source: Flying Saucers, January 1966, p. 58).        |

| 1963 - Two UFO reports occurred at close to the same time in          |
| Massachusetts on this night. At one o'clock in the morning in East    |
| Weymouth (Norfolk County) a married couple saw a thirty-foot diameter |
| object shaped like two bowls rim-to-rim hovering over some power      |
| lines, approximately 300 feet away from them. The UFO made a buzzing  |
| or humming sound as they watched it hover there for three minutes. At |
| about the same time three people in Rockland, Massachusetts in nearby |
| Plymouth County saw and photographed a disc-shaped object zigzagging  |
| away toward the northwest, or in the direction of Norfolk County. The |
| time-lapsed photo shows a light making ninety-degree turns, and was   |
| published in the local newspaper. (Sources: Walter N. Webb            |

| 1968 - Multiple reports of close encounters involving three strangely |
| dressed humanoids came from towns located on the Atacama Salt Beds in |
| Antofagasta Province in northern Chile. Residents of the towns of     |
| Reine, Socaine, Toconas and Chiloporo saw the same UFO manned by      |
| these three beings. The UFO was reported to have landed and on at     |
| least three occasions the humanoids entered the same house, taking    |
| small items with them. This behavior spread fear and panic among the  |
| local inhabitants. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |

| 1970 - At 1:00 a.m. in Sharon, Massachusetts a UFO landed remotely. A |
| brilliant yellow aura surrounded the object as it descended slowly    |
| behind some trees during a rainstorm. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler,     |
| case files report dated September 15, 1970).                          |

| 1971 - At 3:00 a.m. Mrs. D. Hancock heard a loud whirring sound and   |
| looked out the window of her house in Tauranga, New Zealand on the    |
| Bay of Plenty. She saw a large bright white ball of light above her   |
| neighbor's house that lit up the entire area. She watched it for a    |
| while, but eventually went back to bed. (Source: Waikato (New         |

| 1971 - That same day a married couple from Birmingham, on holiday in         |
| Guernsey in the Channel Isles, England watched four spinning, silver  |
| daylight discs over the coastline. The discs hovered for more than a  |
| minute, climbed higher in the sky, changed formation, then shot off   |
| toward the north at high speed. (Source: Glasgow (Scotland) Herald,   |
| June 28, 1971).                                                       |

| 1971 - That night at 11:00 p.m. in Chauchina, Spain a man and a woman        |
| watched a large luminous reddish-yellow light hover for fifteen just  |
| 2 meters over the ground in a nearby pasture. (Source: Vicente-Juan   |
| Ballester Olmos, Catalogue of 200 Type-I Events in Spain and          |

| 1972 - At 8 o'clock in the morning some native farm laborers came     |
| running to farmer Bennie Smith, the owner of the Braeside farm, near  |
| Fort Beaufort, South Africa. They thought they saw a fire in the      |
| thick bush land. Thinking it might be poachers on his land, Mr. Smith |
| went to the spot with his .303 rifle. Hovering partially behind some  |
| brush 200 yards away was a glowing egg-shaped UFO. He went and called |
| the police, and at 9:00 a.m. Sergeant P. Kitching and Warrant Officer |
| P. van Rensburg arrived at the site. The color of the object was a    |
| gun metal blue but after they watched it for a while it started to    |
| glow red all over. They were sure it was under some form of           |
| intelligent control because when the farm laborers shouted from the   |
| bush the object moved down out of sight of the witnesses.             |
|                                                                       |
| They decided to shoot at it with the rifle. Fifteen rounds were       |
| fired. They heard a thud from the seventh shot. The UFO changed color |
| from a red glow to a green glow and then to yellow, and rocked from   |
| side to side. They watched it for another hour before the police had  |
| to leave the area. Mr. Smith stayed to see it leave a short while     |
| later. It turned on end and climbed rapidly into the sky, making a    |
| humming sound. (Source: Ivan Clark, The Fort Beaufort police          |

| 1973 - A procession of unidentified flying objects was witnessed      |
| twice in the night skies over Switzerland, in Fribourg at 10:15 p.m.  |
| and again at Brent-sur-Montreux. (Source: Gillieron, UFO-DOC, cases   |

| 1977 - A 16-year-old in Tehran, Iran took three photographs of three  |
| lights moving in a triangular formation at 4:00 a.m. Another          |
| neighborhood family also witnessed the flying lights. A missing time  |
| experience occurred to a 13-year-old boy in Treinta y Tres, Uruguay   |
| on this night, or close to this date. (Sources: International UFO     |

| 1978 - A UFO landed for several minutes on the patio of a residence  |
| in Ayacucho, Argentina. Mr. and Mrs. Belloq--the couple who lived     |
| there--awoke to a humming noise, looked out and saw that only a few   |
| meters over the treetops was the flying disc. It had no lights and no |
| windows, and ascended after hovering a few more minutes and flew off  |
| slowly in the direction of the city of Tandil. A Bigfoot sighting     |
| also occurred on this night in South Crossett, Arkansas. (Source: UFO |

| 1979 - A dog started barking at 3 a.m. when a six-foot diameter       |
| balloon-shaped object glowed and hovered over the yard of a home in   |
| Wheeling, Illinois. The object flew toward the southwest. A second    |
| object of the same description appeared and flew to the northwest,    |
| disappearing behind some trees. (Source: International UFO     |

| 1979 - At 3:15 p.m. that afternoon eight security guards in downtown         |
| Philadelphia, Pennsylvania watched a domed disc-shaped UFO maneuver   |
| in the daytime sky. The underside of the object turned extremely      |
| bright, then it made a ninety-degree turn and flew off toward the     |
| north. (Source: International UFO Reporter, August 1979, p. 13)                                          |

| 1979 - That same day some debris that fell from the sky, dubbed the          |
| "Mississauga Blob", landed on a picnic table in the backyard of a     |
| home in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. (Source: John Colombo, UFOs over Canada:         |

| 1986 - Two objects flew parallel to each other over Pittsburgh,       |
| Pennsylvania at 9:49 p.m. After a minute of flight they began         |
| rotating around an imaginary center, stopped with one ahead of the    |
| other, and moved off. One of the objects brightened for several       |
| seconds. (Source: International UFO Reporter, November 1986, p. 14).  |
|                                                                       |
| 1990 - In Tapah, Malaysia on this day a witness encountered a tiny,   |
| 6-inch tall being with shiny red eyes. Later that night at 11 p.m.    |
| local time an orange ovoid object hovered over the roadside of        |
| highway D11 west of Montady, France. It had a halo that glowed. The   |
| UFO shot off toward the west-northwest, darkening three times as it   |
| flew. (Sources: Ahmad Jamaludin, Centre for Malaysian UFO Studies     |

| 1993 - Several balls of light hovered over the town of Burgess Hill,  |
| England this night. According to the witness, they seemed to "want to |
| be seen." A red fireball maneuvered in the sky over Derby, England at |
| 11:45 p.m. In Gridley, California at 4:32 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time  |
| a six-minute long videotape was made of a round UFO with windows on   |
| the top. It had reportedly been maneuvering in the sky for several    |
| hours. (Sources: UFO Newsclipping Service, September-November 1993    |

| 1997 - In Dunkinsville, Ohio a woman was watching television when she |
| heard her dogs barking outside at one o'clock in the morning. That    |
| drew her attention outside, and when she turned the porch light on,   |
| she saw a strange creature alongside the pond in her front yard only  |
| 30 feet away. It was hairy and gray, stood about three or four feet   |
| tall, and had large dark eyes. It made gurgling sounds, and walked on |
| its knuckles. Her dogs gave chase and it ran away, but she called her |
| dogs back. The creature was last seen moving along a barbwire fence.  |
| Shortly later she heard a screeching sound coming from that           |
| direction. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database      |
