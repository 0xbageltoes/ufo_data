| 1952 - At 9:30 p.m. on a road north of Pontijou, France two witnesses |
| saw an orange ball of light hovering over highway N824. It made no    |
| sound. It flew off in a southerly direction, stopped, zigzagged,      |
| stoped again, then flew away toward the southwest. The duration of    |
| the sighting was nine minutes. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue  |
| 155).                                                                 |

| 1953 - In Ciudad Valles, Mexico at six o'clock in the evening Sr. S.  |
| Villanueva, age 37, had the engine of the vehicle he was driving      |
| fail. Two four-foot-tall beings approached, and he next saw a domed   |
| disc, 40 feet, making a humming sound. The beings entered the craft,  |
| and the UFO ascended vertically at high speed. The landing traces     |
| included crushed bushes and broken sticks in a circular area 40-45    |
| feet wide. (Sources: Gordon Creighton, The Humanoids: FSR Special     |

| 1958 - At 7:05 p.m. in Warren, Michigan Mr. A. D. Chisholm observed   |
| an extremely bright UFO shaped first like a bell and then like a      |
| saucer. When maneuvering it seemed shaped like a fried egg. It gave   |
| the impression of a huge size at extreme range. It was much brighter  |
| than Venus, at 70 degrees elevation. It hovered for five minutes,     |
| then flipped over and sped away to the west-southwest. The sighting   |
| lasted 6-10 minutes. (Sources: US Air Force Project Blue Book files   |

| 1961 - On this night five people on a farm in Stillwater, Minnesota   |
| observed a group of UFOs arranged vertically in a V formation. The V  |
| formation of nocturnal lights, or a boomerang-shaped object with      |
| running lights, passed behind some trees flying at a low altitude.    |

| 1962 - On this evening two little men, three feet tall, were seen     |
| digging a hole near Sr. Mafra Da Silva's house in Duas Pontes, Minas  |
| Gerais State, Brazil. When he approached them they ran into the       |
| bushes. A few moments later a hat-shaped UFO surrounded by a red glow |
| took off at high speed. (Source: Coral E. Lorenzen, Flying Saucers:   |
| The Startling Evidence of the Invasion from Outer Space, p. 231).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1966 - Late in the afternoon of this day two men named Pereira and    |
| Viana, alleged UFO contactees, were found dead with welders masks and |
| strange papers on them in Niteroi Morro do Vintem, Rio de Janeiro,    |
| Brazil. Plants in their vicinity were burnt. A disc shaped UFO had    |
| been seen earlier. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Confrontations: A         |
| Scientist's Search for Alien Contact, p. 4).                          |

| 1971 - John Hodges and Peter Rodriguez, both in their late twenties,  |
| had just gotten into John's car at two a.m. when they saw in the      |
| headlights things that looked like "brains" on the road about six     |
| feet away. Of a bluish color, a localized mist surrounded them. One   |
| was the size of a human torso, and had something red on it; the other |
| was "the size of an overgrown softball." Frightened, the young men    |
| took off for home. Under hypnosis five years later, John Hodges       |
| recalled that the larger brain had spoken to them telepathically,     |
| saying, "Take the time to understand yourselves, the times draws near |
| when you shall need to. You shall not remember this incident until we |
| meet again."                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| He also recalled that when he had arrived home and was still sitting  |
| in his car, he had a "dream" or vision of being in a large room with  |
| the brain. There were control consoles all along the wall, and there  |
| were several 7-foot-tall Grey skinned, bald humanoids with 6 webbed   |
| fingers and toes and thin lipped mouths. On a TV-like screen were     |
| pinpoint of lights, which the brain told him were places on Earth     |
| where there was "too much power." He was also shown 3-D pictures of   |
| atomic explosions, and of a planet destroyed by "too much power."     |
| After feeling a "buzzing" sensation he found himself back in his car. |
| He thinks the experience was a "holographic projection," because he   |
| noticed that behind him all was black. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted  |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1971-45, citing |
| Ann Druffel, MUFON; Thomas E. Bullard, UFO Abductions: The Measure of |

| 1973 - A man driving near Route 30 in Kingston, Pennsylvania reported |
| that his vehicle almost struck a huge gorilla like animal, with       |
| pointed ears and red glowing eyes. The creature ran away screaming    |
| like a man in pain. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact      |
| Database 1973, case # 1871, citing Paul G. Johnson & Joan L. Jeffers  |

| 1991 - At 2:00 a.m. a disc-shaped object with a cone-shaped dome was  |
| sighted hovering next to a radar blimp for 30 minutes in Las Palmas,  |
| Bayamon, Puerto Rico. It made a humming sound. (Source: Lumieres dans |
