| 1954 - A sphere was observed hovering over Boston, Massachusetts at   |
| 8:00 p.m. Two lights exited from the sphere and returned to it. The   |
| object then vanished, but shortly reappeared, then shrank in size and |

| 1963 - A North Scituate, Massachusetts woman spotted a yellow-white   |
| light that looked to be plunging into the ocean, but suddenly         |
| reversed direction, doubling back on its original course. A friend    |
| with her also saw it. "It suddenly stopped and moved erratically for  |
| a few seconds, reversed direction, and went back from east to west,"  |
| she reported. She watched the maneuvering light for at least 10-15    |
| minutes. When it stopped moving and hovered in one place for a while  |
| she stopped watching it. (Source: APRO Bulletin, November 1963, pg.   |
| 4).                                                                   |

| away slowly. At 9:15 pm. B. L. English, a radio announcer at WTOD     |
| Radio in Toledo, Ohio saw three glowing white spheres, glowing red on |
| their sides, move slowly through the sky, hover, and then move in     |
| fast circles. They made a low, rumbling sound as they flew. (Sources: |

| 1965 - Modbury, South Australia. A dark, disc-shaped object hovered    |
| and circled for 15 minutes at an estimated 3,000 feet altitude. A     |
| photo of the same or a similar object was taken in Adelaide on the    |
| same day. (Source: J. B. Delaire, UFO Register, Volume 7 (1976), p.   |
| 55).                                                                  |

| 1966 - A policeman who had observed an UFO over Milan, Michigan on    |
| March 17 of this year saw an unidentified machine on the ground at a  |
| street intersection on this day. As he drove towards it, with his     |
| headlights illuminating the object, it took off like an airplane and  |
| flew away toward the southeast in the direction of Selfridge AFB.     |
| (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings,  |
| p. 332, case 773).                                                    |

| 1967 - At 2:30 a.m. Carmen Cuneo, a night shift worker at a factory   |
| in Caledonia, Ontario saw two objects near the factory's scrap heap   |
| and dump area: a large cigar-shaped object on the ground, 35 feet     |
| long by 15 feet thick, and a hovering disc-shaped object about 15     |
| feet in diameter. The smaller object, tilted up at a 45-degree angle, |
| had a row of orange-lighted windows around its periphery. In the      |
| larger object were four square windows emitting a pulsating orange    |
| light, and from one end of it projected upward at a 45 degree angle a |
| rod 15 feet long, bearing a large red light at the end. Beneath this  |
| light moved three small humanoid figures about three feet tall,       |
| wearing miner's hats with small lights on them. They were picking up  |
| and examining small objects on the ground with quick, jerky           |
| movements. After watching for 10 minutes, Cuneo called co-worker      |
| Marvin Hannigan to see it, but by the time Hannigan arrived the       |
| humanoids were gone. The two craft started very slowly to rise        |
| straight up into the air. After they reached a height of 50 feet they |
| departed at about 40-45 mph without making a sound. At the landing    |
| site branches were broken and the brush charred, and an oily liquid   |
| was found on the ground. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,    |
| HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1967-49, citing field     |
| investigators James J. Ferrito & Jeffrey J. Gow for NICAP; APRO       |
| Bulletin, November-December 1967, pg. 4; Jacques Vallee, Passport to  |

| 1971 - On this day in 1971, Dr. James E. McDonald, noted atmospheric         |
| physicist and UFO researcher, was found dead from a gunshot wound to  |
| the head, an apparent suicide. Later that evening a disc with a       |
| circular opening in the bottom hovered over Courbevoie, France at     |
| 8:50 p.m. It tilted as it hovered, revealing beams of light directed  |
| upward into the sky. (Sources: Tucson Arizona Daily Star, June 15,    |
| 1971; Phenomenes Spatiaux, June 1971).                                |

| 1973 - In 1973 a 40-foot-long blimp-like object with fins hovered over Penns |
| Wood, Pennsylvania at 500 feet altitude for several minutes before    |
| ascending vertically into the clouds. A search revealed there were no |
| blimps scheduled in the area for that time. (Source: newspaper        |

| 1974 - Off Itajai, Santa Catarina, Brazil at 3:30 p.m. several        |
| independent observers watched a saucer shaped object come in from the |
| north and land on sea. It floated for five minutes before submerging. |
| At 11 p.m. a UFO that changed colors from silver-white to red, green  |
| and orange, then back to silver-white every five minutes, placed a    |
| car for several minutes in Gladstone, Tasmania. Approximately an hour |
| and 45 minutes later a domed disc with blinking lights descended over |
| a military installation in Ventorro, Spain. It was spinning and       |
| seemed to be vibrating in place, and flew away to the north.          |
