| 1945 - During a blizzard a silver, domed object with a square base    |
| landed on the sea off the coast of Ireland. It was surrounded by      |
| purple lights, and made a whirring noise. Two beings with squarish    |
| shaped feet and wearing diver suits were seen walking on the surface  |
| of the water. The craft rose off the surface of the sea and landed in |
| a field on a nearby island, crushing two cows when it came down.      |

| 1960 - A disc-shaped flying object and three nocturnal lights         |
| exchanged green beams of light in the sky over Cottonwood, Minnesota  |
| at 11:45 p.m. The nocturnal lights then entered the saucer-shaped     |
| craft through a hatch. The disc flew off toward the north. Pendulum   |
| motion was also reported. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, November 1962, p.  |

| 1963 - A fisherman in Libreville, Gabon witnessed the landing of a    |
| unusual craft on this night, from which a terrifying creature         |
| emerged. It was humanoid in shape, spoke sounds he could not          |
| understand, left footprints in the sand, and then went back to the    |
| machine and flew off. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A |
| Century of Landings, p. 296).                                         |

| 1966 - Three objects rose from a field with a screaming hi-pitched    |
| noise, maneuvered, then paced a car at three a.m. near a farm two     |
| miles south of Monroe, Oregon. A blast of wind from the UFOs knocked  |
| one of the five witnesses against a car. Flattened grass was found at |
| the landing site. (Sources: Geoffrey Falla, BUFORA Vehicle Project    |

| 1967 - Gary Lambert, a college student from Omaha, Nebraska was       |
| driving home at Christmas during the night when he saw a dimly        |
| outlined object with a row of lights hovering over an underpass on    |
| the highway between Ashland and Lincoln. His sighting precipitated a  |
| number of vivid dreams that night, in which he believes he had been   |
| "contacted" by the beings aboard the UFO. He also believes that he    |
| may have experienced an actual abduction, the memory of which was     |
| erased from his mind. There were no details or other evidence of an   |
| abduction that the witness was able to provide. (Source: David F.     |

| 1970 - A V-shaped formation of 10 silver-gray circular objects was    |
| seen in the sky over Braintree, Massachusetts at four o'clock in the  |
| morning. They were silent, and appeared twice over the area within a  |
| five minute period. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs: Interplanetary  |

| 1971 - In Tooligie Hill, South Australia a red ball of light was      |
| sighted by neighbors on this night. The next day Mr. Habner found a   |
| 2.2 meter diameter ring, 45 cm wide and 10 cm deep in his wheat       |
| field. The wheat was swirled in a counter-clockwise direction around  |
| the ground mark. Soil samples revealed nothing abnormal. (Sources:    |

| 1973 - At 9:00 p.m. a three-meter wide dome hovered over a field at a |
| farm in Les Riveaux, Allier department, France. Two glowing tubes     |
| protruded from the object, and the witness was levitated. (Source:    |

| 1978 - At 4:30 a.m. a three-meter long, oddly shaped UFO was seen at  |
| a low altitude over Cicagna, Liguria, Italy. It had what looked like  |
| iron claws on one end of the object. The UFO fired a beam of light,   |
| then shot off toward the south. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue |

| 1978 - A fleet of six UFOs was seen by Peruvian fishermen over the    |
| Caynarachi River in the San Martin department, Peru on this night.    |
| They first noticed a brightly illuminated rhomboid object that passed |
| over from south to north. It was followed by five more objects in     |
| formation. The UFOs had yellow, amber, and violet lights. The men     |
| fled in fright. (Source: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping Service, April |

| 1978 - Two huge UFOs came screaming over Lake Arrowhead in San        |
| Bernardino county, California at 7:18 p.m. They made a sound similar  |
| to ambulances. There were two sets of independent witnesses to the    |
| fly-by, for a total of five witnesses. (Source: George Eberhart, A    |

| 1987 - A very intense, pink or reddish-orange light lit up the whole  |
| lake in Coon Rapids, Minnesota at 10:00 p.m. The UFO was first seen   |
| above the trees along the shorline. It then went down to the lake     |
| level and turned off all illuminated like a light turned off with a   |
| switch. At least 16 holes were discovered in the ice on the lake the  |
| next day. The holes were between one and five inches in diameter and  |
| were within 200 feet of where the first witness had been standing.    |

| 1992 - On this night at 9:00 p.m. a dark disc-shaped object with      |
| pairs of green and orange lights located at four places around the    |
| underside of the object was seen over a lake in Springfield, Missouri |
| by a boy and a girl, age 10. The UFO left behind a white smoke trail  |
| when it moved away (Source: Lisa Dusenberry, MUFON Field              |

| 1999 - A dark delta-shaped or V-shaped object was sighted over a rest |
| stop on Interstate 44 in Mount Vernon, Missouri on this evening. The  |
