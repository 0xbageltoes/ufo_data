| 1950 - On this night a featureless four-meter wide disc circled a     |
| ranch in Falfurrias, Texas at 300 meters altitude for a few minutes.  |
| It flew off in a southwesterly direction toward Mexico. (Source:      |

| 1954 - A torpedo shaped UFO was seen on this afternoon at 3:20 p.m.   |
| over Klang, Selangor, Malaysia. It shot straight up into the sky when |
| it left. (Source: Ahmad Jamaludin, Summary of Unidentified Flying     |

| 1954 - A U.S. Air Force F-86 fighter jet was scrambled to pursue a    |
| UFO over Nouasseur AFB in Morocco at 10:35 a.m. The UFO flew off      |
| toward the north, and the jet couldn't catch up with it despite       |
| accelerating to 530 mph. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in |

| 1959 - On this night 6-year-old Kim Marks of Purnong Landing, South   |
| Australia was preparing for bed when he saw a five foot tall man with |
| a crimson face, wearing a red jacket and trousers with white          |
| trimmings. He was visible for a minute and a half. Kim's dog did not  |
| react. A few hours later, a multi-colored luminous UFO was seen close |
| to the Marks property. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,      |

| 1967 - A boy who had gone outside in Rochester, Minnesota to buy a    |
| newspaper saw an object resembling an inverted mushroom hovering 10   |
| meters above the ground. It was not larger than a car, tilted to a 45 |
| degree orientation, oscillated, and left towards the northwest. He    |
| took three photographs of the UFO. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport  |
| to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 825).                         |

| 1967 - Four boys, Bob & John Kangas, Mike Kauppi, and Scott Mackay,   |
| ages 9-12, were riding on a snowmobile in Palo, Minnesota at 2:15     |
| p.m. when they saw a very bright light coming from an old abandoned   |
| hayshed, and a second beam of light about 100 yards away in an open   |
| field. Near the latter were 5 moving black "objects" about three to   |
| four feet high, arranged in a diamond formation with a fifth at the   |
| center. These "objects" or beings seemed to glide over the deep snow, |
| then moved toward the beam of light and when they reached it, both    |
| the light and the "objects" faded out of sight. The boys headed for   |
| the nearest house, "visibly shaken, almost to the point of hysteria." |
| Two footprints of an unidentifiable shape were found later at the     |
| site. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of   |

| 1967 - At 7:15 p.m. in McIntosh, South Dakota a single witness saw an |
| object with red, green, and white lights. After he reported the       |
| incident, four young men went to the area to investigate. They saw    |
| four green lights hovering low over the road, but the engine of their |
| car stalled as they approached. Because their car had stalled on a    |
| hill, they turned the car around and coasted downhill. The car        |
| re-started then, so they drove away without investigating further.    |

| 1967 - Clyde L. Dwyer observed a large disc-shaped object from a      |
| window in his South Glenn Falls, New York home at 10:30 p.m. It was   |
| approximately 100 feet in diameter and hovered motionless 175-200     |
| yards southeast of his home. Three large square windows were spaced   |
| around the midline of the object and just below these, jets of what   |
| appeared to be steam were emitted continually from a number of        |
| equidistant points around the object. Its dark mass was illuminated   |
| by a nearby street lamp. A white light shone from the windows, and    |
| two men and a woman could be seen in the central window, with two     |
| more men standing behind the window to the right. Although no         |
| distinguishing characteristics could be seen, "these figures were     |
| definitely of human appearance." After hovering for about five        |
| minutes, the object gradually departed toward the southwest. No sound |
| was heard at any time. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1967 - A woman and her daughter driving home from church at 11:30     |
| p.m. in Letart Falls, Ohio rounded a corner in a wooded area and saw  |
| a huge white figure appear suddenly in front of their car. The        |
| creature appeared to have very long hair and was in sight for several |
| seconds before it shot upward into the sky and disappeared. The       |
| witnesses assumed they had seen an "angel." (Sources: John A. Keel,   |
| FSR, July-August 1968, p. 13; John A Keel, The Mothman Prophecies, p. |
| 119).                                                                 |

| 1969 - Mr. K. Maslund, a radio and TV station technician, was at work |
| at his TV station at 6:30 p.m. in Trejorningsjo, Angermanland, Sweden |
| when he heard the station’s transmission alarm system go off. Opening |
| the door, he saw outside about 50 feet away a UFO 150 meters wide and |
| 5-6 meters tall, hovering in the air. A “tunnel of light” extended    |
| from the object through which the witness saw 7 or 8 entities, about  |
| 1.30 meters tall by 30-40 cm wide, floating towards him. They passed  |
| Maslund within inches and he found that he could not move; after 5-10 |
| minutes, they left the station and re-entered the object through the  |
| tunnel, which then closed. The object then took off toward the north  |
| and the witness was again able to move. The entities were             |
| non-humanoid in shape, looking more like boxes than anything; he had  |
| the feeling the entities were inside the boxes and did not want to be |
| recognized in their “true form.” (Source: David F. Webb & Ted         |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1969-22, citing |
| Richard Heiden and the Swedish UFO Group).                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1969 - That same evening a family in Merida, Badajoz, Spain saw a     |
| disc-shaped object with a dome which glowed "brighter than the sun."  |
| It buzzed their car and their car headlights failed. The object then  |
| paced the car closely for 20 minutes at a low altitude. A woman also  |
| saw the object when she went outside her home after her television    |
| reception had heavy interference and static. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, |

| Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, FSR Special Issue #3, UFOs in Two       |
| Worlds)                                                               |

| 1974 - Keith McDonald and his family were watching at least three     |
| UFOs from the window of their living room in Grayslake, Illinois when |
| everyone but Keith became extremely tired and went off to bed. Keith  |
| next experienced a time lapse of several hours. Under hypnosis he     |
| recalled that three small entities with large eyes, long arms, and    |
| pointed ears entered the house and made mumbling sounds. (Source:     |

| 1975 - At 4:30 a.m. several anglers fishing in the surf at Punta      |
| Ocoa, Dominican Republic saw a domed, disc-shaped object approaching  |
| their location. The dome was transparent and illuminated from the     |
| inside. Visible inside the craft stood two human-looking figures,     |
| wearing bulky helmets on their heads, looking out and working         |
| controls. The craft dove into the ocean and disappeared beneath the   |
| waves. (Source: Leonte Objio, APRO Bulletin, January 1982, p. 5).     |

| 2000 - In the early evening around 6 p.m. three employees of the San  |
| Miguel Corporation, a large beer and beverage maker in Manila, the    |
| Philippines were walking across the company parking lot to their car  |
| when they noticed a strange glow emanating from a large tree on their |
| left. It was a pale blue color. Thinking that it was some sort of     |
| decorative lighting, they ignored it and kept walking. Then they      |
| heard a low rumbling noise that sounded like: "Anong balita, anong    |
| balita." Looking back they caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a  |
| naked, human like creature with white hair and glowing rings imbedded |
| in its wrists like shiny cufflinks. It leapt away with incredible     |
| speed. With a blur it vanished into some bushes. (Source: Albert S.   |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2000, citing Mystical Universe).   |

| 2004 - At four a.m. Mr. M. N. was driving east on Wellington Street   |
| in Sault Sainte Marie, Ontario at the southeastern end of Lake        |
| Superior and as he came to the center city (known to locals as Soo,   |
| Canada). He noticed a vertical beam of light in the early morning     |
| sky, from the top of a hill to the north. He stopped his vehicle at a |
| cross street and looked all the way to the end of the street, about 7 |
| blocks away, where the street ends at the base of the hill and has a  |
| metal stairwell leading to McDonald Avenue. His eyes focused on a     |
| little dark figure standing very still. This caught his curiosity, so |
| he slowly drove towards it. It then started moving from side to side, |
| using fluid movements as if it was floating in the air. It moved as   |
| if confused, or afraid and didn't know what to do. As he got closer,  |
| the figure's appearance seemed to have metamorphosed into a           |
| transparent, shadow-like entity that very swiftly flew up the stairs. |
| To his astonishment, the beam of light that he had seen in the        |
| distant sky a few minutes before was now at the top of the hill, only |
| 100 feet away. With his heart racing he drove as fast as he could     |
| eastward along the base of the hill until he came to the nearest      |
| street that climbed the hill and drove up McDonald Avenue to see what |
| was happening. He arrived at the top of the hill only to find three   |
| circle-shaped burn markings on the pavement of the street. About 10   |
| seconds later he heard a weird kind of gunshot sound. When he looked  |
| up to the sky he saw a bright light shooting up into the stars. As he |
| watched the spectacle a peaceful feeling came over him and he felt as |
| if every hair on his body was standing on end. The feeling of well    |
| being felt like it lasted only a brief 30 seconds, but when he looked |
| again at his watch it was at least 40 minutes later. (Source: Albert  |
