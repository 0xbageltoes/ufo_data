| 1947 - On this day in 1947 three platter-shaped discs were seen hovering in  |
| the sky for a period of three hours over Bremerton, Washington from   |
| late in the afternoon until evening. The objects wavered as they      |
| flew, and shot off at extreme speeds toward the west. (Source:        |
| Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 26, 1947).                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1950 - Oskar Linke and his 11-year-old daughter saw two little men in silver |
| suits in a forest outside of Hasselbach, Germany in 1950. His         |
| motorcycle had gotten a flat tire and they were pushing it toward the |
| village around 2:30 a.m. when his daughter Gabriele pointed to what   |
| she thought was a young deer about 150 yards away. He approached and  |
| realized that what she had seen were apparently human figures,        |
| wearing shimmering metallic clothing. They stood about 1.5 meters (4  |
| feet) in height, and one of them wore a light on its chest that       |
| flashed at regular intervals. He stealthily approached to about 30    |
| feet from them, peering over a small ridge. Next to them was a        |
| pan-shaped disc, approximately 40-50 feet (15-20 meters) in diameter. |
| The object was metallic and had two rows of holes along the sides     |
| each about a foot in diameter, spaced 1.5 feet apart. Out of the top  |
| rose a ten-foot high black, cylindrical "conning tower."              |
|                                                                       |
| When his daughter called to him it apparently alarmed the two         |
| figures, for they rushed back to the object, clambering up the side   |
| of the conning tower and disappearing inside. The outer rim of the    |
| disc in which the holes were sunk began to glow a blue-green color,   |
| and a humming sound started. As the glow and sound increased, the     |
| tower was retracted into the center of the object, and the whole      |
| object rose from the ground. From the swirling effect he got the      |
| impression the object was spinning like a top. The color of the disc  |
| turned to red as it took off. A two-meter circular depression of      |
| compressed ground, freshly made, was found at the landing site, with  |
| ground indentations. At the time Mr. Linke lived in communist         |
| controlled East Germany. He told his story to a judge and U.S.        |
| Military intelligence when he was able to cross into West Germany two |
| years later. (Source: Thomas M. Olsen, The Reference for Outstanding  |
| UFO Sighting Reports, pp. 8-9, citing Leonard Cramp, Piece for a      |
| Jig-Saw, p. 158. This case is often erroneously cited as occurring in |
| 1952).                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1952 - Two cases from Project Blue Book's list of unexplained reports        |
| occurred on this day in 1952. On Cape Cod, Massachusetts, a bright    |
| light crossed the sky in front of a USAF F-94 fighter plane at 1:28   |
| a.m. local time. The light was observed for 15 seconds. Later that    |
| evening at McChord AFB outside of Tacoma, Washington many military    |
| observers tracked 5-6 discs with a theodolite as USAF F-94 jets       |
| pursued them. (Source: Project Blue Book, cases #1299 and #1298).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1955 - In 1955 a silver, oblong object hovered over Adelaide, South          |
| Australia at 2:15 p.m. The object was viewed through binoculars, and  |
| was seen to hide in some clouds when a plane approached. (Source:     |
| Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume I, p. 135).                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1956 - In 1956 a bright blob of light zoomed away when approached by a Royal |
| New Zealand Air Force Vampire jet interceptor, near Ohakea AFB, New   |
| Zealand. (Source: Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p.    |
| 28). In Abingdon, England on this night in 1966, an astronomer, a     |
| second scientist, and five others watched a domed disc w headlights   |
| maneuver in the sky for 90 minutes, beginning at 8:50 p.m. (Source:   |
| Flying Saucer Review, September-October 1966, p. 27). Four            |
| pinkish-white football-shaped objects, flying in a rectangular        |
| formation, paced a private plane flying between Ladd and Peru,        |
| Illinois in the early morning hours of this day in 1969. (Source:     |
| Data-Net Report, April 1971). In 1971 at 9:40 p.m. a domed disc with  |
| flashing red and green lights repeatedly buzzed the Smith family      |
| farmhouse in Gorae West, Victoria, Australia. Watched through         |
| binoculars, the Smiths could see that a silver flash emanated from    |
| the object when it swooped low over the farmyard. It moved back and   |
| forth at high speed for 55 minutes. (Source: Portland (Victoria)      |
| Observer, June 21, 1971). In 1972 a 350-meter wide bright orange      |
| object descended near George Air Force Base in California at 11:50    |
| p.m. More than thirty base personnel witnessed it. (Source: APRO      |
| Bulletin, May 1972).                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - In 1977 a 29-year-old man returned home in Austin, Texas at about     |
| 2:00 a.m. He saw a light in the distance he thought was an airplane   |
| but heard no engine sound. The object, a yellow-orange disc, flew     |
| along the shoreline of the lake, passing in front of the witness at   |
| his lake front home, and flew from view into the distance. (Source:   |
| MUFON Investigation files, case #890709). That same day in Portugal   |
| near the Castelo de Bode dam, a Portuguese Air Force Dornier 27       |
| aircraft encountered a dark daylight object about 13-15 meters in     |
| diameter as it flew out of some clouds. The magnetic compass onboard  |
| the plane malfunctioned during this close encounter. (Source:         |
| Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p. 50).                 |
|                                                                       |
