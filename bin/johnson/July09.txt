| 1947 - At eight o'clock in the evening a one-meter diameter disc flew |
| over Llano, Texas heading toward the southwest. It appeared to be     |
| spinning, and it possibly landed remotely. (Source: Jan Aldrich,      |

| 1951 - At 1:40 p.m. a white, disc-shaped UFO, spinning clockwise,     |
| confronted an F-51 over Dearing, Georgia with head-on passes several  |
| times. Pilot Kinmon said he felt the air disturbance as the UFO       |
| barrel-rolled around the airplane for 10 minutes. (Source: Richard    |

| 1952 - A large silver disc hovered over a tire factory in Miami,      |
| Oklahoma at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. It had a halo of smoke around |
| its rim. It descended to a low, nearby spot, then rose up and shot    |
| away toward the south. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database,     |
| case 2300).                                                           |

| 1952 - An aluminum colored disc maneuvered with flips and up-and-down |
| motion over Kutztown, Pennsylvania at 6:30 p.m. Observers took three  |
| poor-quality photographs of the object. (Source: Project Blue Book    |
| files counted in official statistics, case 1409).                     |

| 1953 - A disc swooped down over the Sheppard AFB hospital building in |
| Texas. It was glowing and moved very fast. It headed off toward the   |
| south. (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in official           |
| statistics, investigation report dated July 12, 1953).                |

| 1955 - A perfectly round, gray-white disc paced a pleasure boat for   |
| six minutes nine miles west of Newport Beach, California at 1:32 p.m. |
| It was surrounded by a "haze of fumes." It suddenly rose upward in a  |
| zigzag motion and flew into a cloudbank. (Sources: Project Blue Book  |
| files counted in official statistics; Morris Jessup, The UFO Annual,  |
| p. 225).                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1959 - An interesting parapsychological experiment closely tied to    |
| the UFO phenomenon was conducted on this day in Washington, DC by the |
| Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. Naval Intelligence. It was held  |
| at an office in a government building at the corner of 5th and K      |
| Streets (quadrant of the city not given). According to Lt. Colonel    |
| Robert Friend, the officer in charge of Project Blue Book at the time |
| and who was present at the session, telepathic communication was      |
| attempted through a psychic channeler who was also a military         |
| officer.                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| Colonel Friend was invited to attend a meeting with this officer, and |
| was given the following background information. A Canadian woman,     |
| Mrs. Swan, had come to their attention through the Canadian           |
| government. The Canadians had conducted an extensive investigation    |
| into Mrs. Swan's claims of contact with the aliens. With two Naval    |
| Intelligence officers present, she went into a trance and they asked  |
| her scientific and technical questions to which a woman of her        |
| education could not possibly know the answers. Yet as questions were  |
| put to her, she was able to answer quickly and easily, apparently     |
| with telepathic help from purported extraterrestrials. According to   |
| the report, the aliens represented an organization called the         |
| "Universal Association of Planets," and this group had a project      |
| monitoring Earth. The investigation took an unexpected turn when the  |
| woman informed one of the Naval officers that "they" were willing to  |
| answer questions directly through him, a Navy commander and           |
| intelligence officer--with no prior experience in telepathic          |
| communications. He took over, attempting to write down the answers to |
| questions put to him by his associate Naval officer.                  |
|                                                                       |
| The word traveled back quickly to Washington officials and a very     |
| skeptical CIA. Nevertheless, there was no strong reason to totally    |
| disbelieve the report of this respected Navy commander and his        |
| partner.                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| A meeting was arranged to be held in the security portion of a        |
| Washington government building. When trance state contact was         |
| achieved, several questions were put to him, and answers came back    |
| quickly. "Do you favor any government group or race?" and "Would      |
| there be a third world war?" Both were answered "No." The officials   |
| present then asked to see a spaceship. The commander, still in a      |
| trance, told the group to look out the window and they would have     |
| proof. They did promptly and a dark saucer-shaped object was seen     |
| hovering in the sky "at approximately 1400 hours."                    |
|                                                                       |
| They hurriedly made calls to the Washington radar center to confirm   |
| the presence of the object. They were told by the radar operators     |
| that they were experiencing a strange type of technical difficulty    |
| with their equipment, and radar was blocked for that quadrant of the  |
| sky over Washington. During the question and answer exchange the      |
| answer to one question indicated that the UFOs acknowledged           |
| difficulty in slipping through our radar net undetected. A number of  |
| other questions were put to the psychic, including whether Catholics  |
| were the chosen people. They were told that they were not. A          |
| follow-up contact session was attempted that same day with only       |
| limited success. It was indicated by the few answers that the         |
| Commander received that "this was not the right time" [emphasis       |
| added]. (Sources: Don Elkins, Secrets of the UFOs, p. 34; Robert      |

| 1962 - A clear photograph of a gray cloud with three lights was taken |
| at 11:10 p.m. by Dr. Taylor, an atmospheric scientist at the Cape     |
| Hallet Station in Antarctica. The cloud and lights moved toward the   |
| northeast at a low altitude. Other sightings of UFOs occurred that    |
| night at both the Chilean and Argentine Bases on the Palmer           |
| Archipelago in Antarctica. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen, UFOs: The     |

| 1965 - Miss Zielonka, age 30, witnessed a three-meter long metallic   |
| object take off from the ground in Moyeuvre, Moselle, France at 12:30 |
| in the afternoon. The object flew south toward Metz. (Sources:        |

| 1965 - At 3:00 p.m. at Santa Maria Island Airport on the Azores,      |
| airport clocks stopped and compasses spun wildly when a white         |
| cylindrical UFO flew over, flying toward the northeast against the    |
| wind. Later in the evening at 9:10 p.m. EDT, six witnesses saw a      |
| white nocturnal light that maneuvered in the sky over the Beckford    |
| Power Plant north of Cincinnati, Ohio. (Sources: (1) BUFORA Journal,  |

| 1967 - At 10:25 p.m. two boys shone a spotlight on a red and white    |
| UFO "fluttering across" the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg,        |
| Pennsylvania. It approached them with a sideways motion and beamed a  |
| white light at them. Making a humming sound, it backed up and         |
| disappeared. (Source: NICAP case investigation files, report dated    |

| 1968 - At 11:30 p.m. two girls met a "man from another world" who     |
| tried to talk to them in La Plata, Argentina. He was six feet tall,   |
| had red hair and blue eyes, and wore a one-piece coverall uniform and |
| a green visor that emitted flashes of light. The girls fled inside    |
| their house. Marks of four fingers were found on the door to their    |
| house. (Sources: FSR, January-February 1970, p. 30; David F. Webb &   |

| 1968 - Three hours after the Argentine humanoid contact, at 9:35 p.m. |
| PDT in Long Beach, California a diamond-shaped, grayish-white hazy    |
| mass was seen hovering under the full moon in the southeastern sky.   |
| At 10:05 p.m. it moved 55 degrees in a horizontal line due west. Ten  |
| minutes later it moved back to the first spot it had occupied. Five   |
| oval-shaped objects with clear edges maneuvered around it. (Source:   |

| 1970 - At 11:10 p.m. in Evillers, France a sphere, the apparent size  |
| of the full Moon, was observed hovering below a black cloud. It had a |
| crescent-shaped object above it. The presence of the UFOs was         |
| accompanied by a power outage in the area. (Source: Lumieres dans la  |

| 1973 - Senora Mabel Gorchs de Veron was crossing the central Plaza    |
| Colon at 6:30 p.m. in Mar del Plata, Argentina when she observed a    |
| bright green light that made her look up. One hundred meters above    |
| here was a circular object about 10 meters (33 feet) in diameter,     |
| emitting a blue glow. It had a dome on the upper past and a row of    |
| small windows around it, through which a dim light came from the      |
| inside. There were some "strange figures" looking out from these      |
| windows. The domed craft remained motionless for several seconds      |
| until a commercial aircraft flew by. The UFO followed it for a few    |
| moments before flying out over the sea. A newspaperman and a group of |
| office employees of the Argentine National Airline also observed the  |
| UFO. Later that evening, at 7:15 p.m. Sr. Nahuel Villegas succeeded   |
| in seeing some shadows moving around inside the same or similar       |
| object while looking through his telescope at 200x magnification. The |
| object was at a higher altitude, and remained in the sky for four     |
| hours, during which it was seen by hundreds of witnesses. (Sources:   |

| 1974 - At one o'clock in the morning an ellipse-shaped UFO with rows  |
| of lights along the side approached a police car on a road near       |
| Kingston, New York. It responded to the police spotlight by beaming a |
| bright light into the car. It then sped away. (Source: J. Allen Hynek |

| 1974 - A huge bullet-shaped object hovered over the port of East      |
| London, South Africa at 11:50 p.m. It had portholes along the sides   |
| of the craft. Electrical power fluctuated in the area at the time of  |
| the incident. At about the same time or approximately twenty minutes  |
| earlier, at 10:30 p.m. European Time, a dark disc blocked out the     |

| 1977 - A dull silver saucer-shaped UFO hovered off to the left side   |
| of a road in Flat Rock, Michigan at 2:30 a.m. It was only about 200   |
| feet above and the ground and 150 feet from the road. It had many red |
| and green lights around its rim, and a beam of light illuminated the  |
| ground for two minutes. The object floated away over the treetops     |
| moving toward the southwest. (Source: J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO   |

| 1978 - Two young men were walking along the railroad tracks on the    |
| outskirts of Butler, Ohio when they heard a noise from the bushes     |
| ahead. The youths saw a huge seven foot tall figure with large red    |
| glowing eyes. One of the witnesses panicked and ran home, the second  |
| remained transfixed by the creature and was unable to move. The being |
| was apparently beckoning to the young man to approach. The entity was |
| described as having a huge round head, large red eyes and was making  |
| an unusual growling noise. The witness was finally able to flee the   |
| area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978,     |

| 1996 - A triangular-shaped UFO landed in a field in Chillan, Chile.   |
| It left three circular indentations in the ground 1.7 meters apart    |
| and 10 cm across. That same day, while visiting the "Julia Set" crop  |
| formation opposite the Stonehenge megaliths in England, two friends   |
| of author Lucy Pringle became ill with nausea, fatigue, and memory    |
| problems. The symptoms persisted for three days following the visit.  |
