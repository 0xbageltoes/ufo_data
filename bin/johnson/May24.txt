| 1949 - A metallic disc with a tail fin was viewed through binoculars  |
| as it moved on a horizontal flight course in Rogue River, Oregon at   |
| 5:00 p.m. It gradually increased its speed until it reached that of a |
| jet aircraft. No propulsion method was apparent. (Source: Project     |

| 1954 - At 12:25 p.m. a B-17 on a photo mapping mission over Richmond, |
| Indiana and flying at an altitude of 18,500 feet, suddenly noticed a  |
| UFO below and to the right of the plane, moving on a different        |
| heading. Leo Brubaker, one of the crewmembers, took a photograph of   |
| the object, directed downward toward the clouds, which shows an       |
| overexposed bright round blob of light. (Sources: Project Blue Book   |

| the ground along Highway 3, 15 kilometers outside of Colonel          |
| Brandsen, Argentina at 11:50 p.m. Two human-like shadows were seen    |
| moving around inside the object. There were two witnesses named       |
| Atencio and Garcia and the sighting lasted for about a minute.        |

| 1962 - A robot-like being was sighted on a ranch in La Pampa,         |
| Argentina on this day by a rancher and his wife. Later an 18 foot in  |
| diameter burnt circle was found in the grass. (Sources: Encounters    |

| 1964 - Two witnesses in Millinocket, Maine saw a fiery orange object  |
| which followed their car at 9:00 p.m. When this object, which was now |
| seen to be spherical, approached to within 2-3 meters, the engine     |
| died and could not be restarted. The sphere was a fuzzy "ball of      |
| fire," only 75 centimeters in diameter. After five minutes, it flew   |
| away and the car could be started. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport |

| 1965 - At 12:05 a.m. a metallic domed saucer, jet black on top, with  |
| three triangular legs and a bank of floodlights around the main body  |
| was seen hovering and on the ground in Eton Ridge, Queensland,        |
| Australia by three men named Tilse, Burgess, and Juden. The object    |
| was 20-30 feet in diameter, 15 feet in height, and was at a minimum   |
| distance of 300 meters away. It made a buzzing or hissing sound, and  |
| made several maneuvers before it sped away. A circle 20 feet in       |
| diameter, consisting of a 3 foot 2 inch wide ring of flattened grass, |
| was found at the landing site the next morning. (Sources: Keith       |

| 1965 - At 6:40 p.m. hunters in Paso de las Carretas, Argentina saw    |
| through binoculars an object resembling an upside-down plate, very    |
| luminous, with a red light on top, flying in circles and landing on a |
| hilltop. The Lujan police sent a patrol, under Comm. Osvaldo Pagella, |
| which found a large, metallic object resting on the hill, but because |
| of the difficult terrain they could not get near the object before it |
| took off. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of |

| 1967 - Remy Deneuville and his family saw a white light to the side   |
| of the road in Arbonne, France at eleven p.m., but it was turned off  |
| when they drove to within 150 meters of its location. Minutes later,  |
| they saw a luminous spherical object fly away for several minutes.    |

| short occupant wearing a helmet leaned out of the craft to observe    |
| them; it then took off. (Sources: FSR, March-April 1971, p 30, citing |
