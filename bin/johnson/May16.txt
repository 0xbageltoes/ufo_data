| 1909 - At 1:00 a.m. five people driving in the mountains from         |
| Monmouth to Treginach, Gwent, Wales spotted a cigar-shaped object in  |
| the sky that maneuvered up and down and with turns. It seemed under   |
| perfect control, and had lights on the ends. At 7:45 p.m. a           |
| government inspector named Hervey in Broome, Suffolk, England         |
| reported that a cigar-shaped airship flew into a strong wind to the   |
| north-northeast toward Lowestoft. (Source: Carl Grove, FSR,           |

| 1954 - At least six observers in a 65 square kilometer area around    |
| Roma, Queensland, Australia sighted a yellow, V-shaped object flying  |
| to the east. It was estimated to be four meters wide. It turned over  |
| a house, and was absolutely silent as it flew. (Source: Larry Hatch,  |

| 1956 - At 10:15 p.m. in Woodstown, Salem County, New Jersey Mr.       |
| Locuson, a building contractor, watched an orange-red light zig-zag   |
| across the sky near the Delaware River and Delaware Bay. It went      |
| north, veered to the west, shot off to the south, and then zig-zagged |
| away. It was very fast and bright. (Sources: Salem Sunbeam, May 22,   |

| 1966 - Manuel Hernandez was coming back from the fields near Cordoba, |
| Spain when he saw a disc-shaped object land 100 meters away. Small    |
| beings resembling "green birds" came out for a few instants, then     |
| took off again. (Sources: Jacques Vallee: Passport to Magonia: A      |

| 1966 - At 12:30 p.m. a newspaper editor and officer manager in Temple |
| City, California were called out to the parking lot to see an unusual |
| object in the sky. A grayish-green object, changing shape from        |
| rectangular to roughly diamond-shaped, to a domed disc, was           |
| reflecting sunlight and apparently metallic. It was visible high in   |
| the northern sky.  Hazy heat waves surrounded it. For 15 minutes the  |
| object moved around lazily, then it suddenly sped off to the          |
| northeast and disappeared. The editor compared the speed to that of a |
| jet. At 1:10 p.m. a school principal saw children on the school's     |
| playground staring at a dark, disc-shaped object with a dome on top   |
| moving high overhead toward the east. At about the same time Charles  |
| Hardman was walking on Alessandra Street in Temple City when he       |
| noticed something that he first thought was a kite or balloon in the  |
| north-northwest sky moving slowly northeast. Through binoculars he    |
| saw that the object's surface was glossy, gray or black, yet light    |
| reflective. At times the top was obscured by hazelike smoke. Without  |
| the binoculars Hardman could see that this was due to different       |
| angles of vision as the object tumbled over in its path. It was       |
| shaped like a diamond with concave sides.                             |
|                                                                       |
| About 1:30 p.m. Mrs. Beverly Harding of Temple City, California was   |
| driving about a mile south of the center of town when she saw an      |
| aerial object paralleling the path of her car, but traveling a little |
| faster than she was. It looked like "a big bowl of jelly,             |
| plastic-like and shiny..." The object was roundish, but irregularly   |
| shaped. Finally, at 3:25 p.m. Mrs. Janice Oyler of San Gabriel,       |
| California was driving through Temple City when she saw a "black and  |
| silver cone-shaped object" in the sky. She stopped her car to watch,  |
| and saw the object bobbing around and circling slowly in one small    |
| area of the sky for about three minutes. (Sources: Los Angeles NICAP  |

| 1966 - At 3:30 p.m. a driver in a car in Cheshire, Connecticut had a  |
| close encounter with a 20-foot cylindrical UFO just four feet over    |
| the ground. It was hovering with no supports touching the ground. It  |
| had a metallic coral surface, and moved slowly. (Source: Larry Hatch, |

| 1967 - Roman and Jose Arribas observed an object land in a pine       |
| forest north of Nieva-Segovia, Cordoba, Spain. They saw "people"      |
| enter the ash-colored craft, which took off straight up, at high      |
| speed. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of    |

| 1967 - Half Moon Bay, San Mateo County, California. At 1:30 a.m. PDT  |
| a family saw a triangular object with a row of red lights and a white |
| light on one end. The object hovered over the ground near a pond,     |
| made a roaring sound, then took off, soaring over their house.        |

| 1967 - Four members of the crew of the SS Point Sur in the Gulf of    |
| Mexico at 10:10 p.m. had radar-visual confirmation with a UFO that    |
| was observed for 50 minutes, shape undetermined. (Source: J. Allen    |

| 1971 - At 9:30 p.m. four witnesses of the Whitlock family in          |
| Anderson, Indiana observed an unidentified aerial object after the    |
| power failed in their house. It was a Saturn-shaped UFO, making a     |
| high frequency sound. The object was the size of a house. The body of |
| the object was a silver ball illuminated by brilliant red, green,     |
| blue and white lights around its rim. It moved at tractor speed, and  |
| then hovered over the hog farmyard, setting off pandemonium of        |
| howling, squacking, and squealing by the dogs, chickens, pigs, and a  |
| parrot. The witnesses suffered vibration, numbness, and fear. They    |
| fled back into their house which had been rendered powerless. The     |
| entire incident lasted 20 minutes. A tree died at the site of the     |
| UFO's closest approach. (Source: Ted R. Phillips, Physical Traces     |

| 1973 - In the mid-afternoon an anonymous man "who enjoys an excellent |
| reputation in Bahia" was walking through his property by the river in |
| Parafuso, Bahia, Brazil carrying his shotgun, when he heard a soft    |
| humming. Then a man about 5 feet 3 inches tall appeared in front of   |
| him. He wore a brownish gray, tight-fitting coverall, with metallic   |
| colored boots and a wide belt with a very large blue buckle. His face |
| and his hands, which had long fingers, were pallid white, his ears    |
| were small and pointed, and his head "larger than ours." This man,    |
| speaking in Portuguese, told the witness not to be afraid and to put  |
| away his gun, saying that he was "not of this world-I come from a     |
| planet that you people call a satellite." He also said that his ship  |
| was hovering a few yards above them, invisible to the eye. Then he    |
| said, "Good bye, brother, I must go" and pushed a white button on his |
| belt buckle. At this a beam of light shone on him "and then drew      |
| away, carrying the man with it", he disappeared a few yards above the |
| man's head. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |

| 1976 - On this afternoon around 4 p.m. a 49-year-old woman waiting at |
| a bus stop in St. Louis, Missouri saw a strange looking man. He was   |
| normally dressed, but had pallid facial features and wore goggles. He |
| had a long sharp nose, a pointed chin, and a small mouth. She watched |
| him for 15 minutes before taking the bus. (Source: David F. Webb &    |

|                                                                       |
| 1979 - Arlindo Gabriel dos Santos was hunting with two friends in a   |
| forest near Baependi, Minas Gerais State, Brazil around 10:30 a.m.    |
| when he became separated from the others. Sr. dos Santos next saw an  |
| object descend towards the ground in a clearing. He approached to     |
| within 180 meters, and saw that the object was shaped like a          |
| "telephone booth" about 1 meter in height. He had been carrying his   |
| Kodak camera with him, and was able to take a snapshot of the object  |
| before it abruptly disappeared in plain sight. He walked to where the |
| craft had been, and then saw another object swiftly descend. This     |
| next object was shaped like a toy top, and a little larger than the   |
| previous object. It had a small propeller like apparatus on top and a |
| long pointy protrusion on the bottom. As he tried to photograph this  |
| second object he heard a whooshing sound and the craft was quickly    |
| enveloped in smoke. He got closer to the smoke, and then he noticed   |
| yet a third craft descending overhead. This one was barrel shaped and |
| about one meter tall. It balanced above the ground before landing. It |
| too had a large propeller at one end, and was covered with red        |
| stripes. This object too suddenly vanished when he tried to approach. |
|                                                                       |
| He finally saw a huge white, egg-shaped object descend to the ground. |
| The ovoid craft had a pointy top, and a fin-like protrusions on each  |
| side. Next to the fins Arlindo could see several windows. While it    |
| descended it produced a horrific noise like a choking motor, and as   |
| it neared the ground it put out four, leg like landing pods. Arlindo  |
| approached and tried to take another photograph, but there was a      |
| sudden flash that temporarily blinded him and left his eyes           |
| irritated. Frightened, he dropped the camera and ran, but was only    |
| able to get about 10 meters before he became frozen in place, unable  |
| to move. He said it felt like someone had grabbed him from behind.    |
| Behind him he noticed two men wearing helmets with visors and gloves. |
| Behind their transparent visors he could see human faces. They        |
| grabbed him, each taking one arm. He begged them to let him go in the |
| name of God, but he received the answer, "In the name of God, we are  |
| all brothers, we don't harm anybody." The voice seemed to originate   |
| from a box like apparatus on their backs. He was taken towards the    |
| landed object. As he got near it he could feel an intense cold        |
| surrounding it. Another helmeted figure stood by a ladder extending   |
| from the craft, looking from side to side. The man asked Arlindo if   |
| he had seen something, which sounded to him like a "Zurca." Arlindo   |
| thought he could have been referring to one of the previous smaller   |
| aerial craft. That man then extended a gloved hand and pulled Arlindo |
| inside the craft through a square shaped doorway. The atmosphere      |
| inside the craft was pleasant and cool, and there was a smell like    |
| "baby powder" in the air. There were other men sitting around on      |
| seats in the room. He described them as human like, wearing dark      |
| tight-fitting outfits. The men had large slanted eyes, thin noses,    |
| and large mouths and they seemed to operating some type of unknown    |
| machinery. The men stood up and began conversing among themselves in  |
| an unknown language. Suddenly from another room a heavyset woman      |
| emerged. She wore a white uniform, gloves, but no helmet. The witness |
| described her as good looking, tanned, with long light fine hair. The |
| woman and one of the men then took him into a corridor. He then       |
| entered a room where he saw a square shaped object in the middle. The |
| man pushed a button on the wall and the object rose up. The object    |
| resembled a large piece of marble. The woman then took out a long     |
| wand like object and pointed it at the object. On the object the      |
| witness then saw an image of the planet Earth and other planets. At   |
| this point the man the removed his helmet and the witness could see   |
| that he had very short, light colored hair. When Arlindo left the     |
| craft he was told to cover his eyes and not to look as the object     |
| left. He followed these instructions and did not see the object       |
| depart. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1979,   |

| 1979 - On the same day as Arlindo dos Santos's close encounter of the |
| third kind in Brazil a mechanic in Charleston, South Carolina felt    |
| compelled to return to a spot where he had previously seen a UFO. A   |
| disc-shaped craft landed, and he was given a metal bar as a gift,     |
| along with the message that the occupants will return again. (Source: |

| 1987 - On this day an airline crew tracked a UFO on their weather     |
| radar. A Canadian Air International Boeing 737 was en route from      |
| Toronto, Ontario to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Capt. Rick Olsen was  |
| flying at 31,000 feet (9,000 meters) when he and his first officer    |
| observed an unidentified object on their weather radar. The radar     |
| track indicated an object "about the size of an aircraft carrier"     |
| about 50 miles away at approximately their altitude, and traveling on |
| roughly the same course at 5,400 mph (8,600 km/hr). The radar target  |
| lasted about four minutes. Weather was hazy at the time, and the      |
| aircraft was not close enough to make visual contact. (Sources:       |

| 1990 - At eight o'clock in the evening two children playing outside   |
| in Tecumseh, Oklahoma called their mother to come see a UFO. The      |
| object was gray/lead in color and surrounded by mist. One of          |
| the witnesses saw windows illuminated in yellow. Others saw a yellow  |
| flame behind the object. The object accelerated out of view. The      |
| entire event lasted two minutes. (Source: Jean Waller-Seifried, MUFON |

| 1996 - Several witnesses reported seeing a large blue, spherical      |
| object hovering low over a field in San Pedro Toxin, Jalisco State,   |
| Mexico at 11:30 p.m. Seven dwarfish figures about 80 cm tall, who     |
| emitted a luminous green glow, were seen moving very quickly on the   |
| ground near the object. They also seemed to have bright lights on     |
| their heads. The entire scene suddenly vanished in plain sight.       |

| 1998 - A very large, dark disc-shaped UFO hovered over a giant        |
| hydroelectric dam and lake, Lago de Colbun in southern Chile, causing |
| EM effects. It was so large it covered the valley. The UFO was        |
| witnessed by over 30 people, who described it as a a gigantic disc,   |
| "dark (not black), with a big orange light on the bottom (middle) and |
| small lights that moved around on the outer part (rim) of the         |
| object." It flew off to the east. Lago de Colbun is Chile's biggest   |
| hydroelectric dam and one of the largest in South America. It is      |
| located 200 kilometers south of Santiago de Chile. The UFO reportedly |
| hovered at 1,000 meters above the ground and remained in view for 20  |
| minutes, before flying across the lake and into the Andes Mountains.  |
| Witnesses described the object as "so big that it seemed to cover the |
| whole valley."                                                        |

| According to ufologist Luis Sanchez Perry, "They call the UFOs        |
| robones (thieves) because that they say they steal electricity.       |
| Before they had the high-tech plant, they didn't have many blackouts  |
| (one or two in a month), but now they have three in a week." "UFOs    |
| have been seen coming out of Lake Colbun near the high tension        |
| wires," he reported, 'absorbing electricity, absorbing water, and     |
| some of them have gone at high speed through the valley towards the   |
| hydroelectric plant," coming within a few hundred meters of the dam   |
| before disappearing. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case  |

| 2003 - At 1:30 a.m. four triangular UFOs were sighted over Yosemite   |
| National Park in California; one of the crafts was very large and     |
| transparent. Camping up on Yosemite at about 7,000 feet elevation,    |
| the night was clear and cool when the witnesses were just about to    |
| turn in for the night and they saw a bright blue flash south of their |
| campsite. Next, they saw one very large triangular craft appear after |
| the flash. This was followed by two more flashs, not blue, northwest  |
| of the campsite and two smaller craft appeared, and then a fourth     |
| craft appeared southwest. This last one was the largest and almost    |
| transperent; we could see the stars through the craft. "At this point |
| we were very frightened," the main witness reported. There was no     |
| noise from the craft, and the animals around the campsite and your    |
| normal forest sounds had gone silent. The four witnesses went into    |
| their truck and armed themselves, and decided to leave when they saw  |
| a very bright red flash and looked out the truck windows and the      |
| objects were gone. They packed their camping gear and headed home     |
| very frightened and confused.(Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO   |

| 2003 - A witness was driving his sister to the bus stop in Rancho     |
| Santa Margarita, California at 11:00 a.m. when they looked up into    |
| the clear sky and observed a shiny disc or sphere that was hovering   |
| in one place for a minute while spinning. It glistened at certain     |
| spots when it was hit by the sunlight. (Source: Peter Davenport,      |

| 2005 - Two triangular-shaped craft were sighted in Oklahoma City,     |
| Oklahoma at 7:15 p.m. When they were first seen they were hovering,   |
| then they began following each other at a high rate of speed. They    |
| had three extremely bright lights: two white and one                  |
| red.(Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, May 2005 |

| 2007 - A large triangle craft with more lights than normal lights was |
| sighted over Ypsilanti, Michigan at 1:00 a.m. by a witness driving    |
| home. It was turning at right angles, first quickly and then slowly.  |
| It had three lights, portholes, or circles that were white on all     |
| three leading edges (sides and middle); on the bottom there were four |
| more circles--3 white ones at each corner of the triangle and a       |
| larger red light in the middle of it. It was larger than a plane.It   |
| flew overhead slowly, where it stopped 150 yards from the witness for |
| about 40 seconds, then turned 120 degrees and went around in          |
| circles around the freeway, then it headed out over the city where it |
| disappeared out of view. The sighting lasted five minutes. (Source:   |

| 2007 - A cylindrical UFO was sighted in Columbus, Missouri at around  |
| 1:00 p.m. The witness reports, "While sitting outside of my business, |
| visiting with a customer, we all looked up and saw a cylindrically    |
| shaped object traveling west above Highway 70. We all watched the     |
| object until it went out of sight. It was silver in color and did not |
| have wings or a tail." They were not able to discern its true size or |
| the distance of object, although it seemed to be flying quite low.    |

| 2010 - At 9:40 a.m. in South Kingston, Rhode Island a stationary gray |
| cylinder slowly accelerated, turned white, then opaque, and           |
| disappeared in 30 seconds. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at around    |
| 9:35 p.m. EDT the main witness was in his backyard smoking a          |
| cigarette on a very clear night, watching some kids play basketball   |
| in the courts. He looked up and noticed three disc-shaped objects     |
| skimming just under the cloud line. They were not balloons,           |
| helicopters or airplanes. They made no sound and were very precise in |
| their movment. He called his sister to come out back to see what he   |
| was witnessing while they flew away. He did see all three objects     |
| very clearly, and the underneath of all three, but he did not have    |
| enough time to grab a camera. They were very disc-shaped objects with |
| a white glow, and underneath of all three he noticed they all had     |
| this same faded black zone where he guessed the engine would be. At   |
| 9:30 p.m. CDT in Hugo, Minnesota two bright lights, pentagonal in     |
| shape and red in color, moved across the northern sky, hovered, then  |
| flew off quickly. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting    |

| 2010 - At 7:00 p.m. two friends in Jeffersonville, Indiana were       |
| walking to a gas station on a golf course near their home when they   |
| spotted a small circular white object in the sky. It was not moving,  |
| just stationary in the sky. Then the light from the object became     |
| brighter and brighter, and it turned into different colors: green,    |
| pink or red, and then blue. It got so bright that you could no longer |
| see its original shape. Then the light shrank back to the white       |
| color, and within an instant it was gone, almost as if it shot out of |
| the universe in a matter of seconds. (Source: Peter Davenport,        |
