| 1948 - Three men in dark drab flight suits were seen flying through   |
| the air at 250 feet altitude over Longview, Washington in the middle  |
| of the afternoon. They circled the city as fast as a freight train.   |
| They had apparatus on their sides that looked like they may have been |
| wearing guns in holsters. They were seen briefly by three witnesses   |
| with the last names of Johnson and Pittman. (Source: Longview (WA)    |

| 1950 - Two ferrymen in Saint Ignace, Michigan watched a flying saucer |
| race all over the sky over the Strait. It gave off a plasma glow. On  |
| the same day two railroad workers saw a flying saucer the size of a   |
| large airplane 3,000 feet over their train. Two silver discs were     |
| seen flying over Jericho and Ramallah in Israel and Palestine. At     |
| eleven o'clock in the morning a silver, rotating disc flew over a pen |
| factory in Fort Madison, Iowa. It left a shower of sparks behind it.  |

| 1957 - An ovoid shaped UFO hovered over a beach in Tahunanui, New     |
| Zealand at 3:30 p.m. It had sharply defined edges, and was five times |
| the apparent size of the moon. It suddenly shot away to the           |
| north-northwest. (Source: Loren Gross, The Fifth Horseman of the      |

| 1966 - At 2:30 a.m. in Warminster, England two Army officers          |
| witnessed a top-shaped UFO fly from the east to the west at a high    |
| rate of speed. The UFO turned and rose, leaving a trail in the sky.   |
| It made no sound. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case     |

| 1966 - At 9:30 p.m. in Daniels Park near Denver, Colorado six         |
| 17-year-old young men and women were in a shelter in the park when    |
| they heard footsteps on the roof. Two boys went out to investigate    |
| and heard a buzzing noise that seemed to surround them. In the field  |
| they saw two red lights each about a foot in diameter. Meanwhile      |
| those left behind in the shelter witnessed a very tall man dressed in |
| black standing outside. They left and started back to their car. When |
| the buzzing started again they saw two blue lights low in the sky,    |
| which were joined by a very bright white light. Watching from the     |
| car, they continued to hear the sound, and saw "four things like      |
| footballs with domes on them." They drove away---with difficulty, for |
| the engine kept stalling---and were followed by a "huge light" which  |
| did not reflect in the rearview mirror. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek,     |

| 1966 - That same evening several luminous objects with bright red    |
| lights were seen hovering at a low altitude in Lincoln, Nebraska.     |
| They sped away. (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence Volume II: A  |

| 1967 - At 11:00 p.m. three men in Balmoral, Victoria, Australia       |
| witnessed a small, silent ovoid-shaped UFO and shone a spotlight on   |
| it. The UFO buzzed the witnessed in response. (Source: APRO Bulletin, |

| 1974 - A multicolored cone-shaped UFO hovered over a car between      |
| Olympia and Lacey, Washington for several minutes on this night. It   |
| made a high pitched whining sound, then took off at a tremendous      |
| speed. (Source: Center for UFO Studies files May 1974, citing         |
| newspaper clipping).                                                  |

| 1976 - A couple driving their car in Kontich, Belgium at 9:15 p.m.    |
| saw a dirigible-shaped UFO cross the road at a fairly low altitude.   |
| It had red and white spotlights around its perimeter. At 11:40 p.m.   |
| in Laroque Timbaut, France a three meter tall pinkish, ovoid object,  |
| 1 meter in diameter, hung just above the ground. It then jumped at    |
| distance of 200 meters almost instantaneously. (Sources: J. Delaire,  |
| UFO Register, Volume 7 (1976), p. 31; Larry Hatch, U computer         |

| 1977 - Mr. Cyril John, age 64, a former local political leader, was   |
| up early for an early start to London at 5:00 a.m. in Milford Haven,  |
| Pembrokeshire, Wales when he noticed a light shining in his bedroom   |
| window. Looking out he observed two objects. The first was a          |
| silvery-gray egg-shaped object with a bright orange-red light on top  |
| of it. It was about four feet across and was rocking gently in the    |
| air about 60 meters away. The second was a seven to eight foot tall   |
| humanoid figure, who floated in the air with arms out and legs bent   |
| back, like a "free fall parachutist." There was only about 35 feet    |
| between the man and the observer. No features could be seen on the    |
| figure's face, and it wore a uniformly silver-gray "boiler suit." It  |
| remained motionless in the air for more than 25 minutes. Then both    |
| the being and the ovoid object began slowly moving off, gradually     |
| disappearing from view in the distance. (Source: David F. Webb and    |

| 1979 - Several cars experienced electrical system failures on highway |
| 33 in Bigand, Argentina at eight o'clock in the morning. Mr. Celotto, |
| a farmer, saw an eight meter wide disc land, and circular ground      |
| traces were found later in a soybean field. (Source: MUFON UFO        |

| 1982 - A mushroom cap shaped flying disc paced two people in a car in |
| Fort Wayne, Indiana. It had hazy lights and made odd maneuvers, not   |
| jerky but always smoothly executed. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer          |
| database, citing APRO Bulletin, June 1982).                           |

| 1994 - The witnesses were out in an isolated area of Victoria,        |
| Argentina at 9:30 p.m. when they spotted a large white object         |
| apparently on the ground about 200 meters away. The object suddenly   |
| became brighter illuminating the nearby trees. A white line was now   |
| visible on the object, and they now saw 3 small lights moving within  |
| the object. The object grew in size, resembling a translucent bubble. |
| Inside they could see eight to ten figures standing in a group.       |
| Seconds later a thick white fog enveloped the area. The object dimmed |
| and shot straight up at high speed. Ground traces were found.         |

| 2002 - A triangular formation of white lights was seen by a police    |
| woman at 3:16 a.m. in Hellifield, near Skipton, England. The lights   |
| travelled slowly through the sky in perfect unison, and then made a   |
| banking maneuver before disappearing from view. (Source: UFO Magazine |
