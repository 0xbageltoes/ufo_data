| 1896 - On this day in 1896 an airship descended from the sky 15 miles |
| north of Pacific Grove, California and landed on the Pacific Ocean.   |
| Three human occupants aboard guided it to shore and then hid it in    |
| the woods, according to the two witnesses. (Sources: San Francisco    |

| 1956 - At 9:45 p.m. a luminous ovoid object maneuvered in the sky,    |
| descended, and then ascended to a somewhat higher altitude in Forest  |
| Lake, Minnesota. The witness, Mr. Moffett, chased it in his car. The  |
| UFO flew to the east slowly, then turned toward the south and flew    |
| away. (Source: Leonard H. Stringfield, CRIFO Orbit, March 1957, p.    |

| 1973 - At 6:00 p.m. several teenagers in Levittown, Pennsylvania      |
| observed a UFO with lights "flying funny" up and down the Delaware    |
| River. It had three flashing red lights, and made no sound. It next   |
| hovered in the sky for one minute, then vanished in the clear sky. At |
| 6:35 p.m. several city residents of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania        |
| watched a UFO over the Linden Avenue area of the city, including some |
| who viewed it through binoculars. It looked like an acorn, with a     |
| green bottom. It was blinking slowly and was surrounded by a gray     |
| mist or haze. At 11:25 p.m. a cartographer and his wife saw UFO with  |
| four blinking white lights and a red light in the center while        |
| driving in northeast Philadelphia on Interstate 95. The object had a  |
| rectangular-shaped bottom, and a hat-shaped side view; it flew to the |
| north, met up with a cluster of lights, and then flew off towards     |
| Bristol. (Sources: Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, December 3, 1973;   |

| 1973 - At 7 p.m. a strange, robot-like creature about four feet tall, |
| with large round glowing eyes 18 inches wide, was seen in Korning     |
| Wood, Quebec, Canada at a distance of about 200 feet from the house   |
| of the witness. It possessed a large round head, long arms, and a     |
| bright red glow that emanated from behind its head. It disappeared    |
| behind the observer's house. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid     |

| 1973 - A 150 foot wide disc hovered in front of the car of a Mr. &    |
| Mrs. Gerard while driving on the interstate highway near Wilsonville, |
| Oregon this evening. The object spun in a circular motion, and        |
| traveled up the I-5 freeway. It had circular portholes two to three   |
| feet deep, one inverted C-shaped area with no lights, and a blue      |
| light on top. It went behind a hill and was gone from view. (Source:  |

| 1974 - Stephen Jenkins of Croydon, Greater London, England woke up at |
| 3 a.m. to hear clearly audible footsteps on the stairs. Two beings    |
| appeared on the landing. Their body texture was "something like       |
| closely compressed pulpy leaves." Their faces were reddish, with      |
| yellow eyes with hard black pupils. Around them was a translucent,    |
| faintly luminous "box like structure." In a moment they were gone.    |

| 1974 - Driving home near Frederick, Wisconsin at 10:30 p.m. William   |
| Bosak, a 69-year-old farmer, noticed something parked on the opposite |
| side of the road ahead. Slowing down to look, his headlights          |
| illuminated an object with a curved, transparent front, behind which  |
| could be seen a figure visible from the waist up, with arms upraised  |
| over his head, as if in terror. The figure seemed to be a little      |
| taller than a tall man, and had a square face with hair "sticking     |
| straight out from the sides." It had long, narrow ears that stuck     |
| straight out, brown furry arms, and a hairy torso. The eyes were      |
| large and protruding. Frightened, Mr. Bosak sped up past the object,  |
| which was surrounded by a kind of fog. As he passed, the car          |
| "darkened, as if in shadow," or his headlights dimmed, and the        |
| witness heard a soft whooshing sound. No ground traces were found at  |
| the site the following day. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,   |

| 1975 - Sandra Larson awoke at four o'clock in the morning to find two |
| beings standing beside her bed in Fargo, North Dakota. They were the  |
| same type she had seen on August 26th: about six feet tall, brown     |
| vinyl like bodies with metallic looking arms, and mummy-like heads    |
| bandaged up in tape (with the eyes remaining visible). They floated   |
| her out through the bedroom wall to a field several blocks away,      |
| where they took her onboard a UFO. When she was taken from the craft  |
| they were in a desert landscape with white sand, lit by a celestial   |
| body resembling the moon. She was taken into a square building where  |
| a humanoid--she thought of him as a scientist--interrogated her using |
| telepathy. Then she was taken home, again floating through a closed   |
| door into her house. She thought about taking a bath, and the         |
| entities asked her what "soap" was; she took them to her basement and |
| gave them a cup of laundry detergent. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted   |

| 1977 - A Waimata Valley, New Zealand farmer had awakened at three     |
| a.m. when he heard his dogs barking in the kennels. When he went      |
| outside he saw a 50-foot in diameter saucer-shaped object on the      |
| ground, about 100 feet away from his house. It was red in color and   |
| he could see it had two open doors or ports. Near his dog kennel were |
| two silver-suited humanoid figures of slight build, about 4 feet 8    |
| inches tall; they were carrying off one of his dogs, which appeared   |
| to be unconscious. He got his gun and opened fire on the creatures,   |
| hitting one. They dropped the animal and the figure that was hit      |
| staggered off into the bushes while the second one entered the        |
| object, which then took off. The dog was comatose for a few minutes,  |
| but later recovered. Friends visiting the farmer later found him in a |
| state of shock, fearful that they would return for retribution.       |
| Footprints were found at the site. The incident also occurred during  |
| a rash of UFO sightings in the area. The next evening there were      |
| reports of hovering objects in Invercargill and Gore Matura, New      |
| Zealand at 10:20 p.m. and shortly after 11:00 p.m. (Sources: Allan    |

| 1977 - Five 45-foot in diameter domed discs hovered over Roseville,   |
| Michigan at 12:20 a.m. Three more discs joined them. Two figures were |
| seen inside each dome. All flew away to the northwest after a couple  |
| of minutes. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, October 1978).           |

| voice on his car radio, and next two reddish-orange balls of light    |
| appeared near the horizon before winking out. Dr. Willy Smith of the  |
| UNICAT project rated the witness as highly reliable. (Sources:        |

| 1979 - While stopped for gas at night on the Corso Europa highway in  |
| Genoa, Italy F. Zanfretta, age 27, was approached by a tall figure    |
| with an oval-shaped head who wore a loose fitting windbreaker. At the |
| same time a fog like mist surrounded the gas pumps and the figure     |
| ordered Zanfretta to accompany him. Zanfretta obeyed, and he was      |
| eventually taken onboard a craft which had landed in a wooded area    |
| near Marzano. While flying over the area he was reportedly shown the  |
| earth from outer space, looking like a marble free-floating in space. |
| The occupants of the craft also showed him numerous photographs of    |
| friends and others, whom he did not know. He was also shown a large   |
| glass cylinder filled with a blue liquid, inside of which floated a   |
| huge hairy ape-like "Bigfoot" creature. In another container he saw a |
| horrible creature resembling a prehistoric pterodactyl. In yet a      |
| third container he saw a large toad-like creature. While onboard the  |
| craft he met a tall green-colored reptilian like humanoid who called  |
| himself "Dargos", whom he had met on a previous occasion. The tall    |
| humanoid reportedly offered Zanfretta a transparent sphere that       |
| contained a rotating golden pyramid as proof of their existence, but  |
| Zanfretta refused to accept it. Allegedly, local residents reported a |
| power outage near Marzano on this night. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, |

| 1987 - At 3:00 a.m. Ed Walters heard some strange voices outside his  |
| home in Gulf Breeze, Florida speaking Spanish. Thirty minutes later   |
| his dog started barking, so he went out on his porch to check and     |
| when he pulled a blind he saw a four foot tall Grey humanoid being    |
| with large almond-shaped eyes looking at him. The being wore wome     |
| type of shield over its eyes, chest, and lower body and was holding a |
| lighted rod in its right hand. The creature turned around and ran     |
| towards a nearby open field. Ed Walters chased the creature, and was  |
| suddenly struck by a blue beam of light. He was unable to move his    |
| legs and fell to the ground, as if the beam was holding him down.     |
| When he was finally able to move, he ran back to the house and        |
| grabbed his camera and his gun. He photographed a large, bowl-shaped  |
| craft with darkened portholes and an illuminated orange ring on the   |
| bottom. He could also see a beam of blue light shining down from it   |
| onto the ground. (Sources: Donald Ware, MUFON UFO Journal, issue #    |
