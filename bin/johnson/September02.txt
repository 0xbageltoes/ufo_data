| 1952 - At three o'clock in the morning Mr. Turason, a radar operator  |
| working for ground control at Midway Airport in Chicago, Illinois     |
| picked up 40 targets flying in miscellaneous directions, up to 175    |

| airliner. The radar sightings lasted a total of eight hours.          |

| 1952 - At 5:50 p.m. two military observers at Davis-Monthan AFB in    |
| Arizona saw seven large saucer-shaped objects, identical in           |
| appearance, in changing formations. When they changed direction for   |

| course with their aircraft. At the last minute the UFO levelled out.  |
| It subsequently made a 90 degree and then it executed a 180 degree    |
| turn. It descended to 700 feet or less, slowed and seemed to hover.   |

| 1954 - Twelve-year-old John Jacob Swain of Coldwater, Kansas had just |
| finished driving a tractor at 10:00 p.m. when he saw a dark           |
| complexioned little man about the size of a five year old child       |
| crouching about 20 feet away. The man had pointed ears and a pointed  |
| nose, and wore shiny clothing. He also was carrying two two-foot long |
| cylinders on his back. He ran or glided, apparently floating across   |
| the ground, to a 50 foot wide disc-shaped object hovering five feet   |
| above the ground. He jumped in and took off without tilting the       |
| saucer. Lights shone from windows or the craft as it flew off faster  |
| than a jet. At the site were found numerous pear-shaped footprints 2  |
| inches wide x 4.5 inches in length, with very narrow heels. (Sources: |

| golf course in Dayton, Ohio. It illuminated an area 40 feet wide. The |
| sighting lasted more than 30 minutes, but the UFO vanished when the   |

| 1958 - At nine o'clock several violent bluish-white flashes were seen |
| at ground level in Docelles, France. The next day four deep           |
| rectangular imprints were found in the ground at the site. The        |
| imprints were five meters apart, and arranged in a square. (Source:   |

| 1960 - In the middle of the night Mr. & Mrs. Palmes noticed a large   |
| dark gray object, covered with tiles and as large as a three-storey   |
| building, in a nearby field while driving down a highway north of     |
| Bunnell, Florida. The UFO then came and hovered over road, only 30-50 |
| feet away. The car's lights and engine died. The wife recalls seeing  |
| short people in tight-fitting uniforms, and her husband being in a    |
| trance. There was an undisclosed period of missing time. (Source:     |

| 1967 - At 1:30 a.m. Ms. Barbara Ward, awakened by her baby, glanced   |
| out her window on the Bentilee Estate, Stoke-on-Trent, England and    |
| saw, a very bright yellow object with an orange light on top in the   |
| adjacent field. It was shaped like an inverted saucer. It appeared to |
| be on the ground or just above it, and its light fluctuated in        |
| intensity. She could hear no sound, though she was behind a glass     |
| window. She reported to investigators Roger Stanway and Anthony Pace  |
| that she "half imagined" she could see shadowy figures moving back    |
| and forth in front of the bright light generated by the object. She   |
| could not be certain because the bright light caused her eyes to      |
| strain when looking at the object. After watching for half an hour    |
| she became tired and went back to bed. The UFO had not moved during   |
| her observation. Subsequent examination of the field failed to reveal |
| any traces. This sighting occurred during a spate of several UFO      |
| incidents in the same area. (Sources: Roger Stanway & Anthony Pace,   |

| 1967 - On this night Nelson Gutierrez, a salesman, encountered a      |
| landed UFO on the Plains Highway, near the Hato Viejo farm outside of |
| Caracas, Venezuela. A being emerged from the object, and according to |
| press acounts the witness claimed to have taken a photograph of the   |
| being. A copy of this photograph was not made available, and the      |
| photographer's intent was to sell it when he had it developed.        |

| 1968 - A brilliant royal blue ball of light with a whitish-yellow     |
| outer ring hovered in the northwestern sky over Lockleys, South       |
| Australia for awhile, then dropped like a stone, veering to the left. |
| It made no sound and left no smoke trail. (Source: Michael Hervey,    |

| 1971 - On this night a 17-year-old woman named James witnessed a UFO  |
| hanging motionless in the sky for more than 30 minutes over Great     |
| Barr, England. It changed shape and color, and disappeared at high    |
| speed. It had green L-shapes with red light at each end. It became    |
| oblong, then cigar shaped. (Sources: Mrs. K. Smith, BUFORA Journal,   |

| 1973 - On his way to work at 1:30 p.m. an older man driving south of  |
| Milroy, Indiana a man saw a green, domed disc-shaped object descend   |
| making a swishing sound, and he watched the object approach in his    |
| car's rearview mirror. The UFO scooped up his car like a forklift.    |
| The front and side windows were blacked out, and he could only see    |
| out through the rear window. He had 95 minutes of missing time during |
| his abduction experience. (Sources: Richard Nottingham, MUFON field   |

| 1973 - Residents of Big Bear Lake, California reported a series of    |
| sightings starting at around 11:00 p.m. of unidentified objects with  |
| flashing lights. A hovering multi-colored object was observed, with a |

| began moving in various directions, then accelerated and sped away    |
| toward the north. (Source: Big Bear News, September 27, 1973).        |

| 1975 - A silent, dark disc-shaped object was seen at 12:30 a.m.       |
| pulsating on the roadside of a highway in Chesterland, Ohio. It then  |
| hovered at treetop level, and shot straight up very quickly. (Source: |

| 1976 - At 5:00 a.m. a UFO with multiple lights was involved in a      |
| close encounter in Jaca, Huesca, Spain. It moved toward the car of    |
| two of the witnesses, circled around it, and then moved over it. A    |
| truck driver was an independent witness. The UFO had a solid top, but |
| indistinct bottom; it was 7-8 meters in diameter, and made a soft     |
| whistling sound. Physiological effects were reported. (Source:        |

| 1978 - A metallic-looking, cigar-shaped object was seen taking off    |
| from a field of maize at 8:10 a.m. in San Michele, Veneto, Italy. It  |
| made a hissing sound. An area of crushed and dehydrated plants was    |
| found at the landing site. It was 6.5 meters by 3 meters (20 feet x   |
| 10 feet). There were reportedly several witnesses, including the main |
| witness, a 14-year-old named Pozzi. (Sources: FSR, March 1979, p. 6;  |

| 1979 - The witness, a surveyor, was out picking mushrooms at five     |
| o'clock in the afternoon in a wooded part of Petushka, Russia when he |
| came upon a large, shiny, metallic looking mushroom-shaped craft on   |
| the ground. The bottom half of the craft emitted a soft pink light,   |
| and the top domed section was encased in an orange mist. The craft    |
| appeared to be spinning and emitting luminous flashes from its edges. |
| Two short men emerged from the object. They were strongly built with  |
| broad shoulders and strong chests. They wore black tight-fitting      |
| suits that covered their entire bodies. The suits had two small slits |
| at eye level. They were talking among themselves in a language that   |
| sounded more like the twittering of birds than anything else. They    |
| appeared to inspect the craft, and then were somehow sucked up inside |
| it. The UFO subsequently took off. On the spot where the object had   |
| been resting the soil was found to be totally sterile with all living |
| organisms completely absent. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |

| 1994 - On this night on Dry Creek, the Greenhorn Mountains, Huerfano  |
| County, Colorado a local hunter was at his campsite when a large      |
| group of "aliens dressed in camo appeared", and before he could       |
| react, he was gassed, captured, and tied up. They never spoke to him, |
| and never fed him. He claims he survived by eating grasshoppers. The  |
| camoflage wearing, human looking entities appeared to be conducting   |
| "some sort of maneuvers." The group then began boarding a small,      |
| silver colored flying object, and the witness was astonished when the |
| object appeared to expand in size to accommodate them all. The object |
| then took off, morphed into the shape of a bear, then morphed into "a |
| three headed wolf", then turned into a cloud. Later, law enforcement  |
| personnel searched the area and found the witness's truck trashed,    |
| the remains of his campfire, and "his half-burnt clothes" scattered   |
| around the area. At the same time a second hunter was reported        |
| missing in the same area, but when he finally showed up, he "raced    |
| away in his truck without saying a word." a local hunter was captured |
| by human-like alien beings, dressed in camoflauge. Small silver UFO   |
| grew in size, changed shape 2x. 2nd hunter also missing, wouldn't say |
| why. (Sources: Christopher O'Brien, The Mysterious Valley, p. 254;    |
