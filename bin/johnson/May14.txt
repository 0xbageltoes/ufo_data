| 1909 - On this night a witness named Egenes reported that a           |
| cigar-shaped object directed five beams of light at a ship's bridge   |
| off the coast of Blyth, Northumberland, England. It then shot away a  |
| mile to another ship, and did the same thing again. (Source: Carl     |

| 1955 - At 12:15 a.m. in Dinan, Cotes-Nord, France Mr. M. Droguet      |
| sighted a large domed disc hovering five feet above the courtyard     |
| outside his house. Two short humanoids in Michelin Man spacesuits     |
| exited the craft. Both wore boxes on their chests. Mr. Droguet was    |
| paralyzed in place and could not move during the encounter, and he    |
| was temporarily blinded by a blue-green light. The men walked with an |
| ackward gait. The UFO left silently by making a vertical ascent.      |

| had observed a dark-gray, circular craft, 20 meters in diameter with  |
| a powerful light, maneuvering and hovering in the sky. (Sources:      |

| 1968 - At six o'clock in the evening the witness, Mrs. Valentina      |
| Flores, heard noises coming from her sheep pen located between the    |
| towns of Uyini and Otoco, Bolivia and went to investigate. She found  |
| the sheep pen covered with some form of plastic net, and inside was a |
| short being 3.5 feet tall, who was killing the sheep with a tube with |
| a hook on the end. The witness threw stones at the creature, and she  |
| was injured when she was thrown to the ground. The tube like          |
| instrument absorbed the net, and the entity rose straight up into the |
| air with a strange noise. Thirty four of the sheep had been killed.   |

| Argentina when he encountered an unusual fog while crossing over a    |
| bridge. An oyster shaped UFO emitted a blinding light beam, and both  |
| he and his truck were somehow picked up and abducted. Inside the      |
| craft he saw a luminous horseshoe-shaped instrument panel 3-4 meters  |
| long. A cask-like device with many cables attached to it was placed   |
| on his head, and he received messages from it that he would not       |

| lights went on and off about 7-8 times". The headlights and console   |
| lights later functioned normally. (Sources: Richard H. Hall,          |

| altitude. They suddenly took off at an incredible speed. (Source:     |

| 1991 - Two teens playing in an isolated field on this afternoon in    |
| Mini Mini, Puerto Rico encountered a small landed silver circular     |
| craft on the ground. It was very shiny and had a small dome-like      |
| sphere on top. The boys approached the object and began touching it.  |
| when a small hatch opened from the bottom of the craft and a long     |
| thin green arm came out and grabbed one boy by the leg. As the boy    |
| struggled to get away a second arm emerged and grabbed him by his     |
| arm. The boy grabbed a piece of wood and struck back at one of the    |
| creature's arms. He managed to cut off one of the creature's fingers  |
| and the creature let go. The finger fell to the ground oozing a green |
| liquid. The witnesses attempted to retrieve the severed finger, but   |
| dropped it during their panic and fled. They later returned to find   |
| both the object and the severed finger gone. (Source: Albert S.       |

| was suddenly awakened by three 4.5 foot tall Grey humanoids, with     |
| large black slanted eyes, who began lifting her from her bed. She     |
| began to struggle with the beings, when she noticed a tall human in   |
| the living room dressed entirely in black and holding a device        |
| resembling a small TV set. She broke loose from the Greys and yelled  |
| for her husband to wake up. He did, and they now both ran to the      |
| kitchen after hearing their dog barking in the backyard. They then    |
| saw a man wearing a blue Air Force blue uniform lying prone on a      |
| projecting part of their roof near a ladder. A K-9 sentry dog that    |
| appeared ready to attack their dog, was also now on the ground below, |
| accompanied by the three Grey humanoid beings. Overhead a number or   |
| red lights were hovering. The witness yelled, "Do not kill my dog!"   |
| Her next recollection was standing alone in her yard next to the      |
| generator shack. A large craft with revolving red lights hovered      |
| above her and a thick fog was coming out of some ports around the     |
| object. She next remembered waking up and sitting up in her bed at    |
| 3:50 a.m. She was later hypnotically regressed, and recalled being    |
| taken to an underground facility, but would not elaborate about the   |
| details. (Source: Paul Ferrughelli, Computer Catalog of UFO Reports,  |
