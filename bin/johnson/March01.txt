| 1950 - A metallic disc hovered over Chihuahua Airport in Mexico at    |
| five kilometers altitude during the day, then shot off quickly toward |
| the south. (Sources: newspaper clipping dated March 5, 1950;          |
| Inforespace, December 1975).                                          |

| 1950 - Military and civilian radars tracked a UFO flying at between   |
| 40,000 and 80,000 feet near Knoxville, Tennessee. At 11:15 a.m.       |
| Stuart Adcock, a Knoxville radio amateur with experience in radar     |
| technology, called the local FBI agent, Mr. Robey, to report that he  |
| had detected an object using a surplus military radar set. The object |
| was circling at at altitude of about 40,000 feet over Oak Ridge       |
| nuclear facility. Mr. Adcock reported another detection the next day. |
| No planes were scheduled in the area at the time. The US Air Force    |
| suggested that the visual sightings may have been due to a mirage.    |

| 1953 - A case of spontaneous human combustion occurred on this day on |
| Highway 291 in Greenville, South Carolina to a victim named Wood.     |
| (Sources: George Eberhart, A Geo-Bibliography of Anomalies, p. 450;   |

| 1954 - The Castle-Bravo H-Bomb test occurred this day at 6:40 a.m. on |
| Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The explosion and energy release   |
| was much stronger than expected. Castle Bravo was the most powerful   |
| nuclear device ever detonated by the United States (and just under    |
| one-third the energy of the most powerful ever detonated), with a     |
| yield of 15 megatons of TNT. That yield, far exceeding the expected   |
| yield of 4 to 6 megatons, combined with other factors and led to the  |
| most significant accidental radiological contamination ever caused by |
| the United States. Radioactive fallout from the detonation—intended   |
| to be a secret test—poisoned some of the Bikini islanders on their    |
| return, as well as the crew of the Daigo Fukuryu Maru ("Lucky Dragon  |
| No. 5"), a Japanese fishing boat, and created an international        |
| incident nearly severing diplomatic relations with Japan. The irony   |
| of the name "Lucky Dragon" of the fishing boat was not lost on any of |
| the newspapers reporting the incident at the time. (Sources: Larry    |
| Hatch, U computer database; Gerard DeGroot, The Bomb: A Life (London: |
| Jonathan Cape, 2004)).                                                |

| 1954 - Three daylight discs were spotted over Carrasco Airport in     |
| Montevideo, Uruguay at 2:30 p.m. They were swinging back and forth in |

| 1962 - At 10:40 p.m. EDT a single witness in Salem, New York reported |
| a 40 cm x 10 cm flying gold box that slowly crossed the horizon in    |

| 1967 - DeWitt Baldwin was raccoon hunting at night in the woods near  |
| Eden, New York when he heard a noise like buzzing bees around 1:30    |
| a.m. He flashed his flashlight on a gold colored, unlighted           |
| saucer-shaped object that had landed on the ground. A sliding door    |
| opened and a man emerged, dressed in a black, tight-fitting suit and  |
| wearing a helmet with goggles. He asked the witness some questions,   |
| such as what he was doing there at that hour and where he had been    |
| born. He then took Baldwin's gun, looked at it and then handed it     |
| back. Baldwin claimed the humanoid broke the muzzle of the gun while  |
| examining it. Baldwin said, "He wasn't white and he wasn't black. He  |
| talked very plainly and with no accent. He had black curly hair." He  |
| told me he would be back, walked up to the saucer, got in and seconds |
| later zipped off out of sight. No footprints or landing imprints were |
| found in the snow where the object had rested. (Source: James         |

| Lapenne, Ariege, France at 7:45 p.m. two strong one-meter             |
| light-beams, 12 meters apart, were seen over a hill about 500 meters  |
| away. A blue glow illuminated the countryside. There were five        |

| 1974 - A woman and her invalid husband were sitting on their front    |
| porch enjoying the spring weather on this afternoon near Millington,  |
| Tennessee when something in the sky caught their attention. They saw  |
| five saucer-shaped objects about two feet in diameter that moved at a |
| low altitude slowly through the sky. They floated leisurely over a    |
| field across the road from their house and settled down in the midst  |
| of a herd of cows some five hundred yards away. Only one cow paid any |
| attention to the small discs. It acted offended by the intrusion and  |
| turned and walked towards one of the mini UFOs. The object rose up,   |
| flew over the cow, and settled down again behind the cow. Each time   |
| the cow attempted to approach it would simply rise up, pass over the  |
| cow and settle down on the other side. The woman's husband became     |
| upset. He went and got his rifle and started hobbling out toward the  |
| field. The wife saw one of the objects fly very close to her          |
| husband's head and then rejoin the others as they flew away. By that  |
| time her husband had reached the fence and was standing still. His    |
| hands were down at his sides, the rifle clutched in one of them. When |
| she got to him he was icy cold and shivering. All he could say was    |
| that one of the objects had "flashed" him with a bright light. She    |
| helped him back up to the house and he went inside to lie down on a   |
| daybed. He stayed there the rest of the day and said nothing more.    |
| The next morning the woman looked out and saw the cow lying dead next |
| to a pond. Two weeks later her husband also died. The doctor said he  |
| had died of a heart attack. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |

| 1974 - At eight o'clock in the evening three observers saw a nearby   |
| hillside illuminated by a bright yellow light in Vesta Community,     |
| Virginia. A red luminous object was then seen ascending from the      |
| site. The object, about the size of a Volkswagen, hovered             |
| approximately 300 feet above the hill and went through a series of    |
| right angle turns, then headed south toward Stuart, Virginia. Billy   |
| Wayne Plasters and Richard N. Clifton drove to the landing site by    |
| truck and observed the silhouette of a "big, tall, heavyset man"      |
| approach from a lighted area. They called out and got no answer.      |
| Frightened, they jumped back into their truck and fled. The light on  |
| the hillside disappeared a few minutes later. Next day, patches of    |
| charred vegetation were found at the site covering a large area.      |
| Other people in the vicinity reported seeing strange lights that same |
| night, and hearing unexplained noises. (Sources: Center for UFO       |

| 1986 - Many cars pulled over on I-5 near Payne Field, Everett,        |
| Washington at around 8:30 p.m. to watch nine large disc-shaped UFOs   |
| drop NLs. The display lasted for nearly an hour before the            |
| objects shot straight up and departed. No explanation was given by    |
| the U. S. Air Force when inquiries were made. At about the same time, |
| a private pilot flying over Snoqualmie Pass, Washington encountered   |
| two amber spheres for one minute duration; there was radio static on  |
| his two-way radio during the encounter. (Sources: (1) Robert Gribble, |

| 1988 - Watching TV in Johnstown, Pennsylvania at 7:50 p.m., a witness |
| and two friends saw a bright light in the valley, so they went        |
| outside for a better look. The object, described as a white oval,     |
| remained stationary and silent for another five minutes before it     |
| "took off like streak of lightning.  It just disappeared." Later that |
| same evening, a football-shaped object with a white light at the      |
| front end and a red light at the tail was sighted by a woman over a   |
| farm in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania at 9:40 p.m. It had a reflecting   |
| surface on the leading side of the bottom of the object (reflecting   |
| white light). The white light flashed while moving, but not while     |
| hovering. Her sighting lasted 10 minutes. (Source: Stan Gordon, MUFON |

| 1989 - Many police personnel and others at 10 locations, centered on  |
| De Kalb County, Alabama reported UFOs. Sightings started in Fyffe,    |
| Alabama at 8:00 p.m. At 10:10 p.m. police from six agencies and a     |
| fire chief reported sightings in Geraldine, Alabama, and took         |
| one poor-quality photograph. At 11:30 p.m. the highway patrol in Fort |
| Payne reported sighting the Fyffe UFO. (Sources: UFO Magazine, June   |

| 1989 - At 8:03 p.m. a mother and daughter in Union City, Ohio spotted |
| a huge metallic triangle craft, halfway between the car and their     |
| house (1/8th of a mile away). It was described as gigantic, 500 feet  |
| in length, and making a low rumbling sound. It terrified them when it |
| moved toward them. The close encounter lasted 10 minutes. (Source:    |

| 1990 - On this night a woman ran out into 11 inches of fresh snow in  |
| her front yard in Otter Tail County, Minnesota to see a hovering      |
| disc-shaped craft. The disc ascended into a larger hovering object    |
| that appeared suddenly. She then suffered a blackout and was          |
| apparently abducted. She vaguely recalled being taken onboard by      |
| tall, blond, Nordic type beings who predicted that a catastrophe      |
| would befall Earth between the years 2000 and 2011. She also believes |
| that an implant was inserted into her head through one of her         |
| nostrils. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1990, |

| saucer that hovered, and then descended to the horizon; it changed    |
| colors as it did so. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case  |

| 1995 - At 9 p.m. a cigar-shaped object with windows appeared in the   |
| sky and looked to be slowly surveying a farm in Sedalia, Missouri. It |
| had a bright light in front and several small lights in the rear of   |
| the object. A lady saw the object hovering over a farm less than an   |
| eighth of a mile away; it had windows along its side, and gave off a  |
| faint hum. She reported it was "bigger than a blimp." After five      |
| minutes of hovering, it left towards the southwest. (Sources: Peter   |
