| 1897 - Mr. Sisson, a postmaster, was walking in the woods on this     |
| afternoon in Greenfield, Illinois when he saw an airship in the sky,  |
| estimated to be only 150 feet up in the air. He could see a woman on  |
| the deck of the object catching pigeons with a net. That same day a   |
| man nine miles away found a letter with "Airship Co., Oakland,        |
| California" letterhead. The note read, "Having delightful             |
| time…Mollie…catching [pigeons] with a net," and went on to describe   |
| 200 mph jaunts to St. Louis, Chicago, and Kansas City." (Source:      |

| 1950 - A silver, cigar-shaped object was sighted by a pilot in the    |
| morning sky over Clarendon, Texas. It flew slowly and vertically.     |

| 1952 - At 2:30 p.m. a silvery cigar-shaped object flew over Brooklyn, |
| New York. It had a light orange streak two-thirds of the way to the   |
| top of the object for its entire length. It flew into a cloud,        |
| causing a sparkling light to emanate from the cloud, and did not      |
| emerge. That night in Chestertown, Maryland a yellow-orange           |
| disc-shaped UFO that was self-luminous moved through the sky in a     |
| zigzag motion. It passed over the eastern horizon in two minutes,     |
| leaving a trail. At 10:30 p.m. 50 or more pale orange lights in a V   |
| formation were seen flying in the sky over Toronto, Ontario. They     |
| crossed 30 degrees of sky in seconds. (Source: Edward Sullivan,       |

| 1953 - A white, rounded delta-shaped UFO, seven feet in estimated     |
| diameter, flew 100 feet above the ground at 60-80 mph in a vibrating  |
| motion over enemy territory northeast of Pammunjon, Korea at 1:00     |
| p.m. It was witnessed by three U.S. soldiers named Morgan, Rymus, and |
| Myers. (Source: APRO Bulletin, July 1953).                            |

| 1966 - There were five UFO reports this day from Massachusetts and    |
| one from neighboring Connecticut. At 12:15 a.m. in Sharon,            |
| Massachusetts an oval-shaped UFO has a glowing rim that looked like   |
| they might be lighted windows. It had a steady red light on each end  |
| and was the size of a car. At 8:00 p.m. an object described as a      |
| high-flying, bright purple light flew over Stoughton, Massachusetts   |
| giving off a loud, piercing humming sound. At 8:11 p.m. two           |
| oval-shaped UFOs with red and green lights hovered directly over the  |
| veterans' home and hospital in Hartford, Connecticut. At 10:00 p.m.   |
| an elongated oval-shaped craft with bright red lights on each end was |
| seen descending into a wooded area in Bellingham, Massachusetts. Five |
| aircraft and a helicopter flew over the area after the UFO landed     |
| remotely, and two aircraft seemed to be circling the area. At 11:45   |
| p.m. a large disc flew over Quincy, Massachusetts accompanied by two  |
| smaller discs. They flashed red and white lights, hovered, and swung  |
| in the sky in a pendulum motion. At midnight a UFO about the size of  |
| a car was seen by two witnesses in a field in Peabody, Massachusetts. |
| It had red, green and white lights, moved with an up-and-down motion, |
| and appeared to land. When the witnesses approached they saw the      |
| lights rise from the ground and fly away. (Sources: Raymond E. Fowler |

| 1967 - A cream colored UFO with a dome, a little larger than a large  |
| car, hovered over Tully, Massachusetts at 7:30 p.m. It flashed bright |
| white lights, then red lights. It made some sharp turns, then moved   |
| off slowly. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler investigation files, report    |
| dated April 29, 1967).                                                |

| 1968 - A woman in Malden, Massachusetts awoke at 2:30 a.m. to a sound |
| "like two steel knives being struck together" and glanced outside.    |
| She saw a red glowing object with a point on top that was hovering    |
| with a fluttering motion. It flew off over a nearby cemetery.         |

| 1975 - Mr. Martindale was walking home from mailing letters in Bay    |
| City, Michigan at 11:30 p.m. when he saw a humanoid being standing in |
| his front yard. It looked like a man but it was totally black. He     |
| received a mental message to go inside the house and not fear         |
| anything. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |
| of Humanoid Reports, case A1401).                                     |

| 1977 - Little Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales. At two o'clock in the      |
| morning the radio of hotel owner Rosa Gremville suddenly went dead.   |
| Moments later she heard a loud humming noise outside and looking out  |
| she was dazzled by a "huge moon lighting up the area, moving about    |
| like a seesaw." It descended and landed in a field 100 yards behind   |
| the hotel. "It was round, with flames coming from the top of a dome.  |
| There was a light on it, like a pulsating star." Two creatures 8 or   |
| 9-feet tall emerged from the dome through the flames. They wore cream |
| or silvery colored jumpsuits. She could see no facial features nor    |
| any hair on these creatures, eventhough see tried to discern what     |
| they looked like through a pair of binoculars. They looked as though  |
| they had hands, but she saw no fingers. "I though their feet were     |
| webbed." The figures walked around near the object for about 15       |
| minutes. Mrs. Gremville wanted to scream, but she had lost her voice. |
| She went in search of another witness and when they returned the UFO  |
| and humanoid figures had gone. Burn marks were found on the ground at |
| the site the next day. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,      |

| farm. The witness to the event fainted and his hair was singed by a   |
| close encounter with the UFO. (Source: International UFO Reporter,    |

| 1978 - On this night four children were playing in the basement of a  |
| home in South Middleton, Massachusetts when one of the girl's, a      |
| suspected UFO abductee, happened to glance at the window. A foot away |
| from the window a white face was staring back at her, just inches     |
| above the ground level. it was oval shaped with vertical nose slits   |
| and a narrow mouth, the eyes were large slanted and gold in color. A  |
| transparent helmet possibly covered the head. She yelled at her       |
| companions but when she turned back again to look the entity was      |
| gone. (Sources: David F. Webb, MUFON UFO Journal, issue #143; David   |

| 1979 - At shortly after 11:00 p.m. two witnesses to a UFO in Croy,    |
| England ran from their car when the brightly lit object passed low    |
| overhead. They reported an abnormal silence, as they could no longer  |
| hear the car engine or the door slam when they fled. (Source:         |

| 1984 - At 16.00 GMT air traffic controllers at an eastern airport in  |
| England witnessed a glowing sphere that looked like "masses of silver |
| paper crinkled up" touch down on a cross runway, then rocket skyward  |
| in a maneuver they judged impossible for aircraft. It climbed 3000    |
| feet in under a second. (Source: International UFO Reporter,          |

| 1993 - At 8:45 p.m. in Black Heath near Salisbury, England a dark     |
| charcoal colored cylindrical object was spotted on the ground. The    |
| object was 60 feet in length and had four landing legs, two of them   |
| appeared to be damaged. Two short, 3.5 foot tall beings with slanted  |
| eyes were seen on board. According to the witnesses, a large US Air   |
| Force helicopter flew into the area and carried the craft away.       |

| foothills of Mount Rainier, Washington State, when he suddenly        |
| experienced total engine failure and his headlights went out at 9:30  |
| p.m. He next saw a nine foot tall, broad-shouldered winged creature   |
| land about 30 feet away from him. The being had a large mouth with    |
| sharp teeth, yellow eyes, a wolf-like face and was covered with a     |
| dark bluish fur. After a few minutes the creature turned its head,    |
| looked at him, and started flapping its wings. The creature then took |
| off towards Mount Rainier. Brian was then able to restart his truck   |
| and drive away. A later search of the area failed to locate any       |
| physical evidence. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |
