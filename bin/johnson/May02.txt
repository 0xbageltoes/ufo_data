| 1949 - At 10:20 a.m. north of Elko, Nevada three metallic discs with  |
| an estimated diameter of 10 meters flew over the desert to the        |
| southwest at 400 kph and an altitude of 4200 meters. They were        |
| silent, and all three veered to the south with the same precise tilt. |

| 1967 - A scientist and his wife sighted a white cigar-shaped object   |
| flying east of Tranmere, South Australia. It had a globe-shaped light |
| at the front and it left a luminescent trail. They watched it for     |
| five minutes as it went over the horizon. There were two more         |
| sightings that evening over Mount Whaleback in Western Australia, one |
| at 8:30 p.m. and another at 11:50 p.m. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs |

| 1967 - A misty gray oval with four blinking red lights and a steady   |
| white light on top was seen in Montezuma, Iowa by a nineteen-year-old |
| named Latcham at 8:25 p.m. It hovered, rose straight up, and then     |
| angled off to the west, climbing rapidly. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,    |

| 1968 - On this morning the witness was out collecting bark for        |
| firewood in a spot near her lake on Keats Island, British Columbia    |
| when the same two strange men she had met on January 29 approached    |
| her. Both wore dark "neat" coveralls, as if they were brand new. One  |
| of the men was about 20 years old, and he seemed to hide behind the   |
| other man as the witness approached them. The younger man stared      |
| intently at the woman during the conversation she had with the older  |
| man, and only spoke once. She continued to be mystified about how     |
| they were coming and going from her remote island location. (Source:  |

| 1971 - Bobby Ford was outside his home in Jonesville, Arkansas on     |
| this night when he was grabbed by a huge hairy creature with claws,   |
| and pulled to the ground. After a brief struggle he escaped from his  |
| assailant. He was treated at a Texarkana hospital for scratches and   |
| shock. Footprints were discovered on Ford's property. (Source: Albert |

| 1972 - William G. Lestin and his wife were driving to a motel near    |
| Salisbury, Maryland at around 11 p.m. when they saw a luminous disc   |
| settle to the ground 100 yards away. Mr. Lestin got out of the car    |
| and walked to within 50 feet of the object. He described seeing a     |
| round object sitting on tripod landing gear. Moving about underneath  |
| it were two four-foot humanoids, resembling human beings but with     |
| long arms that dangled to the ground. They were "apparently covered   |
| with a glazed coat of grayish material" and wore helmets. As he       |
| watched, a door opened and a ramp descended; the two humanoids        |
| re-boarded and the object rose up into the air with a blinding red    |
| light. The entire incident had lasted more than five minutes. Mr.     |
| Lestin was terrified by his experience and had to be sedated when he  |
| arrived at his destination. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,  |

| 1978 - A witness noticed two white uniformed Grey humanoid figures    |
| standing on the grounds of an abductee's property in South Middleton, |
| Massachusetts. They stood motionless and held their arms close to     |
| their bodies. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database   |

| 1978 - On the same day in Escazu, Costa Rica Eduardo Enrique Lacayo,  |
| age 10, was out playing in the front yard of his uncle's house at     |
| 6:30 p.m. when he saw a cat. He decided to chase it as it ran towards |
| a large empty lot across the street. As he ran towards the field he   |
| suddenly noticed a hovering silvery disc-shaped object that emitted a |
| strong yellow light. The UFO resembled two soup plates placed         |
| together and was about 15 meters in diameter, and it was hovering at  |
| about 200 meters above the ground with a slight wobbling motion. A    |
| gray cloud-like mist emerged from the object and descended towards    |
| the ground. Stunned, Enrique watched as the mist-like vapor assumed   |
| the shape of a human-like figure that remained suspended above the    |
| ground. The figure wore a kind of "cape" or long tunic that did not   |
| reach its feet, since the witness was able to observe gold-colored    |
| laceless shoes on the figure's feet. The figure was about 170 meters  |
| tall. The cat also apparently observed the spectacle, since the       |
| animal's fur stood on end and it quickly scurried from the scene.     |
| Eduardo did not notice any facial features on the figure except what  |
| appeared to be thin lips. The figure extended its arms at him, as if  |
| beckoning him to approach, and it appeared to open its mouth. At this |
| point the boy became afraid, and ran away quickly away. Looking back  |
| he did not see the figure again, and the UFO rose up into the sky at  |
| very high speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |
| Database 1978, citing Carlos Vilchez).                                |
|                                                                       |
| 2001 - In Rosario, Argentina a woman, "M" found herself being lifted  |
| into a whirlwind at two o'clock in the morning, presumably from her   |
| bedroom, but she doesn't know how she got outdoors. She was oriented  |
| vertically as she floated upwards, and was able to move her arms and  |
| look around as she did so.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| She approached a powerful light that seemed to emanate from a hole in |
| the sky. She then noticed three humanoids floating next to her, who   |
| accompany her through the orifice. Looking down, she could see the    |
| roof of her house, then watched as the house became smaller, and then |
| the city of Rosario itself faded into the distance. As she continued  |
| to ascend into the sky she fell asleep, but an intense cold wave woke |
| her up and she heard what sounded like a metallic hatch closing.      |
|                                                                       |
| She noticed she had a dark room through a hexagonal opening. As her   |
| eyesight adjusted noticed that she was in an immense room with about  |
| 20 floating cots, each with a human figure on them. To her right she  |
| noticed her 45-year-old sister asleep on one of the cots. She also    |
| recalled seeing a black skinned man lying about 4 cots away. In the   |
| background she could hear a low steady snoring sound. She began to    |
| hear what appeared to be low "voices" that spoke very quickly among   |
| themselves. Almost at the same time three humanoids approached her.   |
| They were about 1.60 meters tall, very thin, with elongated hairless  |
| heads, two small holes for noses, and cat-like eyes that glowed a     |
| bluish-gray color. Their hands had three large fingers connected by a |
| membrane and a separate finger or thumb. Their bodies were of a       |
| beige-pale color and appeared very flexible, almost gelatinous. They  |
| possessed small mouths and what appeared to be a small protuberance   |
| on top of their heads.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| She sensed there were both females and males present but could not    |
| see any sexual features. At this point she sensed desperation from    |
| the beings as if their time was short because their species was       |
| unable to reproduce. One of the beings seemed to measure her cranium  |
| with a thin tube about 30 cm in length that emitted a beam of light   |
| from the tip. As the tube or bar was passed over her head she felt a  |
| slight sensation of warmth. She also sensed that the aliens had       |
| chosen Earth for a reproduction staging area, acquiring the necessary |
| materials, which were human genetic materials from both genders.      |
|                                                                       |
| She could hear other thoughts or speech in her mind and felt that the |
| beings talked about her and about her knowledge. At this point        |
| another one of the beings seemed to measure her face from ear to ear  |
| at the same time telling her via telepathy that everything was going  |
| to be fine. The witness felt that the aliens needed human bodies as   |
| some kind of breeding "container" for their own survival purposes.    |
|                                                                       |
| She became terrified as the three humanoids approached her to touch   |
| her. She asked them if they are spiritual beings and they answer yes, |
| but she felt it was only an attempt to manipulate her mind. One of    |
| the humanoids attempted to touch her breasts but she pushed his arm   |
| aside and noticed that it had a gummy texture with no apparent bone   |
| structure. On her descent back to her home she remembered seeing      |
| images of famous persons flash around her, including John F. Kennedy, |
| Adolph Hitler, and Judy Garland. She woke up in her bed with her      |
| concerned husband attempting to calm her down. (Source: Albert S.     |

| 2003 - Three young women returning from a bonfire in the Illinois     |
| countryside and had just finished putting away equipment and chairs   |
| into a shed. As they got back into their van, at around 3:30 a.m.,    |
| one of them saw a figure standing a short distance off the driveway   |
| by a house. She pointed it out to the other two. Somewhat spooked,    |
| they drove back toward town. They described the figure as man-like,   |
| wearing light colored or white clothing. They headed over to the site |
| of the bonfire, the embers of which were still glowing. Suddenly, in  |
| the glare of their van's headlights they all saw two separate rows of |
| creatures, with perhaps 15 standing in each row. They were about      |
| three or four feet tall and were standing only 15 feet away from      |
| them, directly in front of the van. One of the women wrote that they  |
| had "Christmas light heads" that were connected to their body, but    |
| she couldn't see how. Their arms were up in the air, but she couldn't |
| see any hands. They appeared to be stick-like, and dark gray or brown |
| in color. They did not move but stood perfectly still. The two girls  |
| riding as passengers began to scream for the driver to leave the area |
| immediately. Terrified, they drove away and continued to drive around |
| for the next two hours before they had enough courage to return to    |
| their homes. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |
