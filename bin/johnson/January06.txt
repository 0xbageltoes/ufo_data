| 1948 - Mrs Bernice Zaikowski of Chehalis, Washington heard a          |
| “sizzling and whizzing” sound at three o'clock in the afternoon, and  |
| looked up to see a “birdman” hovering 200 feet above her barn. She    |
| watched “a man equipped with long silver wings fastened over the      |
| shoulders with a strap” ascend rapidly, hover, bank, then fly away.   |
| “He flew in an upright position and appeared to be manipulating       |
| controls strapped to his chest.” The wings did not flap, instead they |
| retracted close to his body during ascent, and were extended to hover |
| or proceed in horizontal flight. Mrs Zaikowski said five other adult  |
| witnesses and a number of children also saw the birdman. (Source:     |

| 1950 - Three military witnesses, including one named Zimmerman, were  |
| flying in a U.S. Air Force C-47 transport plane near Howard, Kansas   |
| on this day when they sighted a silverly metallic, football-shaped    |
| object flying on a straight level flight path. They estimated the     |
| object was between 30 and 60 feet long, was flying at 2,000 feet      |
| altitude at a speed of 400 mph. (Sources: Project Blue Book files     |

| 1961 - At 3:00 a.m. Luis G. Ferre Casas, age 33, and two other        |
| witnesses watched as a domed disc-shaped object, six meters in        |
| diameter, landed quietly on a mountain in Torroia del Priorato,       |
| Tarragona, Spain. It was the color of moonlight. A dog who was with   |
| them refused to approach the landing site. The incident lasted 20     |
| minutes. (Sources: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, FSR Case Histories,  |

| 1966 - Three gray discs and two multi-colored cigar-shaped UFOs, with |
| the colors pink, blue, and white, were seen hovering over Sapporo,    |
| Japan at 1:49 p.m. by Miss S. Fujii. At 1:55 p.m. 16 more UFOs        |
| appeared to the left of these, gradually vanishing after 30 seconds.  |
| Many more appeared in a display at 2:09 p.m. (Source: Y. J.           |

| 1967 - Six luminous spheres were seen flying over Aveyron, France at  |
| eleven o'clock at night. A luminous shaft of light descended towards  |
| the ground near the witness. A humanoid figure was seen standing      |
| inside the luminous shaft. The being communicated via telepathy with  |
| the witness and told him that someday "He will write a book."         |

| 1968 - A night security officer was conducting his rounds in Milano,  |
| Italy when he came upon a flat, pancake-shaped object resting in a    |
| courtyard. He approached and could see that it had a transparent dome |
| on top and a circular railing around it. Next to the UFO were two     |
| human-like figures wearing blue coveralls and black helmets and       |
| gloves. Inside the dome a third figure was moving about. The two      |
| outside seemed to be performing some repairs on the object. The       |
| witness walked up to offer his help and shone a flashlight at the     |
| object. The two figures suddenly scrambled into the object, which     |
| emitted a bright flash and took off. (Sources: Maurizio Verga,        |
| ITACAT: Italian UFO Catalogue; Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |
| Database 1968, case 25).                                              |

| 1969 - Maren Merino was working in the kitchen of her family's small  |
| café in Pontejos, Santander, Spain at 9:15 p.m. when she looked out   |
| the kitchen window and saw an intensely bright light. Her daughter,   |
| 25-year old Felicidad Fernandez Merino then entered the kitchen and   |
| also observed the light. Felicidad asks her mother about it, but she  |
| continued to ignore the light. Thinking this was abnormal, Felicidad  |
| yelled to two other women, including a woman called Paquita. All      |
| three women then opened the window and saw an incredible scene: on a  |
| field only 30 meters away, and hovering about three meters from the   |
| ground, was a luminous square 4-5 meters wide. It was an intense      |
| orange-white color. Inside the luminous square they saw the           |
| silhouette of a man walking about. From the right another figure      |
| appeared and both walked toward the left side of the illuminated      |
| square. Next, from the opposite end of the square three more figures  |
| appear, making a total of five figures. By now the witnesses are      |
| totally fascinated and shout out to the beings. At this time they are |
| joined by another witness, 35-year-old Antonio. When Antonio looked   |
| out the window the craft vanished from sight.                         |
|                                                                       |
| According to the witnesses the movements of the humanoids was         |
| mechanical in nature, with arms straight down their sides with no     |
| apparent joint movement. The beings were tall and well built, with    |
| normal features, chestnut-color hair, and light skin. They wore       |
| something similar to black, tight-fitting coveralls with sleeves and  |
| turtlenecks. The incident lasted for five minutes. As the witnesses   |
| continued to look for the UFO a small shiny sphere descended from the |
| middle of the sky, falling to the ground in a curved trajectory. The  |
| body of the UFO again became visible, clearly displaying the shiny    |
| square section and the portion of the object hat had been invisible   |
| to the witnesses thus far. It was a dull silver color, lightly        |
| fluorescent, and shaped like a domed cupola. The object then rose     |
| slowly and disappeared quickly, leaving behind a brilliant greenish   |
| track that persisted for about 15 minutes after the object left.      |

| 1973 - Mr. Lew was driving in his truck between Tiddington and        |
| Wheatley in Oxfordshire, England at 6 a.m. when a circular-shaped UFO |
| crossed the road in front of him at a low altitude, as if intending   |
| to land in a nearby field. (Source: J. Bernard Delair, UFO Register,  |
| volume 5 (1974), case # 6).                                           |

| 1974 - Martin W. Barry, a Marine Corps sergeant, was making his usual |
| early morning five mile run in the park in Santa Ana, California. He  |
| was out running in a driving rainstorm, when he came upon a           |
| seven-foot-tall, bulky figure standing in a slumped forward posture,  |
| with long arms dangling nearly to the ground. Behind it was hovering  |
| an orange pulsating flying saucer, only a few feet off the ground.    |
| The creature's head accounted for more than half of its height. It    |
| had very large eyes, and its legs were "squashed" and "stubby." It    |
| waddled up to Barry and struck him on the chest, knocking him into a  |
| pool of water. It then waddled away and climbed aboard the UFO, which |
| rose into the sky. Others reportedly saw UFOs over Santa Ana that     |
| day. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of    |
| Human Reports, case 1974-63, citing Andrew Gallagher, Ideal's UFO     |

| 1974 - At 6 p.m. two women watched a strange looking bullet-shaped    |
| metallic object move across the sky above Bend, Oregon travelling     |
| from the southeast to the northwest. (Source: Bend Bulletin, January  |
| 7, 1974).                                                             |

| 1975 - near Lordsburg, New Mexico - Three peopIe listening to a CB     |
| radio in their parked car at around 11 p.m. saw lights approaching    |
| them from behind. As the driver tried to move the car, the CB radio   |
| broke into static and the engine wouldn't start. A bluish light beam  |
| then shone on the car for a few seconds and the group heard a sound   |
| like the hum from high tension wires. The light then disappeared and  |
| they could start the car. As they drove away, they saw a blue glow    |
| behind a nearby hill. The battery on the car went dead a few days     |
| later. (Sources: APRO BuIIetin, June 1975; Mark Rodeghier, UFO        |

| 1976 - Returning from getting milk in Domene, Isere, France at 6      |
| p.m., Jean Claude Silvente, age 10, again saw a two-meter tall Nordic |
| looking being wearing silver coveralls, the same as he had seen the   |
| day before. The man was standing on the sidewalk only 30 yards from   |
| his house, in the same posture as before, but only 12 feet away from  |
| him this time. He spilled the milk and ran. His sister’s boyfriend,   |
| who had been following him, saw nothing. But when they returned to    |
| the same spot Jean Claude, his mother, his 17-year-old sister, and    |
| ther boyfriend all saw a red “headlight” dive down from the sky at    |
| them “as if it would land on them.” They ran away in panic to a       |
| nearby police station. At 8:20 p.m. a cigar-shaped UFO with lights on |
| the bottom flew slowly over the town of Laissaud, Savoie, France. It  |
| periodically emitted beams of light downwards for 5 minutes, then     |
| zoomed away to the north. (Sources: (1) Charles Bowen, Saga UFO       |

| 1977 - At 1:15 a.m. Mrs. Florida Malboeuf, about 50 years of age, was |
| sitting at her window on the Rue Casgrain in the city of Montreal,    |
| Quebec when she saw an oyster shaped, flat bottomed metallic object   |
| with a row of white lights around its base. It came flying in from    |
| the north and landed on the rooftop of a three-storey apartment       |
| building across the street from her, only 60 feet away. Immediately   |
| two figures appeared on the roof, they were over six feet tall and    |
| thin, with long arms and they wore white one-piece uniforms with      |
| their heads covered with tight "bath helmets." They stood looking at  |
| the street, then at the sky, then they apparently returned to the     |
| object. A moment later they disappeared, and the UFO rose from the    |
| roof about 20 feet, and then flew off to the east. Her son Andre went |
| over to the rooftop in question and found there a large elliptical    |
| shaped crust of ice, 0.8 inches thick, and about 18 feet in diameter  |
| that was on top of the snow, evidently formed by the local melting of |
| the snow. In relief on this plaque and going toward the façade of the |
| building, were four small, narrow footprints only 6.5 incheslong.     |

| 1978 - Two men leaving a beachfront cafe in Santo Antonio de          |
| Caparica, Estremadura, Portugal at 10:30 p.m. saw a bright bluish     |
| light flying low over the ocean descend at a steep angle at high      |
| speed. The light then stopped, and descended more slowly into a       |
| wooded area next to a nearby campground. Both men ran into the woods, |
| which were now illuminated by a bluish glow. Upon entering a          |
| clearing, they saw a 2.1 meter tall human-like figure, standing eight |
| meters away from them. It wore a loose fitting silvery outfit that    |
| was shiny in appearance. The being also wore a large white helmet     |
| with a narrow black visor across the eyes. The figure seemed          |
| surprised by their presence, turned around and with a heavy, slow     |
| motion walked back towards a metallic blue, saucer-shaped craft with  |
| a dome on top, that was hovering very close to the ground. Both men   |
| became frightened and fled in panic from the clearing. During the     |
| encounter one of the men felt a buzzing sound inside his head, and    |
| later suffered from insomnia. The next day an eight meter in diameter |
| circle was found in the ground in the clearing. (Sources: UNICAT      |

| 1990 - The witness, a repeat abductee, was awakened at around         |
| midnight in Townshend, Vermont by a strange-cloaked humanoid that     |
| stood by the side of his bed and communicated with him, telling him   |
| not to tell anybody about the visit. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1995 - A British Airways Boeing-737 flight with 60 passengers aboard  |
| was buzzed by a bright wedge-shaped object as it flew over the        |
| Pennine Alps in Derbyshire, England on its descent to Manchester      |
| Airport at 6:40 p.m. The object appeared to be only meters in front   |
| of the airliner as it flew at 13,000 feet, and it was so close that   |
| the co-pilot instinctively reacted by ducking down inside the         |
| cockpit. It had small lights, made no attempt to change course, and   |
| made no discernable sound or turbulance. The object did not appear on |
| radar. However, there was at least one witness on the ground to the   |
| close encounter. (Sources: Curt Sutherly, UFO Mysteries: A Reporter   |
