| 1954 - Mr. Chesneau, a fireman, saw a round luminous object slowly    |
| descend toward the Marignane Airport, France at 9:00 p.m. He went     |
| inside and called the control tower to report it. When he came        |

| 1955 - A red circular object three meters in diameter was observed to |
| land and take off again in San Sebastian, Spain. Three independent    |
| witnesses saw the object come to ground. They described it as a very  |
| bright red globe 2.5 meters in diameter, which they thought was made  |
| of a metallic material. When one witness approached to within 100     |
| meters, the object took off. The principal witness was a 23-year-old  |
| man named Galarraga. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A |

| 1958 - At around 4 p.m. a silver gray disc followed two witnesses in  |
| their car along the side of road in Bloemfontein, Orange Free State,  |
| South Africa at low altitude. It then abruptly shot off into the sky. |
| Later that same evening in Beachwood, Ohio three nocturnal lights     |
| traced a perfect triangular path in the sky. (Sources: (1) Cynthia    |

| 1966 - Violet Bricker was driving two miles north of La Harpe,        |
| Illinois on Rte. 94 at 8:15 a.m. when she observed a light flash that |
| she first believed was an approaching plane. As it neared she saw it  |
| was more dirigible-shaped and closed rapidly on a collision course    |
| with her. It stopped and hovered over the telephone lines opposite    |
| her car. It was ovoid shaped and made no sound, and was about as long |
| as a Piper Club. It had a single bright yellow-white light on the end |
| facing her. There were no doors, ports, or landing gear visible, but  |
| a lateral line like a seam encircled the UFO. It began revolving in a |
| clockwise motion on its axis, bringing the other end in view and      |
| exposing a two-foot platform on which stood a "man" wearing a bulky,  |
| white, one-piece suit. He was about five and one half feet tall,      |
| stocky build, and he stood with his left hand against the object and  |
| his right hand on his hip, staring directly down on the witness. His  |
| face had a ruddy complexion and his eyes were dark, but he looked     |
| entirely normal otherwise. The object drifted about on its axis and   |
| the man was lost from view. Ms. Bricker was so taken aback by the     |
| experience she could not recall if she actually stopped her car or    |
| not. She recalled seeing a man and a woman on foot not 20 feet away   |
| to whom she signaled frantically to catch their attention, but to no  |
| avail. (Sources: Robert Smulling, Skylook, August 1970, p. 19; David  |

| 1967 - At 4:00 a.m. a 32-year-old man was driving to work in Winsted, |
| Minnesota in his 1964 Chevy truck when he had to get out and inspect  |
| his vehicle when the engine stalled. Only then did he observe an      |
| intense light to his right, coming closer. He saw it land on the road |
| and locked himself inside the cab of his truck. The craft settled on  |
| a tripod landing gear; it measured 25 meters in diameter and was 10   |
| meters high. Something similar to an elevator came down from it, and  |
| a man dressed in blue coveralls "with something like a glass fish     |
| bowl on his head," of medium height, seemed to check something and    |
| then left. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of |
| Landings, case 809).                                                  |

| 1967 - At 5:40 p.m. four observers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania      |
| watched a disc-shaped object for 45 minutes as it buzzed, circled,    |
| and flipped over several times, then shot off to the south. A         |
| box-shaped object was then seen flying north. (Source: Larry Hatch, U |

| 1967 - On or about this date six witnesses from three families        |
| driving on Highway 55 two miles east of Farwell, Minnesota had their  |
| car engine falter when several tiny lights passed their windshield.   |
| The car functions alright after the lights had departed. (Source:     |

| 1968 - An very bright, yellowish orange, disc-shaped UFO landed at a  |
| remote distance from two men, Sr. Massague and Sr. Aguade, in the     |
| Torrellas de las Foix mountains, Barcelona, Spain at 8:15 a.m. It was |
| ten meters in diameter, and estimated to be about 3500 meters away.   |

| 1969 - At four o'clock in the morning a glowing object rose to the    |
| surface and floated on the ocean off the coast of Vina del Mar,       |
| Valparaiso, Chile. The surface of the sea boiled and there was an     |
| odor of sulphur in the air. At 9:00 p.m. in Port Alegre, Rio Grande   |
| do Sul state, Brazil soldiers at the Vila Floresta watched a hovering |
| fireball that shot a fiery beam when it began moving. At 11:45 p.m.   |
| on the highway between Campos and Itaparuna, Rio de Janeiro state,    |
| Brazil a single witness stopped his car to watch a metallic domed     |
| ovoid-shaped object hovering over a nearby hilltop. The dome on the   |
| object glowed a purple color. (Sources: (1) Lumieres dans la Nuit,    |

| 1975 - Carlos A. Diaz was walking home from the bus after a late      |
| night at 3:30 a.m. in Puerto Ingeniero, a town outside Bahia Blanca,  |
| Buenos Aires, Argentina when he saw a blindingly bright that emitted  |
| a bent beam of light and found himself paralyzed. He then heard a     |
| humming noise and was levitated off the ground. He fainted, and when  |
| he came to he was inside a spherical room about 8 feet in diameter    |
| with luminous walls. Three beings, about 5' 9" tall, entered the      |
| sphere. Their heads were half the size of human heads, shaped         |
| like smooth green knobs, with small noses and small ears, and         |
| were completely devoid of hair. They were dressed in pale cream       |
| colored "rubber" suits that covered their entire bodies up to their   |
| necks. Although their arms terminated in fingerless stumps, they were |
| nevertheless able to pull out large clumps of Diaz's, but this caused |
| him no pain. They even pulled out some hair from his chest. Finally   |
| Diaz fainted again, and when he awoke he found himself lying beside a |
| road outside Buenos Aires. The time was 7:30 a.m. but his watch had   |
| stopped at 3:50 a.m. He was nauseous the entire day, and was taken    |
| to hospital. (Sources: Pedro Romaniuk, FSR, November 1975, p. 39;     |

| 1975 - At 2:30 p.m. 15-year-old David Mahon was in his backyard in    |
| Brownstown, Illinois photographing his dog when he heard a loud       |
| droning noise and saw a black disc-shaped object passing overhead. He |
| took five photographs, then felt himself being levitated upward and   |
| he lost consciousness. He recovered conciousness in a small cubicle   |
| only five feet in diameter. There was a row of blinking orange lights |
| that encircled the room at waist height. He remembered being in this  |
| compartment for less than a minute. He then fainted again             |
| and recovered consciousness near his home. His father told him that   |
| he had been gone for nearly an hour. The photographs of the UFO were  |
| overexposed and out of focus. There were two other witnesses who      |
| briefly witnessed the flying disc in Brownstown. (Source: Eileen      |

| 1975 - At 6:55 p.m. in Laulne pres de Lessay, Manche department,      |
| France a domed disc-shaped craft 15 meters long with portholes, took  |
| off from a landing on  a farm. It had three legs as landing gear. The |
| principal witness was 12-year-old Yvon Vildier, but two more adult    |
| witnesses named Marie LeClere and Richard (first name only) observed  |
| it as a light in the sky. It left behind traces on the ground and a   |
| petroleum odor. The ground marks included three large landing pod     |
| imprints, irregularly spaced in a triangle 1 m x 1.6 m x 2.5 m, and   |
| three small center clustered imprints. The entire event from first    |
| observing a luminous phenomenon in the area to the disappearance of   |
| the craft lasted 20 minutes. (Sources: Roland Godefroy, Phenomenes    |

| away from him, about 15 feet high, a luminous white color, and        |
| resting on five thin legs. A door in the craft opened and a very tall |
| man, at least two meters tall, emerged. He wore tight, white luminous |
| coveralls and had long blond hair. On the back of each hand was a     |
| green circle. He walked stiffly with his arms extended in front of    |
| him, in the manner of a sleepwalker. When the boy sneezed, this       |
| “giant” turned toward him, and Jean Claude ran home. A short while    |
| later he was sent out by his mother to get some milk, and while       |
| returning home he saw the same being again. It was following him on   |
| the sidewalk 80 feet behind, still with its arms held out stiffly in  |
| front of him. Jean Claude ran home. Note: An almost identical         |
| humanoid was seen in Chamouilley, France in October of that same      |
| year. It had similar features, was tall and had blond hair, and it    |
| also walked in the manner of a sleepwalker with one slight            |
| difference, it appeared to be wearing tight-fitting goggles.          |

| 1979 -  Two members of the Quezet family in Mindalore, Gauteng        |
| province, South Africa experienced a 20 minute episode of missing     |
| time in the pre-dawn hours when they had a close encounter with an    |
| ovoid object that made a buzzing sound. Meagan Quezet and her 12-year |
| old son Andre were out looking for their dog shortly after            |
| midnight after they heard it barking. Soon they noticed a peculiar    |
| pink glow beyond a tarmac road. Thinking that it was a police car,    |
| they approached the area. As they reached the glow they noticed that  |
| it came from a peculiar egg-shaped craft resting on the ground on     |
| several thin leg-like protrusions. The intense pink glow emanated     |
| from the top of the craft. Suddenly5 or 6 men jumped to the ground    |
| from an opening in the craft. One walked to the far end of the        |
| object, two remained standing in front of it, and two others          |
| approached the witnesses. The men appeared to speak among themselves  |
| in a loud "sing-song" unintelligible language; two kneeled down and   |
| appeared to touch the asphalt. All the men wore tight-fitting white   |
| suits; all but two had hoods that covered most of their faces. The    |
| one who appeared to be the leader approached Mrs. Quezet and spoke to |
| her in a high-pitched unintelligible voice. He made a slight bow      |
| towards her as if in a form of salute. He had a black beard, frizzy   |
| black hair, and slanted eyes and dark olive skinned complexion. Soon  |
| the men walked back to the craft and entered the object, the craft    |
| then emitted a whistling sound, the thin leg-like protrusions         |
| telescoped back into the craft, which then rose up and disappeared    |
| into the clouds. Under hypnosis the witness recalled being taken      |
| inside the object where she saw chairs, panels and a table. She was   |
| asked to come with them but she refused.  (Source: Xenolog, March     |
| 1979, p. 19).                                                         |

| 1979 - Jean Hingley had waved goodbye to her husband as he went off   |
| to work in the bitter cold morning in Rowley Regis, West Midlands,    |
| England at around 7:00 a.m. Then she saw a light in the garden.       |
| Thinking her husband had left the carport light on, she went out to   |
| investigate, but it was still to dark, so she returned to the         |
| kitchen. She put down some food for the family Alsatian dog, Hobo,    |
| and called him from the garden, but he flopped down as if he had been |
| drugged and gazed at the ceiling, glassy eyed. Then, with a "zee-zee" |
| noise, three weird looking creatures flew past her into the lounge.   |
| There were only three and a half feet tall, and had waxy white faces  |
| and coal-black eyes with no eyebrows and very thin mouths. They wore  |
| silvery uniforms, with a transparent fish-bowl type helmet over their |
| heads. They also had transparent wings, and floated. Jean was left    |
| clinging to the sink, paralyzed, but she next suddenly also floated   |
| towards the lounge. Jean noticed that the aliens were inspecting the  |
| ornaments on their Christmas tree with interest. She said they also   |
| probed her mind with telepathy, "it was like a light or an X-ray      |
| penetrating." They told her telepathically that she would not be      |
| harmed, and when she asked them where they were from, one of them     |
| reported "we come from the sky." She then explained to them why the   |
| house was all decorated, to celebrate Jesus's birthday. "We know all  |
| about Jesus," they claimed. They said they would return. They also    |
| claimed that "we come down here to talk to people but they don't seem |
| to be interested." Finally, when she showed them how to light a       |
| cigarette, they fled in terror, taking a mince pie with them. Outside |
| in her garden was an egg-shaped object with windows. They floated     |
| into it and it took off, emitting a bluish flash and pulsating twice  |
| before disappearing with a flash. The dog returned to normal, and     |
| Jean called the police. Her electric wall clock had stopped, and all  |
| her cassette tapes were magnetized and unplayable. In the snow        |
| outside where the object had sat, there was an oval outline, which    |
| the local UFO group was able to photograph before the snow melted.    |

| 1979 - At 6:20 p.m. three red triangle-shaped UFOs were sighted over  |
| Interstate 290 in Auburn, Massachusetts; AM and CB radios were        |
| affected. There was steering loss, loss of power, and the main        |
| witness's car was reportedly levitated as well. Ms. Emery felt heat,  |
| paralysis, and she had a skin rash as the result of her close         |
| encounter. The UFOs flew off to the northwest. Also during this       |
| period of repeated sightings of low level lights and a diamond-shaped |
| object over the area, a witness reported seeing a 7-8 foot tall hairy |
| figure in a field at 11:00 p.m. near Sturbridge, Massachusetts. He    |
| shone a spotlight at it and the creature ran towards him. The witness |
| fired three shots at it and then ran away, shooting one more time     |
| over his shoulder. The shots appeared to have no effect on the        |
| creature, but it stopped and did not pursue him further. (Sources:    |

| 1980 - At around five a.m. the witness, a 33-year-old painter living  |
| in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England suddenly awoke in his bedroom to    |
| see a huge two-meter tall glowing green figure standing at the foot   |
| of his bed. It looked to him more like a holographic image than a     |
| solid figure. The being apparently communicated with the witness      |
| using telepathy. Among the many things mentioned was that his race    |
| regularly transported human beings to other planets in order to       |
| colonize them. When a planet was in danger of overpopulation they     |
| somehow started a war in order to reduce the number of inhabitants on |
| that planet. He also warned that the Earth was in danger of "breaking |
| in half." Apparently the witness's wife slept through the entire      |
| encounter. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database      |

| 1997 - B. C., a 57-year-old farmer living in Ille et Vilaine,         |
| Chantepie, France was awakened at two a.m. by a noise like an         |
| explosion and a strident whistling sound. His wife continued to       |
| sleep. He got out of bed and went to the kitchen to get something to  |
| eat. Suddenly he saw a bright flash of light outside. He looked out   |
| the French windows of his farmhouse and saw lights in the middle of a |
| field resembling headlights. He grabbed his shotgun and went out to   |
| investigate. Running toward the light, he attempted to shout a        |
| warning, but oddly no sound came out of his mouth. He next was hit by |
| some invisible force field and was unable to move. He then saw two    |
| small beings emerge from the luminous form. The figures looked to be  |
| transparent and passed close to him, seemingly unaware of his         |
| presence. The figures then walked toward the nearby barn. At the same |
| time he felt a prickling sensation and began to sweat. The small      |
| beings walked by him a second time and disappeared inside the         |
| luminous form. The light shot up into the sky vertically at an        |
| incredible speed. B. C. was now able to move and he returned to his   |
| kitchen, still sweating. When he got back to his bedroom his wife was |
| still in bed sleeping. He appeared to have experienced some missing   |
| time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1997,     |
