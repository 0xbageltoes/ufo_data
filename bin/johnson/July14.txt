| "comet" with illuminated windows on side make a hissing sound as it   |
| flew over Akron, Ohio at 9:45 p.m. It then shot up vertically into    |
| the sky at an incredible speed. (Sources: Flying Saucers magazine,    |

| 1934 - On a clear evening a perfectly circular, vividly white         |
| disc-shaped object hovered directly over a French tourist in the New  |
| Forest, north-northeast of Ringwood, Dorset, England at 8:30 p.m. A   |
| blue halo formed around the object for one minute, and then the UFO   |
| changed color from white to yellow to orange to red, whereupon it     |
| took off at high speed with a rushing sound. (Sources: Paul Faiveley, |

| 1947 - At 10:30 a.m. in Syracuse, New York a 13-year-old boy saw a    |
| long, featureless cigar-shaped object hovering over an orchard only   |
| 100 meters away. At 1:00 p.m. in Wilkesboro, North Carolina a buzzing |
| noise was heard and then a disc shot through the sky fast at an       |
| altitude of 1500 meters. At 7:20 p.m. a small disc flew over a farm   |
| south of Idaho Falls, Idaho flying on an irregular course, low and    |
| slow. It tilted, then flew away to the southwest making an odd sound. |

| 1951 - At the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico on this morning |
| an oval-shaped object flying near a B-29 was viewed from the ground   |
| through a telescope during a rocket launch, and then tracked on       |
| airborne radar by two jets. The radar confirmed the visual sighting   |
| of a fast-moving UFO. Motion picture footage was allegedly obtained,  |
| but subsequently lost. (Sources: Donald Keyhoe, True Magazine,        |

| 1952 - At 7:40 p.m. a group of three engineers in Hillandale, Alabama |
| watched a round glowing object descend to the north, then make an     |
| instant reversal in direction and head south. At 8:00 p.m. a famous   |
| sighting occurred over Chesapeake Bay near Norfolk, Virginia by two   |
| pilots named Nash and Fortenberry. The men were flying a DC-4         |
| aircraft for Pan American Airways when they sighted six luminous      |
| reddish-orange disc-shaped objects that were joined by two brighter   |
| discs. They were each estimated to be 100 feet in diameter, and they  |
| suddenly flipped on edge, revealing a flat, coin-like shape. They     |
| made a sharp turn, blinked off and on in unison, and then flew off in |
| formation as the disappeared in the distance. (Sources: (1) Loren E.  |

| 1964 - A close encounter occurred on this evening in Tallulah Falls,  |
| Georgia. Miss P. Upton came running home nearly hysterical. While     |

| 1999 - Three men were walking home from a local pizza parlor          |
| in Virgilio, Sicily, Italy at 11:45 p.m. when they spotted a bright   |
| red spherical object descend slowly from the sky at a 60 degree       |
| angle. It had a weak yellow light on its upper section. It was about  |
| 200 meters away above a nearby rooftop when first spotted. The object |
| halted six meters above the ground and hovered. Through an opening    |
| on top of the craft a vaguely human-shaped figure was visible.        |
| Suddenly, the craft shot up and disappeared over the rooftops. Five   |
| days later, at around 2:30 in the afternoon, the main witness was     |
| returning home when he saw a white vehicle parked in front of his     |
| house, occupied by two men. Soon after entering his home the two men  |
| knocked on his door. They proceeded to ask the witness several        |
| questions about the UFO he had seen, and basically harassed him with  |
| threatening remarks. He described them as very tall, about 40 years   |
| old, wearing white shirts and gray pants. They appeared to have       |
| nametags on the shirts, which they quickly covered. (Source: Albert   |

| 1999 - At 11:15 p.m. a taxi driver in Mastic, Suffolk County, New     |
| York was driving some passengers through town when they witnessed a   |
| metallic domed disc that was hovering at 150 m altitude. After he     |
| dropped off his passengers he noticed that the UFO was still there,   |
| hovering in the same spot, when the taxi made the return trip.        |

| 2000 - On this night a woman had just returned to her house in        |
| Rennes, France when she saw a disc-shaped object surrounded by bright |
| lights descend overhead and land in her garden. Two figures came out  |
| of the object. They had oval-shaped heads, bulging eyes, and large    |
| "cauliflower-like" ears that stuck out the side of their heads. The   |
| humanoids were wearing red colored combination suits. They spoke to   |
| the witness and she fell to the ground and went into a deep sleep.    |
| When she awoke the beings and the object were gone. (Source: Albert   |

| 2000 - At 11:30 p.m. an orange, dome shaped object flew over          |

| occasionally turned white as it flew by. (Source: Peter Davenport,    |

| 2003 - An animal reaction case was reported from Orting, Washington   |
| on this night. All dogs in the area whined loudly at around 1:30 a.m. |

| object, which bobbed up and down. (Source: Peter Davenport, National  |

| 2008 - A double set of pinpoint reddish orange steady lights was      |
| viewed at 200 feet distance in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at 10:00    |
| p.m. for a minute and a half. It was definitely a craft, according to |
| the witness. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, |
