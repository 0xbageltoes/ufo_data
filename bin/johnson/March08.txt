| 1949 - A silent greenish-white object was sighted in the sky near the |
| Los Alamos Atomic Energy research facility in New Mexico. It flew     |
| toward the southeast at the altitude of the cloud layer, and was seen |
| by guards Patterson and Lang from two guard stations: 103 and 106.    |

| 1950 - A Naval commander sighted a UFO in the sky over Mazatlan,      |
| Mexico which he described as an "artificial device." At five o'clock  |
| in the morning the crew of two airliners, the Air Traffic Controller, |
| and many other ground witnesses at Vandalia Airport, Ohio sighted a   |
| bullet-shaped UFO being chased by military jets. The UFO ascended     |
| very fast. (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence (Volume I), p.     |

| 1954 - A red disc-shaped UFO flew over the Laredo Air Force Base in   |
| Laredo, Texas on this day. It tilted to a vertical orientation and    |
| then shot straight up into the sky. It was reported by a pilot at the |
| base. At 11:07 p.m. ten to twenty nocturnal lights in a crescent      |
| formation--possibly a single crescent-shaped object--flew over San    |
| Antonio, Texas. It made no sound. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, May 1954;  |

| 1957 - A pilot saw a circular object flying against the wind in       |
| Baudette, Minnesota. It was luminous, about 5.5 meters in diameter,   |
| and flew so low that it appeared to suck up the snow on the ground.   |

| 1965 - At 7:40 p.m. three persons in Mount Airy, Maryland, including  |
| an instrument maker for the U.S. Bureau of Standards, saw a           |
| cigar-shaped object with six lights--two of them fixed red lights.    |
| It flew above them at a low altitude, and avoided hitting their house |
| at the last moment. It was lost from sight in the northeast. The      |
| duration of the event was three minutes. (Sources: Project Blue Book  |

| 1966 - A retired Marine Corps aircraft mechanic saw a domed           |
| disc-shaped UFO hover over Chesterton, Indiana at 2:30 in the         |
| afternoon. The UFO was surrounded by a bright, misty haze, and        |
| hovered above a cloud bank for 4-5 minutes. It then tilted at an      |
| angle and shot away. (Source: Gordon I.R. Lore, Jr., UFOs: A New      |

| 1967 - Mr. and Mrs. Wallace were driving in Leominster, Massachusetts |
| at 1:05 in the morning when they noticed an unusual light flying over |
| a nearby cemetery. They drove closer to investigate and saw the UFO   |
| surrounded by a heavy fog or mist. They described the object as a     |
| bright bluish-white, glowing dome-shaped object that was hovering low |
| to the ground with a rocking, pendulum motion. The rim of the object  |
| glowed as bright as an acetylene torch. The car's engine, lights, and |
| radio failed. Mr. Wallace got out of the car and felt his arm tugged  |
| by some force against the body of the car. He felt tingling electric  |
| shocks and felt paralyzed in close presence to the object. The UFO    |
| wobbled, hummed, and then shot up vertically into sky. (Source:       |

| 1967 - That night in Galesburg, Illinois a domed disc-shaped object   |
| with a spinning rim and a pulsating red light passed overhead, making |
| a hissing sound. (Sources: NICAP case investigation files; John A.    |

| 1967 - Also that same night an elongated flying object with flashing  |
| body lights and light beams at each end was reported by multiple      |
| independent witnesses in Goodland, Kansas. The UFO reportedly made a  |
| sound "like a vacuum cleaner." (Sources: Norton (Kansas) Daily        |

| 1977 - Nine independent witnesses watched a red ball of light         |
| maneuver against the wind in Gatchelville, Pennsylvania at 7:30 p.m.  |

| 1982 - There were two close encounter UFO reports on this day from    |
| Georgia and Connecticut. At 1:45 p.m. three former Air Force pilots   |
| flying in a private corporate jet saw a ten foot diameter silver disc |
| that flew within 25 feet of their left wingtip. They were flying      |
| close to Metter, Georgia at the time, 60 miles southwest of           |
| Allendale, South Carolina. At 8:15 p.m. three witnesses in a house in |
| Bethel, Connecticut saw two rows of red lights pass over their house  |
| and fly off towards the north-northeast at a low altitude. The UFO    |
| caused the house to shake when it passed over. (Sources: MUFON UFO    |

| 1997 - A triangle-shaped UFO with a large dome at one end hovered low |
| over a field in Lympe, England near the town of Hythe at three a.m.   |
| There were three witnesses. One of the witnesses, Ms. S. Hall, said   |
| that it had lots of bright lights around the sides and made a humming |
| noise. (Source: Lynn Picknett, Mammoth Book of UFOs, p. 168).         |

| 1998 - On this afternoon a farmer in Rho, Lombardia, Italy saw a      |
| white object in the shape of an upside-down pear hovering above a     |
| field. He called his wife and both watched the object for about half  |
| an hour. During the episode a hatch slid open and an occupant         |
| emerged. The UFOnaut was only about 40 inches tall, with two huge     |
| black eyes. The being floated in the air close to the object for      |
| about ten minutes, then re-entered the object which rose vertically   |
| and left at a high rate of speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |

| 2003 - A silent "flying wing" was seen by a couple leaving their home |
| in Greenbelt, Maryland at 8:15 p.m. It flew below the clouds at an    |
| estimated 600-1,200 feet altitude. It had "pure white" circular       |
| lights on the wingtips, small red lights in the middle that           |
| brightened and dimmed. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO         |
