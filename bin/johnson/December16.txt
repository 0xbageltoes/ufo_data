| 1950 – An unidentified object landed on the surface of Lake Michigan  |
| near Grand Haven, Michigan at 11:45 p.m. making the surface glow. It  |
| then sank beneath the surface. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A       |

| 1952 – In Gisborne, New Zealand at ten o’clock in the evening some    |
| “angel hair” residue fell from a fast moving, luminous blue object    |
| that made erratic maneuvers in the sky and flew off quickly towards   |
| the east. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. 1952:             |
| November-December, p. 68).                                            |

| 1953 – At the test launch of a V-2 rocket at Point Mugu, California   |
| many ground observers watched a huge, fast moving white disc fly off  |
| toward the west. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. 1953:      |

| 1954 – Taking a rest stop while driving along the Pan-American        |
| highway near San Carlos del Zulia, Venezuela, Jesus Paz left his two  |
| friends in their car and walked off a short distance to relieve       |
| himself. They heard him screaming and then saw him fall unconscious.  |
| A small hairy dwarf ran off from the spot to a flat, shiny hovering   |
| UFO. The machine shot off with a loud whistle. Jesus Paz had deep     |
| scratches on his body from the creature. (Source: Coral E. Lorenzen,  |
| Flying Saucers: The Startling Evidence of the Invasion from Outer     |
| Space, p. 55).                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1957 – Mrs. Mary M. Starr, a long-term resident of Old Saybrook,      |
| Connecticut and a graduate of Yale University with two degrees, was   |
| in the habit of spending all but two or three winter months in a two  |
| story beach house situated only a few hundred feet from Long Island   |
| Sound. At the beginning and end of the tourist season her home is the |
| only building occupied in the vicinity, and marshy ground surrounds   |
| her property on three sides. On this night Mrs. Starr was awakened    |
| from a sound sleep sometime between two three a.m. by bright lights   |
| passing her bedroom window, which faces north. She looked out her     |
| east window and saw a fuselage-shaped craft coming to a stop just 10  |
| feet from the hourse. It was 20 to 30 feet long, dark gray or black,  |
| with brightly lit square windows. The object hovered motionless, just |
| five feet above the ground. It had no wings, fins, or other external  |
| structure.                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| Behind the lighted windows were two humanoid forms that passed each   |
| other, walking in opposite directions. They appeared to be wearing    |
| yellow jackets, and each had his right hand raised. She thought at    |
| first they might be stewards, carrying trays, except that their heads |
| were unusual. They were square or rectangular and a reddish orange in |
| color. Their feet were out of view below the portholes. Then a third  |
| man entered from the left, and Mrs. Starr leaned forward to try to    |
| see his face more clearly. As she did so the portholes faded and the  |
| entire object began to glow with scintillating brilliance.            |
| Immediately, there rose from the nearer end a kind of antenna, about  |
| six inches long. It oscillated and sparkled. For almost five minutes  |
| the glow and the sparking continued, then the antenna lowered and the |
| object began to move to the right, back in the direction from which   |
| it had come. It made a very sharp right-angle turn. Mrs. Starr        |
| thought it would hit her blue spruce but it did not. It had by now    |
| turned a dull bluish gray again, and instead of portholes small       |
| circular lights outlined the entire rim. It's shape now appeared to   |
| be oval, and as it dipped or "undulated" to follow the contour of a   |
| shallow depression just beyond the garden, she saw that it was very   |
| shallow in depth. Over the marsh it tilted steeply and shot up into   |
| the sky at the speed of a jet taking off, but in complete silence.    |
|                                                                       |
| Except for the figures, she had seen nothing inside the object. The   |
| men could not have been more than four feet tall at the most, given   |
| the size of the object as determined by occlusion of nearby objects.  |
| The U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book recorded the case as "little men |
| in cigar." Project Blue Book filed a newspaper article on the case,   |
| but did not investigate. (Sources: Civilian Saucer Intelligence       |
| Newsletter, July 15, 1959; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A     |
| Century of Landings, case 451; Coral E. Lorenzen, Flying Saucers: The |
| Startling Evidence of the Invasion from Outer Space, p. 77).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1957 – Later that same night at around 8:45 p.m. an aluminum colored, |
| disc-shaped UFO followed a train near Chrockatt de Sa in Minas Gerais |
| State, Brazil for ten minutes, maneuvering back and forth from side   |
| to side of the train. It had a bright orange light. (Source: Loren E. |
| Gross, The Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse: UFOs: A History. 1957:   |
| December, p. 53).                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1965 – In Chineham, Basingstoke, England at 7:45 p.m. two police      |
| officers, J. Harwood and B. Gibbons, sighted a tadpole-shaped UFO     |
| with a large green dome on top and a red flaming tail two to three    |
| times its length. It passed overhead at an extreme speed. There were  |
| low lying clouds at the time and the UFO passed under the clouds.     |
| (Source: Gary Heseltine, UFO Magazine (UK), July 2003, p. 5, citing   |
| R. Chapman).                                                          |

| 1967 - A man driving with his girlfriend late at night in Winterfold, |
| Surrey, England had stopped his vehicle outside a deserted mansion in |
| order to clean the windshield. His girlfriend meanwhile remained in   |
| the car. He noticed an acrid smell. He got back into the car and then |
| noticed a strange figure looking at them from nearby. The humanoid    |
| was about four foot six inches tall and had a luminous, oblong-shaped |
| head. Furthermore, the odor seemed to be coming from his direction.   |
| The figure approached and put an arm on the roof of the car. At this  |
| point the man and woman drove away at high speed. (Source: Albert S.  |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1967, case # 1640, citing Fortean  |
| Times, issue # 10).                                                   |

| 1977 – On a highway just north of Uzes, France at 10:00 p.m.          |
| witnesses on two separate motorbikes both had their bikes stall in    |
| the presence of a Saturn-shaped UFO with a red ring around it. The    |
| UFO crossed over highway D979 going east, then flew away to the west. |
| At 11:25 p.m. in La Aurora, Uruguay there was a great flash in the    |
| northeastern sky, followed by a UFO gyrating downward as if out of    |
| control. Huge sparks fell to the ground, and the UFO descended as if  |
| going to land, but then suddenly rose up into the sky at tremendous   |
| speed. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, October 1978; Bob Van Der     |
| Velde, APRO Bulletin, May 1982, p. 4).                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 – At 2:30 a.m. in Francavilla, Italy a college coed saw an   |
| ovoid UFO surrounded by a white mist. She was standing in her living  |
| room by a balcony overlooking the sea when she noticed a gaseous      |
| form, white in color with two pulsating lights, a red one at one end, |
| a green one at the other end. It descended onto the surface of the    |
| sea and became a very bright flourescent white light that reflected   |
| off the surface of the water. She attempted to wake her parents but   |
| they continued to sleep. She next noticed two short figures standing  |
| in the garden at the adjacent apartment. They were very thin with     |
| large squarish heads and large feet. Both were wearing dark gray      |
| tight-fitting uniforms. They turned a corner moving as if in slow     |
| motion and in a limping manner, disappearing down an alleyway.        |
| Moments later the bright white light, now very near the breakwater,   |
| vanished. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 218; Maurizio      |
| Verga, ITACAT - Italian UFO Catalogue).                               |

| 1978 – Over Calama, near the city of Antofagasta in northern      |
| Chile at shortly after midnight, a Chilean Air Force jet sighted and  |
| tried to intercept a huge luminous rectangular flying object.         |
| (Source: Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p. 42 citing   |

| 1978 – In Caracas, Venezuela in the early morning, predawn hours  |
| five UFOs emitted different colors, made a semi-circular turn, and    |
| then hovered over a mountain for several minutes before finally       |
| shooting away. (Source: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping Service, March  |
| 1979, p. 14 citing Cronica, December 16, 1978).                       |

| 1978 – At 5:30 a.m. at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada a    |
| married couple and a child saw a disc-shaped object with glowing      |
| white lights. The UFO made several falling leaf movements. An airline |
| pilot flying in the vicinity also reported that a UFO streaked by his |
| airliner although the UFO did not appear on radar. (Source: Las Vegas |
| (Nevada) Sun, December 17, 1978).                                     |

| 1978 – On this night on a road one-mile south of Abington,        |
| Indiana the witnesses’s car engine and radio went dead when a UFO     |
| appeared coming over the trees only ten feet above the ground. The    |
| aluminum colored UFO was shaped like a trapezoid with rounded         |
| corners, with two lights in the front and two on the bottom. (Source: |
| Richmond (Indiana) Paladium Item, January 1979, p. 7).                |

| 1978 – In Saltillo, Mexico in the state of Coahuila a flying      |
| object exploded in the night, lighting up the sky with a violet       |
| color. The explosion was reportedly heard over a 1,000 square         |
| kilometer area. (Source: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping Service, March |

| 1992 – A man awoke on this night at 5:30 a.m. in his bedroom in       |
| Scotland and felt compelled to go to window. He saw a tall,           |
| tannish-gray being only two meters away. A powerful sense of fear     |
| overcame him, and he believed that the alien had come for his         |
| girlfriend, still asleep in the bed. He next experienced a loss of    |
| memory as to what happened next, and they both felt ill. (Source:     |

| 1997 - On this night in Riachao De Jacuipe, Brazil a witness saw a    |
| bright light in a nearby field that increased rapidly in size as it   |
| approached. viewing through a pair of binoculars, the witness saw a   |
| humanoid silhouette within the light. It was without any features,    |
| and appeared to be silvery metallic in color, and emitting an orange  |
| beam of light. It and the light suddenly disappeared. (Source: Albert |
