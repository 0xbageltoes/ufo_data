| 1947 - A 1:15 p.m. four rocket experts saw a silver saucer in the sky |
| over Organ, New Mexico. It flew off to the north at 9,000 feet        |
| altitude. (Source: Ted Bloecher, Report on the UFO Wave of 1947, p.   |

| 1947 - About 45 minutes later nine white saucers flying in            |
| V-formation flew over Medford, Oregon at a speed of 120 mph. They     |
| flew in a spiral over the airport, and appeared to make a cloud.      |

| 1947 - Between 13 and 18 white oval and disc-shaped objects flew over |
| Clarion, Iowa at 4:45 p.m. They made a noise like that of a dynamo.   |

| 1952 - On this night three military policemen in Park Ridge, Illinois |
| near O'Hare Airport sighted a thirty foot in diameter disc with a     |
| blue glow hovering over two civilian radio towers. It jumped about in |
| the sky for 45 minutes. (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in   |

| 1952 - At 9:05 p.m. EDT a BOAC airliner with 22 witnesses aboard      |
| tracked a group of at least seven objects for 18 minutes over Canada, |
| first encountering the objects around Sept-Iles in Quebec. The        |
| objects were seen flying in and out of broken cloud cover. There were |
| six small ovals and a larger dark object, which was continually       |
| changing shape. It was described as changing shape "like a swarm of   |
| bees might do." The six smaller orbs were "strung out in a line." The |
| explanation provided by the US Air Force, that they were witnessing   |
| Mars, was impossible at the time. (Sources: Brinsley LePoer Trench,   |

| 1964 - Lavonia, Georgia - Driving near the Georgia-South Carolina      |
| border late in the evening, Beauford Parham experienced a close       |
| encounter with a huge, amber colored, spinning top-shaped UFO. It     |
| made a hissing sound "like a million snakes". The witness felt a      |
| burning sensation in his body while the UFO hovered just in front of  |
| car for more than a minute as he travelled along at 65 mph. The UFO   |
| went up over the car, leaving a strong odor like "embalming fluid"    |
| and a gaseous vapor covered his car. The UFO came straight at his car |
| again and the engine of his car began to miss. He stopped the car,    |
| and the object "spun like crazy" and then took off, disappearing in a |
| split second. Parham's hands continued to burn even after he washed   |
| them. An oily substance on the car persisted after several washings,  |
| and the car's hood was warped with bubbled up paint. (Source: Richard Hall,   |
| Uninvited Guests, pg. 248).                                           |

| 1967 - A man and a woman driving at 1:30 a.m. sighted an              |
| oyster-shaped UFO near Scotch Plains, New Jersey. It was very large,  |
| perhaps 200 feet wide, and 25-30 feet thick. It had three red lights  |
| and a row of blue lights. The UFO followed their car for 500 feet,    |
| then veered off to the south and took off. A Project Blue Book        |
| "unknown." (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official      |

| 1968 - On this evening in San Luis de Palmar, Corrientes, Argentina   |
| on Highway 5 a circular flattened disc-shaped object was sighted by   |
| three men in their thirties, Senors Sanchez, Pastor, and Vega. It     |
| emitted a vivid orange light. When it passed close to their car it    |
| shook the car violently and the car's gears went into reverse,        |
| causing the car to drive backwards. (Source: Oscar A. Uriondo, FSR    |

| 1970 - At 9:32 p.m. a 20 foot in diameter glowing green, oval-shaped  |
| object with a small blue inner ring descended at a 45-degree angle    |
| toward four people in a car in Apopka, Florida. It came down 1000     |
| feet away and to the right of the car and pursued the car closely. It |
| had a hazy edge and a convex bottom. (Source: Hollifield, APRO        |
| Bulletin, July-August 1970, p. 1).                                    |

| 1972 - In 1972 a circular orange UFO hovered at 250 meters altitude around 9 |
| p.m. for two minutes along the shore of Calais, France. It dropped    |
| some kind of a liquid, then flew to the northwest out to sea.         |

| 1974 - At one o'clock in the morning in Lille, Nord, France a         |
| lenticular-shaped disc that emitted a strong orange light was seen by |
| several witnesses travelling in a cars. The car batteries were        |
| drained of power. At 2:25 a.m. a reddish orange luminous cylinder was |
| seen over Hellemes, Nord, France. It hung vertically in the sky and   |
| had an intensely bright center section. A second and third set of     |
| witnesses saw an orange light but did not see the structure of the    |
| object. A fourth set of witnesses saw a violent red light. The        |
| cylinder was over the zinc roof of a house, and reportedly in         |
| generated smoke from the roof as the zinc roofing partially melted.   |

| 1974 - At Bogue Inlet, Washington, North Carolina at 9:30 p.m. a      |
| businessman was on his boat on the lake when he spotted a cone-shaped |
| UFO hovering over one spot in the lake for ten minutes. It stayed     |
| there until a plane flew over, when it then shot up vertically at     |
| high speed, giving off an orange, jet-like flame. It was definitely   |
| not a Marine military aircraft, according to the witness. (Sources:   |

| 1975 - At 10:30 p.m. a reddish orange ovoid object with a halo of     |
| light flew toward the northwest and maneuvered up into the sky. It    |
| was watched for 45 minutes over the town of Puilly, Meuse, France. It |
| was completely silent. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, December       |
| 1975).                                                                |

| 1989 - Several villagers in Chrysopetra, Macedonia, Greece had        |
| previously seen strange flashes of light in the sky earlier in the    |
| day. At 2:30 p.m. an elderly woman was doing some household chores    |
| when she heard a loud bang from outside. She ran out and found her    |
| granddaughter in a state of shock. The girl told her that she had     |
| seen a large white cloud in the garden, and then the figure of a      |
| giant almost eight meters tall appeared. He seemed to be totally      |
| encased in mist and was slightly deformed. He disappeared suddenly    |
| disappeared in plain sight emitting a loud banging sound. Large       |
| footprints were found later at the site of the encounter. (Source:    |

| 1989 - The witness was sleeping on a couch that night in Bradford,    |
| Ontario when she woke up at 3:39 a.m. feeling very apprehensive. She  |
| had a strong buzzing sensation in her head and became completely      |
| paralyzed. The next thing she knew it was five o'clock in the         |
| morning. She was later able to recall that several 3 to 4 foot tall   |
| humanoids with very thin arms and small heads had appeared in her     |
| room and had somehow taken her up through the roof. They pointed at a |
| large dark boomerang-shaped object overhead and told her that it was  |
| a "light portal." She was then taken onboard. Inside the ship she saw |
| an enormous ziggurat-shaped ship, ringed with white running lights on |
| each level. She was told that it was a "light ship" that traveled     |
| inter-dimensionally on light particles. The beings also talked about  |
| human being's perception of dying and the existence of many other     |
| dimensions. A few nights prior to this incident the same witness      |
| recalled also having had several small beings in her room and she had |
| gone immediately to sleep. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |

| 1994 - A round craft so large that it obscurred an entire water tower |
| was seen from Pensacola Beach, Florida at 11:55 p.m. by six           |
| witnesses. It made no discernable sound. (Source: C. Joseph Barron,   |
