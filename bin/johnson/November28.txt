| 1942 - On this night a cigar-shaped object flew over Turin, Italy. It |
| was 200-300 feet in length and flew at an estimated 500 mph. It had   |
| four red lights spaced at equal distances along its body. (Source:    |

| 1952 - At 7:40 p.m. an odd fireball moved too slowly to be a meteor,  |
| then zigzagged for 20 minutes. It's estimated altitude was 50,000     |
| feet; "not a star" according to the witness, who was flying over      |
| Delta, Utah in a U.S. Air Force T-33 trainer. (Source: Loren E.       |

| 1953 - On this day two men, Pedro Serrate and Francisco Teixeira,     |
| were duck hunting on the Baia dos Patos, near the city of Pedras      |
| Negras in Maranhao State, Brazil when a disc-shaped UFO hovered over  |
| and then alighted on the bay, only 15 feet away from one of them. The |
| dark blue hull was like two “basins” put together; 16 feet long, 8    |
| feet high, and 6 feet wide. Around the perimeter was a three foot rim |
| of transparent glass. It had two curved pipes or tubes that were      |
| pouring out water, and behind the hull was a sort of rudder three     |
| feet long. Sr. Serrate could see four young human looking men and two |
| young women sitting in a row inside the craft. They all had red hair  |
| with pinkish faces, and the women had long hair. All of them wore     |
| dark blue uniforms. When then noticed that they were watched, the     |
| craft took off at a fantastic speed, and disappeared from sight       |
| within seconds. (Sources: O Cruzeiro newspaper, November 13, 1954;    |

| 1954 - At 2:00 a.m. in the city of Petare, Venezuela two men had a    |
| violent encounter with three hairy dwarfs. They first saw a luminous  |
| sphere on the ground with a hatch door open. Out of it came three     |
| hairy dwarfs wearing loincloths. They were about three feet tall with |
| clawed fingers. The dwarves fought with the men, who reported that    |
| they appeared to have phenomenal strength. At one point one of the    |
| man attempted to stab one of the creatures with a knife, but the      |
| blade glanced off as if the creature’s body was made of steel.  There |
| was a blinding light and the creatures and the craft were gone.       |

| On that same night in 1954 in Palmarito, Venezuela a group of         |
| peasants saw a sphere land and discharge three very short dwarfish    |
| men. When they re-boarded and the object flew away, they reported the |
| craft left behind a slightly visible trail in the sky. (Sources:      |

| 1954 - Also in 1954 at 12:45 p.m. five miles east of the city of Manila in   |
| the Philippines, two 39-year-old men, one of them a doctor with a     |
| degree in physics, watched an orange domed disc maneuver through the  |
| sky. The craft was about 70 feet in diameter, and had five evenly     |
| spaced yellow portholes. The body of the object itself was flecked    |
| with red streaks, and it made no sound as it moved. The UFO reversed  |
| direction and was gone in three seconds. Listed as a Project Blue     |
| Book “unknown” case. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in     |

| 1956 - A strange customer in John Whitworth's shop in Biggelswade,    |
| England, someone with a very high forehead, told him that he could    |
| see a flying saucer if he would go to a certain spot on this night.   |
| Whitworth went there and did see a hovering object like a humming     |
| top, with lighted portholes. Just one year later the visitor returned |
| and told him he would again have a contact this time, at another      |
| spot. Whitworth went with a crowd of others, including a BBC          |
| recording van, and was disappointed. Later he received a telephone    |
| call, “in an unearthly voice,” which reproached him for bringing the  |
| others. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of   |

| 1966 - At 5:15 a.m. a man named Nipper driving between Lennox and     |
| Valdosta, Georgia near the town of Sparks saw a luminous object land  |
| on the road; his car engine stalls, and his radio goes dead.          |

| 1966 - On this night two 17-year-old teenagers, a man and a woman,    |
| were driving on Highway 1300 in El Campo, Wharton County, Texas when  |
| they were pursued by a UFO. They first observed a dark, red object    |
| land by the side of the road, and later it took off and started       |
| following their car. (Sources: Houston Tribune, January 19, 1967;     |

| 1967 - At 2:18 a.m. farmer Wilson Gusmao, who had been involved in    |
| previous humanoid encounters, was awakened in Alexania, Goias State,  |
| Brazil by a telepathic voice that called his name. He got out of bed  |
| and upon raising the curtain he noticed a huge bright light resting   |
| on the ground about 100 meters from his house. He attempted to wake   |
| up his wife but to no avail. He also attempted to get his brother in  |
| law to wake up, but with the same negative results. Walking to the    |
| living room he could now clearly see a landed object encased in a     |
| bright blue glow that was about five meters in diameter. He left a    |
| written note to his wife, telling her that he was going to check a    |
| landed "spacecraft," grabbed a flashlight, and walked outside. It was |
| raining very heavily at the time that Wilson approached the UFO,      |
| getting to within three meters. A bright beam of light then struck    |
| Wilson around the waist, causing him to levitate closer to the object |
| and completely paralyzing him. A door now opened and Wilson could see |
| the inside of the craft clearly. He saw four humanoids, all dressed   |
| in tight-fitting coveralls. They wore a belts with large buckles that |
| had what looke like "piano keys" on them. The beings stared at Wilson |
| intently. Wilson somehow felt inferior when the humanoids watched     |
| him. He described them as human looking with long blond hair. Their   |
| skin appeared porcelain-white, as if they had never been exposed to   |
| any sunlight. The leader of the group conversed with Wilson and gave  |
| him several messages dealing with nuclear armaments on Earth. Wilson  |
| was to have later contacts along with members of the Brazilian        |
| defense establishment including General Uchoa. (Sources: David F.     |

| 1967 - At 2:30 a.m. a Brazilian highway patrolman saw an immense      |
| object near Americana, Sau Paulo State, Brazil "as high as a 15-story |
| building, apparently made of aluminum and with enormous rivets on     |
| it." It descended and hovered 50 yards from the ground. It carried    |
| searchlights too bright to look at, and made a loud humming sound     |
| that made the patrolman's head ache. His police car would not start   |
| and its lights went out, as well as the lights in the police booth,   |
| but they came back on as soon as the object departed. (Sources: APRO  |

| 1967 - At 7:15 p.m. three witnesses in Rockport, Maine had a close    |
| encounter with a row of 8-10 blinking white lights, and a parallel    |
| upper row of yellow lights, that seemed to be attached to a curved    |
| surface of a flying object. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:         |

| 1967 - At 10:20 p.m. near High River, Alberta, Canada a car radio     |
| began fading in and out and the headlights and dashboard lights       |
| dimmed. The witness then saw a bluish-green, elongated object to his  |
| left. It was quite fuzzy and no details could be made out. He stopped |
| the car and heard a noise like a "jet motor," only very loud. The     |
| object continued traveling on a straight line towards the east and    |
| disappeared, whereupon the lights and radio then started operating    |
| properly. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, January-February 1968, p. 5; Mark  |

| 1968 - At 9:56 a.m. local time Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base       |
| (RTAFB) in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand Ground Control Approach (GCA)      |
| reported two low flying and slow moving objects approximately 13      |
| nautical miles (NM) south of the base. Contact with the UFOs was lost |
| when the objects were 9 NM west of the base. Sightings were confirmed |
| by radar. The Nakhon Phanom Command Post was informed that the        |
| sightings "definitely were not ghosts." (Source: www.nicap.org,       |

| 1968 - On this night students from the local Recoleta de Montevideo   |
| School in Lima, Peru reported encountering a strange short humanoid   |
| with an egg-shaped head and a blinking light on its chest area, and   |
| what appeared to be a long antenna like protrusion on its back. It    |
| appeared to have duck-like feet, and it was shorter than a 7-year-old |
| boy. A priest and a teacher also reported seeing the creature.        |

| 1971 - On this day in Canoga Park, California a nocturnal light was   |
| seen skimming the ground. Later investigation revealed three 38"      |
| diameter imprints in an 18 foot triangle, and  a burnt bush at the    |
| site. (Source: Ted Phillips, Physical Traces Associated with UFO      |

| 1972 - At 12.30 a.m. Alfonso Rey, age 62, was watching television in  |
| his home in Tres Arroyos, Buenos Aires province, Argentina when the   |
| TV picture went out. When he got up to check the TV he noticed a tall |
| being seated in an armchair at the opposite end of the room, wearing  |
| a blue-green metallic coverall uniform, with helmet, boots, and a     |
| black belt with a box attached. The being stood up, and was at least  |
| 6.5 feet tall. Sr. Rey asked the being what he wanted, but got no     |
| reply. Rey touched the being's hand, which felt cold and abnormally   |
| soft, "like foam rubber". He could not describe the facial features   |
| except for the eyes, which "seemed to emit a silvery light." Sr. Rey  |
| went into the kitchen, followed by the strange visitor, and he        |
| noticed that his refrigerator was not running normally. Sr. Rey also  |
| noticed that his visitor seemed to be walking on air. Next the being  |
| pressed some buttons on his belt apparatus, which caused an amber     |
| light to come on. Then he walked to the backdoor, and looking up at   |
| the sky pressed other buttons on his belt. The being went outside     |
| into the yard, then vanished into thin air. That afternoon, at 4:20   |
| p.m. several patrons of a bar reported witnessing a similar looking   |
| stranger in the bar at the corner of Calle Alsina and Calle Pringles, |
| in Tres Arroyos. Their descriptions matched those provided by Sr.     |
| Rey. They said the stranger walked into the bar's bathroom and did    |
| not emerge. (Source: Jane Thomas, FSR Case Histories, issue #14,      |

| 1972 - In La Sarre, Abitibi, Quebec at 10:30 a.m. a nine-year-old     |
| boy, Mario Mercier, was alone on an ice skating rink on a sunny day   |
| when he observed a white, spherical cloud-like UFO land in a snowy    |
| field 700 feet away.  Three four-foot tall, square-shouldered beings  |
| emerged, wearing black suits and black square-shaped helmets. One of  |
| them carried a small black "kettle" that he proceeded to fill with    |
| snow. He then walked to the Mercier family chicken house, and was     |
| about to enter when the boy cried out. He then turned toward Mario,   |
| who attempted to hide inside the rink's hockey net. The UFOnaut       |
| walked back, and with one of the others, was seen to "climb" or       |
| levitate into the "cloud." The UFO rose vertically swiftly. A 10 foot |
| circle of blackened grass was left behind, with rectangular tracks in |
| snow. It was two years before grass would grow again at the site.     |

| 1980 - Police constable Alan Godfrey, age 31, was on routine patrol   |
| in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, England when at 5:05 a.m. he            |
| encountered a metallic disc with a dome on top and a row of five      |
| windows, blocking the road ahead. He fetl attracted to it, and        |
| alternately frightened and secure while he sat in his patrol car.     |
| When he attempted to alert headquarters to its presence he found that |
| his radio would not work. He then sketched the craft. The domed       |
| metallic disc had the rowof windows, was luminous, and had additional |
| lights on top and bottom. The central section was spinning; bushes    |
| beneath it were agitated. Abruptly, he found himself one hundred      |
| yards farther down the road than he had been, and the UFO was gone.   |
| He had a vague recollection of getting out of his car and looking for |
| the object, and hearing a voice, and he had 15 minutes of missing     |
| time. When he returned to the car it would not start.                 |
|                                                                       |
| Later, under hypnosis, Godfrey recalled that he lost consciousness    |
| after a beam of light from the object struck him. Then he felt        |
| himself floating into the craft and meeting a human-like being named  |
| Joseph. The UFO occupant was six feet tall, and friendly in demeanor; |
| Joseph had a thin nose, a beard, and mustache. He wore a skullcap and |
| was clad in a robe, making him look something like a Biblical         |
| prophet. A large black dog accompanied him. The room also contained   |
| eight metallic robots, each about three and a half feet tall, with    |
| headgear like lampshades, which were making a sort of murmuring       |
| chatter. Whenever they touched Godfrey, beeping sounds emanated from  |
| them. Joseph directed Godfrey to a bed. He thought about resisting,   |
| but instead lay down on the bed, where a beam of light from the       |
| ceiling shone down on him. Communicating by telepathy, Joseph touched |
| his head, and Godfrey lapsed into unconsciousness for a while. The    |
| robots removed Godfrey's shoes and studied his toes. Meanwhile,       |
| instruments were placed on his arms and legs , which caused him       |
| discomfort to the point of sickness. There was a sickly odor that     |
| permeated his nostrils, and he closed his eyes from time to time.     |
| Joseph asked him questions, but Godfrey would refuse to tell          |
| investigators what they were. The alien told Godfrey that they had    |
| met before, apparently when Godfrey was a child. After the incident,  |
| he had a split in the sole of his boot, and a bruise on his foot. EM  |
| effects were the failure of two different radio systems (UHF and      |
| VHF). Three other cops saw a bright light moving toward Todmorden at  |
| the time of Godfrey's abduction experience. (Sources: Jenny Randles,  |

| described as a gray oval-shaped object, perhaps 20 feet in diameter,  |
| which made no sound. She concluded that psychic interaction between   |

| 2000 - Several witnesses in Oakville, Ontario, Canada first saw six   |
| chevron or V-shaped craft fly and land behind a hill at around nine   |
| o'clock in the morning.  They went closer to see better and saw eight |
| of the objects, three of them already on the ground. All of the craft |
| appeared to be damaged. Four beings, with light brown skin and large  |
| oval-shaped eyes, came out of one of the objects and seemed to        |
| inspect their craft. When they turned around and saw the witnesses    |
| there next was a loud, piercing noise, causing the witnesses to lose  |
| consciousness. When they recovered consciousness, all of the craft    |
| had gone, and they discovered several puncture wounds in their skin.  |
| After the experience their watches were all four hours behind the     |
