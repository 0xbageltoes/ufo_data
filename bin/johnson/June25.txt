| 1943 - The USAAF First Air Division was flying over the Elbe Estuary  |
| in Germany on this day when they saw twelve flat objects,             |
| approximately six-feet square, fall like dead leaves. No "flack" or   |
| other explosions were noted at the time. (Source: Jan Aldrich,        |
| Project 1947 website).                                                |

| 1952 - At 20:23 p.m. over Suwon, Korea a silver coin-shaped object    |
| was seen spinning in a counterclockwise direction. The edges of the   |
| disc were dark blue, with its diameter seven times larger than its    |
| thickness. It changed course, paused, then rose vertically straight   |
| up. A bright yellow-white egg-shaped light flew at a slightly higher  |
| elevation than the planet Venus over Chicago, Illinois. Occasionally  |
| had a red tail light visible. It made a large continuous circle in    |
| the night sky at a slow speed. Project Blue Book "unidentified" case. |
| (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in official statistics, case |
| # 1344).                                                              |

| 1954 - A 40-foot diameter disc with a cone-shaped top was sighted by  |
| a private pilot over Indian Lake, Ohio at 4:05 p.m. Jets were seen    |
| pursuing the object. Ground radar returns confirmed the presence of   |
| the UFO. Project Blue Book "unidentified" case. (Source: Project Blue |
| Book files counted in official statistics, case # 3072).              |
|                                                                       |
| 1957 - Baltimore, Maryland: "Car radio stopped playing and street     |
| lights went out as formation of seven white discs with red rims       |
| passed overhead." (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving      |
| Vehicle Interference, case 42, citing Richard H. Hall, The UFO        |
| Evidence (Volume I)).                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1962 - In Kurrajong, New South Wales, Australia a glowing red object  |
| of great size and speed was seen as it flew over. (Source: Michael    |
| Hervey, UFOs over the Southern Hemisphere, p. 87).                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1964 - In Spring Valley, Nevada a spinning top-shaped UFO w pyramidal |
| sides and a two-foot long pedestal was seen resting on the ground. It |
| was about the size of a Jeep and was a "shiny plastic" color. It rose |
| ten feet off the ground, then landed again. Took off and flew in a    |
| horizontal direction. A UFO very similar in appearance was sighted in |
| South Carolina on June 30, 1964. (Sources: newspaper clipping, July   |
| 1, 1964; Project Blue Book files counted in official statistics).     |
|                                                                       |
| Spring Valley, Nevada - 1964                                          |

| 1967 - Dogs howled when a UFO flew ten to twenty feet off the ground, |
| making a low-pitched, droning noise, three miles north of Harrisburg, |
| Pennsylvania. As police approached the object the light went out and  |
| the dogs stopped barking. The two principal witnesses could hear      |
| voices coming from the UFO, talking in a high-pitched,                |
| incomprehensible "gibberish" at 2:05 a.m. (Sources: David F. Webb and |
| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1967-50;    |
| George Cook, NICAP investigation files).                              |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - On this night in Bethel, Connecticut six teenagers were        |
| sleeping out in the backyard of a home when they saw a bright light.  |
| They drove to Sunset Hill to get a better view and saw it was a domed |
| disc with red and green flashing lights around the dome. Their car    |
| radio experienced interference when the object was in view. Several   |
| weeks later, some members of the group found an area of grass matted  |
| down where the object had hovered close to the ground. (Source: Mark  |
| Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, case 206,      |
| citing Ted R. Phillips, PhysicaI Traces Associated with UFO           |
| Sightings).                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 10:30 p.m. Robert Luca was driving from Durham, Connecticut |
| to Hamnonassett Beach when he saw two large, cigar-shaped objects in  |
| the sky. From one of them came two smaller objects; one flew to the   |
| east, the other to the west. One of the discs came towards him,       |
| descending in falling leaf motion behind some trees about 1/4 mile    |
| away. It was dull metallic in color. The next thing he remembered was |
| arriving at the beach shortly before two a.m., with no memory of the  |
| intervening three hours. Under hypnosis in 1977, Luca remembered      |
| being nude in a room with a white floor, lighted by indirect blue     |
| white light. In a later session, he remembered being on a table in    |
| this room, with two "persons" at his head and feet. The entities had  |
| large baldheads, no noses and "tapered" faces. (Sources: David F.     |
| Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case    |
| 1967-52; David Webb & Richard Nycz case investigation files).         |
|                                                                       |
| 1971 - A brilliant flash of light followed by a gust of wind were     |
| seen and felt in Stewart, Minnesota at 12:30 a.m. Ducks in the area   |
| were frantic. Two 8-meter wide crop circles were discovered in a      |
| cornfield. (Source: Coral E. Lorenzen, Encounters with UFO Occupants, |
| p. 20).                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - At 12:50 p.m. small dark object ascended from the ground and   |
| joined a large, delta-shaped object overhead in Melville, Western     |
| Australia. Later that day a group of meteorology professors saw a     |
| wingless cigar-shaped UFO fly toward the east over Verona, Italy for  |
| 20 minutes beginning at 6:00 p.m. A 25-meter circular hole in the     |
| ground was found later. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, July-August 1972, p. |
| 8; Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue no. 121).                             |
|                                                                       |
| 1974 - A dog began barking at 1:15 a.m. when a domed disc-shaped UFO  |
| with red and white lights on top and an orange-lit rim with oval      |
| white lights landed in St-Cyrille-de-Wendover, Quebec. Three rings    |
| were found at the site, 19 feet in diameter with a 2-foot width. The  |
| grass inside the rings did not appear to be disturbed. (Source:       |
| Center for UFO Studies investigation files, on-site investigation;    |
| Wido Hoville, Skylook, November 1974, p. 10; APRO Bulletin, December  |
| 1974, p. 1).                                                          |

| 1976 - A woman and two teenage girls were driving on interstate       |
| highway I-680 in Pleasanton, California when they saw an eighty-foot  |
| long, 40-foot wide ellipsoidal object. It had a revoling bottom       |
| section with red and white panels of light. It was self-luminous, and |
| kept pace with the car, flew over, then flew away over some houses.   |
| (Source: MUFON case investigation files; MUFON UFO Journal, March     |
| 1977, p. 8).                                                          |

| 1978 - At an evening baseball game in Medway, Massachusetts around 8  |
| p.m. a silvery-gray domed disc came down low over the field and       |
| hovered, bobbed, wobbled, and moved behind some trees. It re-emerged, |
| wobbled and hovered again for about a minute. Its distance was about  |
| 200-300 feet from the by-standers. (Source: Richard Hall, MUFON UFO Journal,  |
| December 1978, pg. 16).                                               |

| 1984 - A bright circle trailing a red tail and flashing a beam of     |
| light from its circumference was seen hovering over Blairgowrie in    |
| the Orkney Islands, Scotland. A V-shaped object was seen to leave and |
| return to the circular object several times. After awhile both        |
| objects faded away. (Source: Ron Halliday, UFO Scotland: The secret   |
| history of Scotland's UFO phenomenon, p. 141).                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1993 - At 8:50 p.m. a private pilot at his home in Rognes, France     |
| sighted a black disc-shaped object flying quickly from the north to   |
| south at 3,000 feet altitude. He reported it to the police and Air    |
| Traffic Control. (Source: Phenomena magazine, issue no. 16).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1995 - A very shiny silvery egg-shaped object was seen in the         |
| northern sky from Batesburg, South Carolina at 7:00 p.m. The witness  |
| claimed to be very familiar with military aircraft and this was not   |
| that. At 7:30 p.m. a dark object flew over Hastings-on-Hudson, New    |
| York. It had flailing appendages, and moved slowly. It may have paced |
| the witness. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, |
