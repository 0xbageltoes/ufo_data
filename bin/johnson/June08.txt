| 1920 - At 6 p.m. a cylindrical object flying at only 75 feet          |
| altitude, passing over Rushville, Missouri, was seen by two           |
| hundred people. It made a 90-degree turn to the east, and disappeared |
| into a cloud. (Source: Skylook, October 1973, p. 16; Richard H. Hall, |

| 1954 - Sometime after one o'clock in the morning and before 2:30 a.m. |
| Mr. L. T. Prewitt, an employee of the Red River Arsenal, sighted a    |
| golden yellow light fly over his house in Texarkana, Texas for two    |

| 1964 - In 1964 Mrs. Helen Reed of Lawrenceville, Illinois observed a         |
| 15-foot-wide, domed, spinning object around 10:30 p.m. It was moving  |
| five meters above the ground and less than 20 meters away. It made    |
| sharp, 90 degree turns, and had colored lights emanating from the     |
| dome (blue turning to red), and bands of yellow light. The object     |
| went out of sight behind some trees to the north. (Sources: NICAP UFO |

| 1964 - Also on the same night five witnesses, including Sheriff L. C. |
| Brinkerhoff of the Big Horn County, Wyoming sheriff's department had  |
| a close encounter with a blue-green UFO that hovered over the         |
| badlands near Burlington, Wyoming. It reacted to the sheriff's        |
| spotlight by beaming a ray of light into the patrol car. (Sources:    |

| 1966 - Two ice cream truck drivers, Armstrong and Polomka, watched a  |
| domed craft maneuvering in the sky for 20 minutes between Kingston    |
| and Naracoorte, South Australia. A white light made up the body of    |
| the craft, while a red light looked like a dome on top; the white     |
| light was interlaced with smaller colored lights. It moved at         |
| fantastic speeds. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs Over the Southern    |

| 1966 - Max Baker, age 43, was driving west on Sandusky Road between   |
| Kansas, Ohio and Toledo at 6:45 a.m. when a bright silver, metallic   |
| cigar-shaped object appeared out of nowhere and buzzed his car. The   |
| UFO was completely silent, and passed within 30 meters of his car,    |
| flying low to the northeast. The close encounter lasted one minute.   |
| His report to the Air Force remains a Project Blue Book unexplained   |
| case. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official           |

| 1966 - Also on that same evening, three young Canadians were driving  |
| south of Castlegar Airport in British Columbia when they were chased  |
| by an oval shaped object, about six feet in diameter. It gave off a   |
| bluish glow and stayed parallel with the car as they drove along the  |
| highway at about 45 m.p.h. It had beams of light pointing upward and  |
| downward coming from it, as it flew about 10 feet above the power     |
| lines. It made no noise. (Source: Charles Bowen, World Round-up, FSR, |

| 1968 - Between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m. a university professor named        |
| Richalda and a woman accompanying him witnessed a 0.5 meter,          |
| hat-shaped UFO that flew to the southwest while driving near a        |
| hydro-electric dam in Capataneni, Bacau, Romania. The sighting lasted |
| two minutes. (Source: Ion Hobana & Julien Weverbergh, UFOs from       |

| 1974 - At Lake George near Goulbourne, New South Wales, Australia a   |
| Mr. L, an elderly farmer, noticed an elongated luminous object in the |
| sky at around 11 p.m. on the night of June 7-8, 1974. It ejected a    |
| "falling star" that approached to within two miles of him, hovering   |
| about a half a mile up in the sky. It appeared as a red luminous      |
| sphere. Later that night this sphere appeared to land behind some     |
| trees several miles away. At around three o'clock in the morning he   |
| went out with his dog to investigate, and walked toward the landing   |
| site. He heard a number of other dogs barking, and a voice that       |
| yelled, "shut up!", which caused him to stop. He sat down where he    |
| was and waited until around 6:00 a.m., and then went on to the site   |
| and found "an area of burnt vegetation for a distance of 200 yards."  |
| When the witness was subsequently hospitalized and diagnozed with     |
| paranoid schizophrenia, he was able to recall futher details. He      |
| remembered that he had approached to withing 300 yards of the landed  |
| object, and observed it through binoculars. Three or four men over    |
| eight feet tall came from behind the landed craft and "floated" to    |
| the ground. They were wearing glowing silver colored suits that       |
| covered their bodies up to their necks. He could discern no facial    |
| features on the beings. Later, a chute emerged from the object, and   |
| down it came a number of cylindrical metal "packing cases." After     |
| that, about 40 head of black cattle came down the chute, and were     |
| driven away by normal looking men, accompanied by dogs. (Source:      |

| 1986 - A 40-foot long, cigar-shaped UFO was seen in a red mist in     |
| Metcalf, Illinois at 8:30 p.m. It was seen for 30 seconds, less than  |
| half a mile away, and was completely silent. (Source: Bob Gribble,    |

| 1990 - In 1990, the Bridges family of Navarre Beach, Florida observed a      |
| cluster of 20-30 lights at 11:30 p.m. that appeared to be low over    |
| the Gulf of Mexico about ten miles away from their home. These lights |
| would join together in a circular orbit and then shoot out in many    |
| directions. Some of the paths were jagged with sharp turns and abrupt |
| stops, while others were smooth stops. The UFOs would then regroup    |
| and repeat the process randomly. Another group of about 20 people,    |
| who were visiting in rental units, also saw the display. The entire   |
| event lasted about 30 minutes. (Source: Rex Salisberry, Gulf Breeze   |

| 1991 - Civil radar tracked UFOs over Concepcion, Paraguay. Pilots     |
| encountered and radar tracked a reddish oval-shaped object that paced |
| a small aircraft and then hovered above the airport; electro-magnetic |
| effects were reported on the plane. At around 6:00 p.m. an intense    |
| bluish-white oval-shaped object buzzed a Japanese airliner, then      |
| paced a Cessna for 25 minutes. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO     |

| 1994 - In a farming area outside of Padova (Padua), Italy at around   |
| midnight a robot-like entity with lights approached the witness. It   |
| used telepathy to communicate with the witness, warning him that it   |
| meant no harm and there were 14 others just like him, hiding in the   |
| nearby woods. It then lifted off vertically, and flew away. (Source:  |

| 1998 - During the predawn hours of this morning in Puerto Rico the    |
| witness, Belen, found herself seated on a stainless steel table that  |
| floated in mid-air. To her left stood two short gray beings wearing   |
| white coveralls. They just stood there looking at her, seemingly      |
| waiting for something. At her feet stood a tall, human like figure,   |
| with black hair, large eyes, fine chiseled facial features and very   |
| thick eyebrows. She felt relaxed and unafraid. She asked the human    |
| figure what were they doing, and his answer was, "We are preparing    |
| you." She asked him not to leave any marks on her body this time, but |
| she was told that it was necessary, and that next time no scars or    |
| marks will be left behind. She then lay back on the table and saw two |
| "tubes" descend from the ceiling. The tubes were also metallic and    |
| emitted beams of light towards her stomach area. At this point she    |
| lost consciousness. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact      |

| 2002 - Dr. Joyce Pugh, a MUFON consultant, reported that on Saturday, |
| June 8, 2002 at about 10:30 p.m. she and her husband were driving on  |
| Highway 319 toward Ocilla, Georgia when they sighted unusual lights   |
| low in the overcast sky above the trees off to the left near Tifton,  |
| Georgia. They were shaped like an elongated triangle with a white     |
| light in each corner, and a red light in the bottom center. The       |
| lights appeared to be on one object, which slowly moved across the    |
| road. They turned off the highway to pursue it. They later sighted    |
| two more craft with indistinct lights. They could hear the sound of   |
| roaring jet engines apparently coming from the lights/craft, as they  |
| seemed to fly along slowly. They went back to the area where          |
| they observed the first object and once again observed hovering       |
| lights. The lights crossed the road again and then disappeared as Dr. |
| Pugh continued to negotiate traffic. (Source: George A. Filer & David |
