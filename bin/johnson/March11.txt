| 1950 - A car was buzzed by a brilliant blue disc at 9:00 p.m. as it   |
| was being driven from Chualar to Salinas, California. The UFO made a  |
| loop, then shot off to the south. There were many calls to the        |
| authorities reporting sightings of the object. (Source: Loren E.      |

| 1955 - At 1:15 a.m. in Bexley, London, England a glowing disc-shaped  |
| object flew toward the southwest, stopped, then turned back toward    |
| the Thames Rivers, then flew off quickly to the northeast. (Source:   |

| 1963 - At 8:00 p.m. two military witnesses in the Air National Guard, |
| Parish and Joy, were flying over the Pacific Ocean near Oahu Island,  |
| Hawaii when they spotted a very bright, crescent-shaped UFO flying at |
| high altitude. The object flew off to the west. (Sources: APRO        |
| Bulletin, January-February 1964, p. 5; Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft  |
| UFO Encounters, p. 33).                                               |

| 1969 - At 12:15 a.m. a man named Allot drove through a luminous dome  |
| in the road in the Loudeac Forest between La Croix-Jartel and St.     |
| Julien, France and was temporarily paralyzed. (Sources: Jacques       |

| 8782, citing Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue #102).                      |

| 1969 - On the same day a motorist in Campinas, Sao Paulo state,       |
| Brazil saw a light moving erratically in the sky, changing color from |
| yellow to green, then blue, then purple, then back to green. The      |
| color changing UFO came to a halt right in front of his car at 4:45   |
| p.m. The car's engine slowed down and the witness, a man named Randi, |
| temporarily felt paralyzed. After the light flew away, both the car   |
| and motorist were back to normal. (Sources: Walter Buhler, FSR Case   |
| Histories, August 1971, p. 11; Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving  |
| Vehicle Interference, p. 45 (case 267)).                              |

| 1978 - Sometime around 11 p.m. three people were camping on the site  |
| of a Maori burial ground in the Waimata Valley, New Zealand when one  |
| of them awoke suddenly and saw a being looking at them. Her memory    |
| went blank at this point, but she does recall that at 4:00 a.m. the   |
| next morning all three of them woke up and left the area. Under       |
| hypnosis, she recalled that she and one of her companions were drawn  |
| onboard a luminous domed disc-shaped craft by a beam of light. A      |
| humanoid being of medium built, who wore a pair of silvery            |
| calf-length boots, met them inside. He communicated with her by       |
| telepathy and warned them to keep silent about the experience.        |

| 1984 - A mother and daughter observed a large cylindrical-shaped UFO  |
| hovering outside their family room window in Wolcott, Connecticut.    |
| The object was just seven feet above the ground, and only four feet   |
| from the window. It made no sound, and stayed there for seven         |
| minutes. (Source: Robert Gribble, APRO Bulletin, June 1984, p. 5).    |

| 1992 - At 6:30 p.m. a woman in Bellomonte, Puerto Rico was sitting    |
| alone in her rocking chair on the rear patio of her home, when        |
| suddenly she felt a strong presence nearby. She saw two very tall,    |
| muscular men with light skin standing close beside her. They wore     |
| tight-fitting black uniforms that covered their entire bodies except  |
| for their faces. They were accompanied by two short humanoids with    |
| large egg-shaped heads and yellowish skin, wide lipless mouths, and   |
| large dark slit-shaped eyes. These creatures wore brown,              |
| loose-fitting outfits. The two short beings appeared to be in charge  |
| of the situation and were intent on inspecting the terrain and        |
| plants, constantly murmuring between themselves in a strange          |
| language. The tall beings communicated with her using telepathy,      |
| informing her that the short beings wanted her to plant certain       |
| different kinds of flowers and trees in her garden. She said that she |
| had felt more comfortable with the presence of the two beings who     |
| looked human than with the odd looking short creatures, but that      |
| there appeared to be a definite collaboration occurring between the   |
| two types of beings. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, case #434, citing    |
| Jorge Martin, Enigma, issues 53-53).                                  |

| 2000 - At 8:10 p.m. Shaun Boer of Traralgon, Victoria, Australia saw  |
| a bright star-like object that was moving through the sky very fast.  |
| It made a 45-degree turn and then faded out. Later he remembered      |
| being in a round room with a high ceiling. There were several pillars |
| coming down the sides of the walls. The "room" seemed to be dirty. In |
| the middle of the room there was a sort of table, resembling a half   |
| cylinder, made out of what appeared to be corrugate iron. He recalls  |
| that he encountered two types of creatures: some were short with      |
| bluish black skin, perfectly round eyes, and they wore coveralls with |
| hoods. The others were the classic Grey humanoids with large black    |
| almond-shaped eyes. He later found a triangle-shaped scar on his      |
| upper arm. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database      |
