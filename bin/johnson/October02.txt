| 1966 - Mrs. Everett Steward, a flight attendant, was talking on the   |
| telephone from her home in Cincinnati, Ohio at 10:20 p.m. when she    |
| smelled a foul odor in the room. She went to her bedroom, where she   |
| had a feeling of being watched. Looking out the window, she saw an    |
| oval-shaped object with portholes and red, green, and white lights    |
| revolving around it. It was 75 feet in diameter and 100 feet above    |
| the ground. She woke her husband, who also saw it, and called her     |
| married daughter, Mrs. Janet Emery, a mile away. The Emerys also saw  |
| it, and a neighbor with binoculars could see that it had illuminated  |
| yellow square windows. Next, her daughter Janet went outdoors and saw |
| the UFO eject a red ball, which maneuvered about while the first UFO  |
| took off southward. The red ball flew 100 feet over Jane's head. It   |
| too was oval shaped, and its underside was shiny like aluminum foil.  |
| It was "bigger than my cottage and yard combined." She also smelled   |
| the garbage like odor. Mrs. Steward went to bed, but the odor still   |
| persisted in the house. Sometime later that night the room was        |
| filled with a brilliant white light, which then vanished, and a globe |
| of light about 21 inches in diameter appeared at the foot of her bed. |
| Inside the globe were the images of five "non-human, hairless heads"  |
| with oval, sunken eyes. "Instead of noses, there were slits, and they |
| had no mouths." Telepathically, they repeated several times that "we  |
| have made contact." Mrs Steward screamed, and the globe disappeared.  |
| She was so upset by the experience that she began psychiatric         |
| counseling and continued it for the next two years. (Sources: Leonard |

| 1968 - In Lins, Sao Paolo State, Brazil at 6:20 a.m., while oiling    |
| his bulldozer’s engine, Sr. Doribio Pereira saw a golden colored      |
| cigar-shaped craft hovering a foot or so above the ground, only a few |
| feet away,  Next he saw a man standing on a platform that extended    |
| from the base of the object, who drew a weapon resembling an electric |
| drill from his sleeve. The being pointed it at the witness, and when  |
| it emitted a bright flash Pereira found himself paralyzed. He could   |
| see that inside the cigar, which had a “glass roof,” there was a man  |
| using some sort of keyboard with both hands, and outside the craft on |
| an extended platform stood three more men. One of them was taking     |
| soil samples with a “conch shaped object.” Then the craft flashed a   |
| very vivid light three times, the platform retracted, and underneath  |
| the craft appeared “something like an electric polisher, rotating at  |
| high speed.” After that it took off with a slight sound. The men were |
| described as thin, about 5’5” tall, and dressed in blue knee-length   |
| robes, hoods, and brown sandals with cross garters to the knees.      |
| Pereira, in a state of near shock, was given a lift to his home, and  |
| from there he reported to the Town Council. Because of his nervous    |
| state he was sent for a medical examination, during which Dr. Antonio |
| Geris found him entirely normal. Officials of the Brazilian Air Force |
| later subjected him to an intense interrogation. (Sources: Gordon     |

| 1978 - At 11:15 a.m. four young boys in the Groendal Nature Reserve,  |
| Uitenhage, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa had been out hiking in |
| an isolated area, and were now waiting to be picked up by their       |
| parents, when suddenly their attention was drawn to a glistening      |
| object in the distance. They next saw two men wearing shiny silvery   |
| outfits, standing just to the west of the object. The men were        |
| able to move across the difficult terrain in a gliding motion, and on |
| on top of the hill they were joined by a third man that appeared to   |
| be carrying a small suitcase. The three men then glided towards a     |
| dividing fence and flew over it, and one stopped to look at the boys. |
| The silver suit covered his forehead, so only his lower face was      |
| clear, but they could see he had gray skin. Finally, the men glided   |
| up a hill and seemed to disappear upon reaching the summit. During    |
| the incident the boys noticed a strange silence in the area and two   |
| of them felt disoriented. Possible ground traces were found on the    |
| site. (Sources: Cynthia Hind, MUFON UFO Journal, October 1978, p. 5;  |

| 1981 - Helmstedt, Germany - At around 2:10 a.m. the witness was       |
| riding a bus through East Germany to Mittaguzeit in the East Berlin   |
| sector when he noticed two tall figures walking on the side of the    |
| road. They were oddly dressed, wearing silvery coveralls. They were   |
| also walking in a peculiar fashion, and he had never seen similar     |
| people before in the area. The bus continued on and he lost sight of  |
| them. The next day there were reports of bright lights over the area. |

| 1982 - At 5:00 p.m. ten college women, members of a volleyball team,  |
| saw an arrowhead or pentagon-shaped object with many multicolored     |
| lights while riding in their van onHighway 13, 18 miles north of      |
| Springfield,  Missouri. The object glided over nearby trees, and then |
| hovered near their van. Its lights were white, yellow, and red, and   |
| it gave off white beams of light.  It finally moved away silently     |
| after 30 seconds. Three hours later ten people in a bus in Brighton,  |
| Missouri watched a silent manta ray-shaped object hovering nearby. It |
| too had many lights, and tilted at an angle. Their sighting lasted    |
| two minutes.  (Source: (1) Boone County (AR) Headlight, October 7,    |

| light with small black dotted things on it in Beluran, Sabah,         |

| five minutes until its lights turned off. The sky was dark with no    |
| moon. (Sources: George Filer, Filer's Files, 1998, issue 40; Joseph   |

| 2001 - At 6:55 a.m. several motorists in Sandyville, West Virginia    |
| spotted a blimp-like UFO with a smooth surface that was glowing       |
| bright red in the overcast daytime sky. A chevron-shaped object       |
| exited from a door in the bottom. There was no sound during the       |
| entire incident, which lasted five minutes. The two objects vanished  |
| at the same time. (Source: UFO Magazine (USA), February 2002, p. 21). |

| 2004 - A large triangular object, close to the ground, was seen in    |

| 2004 - A man was driving home at 5:30 a.m. in rural Tennessee when he |
| noticed what first appeared to be a fire on a nearby ridge. As he     |
| drove he got closer and realized that it was not a fire at all but a  |
| series of three reddish-orange lights affixed to the bottom of a huge |
| triangular craft. He neared an intersection and got out of his car to |
| watch this metallic craft as it approached from the north and moved   |
| directly towards him. He became fearful and started to run from his   |
| car, but realized that there was nowhere to run. As the giant object  |
| passed overhead, it blocked out all the stars and he estimated its    |
| size to be some 300 feet in length. The bottom of the craft           |
| was illuminated from three flame-like symmetrical appendages, and     |
| there was a ribbed structure running across the bottom of the object. |
| As it passed directly overhead he felt an energy that reverberated    |
| through his body. He stated that he felt many sensations all at once, |
| but could find no description for what he actually felt. The object   |
| also made a pulsating or drumming noise which also passed throughout  |
| his body. After the object passed him, it suddenly turned west and    |
| moved behind some nearby hills. The witness reported a metallic taste |
| in his mouth and a nose bleed. Later he found that his face and back  |
| were slightly sunburned and his hair was falling out, he also felt    |
| lethargic. He realized later that he had experienced 15 minutes of    |
| missing time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database   |
