| 1950 - At 10:30 a.m. six elliptical UFOs flew over Evansville,        |
| Wisconsin in a loose echelon formation at a speed of 500 mph and at   |
| an altitude of 10,000 feet, making a sound like helicopters. They     |
| were seen by Mr. B. Blair, a commercial airline pilot in flight at    |
| that time. At 9:08 p.m. a bright light made a sharp turn toward a     |
| DC-3 transport plane over Bakersfield, California at 9:08 p.m., flew  |
| parallel to it for a short while, then pulled ahead and to the left   |
| at a speed of over 200 mph. (Sources: (1) Edward Sullivan, letter     |

| 1954 - At 10:15 a.m. a green colored cylindrical object hovered over  |

| India saw the passage of a UFO described as “a flying boat” with a    |
| brilliant light on the back. The object then approached the ground    |
| and performed a vertical landing. Three people wearing “western”      |
| suits emerged and made hand gestures to the locals, who panicked and  |
| ran to their houses. The object remained on the ground for five       |
| minutes and took off in a vertical ascent, disappearing at high       |
| speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1954,    |

| Chula Vista, San Diego County, California at 7:30 p.m. for 20         |
| minutes. It looked like a ball with a long antenna rod attached, and  |
| a flashing white light ran back and forth along the rod. The UFO made |
| several dashes at terrific speeds, and was watched through binoculars |
| by seven witnesses. It made no sound. The sighting lasted between 20  |
| and 30 minutes. A Project Blue Book "unknown". (Sources: Project Blue |

| 1966 - At 10:30 a.m. Miss Connie Carpenter saw the "Mothman" in New   |
| Haven, West Virginia. Mothman, a tall winged figure in gray, was      |
| standing on the golf course on this morning. It unfolded its ten foot |
| wide wings and flew directly at her windshield. She saw its red eyes. |
| It then veered off and disappeared from sight. After the encounter    |
| her eyes were red, swollen, and itchy for two full weeks. (Sources:   |

| 13-year-old Sheila Cain and her sister were walking home when they    |
| saw the Mothman creature standing by the road. It was seven feet      |
| tall, and was gray and white in color with big red eyes. They         |
| screamed and ran home, and it flew low over their heads as they ran.  |

| 1968 -  A luminous round object with body lights hovered over         |
| Belcourt, North Dakota at 7:00 p.m. It shone a red light beam to the  |
| ground. When a police officer shined a spotlight at it, it            |
| immediately blinked out. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, January    |

| 1974 - Dora Ellen Afelbaum was driving home near Dallas, Texas in her |
| new car on Thanksgiving night when she saw a light following her. She |
| stopped the car and rolled down her window, thinking it may be a      |
| helicopter, but she heard no sound. The light then moved ahead of her |
| and she saw what appeared to be dogs, then a "human like form"        |
| running toward the light. Suddenly the light, the animals, and the    |
| figure vanished. There were others cars on the highway but none       |
| stopped, and no one else appeared to have witnessed the incident.     |

| 1975 -  Mr. And Mrs. Henry Vidal and their five-year-old son were en  |
| route to Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico at around 2:30 a.m. when     |
| they saw a bright object approach them at high speed. Glowing         |
| different colors, it hovered silently ahead of their car, which had   |
| slowed down to a crawl despite all attempts by Mr. Vidal to speed up. |
| The object was cone-shaped and the bottom appeared to rotate rapidly, |
| "like a drill." It was so large and so close that it filled most of   |
| their windshield, and remained in position near their slowly moving   |
| car for what they thought was 15 minutes, after which it rapidly      |
| climbed away and disappeared from view. They reached the town of      |
| Culiacan at 7:00 a.m., about two and a half hours late, and the       |
| missing time could not be accounted for.  After they returned to      |
| their home in Santa Ana, Mrs. Vidal began to have a series of         |
| nightmares in which she dreamed she had been abducted by a UFO. In    |
| another dream she was levitated from her bed by a group of shadowy,   |
| small entities using some bright fluorescent lights. Her husband,     |
| awakened by her cries, awakened his wife, and she had scratches on    |
| her arms and legs that she could not account for. (Source: David F.   |

| 1975 - A round or disc-shaped object, yellow in color, approached to  |
| within 100 feet of two hunters on Peters Mountain, West Virginia at   |
| around 6:00 p.m. It blinked on-and-off, then shot away as three U.S.  |
| Air Force jets entered the airspace, but reappeared after the jets    |
| had gone. (Source: Bob Teets, West Virginia UFOs: Close Encounters in |

| 1975 - Two men, Marquis and Rindahl, were driving on a road nine      |
| miles east of Goodridge, Minnesota when they were approached from     |
| ahead by a silent glowing red object at 7:15 p.m. It approached to    |
| within half a mile at 200 feet altitude, then landed.  The driver     |
| turned the car around but the engine began to stall, and the vehicle  |
| subsequently required an extensive tune up before it would run right. |
| A second driver reportedly also saw the UFO. (Source: Middle River    |

| over. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, July 1979).                     |

| 1979 - At 4:30 a.m. at least seven witnesses observed a 42-foot long  |
| ovoid UFO hovering right over the Sheraton Hotel in Norwich,          |
| Connecticut. It hovered tilted, and was completely silent. Finally,   |
| it shot off to the west. (Source: Lawrence Fawcett, International UFO |

| 1979 -  At 5:15 p.m. a 13-year-old girl saw a large cigar-shaped      |
| object with several white lights on it approach at an oblique angle   |
| and land in a field in Porcie-Amblagnieu, Isere department, France.   |
| It made a whistling sound. A very tall man like figure wearing a      |
| shiny silvery outfit got out and stood next to the object. The        |
| witness became frightened and ran home. The grass had been flattened  |
| at the landing site, swirled in a spiral pattern bending toward the   |
| top of a slope. (Sources: UNICAT database, case # 405, citing GEPAN   |

| 1979 - At 10:30 p.m. a circular object gave off intense blue flashes  |
| of light while it hovered over a busy traffic intersection in Madrid, |
| Spain. Two police cars were sent to the intersection, and experienced |
| radio interference while the UFO hovered above them for the next      |
| three hours. (Sources: UFO Newspaper Clipping Service, February 1980, |

| 1980 -  A group of four driving to a hospital in central Kansas       |
| arrived at the hospital much sooner than they had planned. They       |
| encountered a green beam of light off to the side of highway and      |
| ahead of them at two o'clock in the morning. It was coming from a     |
| huge flying object, "as big as a city block," that was cone-shaped    |
| with peach, green, and white colored lights. Somehow it had caused    |
| them to be transported closer to their destination, according to the  |
| witnesses. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, International UFO Reporter,       |

| 1982 - At 5:00 o'clock in the morning in Palatine, Illinois in the    |
| suburbs of Cook County, there was a vehicle encounter between three   |
| police officers and a domed disc-shaped object 30 feet in diameter,   |
| which emitted a light beam toward the ground. It began when a         |
| luminous object with brilliant illumination brightly illuminated a    |
| police patrol car, then changed direction when pursued. The white     |
| domed disc was later seen to the east, with a light beam extended     |
| toward the ground, as it descended behind the tree line.  The entire  |
| episode lasted about three minutes. (Sources: Mark Rodeghier,         |

| 1982 - At 6:00 a.m. two hunters in a deer blind in Castroville, Texas |
| saw a multi-colored V-shaped object nearly over their heads, moving   |

| 1983 - A bedroom visitation with paralysis occurred on this night to  |

| 2004 -  A huge disc-shaped object accompanied by other smaller craft  |
| came over the witness's apartment building in Gardena, California at  |
| around one o'clock in the morning. It seemed to be close, and could   |
| change direction and speed in the blink of an eye.  It had lights and |
| was very quiet, making no noise at all. The sighting lasted 30        |
| minutes. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,     |
