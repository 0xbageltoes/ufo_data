| 1952 - Five military witnesses at Woomera Open Air Theatre saw a      |
| cigar-shaped object fly on a straight, horizontal course at 8:00 p.m. |
| in Woomera, South Australia. It flew from right to left, had to       |
| porthols and interior lighting, and was faster than a jet. (Source:   |

| 1952 - Several sighting reports came from France on this day. The     |
| earliest was at 2:03 a.m. at Marignane Airport, where customs         |
| official Gabriel Gachignard saw a 15-foot long football or            |
| cigar-shaped object, throbbing with soft changing tints. It had a     |
| metallic grillwork and four rectangular windows, 8 to 12 inches wide. |
| It made a dull sound when it touched the ground, and a soft swishing  |
| sound on its quick departure when the witness ran towards it. The     |
| acceleration was instantaneous, and the UFO was gone from view in     |
| three seconds. (Sources: Aime Michel, The Truth About Flying Saucers, |

| 1952 - At five o'clock a white cylinder surrounded by eight pairs of  |
| Saturn-like red balls were seen at 300 to 400 meters altitude over    |
| the town of Gaillac, France. Angel hair filaments fell on the roofs   |
| of houses in the area. Thirty minutes later a UFO was seen hovering   |
| over Brives-Charensac, France. (Sources: Aime Michel, The Truth About |

| 1952 - At 10:30 p.m. a large round white object flew from east to     |
| west over Eyrans, France. It had a pointed end and threw off sparks.  |
| Angel hair residue also fell to gound here as well. (Source: Lumieres |

| 1954 - Several sightings and close encounters occurred this day in    |
| France and Italy, and a photograph was taken of a UFO in Und,         |
| Hungary. On this night in the Chicama Valley of Peru a brilliant disc |
| flashed in the sky, moved slowly at first, then sped up, dropped      |
| diagonally, then hovered in the sky. (Source: Coral E. Lorenzen,      |

| 1954 - A shop owner and his employee felt an electric shock as a very |
| bright object flying very low stopped the engine and turned off the   |
| lights on their car in Linzeux, France. In Mezieres, France two       |
| policemen on bicycles saw a craft which took off from a field. They   |
| noted that the cows in the field appeared to be afraid, bellowing and |
| grouping in the pasture. They saw a trail of sparks trailing from the |
| object about 5 meters in length, heard a whistling, purring noise as  |
| it moved away. The minimum distance to the object was 150 m. They     |
| found that a fence had been damaged. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,        |

| 1954 - At two o'clock in the afternoon in Ciolica Alta, Italy a young |
| man named Fabrizio Bruni heard a strange hissing sound and saw an     |
| object in a field  that was emitting a blinding glare. It was         |
| stationary, hovering one meter above the ground, and seemed           |
| transparent. The witness fell to the ground "because of his strong    |
| emotions" experiencing thae sight of sruch a ts. The object took off  |
| vertically and suddenly, leaving a trail. Very white, glistening      |
| threads were found on the ground. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport   |

| 1954 - The close encounter experiences continued unabated during that |
| evening. At 7:30 p.m. farmer Gilbert Hee, in Les-Jonquerets-de-Livet, |
| France was gathering pears when he suddenly saw an elongated object   |
| with a light at both ends resting in the pasture. He didn't dare get  |
| closer to investigate, but he did see cows gathering around the       |
| object. A minute later, the lights on the object went out, and the    |
| witness lost interest and went home. Two hours later, an 18-year-old  |
| man named Cheradame fell from his motorcycle when it suddenly failed  |
| at the same spot, and alerted neighbors saw the object again. It had  |
| moved only slightly and two occupants were seen. They were short,     |
| about one meter tall, and walked in a stiff fashion. They had on      |
| clothes resembling bright armor. They vanished suddenly, and the      |
| craft took off without making a sound. At 8:30 p.m. a schoolboy and   |
| his school director saw a UFO on the ground in Moussey, France.       |
| Triangular ground traces were reported. At 11:15 p.m.                 |
| in Oye-Plage, France on Route N40, the Mayor's secretary saw a        |
| bright, cigar-shaped object for 15 minutes. It was flying very low    |
| and following the turns of the road at 20 meters altitude. It         |
| suddenly tumed at a right angle from the road and flew away. (Source: |

| 1954 - A 12-year-old girl approached a one-meter long ovoid object on |
| the road northeast of Plouezoch, Finistere, France. She received      |
| electric shocks and was temporarily paralyzed. (Source: Larry Hatch,  |

| 1954 - Finally, at 11:30 p.m. Ms. Ermellina Lanzillo was in her house |
| near Grosseto, Italy looking for her cat, when she saw from her       |
| window a strange entity standing in her garden. The being appeared    |
| fat but had narrow shoulders, ape-like eyes, and a head like a diving |
| helmet. At first she was paralyzed with terror, but she was able to   |
| regain self-control when called by her niece and withdrew from the    |
| window. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of    |

| 1958 - An object resembling a large gray cigar with an assembly tail  |
| flew at treetop level over Union Dale, Pennsylvania making a strong   |
| "swishing" sound. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A     |

| 1967 - In Dympep, India a spinning multicolored object emitting red   |
| and green lights, 7.5 meters in diameter, came down to the surface of |
| a river, causing thunderous agitation of the water, and then took off |
| over a forest with a wave of heat. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport  |

| 1967 - At four a.m. a crackling sound was heard over the Bacup,       |
| Lancashire, England police station's short wave radio, so police      |
| officer B. Earnshaw went outside to investigate. He saw a 50 foot     |
| long cigar-shaped object flying at a low altitude, estimated to be    |
| only 250 feet. It had portholes on the side and no visible means of   |
| propulsion. It was metallic looking yet glowed, and made a whirring   |
| noise. At 4:15 a.m. six on-duty police officers in Glossop,           |
| Derbyshire, England saw the same UFO from different locations. The    |
| object was "swinging from side to side" in a pendulum motion.         |

| 1967 - A brightly luminous object bobbed up-and-down, and then        |
| hovered near a nuclear missile base in Parshall, North Dakota at 3:00 |
| a.m. It was witnessed by a police lieutenant and a civilian. It shot  |
| straight up and out of sight in seconds. (Sources: NICAP UFO          |

| 1967 - A near head-on collision between an airliner and a grayish,    |
| open triangle or V-shaped craft with six very bright white lights     |
| along one side occurred at three o'clock in the morning north of      |
| Jacksonville, Florida. The object was so close it caused a green glow |
| to illuminate the cockpit. The UFO made an unbanked, 180 degree turn. |
| It did not appear on radar. There were four witnesses on board the    |
| aircraft. (Sources: Willy Smith, International UFO Reporter,          |

| 1968 - At 10:30 p.m. three men in their twenties sighted a            |
| semi-circular or crescent-shaped object with red and green flashing   |
| lights and a white light hovering for 30 minutes over Wallingford,    |
| Connecticut. At one point it was joined by two more similar objects   |
| that remained for a few minutes, then shot off in opposite            |
| directions. They were gone in less than 15 seconds. (Source: Meriden  |

| 1973 - At 6 p.m. fifteen witnesses reported that a lenticular         |
| disc-shaped object hovered over a lake, Lago Ramos Mejia in Nequen    |
| Province, Argentina at 2000 m altitude or less. There were four UFOs  |
| in total, and one approached to within 400-500 meters. It was         |
| pulsating with a weak luminosity. It finally moved out of sight in 45 |
| seconds. (Sources: Richard F. Haines, Project Delta, p. 189; UNICAT,  |

| 1974 - A blue, oval-shaped object paced a car in Aveley, Essex,       |
| England at 9:50 p.m. John and Elaine Avis and their three children    |
| were on their way home from a visit to Harold Hill, some 20 minutes   |
| away. A bright light from the sky swooped across the road in front of |
| them, and the radio sparked, the car lights went out, and the engine  |
| stalled. It was surrounded by a green mist, which the car rolled      |
| into, and they felt a sensation of cold and there was abnormal        |
| silence. They were then abducted and they had three hours of missing  |
| time. Onboard the craft there were four foot tall creatures with      |
| pointed ears and 6 ft. 6 in. tall hooded human-looking albinos.       |
| Following the incident John had a nervous breakdown, while Elaine and |
| the children had personality and lifestyle changes. For instance,     |
| they became ill if they ate meat. Both John and Elaine gave up        |
| alcohol and John stopped smoking. (Source: FSR, April 1978, p. 13;    |

| 1974 - At seven p.m. there were three reports of a close encounter on |
| Highway 42 in New California, Ohio. At 7:04 p.m. two women driving    |
| near Liberty Lake Bridge in Carroll County, Maryland suffered         |
| physiological effects during a close encounter with a UFO. At 7:30    |
| p.m. five men in a boat in Cincinnati, Ohio had a close encounter     |
| with a huge UFO for ten minutes. (Source: CUFOS files, reports dated  |

| 1975 - David Stephens and Glen Gray were driving at around 2:30 a.m.  |
| on a rural highway between Norway and West Poland, Maine when David   |
| discovered that the car was no longer responding to the steering      |
| wheel. It turned of its own accord onto a back road full of potholes, |
| but they felt no bumps, which suggested the car was being levitated.  |
| They came to a cornfield where two lights were visible four feet from |
| the ground. As these lights rose silently to treetop level, they      |
| realized that they were coming from a very large, gray cylindrical    |
| object, "as big as a football field." They were then enveloped in a   |
| blinding light, leaving them both unconscious. They regained          |
| consciousness only when the car had reached West Poland. They turned  |
| back, and the car automatically turned onto a road leading to Tripp   |
| Pond (also called Thompson Lake). The UFO was there, waiting for      |
| them, about 150 feet up. Another UFO only one-quarter as big, soon    |
| joined by a second, maneuvered over the pond, showing red, green, and |
| blue lights. A smoke or fog then rose from the pond and concealed     |
| these two objects, so they could then see only the larger object,     |
| which showed a long window and three bright lights. Finally it rose   |
| vertically, together with the smoke. They drove to David's parents    |
| trailer, by which time both were feeling sick, with chills, swollen   |
| hands and feet, and orange whites of the eyes. They lacked balance    |
| and coordination, and felt lightheaded. Stephens experienced intense  |
| thirst, and both men slept very deeply. Hallucinations and            |
| poltergeist-like activity troubled them for the next few days.        |
|                                                                       |
| Later under hypnosis, Stephens recalled that when they had            |
| encountered the bright light he had somehow been taken from the car   |
| into a round, metallic looking room with a small round window, from   |
| which he could see the car below. A Grey being 4.5 feet tall, wearing |
| a long black robe that seemed to be made of paper, entered the room.  |
| It had a bald, mushroom-shaped white head and slanting "white" eyes,  |
| a small flat nose, and no mouth. The hands had a thumb and only three |
| long fingers. By telepathy, this entity told Stephens not to be       |
| afraid. He was taken into a brightly lit adjoining room where there   |
| were four other beings. Here he was told to undress and lie on a      |
| table. Blood samples were taken, and a square machine with            |
| dials scanned his body. The Grey humanoids also took a button from    |
| his clothes. Finally, he put on his clothes, and was somehow          |
| transported back to his car. The beings told him they would see him   |
| again. The two men had experienced three hours of missing time. Both  |
| were ill for three days, and had a number of paranomal experiences,   |
| including a stocky Man in Black (MIB) who visited Stephens and told   |
| him not to talk about what had happened to them. Even when hypnotized |
| he resisted revealing when the beings told him they would return.     |
| Their physiological effects included chills, swollen feet and ankles, |

| 1975 - A helicopter like object, but not a normal helicopter, hovered |
| over the Brunswick Naval Air Station in in Maine in the early morning |
| hours, at the same time as a Loring AFB UFO incident. It stayed for   |
| 5-10 minutes, then flew off over Atlantic Ocean. (Source: Bangor      |

| 1975 - At around 8 p.m. Steve Harris, San Gayer, and Carl Jackson     |
| returned to the spot of their creature sighting in Happy Camp,        |
| California about an hour earlier, accompanied by Helen White and Rick |
| Pool. They shone spotlights around, but saw nothing. Then Steve fired |
| his rifle several times. Immediately they heard a loud "wow-wow-wow"  |
| sound, and turned around to see in the spotlights three dark,         |
| non-reflecting forms about five feet high, vaguely human in shape,    |
| with a glow around the edges, 30-35 feet away. These forms were       |
| moving about slowly, but staying at the same distance. They seemed to |
| absorb the light without reflecting it, but occasionally the whole    |
| shape would glow slightly. No further details could be made out.      |
| After some seconds, during which Helen failed to use her Polaroid     |
| camera, Helen and then the others began to feel a choking sensation,  |
| "as if the oxygen was being depleted from the air." After 3 or 4      |
| minutes of this, all five of them piled into their Ford Bronco and    |
| drove off. Looking back, they saw a glowing orange, disc-shaped       |
| object rise up from close to where they had been. It looked to be     |
| about 40 feet in diameter, and it followed them at a distance of 150  |
| feet just above the trees until they reached the highway. (Sources:   |

| 1982 - On this evening a father and daughter witnessed a large        |
| silvery sphere, 100 feet in diameter, with pocks like a golf ball,    |
| near Summit Lake, Alaska. It changed color to orange, and then to     |
| red, only 100 yards away from them. It made no sound. The close       |
| encounter lasted about an hour. (Source: Richard Sigismonde,          |

| 1989 - A family of four in Brewster, New York found themselves awake, |
| late at night, walking around their house for no apparent reason, and |
| having no recollection of how they got there. The father was standing |
| in the living room with all the lights on, when one of his sons came  |
| running downstairs, yelling that there was a UFO hovering outside.    |
| They all ran to the basement and looked out a window to see. Next, a  |
| red beam of light came down from the sky and covered the entire       |
| house. The light stayed on the house for about a minute, and then     |
| went out. The father then walked outside to see what was going        |
| on, and saw a large black, triangle-shaped craft with a large red     |
| light in the center and several white lights on the front. It was     |
| slowly moving away from the area. The youngest son later informed his |
| parents that that same night he had awoke and seen two “little men”   |
| standing in his bedroom, a third being then walked in, passing right  |
| through the bedroom wall. In addition, the man and his wife           |
| remembered having had a “dream” of little bald men with big round     |
| eyes leading them down a dark corridor. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,   |

| 1989 - At 5:10 a.m. two women, Wilson and Underwood, took photographs |
| of a reddish-orange object with columns of light, which then paced    |
| their vehicle at close range in Huntsville, Alabama. They experienced |
| at least 25 minutes of missing time, and the clock in their pick-up   |
| truck was off by six hours. They also experienced nightmares over the |
| next several nights. (Source: UFO Newsclipping Service, December      |

| 1995 - Residents of the Las Margaritas and Santa Rosa development,    |
| Jalapa, Veracruz, Mexico witnessed a collision between two UFO's in   |
| mid-flight at around 4 a.m., directly above the Bosques del Recuerdo  |
| cemetery. Both objects had been flying at high speed low above the    |
| ground. It was reported to resemble an enormous light that divided    |
| into three smaller lights, two of which had collided in mid-air. One  |
| witness reported being awakened by a loud noise, and saw his bedroom  |
| fill with light. After the objects had disappeared, three figures     |
| looking like women were seen standing in the middle of the cemetery;  |
| cab drivers rushed to the scene but could find nothing. (Source:      |

| 2004 - On this evening in Orizaba, Mexico Mrs. M., who runs a small   |
| food retail establishment from her home, was watching television      |
| facing towards the street, and hoping for a client to stop by, when   |
| suddenly the television reception began to fail and there was sudden  |
| heavy RF interference. This was remarkable since the street was empty |
| and there weren't any vehicles around that could cause the problem.   |
| Suddenly, a very tall figure walked by the front door of her house.   |
| The strange figure had a very pale white complexion, extremely white  |
| according to the witness. The figure then turned to look at her, and  |
| the stranger's stare was so intense and penetrating that she could    |
| not move; she wanted to yell out to her sister who lived next door,   |
| but was unable to utter a sound. The stranger abruptly disappeared,   |
| and at the same time the television returned to normal, but she was   |
| not able to move for at least five minutes. (Source: Albert S.        |

| 2004 - At 10:00 p.m. a dark triangular object was sighted in          |
| Brooklyn, New York. It had no lights, made no sound, and was huge.    |
| Also at 10:00 p.m. a boomerang-shaped object was seen in Miami        |
| Gardens, Dade County, Florida. It was a gray, metallic looking object |
| that glided smoothly, moving as fast as a small jet, with no lights   |
| or sound. At 10:15 two V-shaped UFOs were reported over New York      |
| City. They were gray V-shaped objects flying side-by-side, with no    |
| lights and no sound. Two more reports were received from Ithaca, New  |
| York at the UFO Reporting Center of a very large, white, V-shaped     |
| object that moved quickly across the sky between 10:20 and 10:30      |
| p.m. on the night of a lunar eclipse. The sightings lasted several    |
| seconds. At 10:18 p.m. 1 V-shaped light formation traveling in a      |
| southwest direction was sighted over Largo, Pinellas County, Florida. |

| 2007 - At around 1:00 a.m. the main witness and his friend were       |
| riding around League City, Harris and Galveston Counties, Texas       |
| looking for something to do. As they drove about they came upon a     |
| newly finished building on a new road, so they decided to check it    |
| out. No street lights had been erected yet, and it went through a     |
| large field. They were in the middle of the road when a huge, brown   |
| and tan object, somewhat oval shaped, came flying through the air     |
| straight at them. The driver slammed on the brakes because it didn’t  |
| look like the craft was going to stop, but as soon as he did that the |
| object stopped. It just sat there hovering, about 10-15 feet from     |
| their car. For a short while both witnesses just sat in the car       |
| staring at the object, which took off straight up at an incredible    |
| speed. They then drove away, not knowing what to do. A few yards down |
| the road they stopped and turned around--scared but still curious.    |
| They then saw the object again, floating just above the road, and     |
| it flew straight towards them again and hovered right over them; it   |
| stayed there for about 10 seconds and then it flew away. As they      |
| watched the object speeding away a weird-looking creature about 5     |
| feet tall, with a round shape to it, jumped out of the bushes and ran |
| onto the road. They had to swerve to avoid hitting it. They don’t     |
| know where the creature went, but it walked on two legs. It seemed to |
| have been naked, and was an odd looking brown color. Afterwards, they |
| drove home. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2007 Humanoid Sighting        |

| 2007 - At 1:00 p.m. a high altitude, disc-shaped craft moved from     |
| North to South over Keller, Tarrant County, Texas and hovered a few   |
| times for several seconds. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO     |
