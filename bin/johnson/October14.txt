| found in front of him on the road an oval-shaped aluminum object      |
| about 5.5 m in diameter, 1 m high. As he applied the brakes, the      |
| object took off at very high speed. Sev- eral persons confirmed the   |
| sighting. The disk was gray, supported a dome, and emitted a soft     |
| whistle. It took off when Casella was only six meters away. (Sources: |

| Mayenne department, France observed an orange sphere land and he      |
| walked out to approach it. When he got close he found it was shaped   |
| like a flattened dome, 5.5 meters in diameter, and it gave off a      |
| blinding light, which illuminated the countryside for about 200       |
| meters. It was also transparent, and a dark figure could be seen      |
| inside. After remaining at ground level for 10 minutes it left by     |
| flying to the north, while a bright cloudy misty material fell slowly |
| to the ground at the site. When the witness arrived home he found his |
| clothes were covered with a white film of adhesive substance, not     |
| unlike paraffin wax. (Sources: La Croix, October 16, 1954; Aime       |

| 1957 - Antonio Villas Boas, age 23, had his second UFO sighting prior |
| to his famous UFO abduction, when at 9:45 p.m. he watched a blazing   |
| object, possibly disc shaped, play tag with him over a field on his   |
| family farm in Sao Francisco de Sales, Minas Gerais, Brazil. He was   |
| plowing the field with his brother on a tractor when they saw a red   |
| light at the edge of the field. He went toward it, but it shifted its |
| position every time he got close. The object nearly touched down,     |
| and came down to a height of 100 meters. It vanished on the spot. The |
| sighting lasted from ten to twenty minutes. (Sources: Olavo T.        |

| 1971 - At 9 p.m. three men camping on the banks of the Trinity River  |
| near Hawkins Bar, California heard a deafening roar come from the     |
| opposite side of the river. They then saw several large, dark         |
| humanoid figures moving about. The campers stayed up the remainder of |
| the night watching the black shapes moving around a campfire, making  |
| high-pitched whining noises and sounds of rapid-fire chatter. There   |
| had been numerous reports of UFOs and strange lights in the area.     |

| 1972 - In Rexville, Puerto Rico at 4:00 a.m. a witness named Martinez |
| saw an ovoid object land. Some beings exited from the craft and took  |
| concrete blocks from the landing site. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U       |

| 1972 - Airman First Class Steven Briggs and Airman Dennis Hillsgeck,  |
| stationed at McChord Air Force Base in Pierce County,                 |
| Washington, were instructed to check the tactical air navigational    |
| (TACAN) facility located eight miles east of air base. Upon their     |
| arrival at the site they opened the locked security fence surrounding |
| it and entered the compound. Once inside, they began their systems    |
| check of the equipment. At around 2:00 p.m. Briggs heard a            |
| high-pitched engine sound coming from outside the building, so he     |
| went out to investigate. Once outside he observed a saucer-shaped     |
| object directly over the building. He then watched the object land    |
| just south of the compound. Startled, Briggs entered the building and |
| summoned Hillsgeck. Back outside both men observed two "creatures"    |
| walking towards the fence. Briggs went back into the building and     |
| telephoned the base security police. He yelled that they needed       |
| help because "intruders" were attempting to enter the facility. Sgt.  |
| Holmes at the security desk dispatched Sgt. Dwight Reid and AIC       |
| Michael Tash to the scene. After 17 minutes they arrived and observed |
| Briggs and Hillsgeck standing near their government vehicle; both     |
| appeared to be in a daze and neither could speak. An ambulance was    |
| summoned. Hillsgeck appeared to have burns around the face. Tash      |
| walked around the area and found ground marks in the soft dirt.       |
| Suddenly Reid yelled to Tash that an object was directly overhead,    |
| and indeed the saucer-shaped object was hovering just above the       |
| facility. Sgt. Reid attempted to communicate with the security police |
| desk, but the radio would not work. Reid and Tash then got Briggs and |
| Hillsgeck and drove them from the scene. One mile from the site Reid  |
| was able to communicate with security, and he requested assistance,   |
| declaring a "Covered Wagon" (a high security violation alert). Four   |
| additional security officers arrived, including Sgt. Darren Alexander |
| and his dog "Champ." Approximately 400 yards south of the site, Sgt.  |
| Alexander was alerted by his dog to two creatures standing near a     |
| remote power station. Sgt. Alexander yelled for the creatures to      |
| stand and raise their hands, but instead both creatures moved towards |
| Alexander, who noticed that one of them was holding somekind of an    |
| object he thought was a weapon. Sgt. Alexander then fired six rounds  |
| form his revolver. After firing the shots, Alexander returned to his  |
| vehicle and radioed that he had fired at the creatures. Soon another  |
| security alert team arrived. They conducted a search of the area and  |
| also observed the saucer sitting on the ground, directly east of the  |
| power station. They circled the craft and called for a supervisor, a  |
| Captain Henry Stone. When Stone arrived and walked toward the object  |
| it flew off in an easterly direction and was out of sight in a few    |
| seconds. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1972,  |

| 1973 - In Dover, Delaware at 12:20 a.m. a brilliant yellow-orange UFO |

| 1973 - Nancy, age 22, and her boyfriend Jim were camping at Phantom   |
| Lake, Wisconsin with another couple and the couple's baby. Nancy and  |
| Jim had just settled down in the camper for the night when they were  |
| awakened by a bright light shining in through the back window. Then   |
| the camper door suddenly burst open. They saw a bright saucer-shaped  |
| object about to land, descending in a zigzag motion. Once on the      |
| ground the glowing object disgorged a variety of figures, perhaps     |
| twenty. They could see a couple of male figures approaching their     |
| camper slowly. One appeared to be a black man. A second was similar   |
| to a swami, standing on one leg with his other leg wrapped around his |
| head. A disembodied face appeared in the camper telling them not to   |
| be afraid. About seven of the men stood in a semi-circle, ten feet    |
| away form the van door. One of the seven had dark curly hair and was  |
| dressed in blue jeans and a red plaid shirt, and he held a German     |
| shepherd in each hand by a leash. The group stood there for about ten |
| minutes, staring silently at the witnesses, who cowered inside the    |
| van in great fear. A man appeared carrying what looked like a scroll. |
| Three more beings, different from the others and only four feet tall, |
| came out of the "space ship" and moved about the area very quickly,   |
| "just sort of running around." They seemed to glow a whitish green    |
| color. One of these perched in a tree.                                |
|                                                                       |
| While this strange assemblage was still present, Jim jumped out of    |
| the camper and warned their friends who were asleep in a nearby tent. |
| They were unable to understand what all the excitement was about      |
| because they were unable to see either the "spaceship" or any of the  |
| beings. Jim hustled them into the camper, collected all their         |
| belongings, found his dog and, with the other couple driving, they    |
| took off. En route back to Milwaukee Nancy and Jim, riding in the     |
| rear of the camper, experienced a variety of strange phenomena,       |
| including a gloved hand apparition and a presence. Both Nancy and Jim |
| became hysterical. The other couple perceived nothing unusual and     |
| believed their friends had gone crazy. They took them directly to a   |
| hospital emergency entrance upon returnning to Milwaukee. (Sources:   |

| 1973 - On this evening there were at least 80 reports of discs with   |
| red and green lights in central and western Ohio. These included      |
| reports made by both citizens and police from Union and Dayton in     |
| Montgomery County, Ohio. In Dayton, Ohio at 7:30 p.m. four "flattened |
| footballs" were chased through the skies by military jets. There were |
| over 50 witnesses. In Boston, Ohio a cow was missing from a pasture   |
| after a UFO landed there. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO          |
