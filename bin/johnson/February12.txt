| Bremen, Germany with both of the top Nazi leaders Goebbels and        |
| Himmler present, occurred at 1:00 p.m. on this day. The tracking film |
| showed an unidentified sphere that circled and followed the rocket.   |

| 1952 - The pilot and co-pilot of a MATS C-47 transport plane flying   |
| between Friendship Airfield and Baltimore, Maryland sighted a bright  |
| white UFO at 10:30 p.m. The object moved slowly at first, then        |
| accelerated away. The sighting lasted two minutes. (Sources: Project  |

| 1959 - At 6:10 p.m. a white cylindrical object, shaped like a         |
| cigarette in appearance, jerked back and forth over a cloud in Miami, |
| Florida. It then vanished suddenly. (Source: Loren E. Gross, The      |

| 1965 -  A strange looking plane was seen to dive into the sea near    |
| Minehead on the North Devon, England coast. Four witnesses saw it     |
| from two different points along the coast. A lifeboat, two RAF        |
| helicopters, and a Shackleton failed to find anything after a 90      |
| minute search, and no planes were reported missing. The "ghost plane" |
| may have been seen inland before it reached the sea, for a strange    |
| low-flying plane was reportedly seen over Swainswick, near Bath in    |
| Somerset, England. The ash-grey "plane" was flying about 100 feet     |
| above the road in a west-southwestly direction. It had a misty        |
| appearance, despite the fact that there was no fog or mist at the     |
| time. It came from behind some trees, and then literally just         |
| disappeared. "The strange part was that it made no sound and did not  |
| appear to have an engine, but it was certainly not a glider."         |

| 1967 - The witness, a civilian named Atkinson, first heard a          |
| "chirping"noise at between 3:30-3:40 a.m., then saw four glowing      |
| oval-shaped objects in the sky over Grand Rapids, Michigan. Three     |
| were in a line formation while the fourth was off to one side. The    |
| UFOs went behind some buildings. The case is listed as a Project Blue |
| "unknown." (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official      |

| 1967 - At 9:45 p.m. a domed disc with rotating colored lights was     |
| sighted from an apartment building in Wharton, Texas. The disc        |
| skimmed over the treetops and performed other maneuvers. The sighting |
| lasted 10 minutes. (Sources: NICAP case files; Condon Colorado UFO    |

| 1968 - On this night a large round object was seen close to the       |
| ground in Farm Creek, Utah in Uintah County by a woman named          |
| Christiansen. It changed color from green to red, performed a number  |
| of maneuvers, and left rapidly. (Source: Frank B. Salisbury, The Utah |

| 1969 - At 5:40 a.m. in Pirassununga, Sao Paolo state, Brazil Luis     |
| Flozinho De Oliveira, a farm worker, was on his way to work when he   |
| was approached and attacked by two strange looking aggressive tan     |
| skinned beings. The men were 1.5 meters (4.95 feet) tall and had      |
| beards, long hair, and asymmetrical eyes. Both humanoids wore white   |
| unbuttoned shirts and long beige colored pants with what appeared to  |
| be colorful inscriptions and drawings on them. They also wore dark    |
| shiny medallions around their necks. At first stunned, Luis fought    |
| back effectively, knocking them both to the ground, one on top of the |
| other. The two humanoids got up and exchanged some words between      |
| themselves in a strange language. They then told Luis in perfect      |
| Portuguese that they were leaving since he was much stronger than     |
| they, and they both fled into the thick underbrush. Luis's dog        |
| “rolled up into a ball on the ground for protection” during the       |
| attack upon its master. The dog refused to eat anything after the     |
| encounter, and died a month later, its body found bloated up. The dog |
| had never been willing to return to the place of the encounter.       |

| 1969 - The crew of a fishing boat off the coast of Quinteros, Chile   |
