| 1953 - A kite-shaped or diamond-shaped object turned towards a T-6    |
| aircraft flying over Grid Area CS in Korea at 4:25 p.m. It was orange |
| in color and seemed translucent, with what appeared to be sparks      |
| extending a short distance behind it The object was estimated to be   |
| six feet long and a foot and a half in thickness. The military pilot  |
| got to within 600 and 800 feet distance from it. The duration of the  |
| sighting was five minutes. (Source: Richard F. Haines, Advanced       |

| Canada. The UFOs would dart back-and-forth in the sky. The river used |
| his dome light and siren to signal them. The UFOs flashed light back  |
| at them for a few seconds, then skipped off over the trees. (Source:  |

| 1991 - The 21-year-old witness in Bekes, Hungary had heard a very     |
| loud voice in his room on the night of December 4, 2001, telling him  |
| "you will meet us soon." This was repeated for 11 nights in a row. He |
| could not locate the source of the voice. On this night he was        |
| returning home from the movies when he caught sight of a hovering     |
| shiny gray disc-shaped object over the courtyard. He was suddenly     |
| compelled to walk under the object and a beam of light descended on   |
| him from the bottom of the craft, and he was apparently brought up    |
| inside the beam. He found himself inside the object looking out a     |
| window at his courtyard. Two four-and-a-half-foot tall beings stood   |
| in the room with him. The beings were human-like except they had      |
| large heads and eyes. They had long arms ending in hands with three   |
| digits. One of the beings communicated with the witness telling him   |
| that they had been watching him for three years and that they travel  |
| via inter-dimensional portals. A beam of green light hit the witness  |
| on his forehead and after that he only had vague memories of          |
| traveling to a moon-like planet and of seeing pyramids from above. He |
| later found himself in his courtyard suffering from a terrible        |
| headache and feeling dizzy. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue    |

| 1996 - Nur-a-Shamat Camp, Israel - Daoud Ahmad awoke a one o'clock in  |
| the morning feeling thirsty and tried to get out of bed, but two      |
| short creatures quickly pounced upon him and beat him. Each had only  |
| one eye and they were remarkably strong. They wore black leathery     |
| clothes, and had Mohawk style haircuts. After they beat him he lost   |
| consciousness. He was taken to a local hospital where he was treated. |
| He also recalled that the beings had only three fingers on each hand. |

| 1999 - In Troup County, Georgia an ovoid object zig-zagged at high    |
| speed near ground level, and pulled up to avoid a pickup truck whose  |
| headlights had just been turned on. The object approached to within   |
| 200 meters, turned a dull red color, then dimmed to near              |
| invisibility. It left a trail of sparks and ashes. (Source: UFO       |
