| 1950 - In a newspaper story published in December 1967, a man from    |
| Salzburg, Austria claimed that he was abducted by a five-foot tall    |
| Grey humanoid UFOnaut who wore a silver uniform with a fishbowl style |
| helmet. The incident reportedly occurred in a forest five miles north |
| of Salzburg at around 11:00 p.m. at night. He was paralyzed and was   |
| floated up to the top of a round craft that had landed in a nearby    |
| field. The UFO had a dark interior, and the experience involved an    |
| off-Earth journey. The encounter lasted about an hour. (Source:       |

| 1963 - A metallic domed disc with a transparent dome and aerial and a |
| concave bottom hovered 30 meters above the ground at a farm in Moe,   |
| Victoria, Australia. It was about eight meters in diameter, and gave  |
| off a bluish glow as it emitted a swishing noise. Horses and cattle   |
| on the farm panicked and fled. It climbed into the sky at a 45 degree |
| angle going off toward the west and into the clouds. (Sources:        |

| 1969 - William Black observed a yellow-orange light moving from south |
| to north while walking his dog at 10:40 p.m. in Brooklyn, New York.   |
| He saw a small protuberance on the edge of the "disc" as it passed    |
| overhead. After he crossed the street he saw two light sources going  |
| north, which veered slightly and headed off to the northeast.         |

| confirmed his report by witnessing the same tiny humanoid creature.   |

| 1976 - Two men, Gelo and Carmona, were riding on a motorcycle between |
| Olivares and Gerena, Sevilla, Spain at 8:10 p.m. when                 |
| their motorcycle engine died. They then saw a 30 meter long           |
| cigar-shaped object on the roadside. (Sources: FSR, October 1976, p.  |

| 1978 - Late at night, a 15-year-old teenage girl woke up in her       |
| bed in her home near Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She saw an intense     |
| light emanating from outside her bedroom window and was unable to     |
| move. However, she was able to see out the window and saw a luminous  |
| dome-shaped object hovering very close to the ground in the garden.   |
| It was completely motionless, and had pulsating multi-colored lights  |
| on its top. Suddenly she heard a voice inside her head that said: "We |
| will pick you up and you will join us." Terrified, she answered in    |
| her mind: "No, I will not come with you because I am materialistic    |
| and very attached to the banal joys of life. You are advanced         |
| spiritually and extremely distant from my concerns. Leave me,         |
| spirituality does not interest me". After about an hour of what felt  |
| like constant mental struggle her paralysis subsided and she was      |
| finally able to move. The dome-shaped machine then slowly rose up     |
| from the garden. Terrified, she ran for her parents, who saw the      |
| slowly ascending object leave, emitting multicolored flashes of       |
| light. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978,    |

| 1979 - At 10:00 p.m. a 15 meter in diameter luminous domed disc was   |
| seen over the Metauro River in Fano, Italy during a rainstorm. It     |

| 1992 - A dome-shaped UFO with white windows or lights rotating around |
| the base hovered over Risley Nature Reserve in Warrington, England at |
| 7:15 a.m. It was seen from the M62 highway, and it disappeared into a |
| large cloud. (Source: Timothy Good, Alien Update, p. 250, citing the  |

| 1994 - At 11:00 p.m. a glowing oblong object caused electromagnetic   |
| interference effects on a car in Enkopping, Uppsala, Sweden. The UFO  |
| then sped away. (Source: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume    |

| 1996 - Two witnesses reported that at 8:10 p.m. a luminous            |
| cigar-shaped object hovered close to the ground in Proaza, Oviedo,    |
| Spain. A sphere with "sticks" extended to the ground and illuminated  |
| the surrounding terrain. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database,   |

| 1999 - For a total of three minutes a single witness in Lucky Point,  |
| Knox County, Indiana saw a bright light in the northwest. A silvery,  |
| shimmering disc-shaped object the size of a Boeing 707 then came into |
| view, moving silently. The UFO tipped on its side, and then traveled  |
| up-and-down in all directions. It next moved in a figure-8 pattern    |
| and flew off towards the northwest. A photograph was taken. The next  |
| day the witness was approached by three men in dark suits who         |
| demanded the print and the negative. The three men identified         |
| themselves as employees of Indianapolis Power and Light and asserted  |
| that it was illegal to take photos of the power lines. I.P. & L. was  |
| contacted and denied that it sent representatives to interview the    |
| witness. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1999,  |

| 2005 - At 1:25 p.m. in Maple Ridge, British Columbia two witnesses    |
| sighted a large white oval object with legs hanging down. It rose     |
| quickly out of sight. At 6:28 p.m. in Ruskin, British Columbia a      |
| single witness sighted a large V-shaped object with lighted panels on |
| the underneath side. At 9:00 p.m. in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada two     |
| witnesses reported that a multicolored light hovered over them for    |
| four minutes, shifted back and forth, then shot away towards the      |
| east. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 2005 Canadian UFO Survey, cases # 7, 8, |

| 2006 - The witness was driving alone from Elaine to Crumrod, Arkansas |
| at six o'clock in the evening when he noticed two very bright lights  |
| on each side of his car that began to follow him. He turned into the  |
| driveway of the first house he came to and the lights did the same.   |
| He did not get out of the car, but instead blew the car horn          |
| for several minutes while the bright lights remained close to his     |
| car. He then saw figures with glowing eyes standing all around the    |
| house; they were looking at him. He started calling family members    |
| and friends on his cellphone, but it soon went dead and so did the    |
| car's engine. A friend whom he had succeeded in phoning came by to    |
| pick him up, but did not see anything. His car still would not        |
| start an hour after the incident and had to be jump started. The      |
| resident of the house refused to come out because he thought there    |
| was something “strange” happening outside. (Source: Albert S.         |
