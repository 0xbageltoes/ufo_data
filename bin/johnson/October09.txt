| 1951 - At 1:42 p.m. CAA Chief Aircraft Communicator Roy Messmore at   |
| Hulman Municipal Airport in Terre Haute, Indiana sighted a round      |
| silver object that flew directly overhead. The UFO reached the        |
| horizon in 15 seconds. A very similar incident happened three minutes |
| later near Paris, Illinois (15 miles NW) and was also listed as       |
| "unidentified" for several years, but was eventually reclassified.    |

| returning home in the evening when he saw four occupants of an object |
| that had descended to ground level 70 meters from the road he was on. |
| Seeing a blue light at first, he thought that an airplane had made an |
| emergency landing. However, the cigar-shaped object was wingless.     |
| There were four humanoid beings wearing some type of rubber coveralls |
| working under it. They were about 1.2 meters tall and had very large  |
| chests and oversized heads; their legs were short and thin. (Source:  |

| Carette saw a fiery sphere flying at treetop level for ten seconds.   |
| It had a protuberance or dome on top, and was estimated to be about 4 |
| meters in diameter. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the     |
| Straight Line Mystery, p. 152; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia,   |

| 1954 - As he was driving near Carcassonne, France at around 4 o'clock |
| in the afternoon, Jean Bertrand saw a bright, metallic sphere ahead   |
| on the road. The top half appeared to be made of transparent plastic, |
| and two humanlike figures were seen standing inside. It took off      |
| quickly, flying away to the east. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying       |
| Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery, p. 145; Jacques Vallee,        |

| 16--were roller skating at 6:30 p.m. when they saw a luminous object  |
| near the cemetery. It was round, about 2.5 meters in diameter, on     |
| stood on three legs. A dwarf, about 1.2 meters tall, dressed in       |
| black, having a face covered with hair and large eyes, came out and   |
| shone a blinding light at them. It said something in an unknown       |
| language. The children ran away, but looked back in time to see the   |
| object flying away high in the sky. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying     |
| Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery, p. 154; Jacques Vallee,        |

| 1954 - Mr. Barrault was riding his bicycle in Lavoux, France at seven |
| o'clock in the evening when he suddenly saw a figure in a diving suit |
| aiming a double beam of light at him. The individual had boots        |
| without heels and very bright eyes. It walked along the road for      |
| about a minute and then went into the forest. The witness was         |
| paralyzed and was unable to movethroughout the incident. The entity   |
| had a hairy chest and two lights, one above the other, in front of    |
| him. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight Line      |

| 1954 - Briatexte, France. At 8:30 p.m. on Route N631 at "La Caiffe,"  |
| a technician named J. P. Mitto was returning from Toulouse with two   |
| other friends when they saw two small figures cross the road in front |
| of their car and jump into a pasture. The beings were about the       |
| height of 11-year-old children and crossed only five meters in front  |
| of them. Stopping immediately, the witnesses saw a large convex disc  |
| take off vertically. It was about six meters in diameter, orange in   |
| color, and was literally "sucked up" into the sky. Brown oily spots   |
| were found at the landing site. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to  |
| Magonia, p. 222).                                                     |

| sight. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia, p. 222).         |
