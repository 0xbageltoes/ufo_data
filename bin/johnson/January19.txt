| 1967 - A 15-year old boy was in his room at four o'clock in the       |
| afternoon, in an undisclosed town in Indiana when he heard a sound    |
| like a rumbling train. He went to his window to check and was         |
| startled to see a shiny flying object moving slowly 25 feet above the |
| ground. The UFO was described as jar shaped with a silver quilted     |
| surface and had an opening on the top. The object seemed to follow    |
| the contour of the land and made several sharp-angle turns around     |
| trees. The teen grabbed a small plastic camera and snapped several    |
| photos. One of the photos seems to show the head of a humanoid like   |
| figure protruding from the opening on top of the object. (Source:     |

| 1979 - The witness was driving to the town of Bastia, Italy in        |
| Liguria province in the evening and had just turned a curve in the    |
| road when his vehicle's engine suddenly stalled. As he looked under   |
| the hood he noticed two figures looking at him from behind a nearby   |
| electrical pylon on the side of the road. At first he thought they    |
| were electrical company workers and did not pay them any attention.   |
| But he soon looked back at the two figures more closely and noticed   |
| that one was about 2.50 meters in height and massive in appearance,   |
| while the other figure was somewhat shorter. Both wore shiny          |
| tight-fitting outfits. The figures stared at him for a few minutes    |
| and then walked back into the woods. Soon after his encounter with    |
| these two strange beings he was able to start his engine. That same   |
| evening another witness saw a bright bluish light descend into the    |
| same woods. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database,    |

| 1988 - A father and daughter were driving to pick up the mother from  |
| work at around 5:00 p.m. in Benton, Louisiana. They pulled into the   |
| parking lot of her work and stopped to wait for her. The lot, the     |
| street, and the nearby Interstate highway were all in their normal    |
| hubbub of activity. The daughter brought her father's attention to a  |
| streak of light in the sky. Almost as soon as he focused on it, the   |
| light seemed to appear immediately in front of them, about 150 feet   |
| away and about 50 feet above the ground. It was a dull silver or      |
| steel gray disc-shaped object. Around the perimeter were openings     |
| like wind scoops, which spun about fairly rapidly. From the top of    |
| the disc emerged a sheath from which extended rotary blades like      |
| those seen on helicopters. The craft performed this extension as they |
| watched, although the blades did not turn. The disc was about the     |
| size of an automobile and about five feet tall. It never made any     |
| noise for the minute and a half of the performance. A strange silence |
| permeated the environment. "It seemed...that there were no cars       |
| moving, [we] didn't hear a thing in the world. Nothing. Just like the |
| world stood still." Then the device zipped away, and as soon as it    |
| had left "the traffic on I-20 came alive and the parking lot became   |
| active." (Source: Michael Swords, International UFO Reporter, Summer  |
| 2002, p. 21).                                                         |

| 1991 - At 10:30 p.m. in 1991 a 31-year-old respiratory therapist was  |
| driving home in Massachusetts and observed a domed disc with a large  |
| square window emitting white light. It hovered low (25 feet) over a   |
| tree across the street that was only 360 feet away. Electrical        |
| interference was reported in the form of static on the telephone.     |

| 1993 - In Beldon, Western Australia at three a.m. the witness awoke   |
| to see a figure kneeling to the left side of his bed about half way   |
| down the side. The figure was thin and had normal features, except    |
| that it had no hair and the ears were defined only by a faint         |
| outline. A golden box-like object appeared to be attached to the      |
| being's neck just below its right ear. The witness reached out to     |
| touch the figure, but his hand went right through it. It then         |
| disappeared, to re-appear seconds later passing through a closed      |
| screen door. His dog at the foot of the bed watched the whole         |
| incident but did not react in any noticeable way. There were no       |
| sounds, smells, or other anomalies noted. The entity was wearing a    |
| grayish-green polo shirt that had a higher than normal neck line. It  |
| had a belt that supported a pair of loose fitting trousers. It was    |
| too dark to see any footwear. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |
