| 1952 - At 11:40 p.m. four yellow disc-shaped objects approached the   |
| Savannah River AEC nuclear facility near Ellenton, South Carolina     |
| from the south at a very low altitude. They flew straight and level   |
| for a short period of time, but they had to rise to pass over tall    |
| tanks on the ground. They made no sound, and weaved left to right as  |
| they flew. Four DuPont workers were the witnesses. (Sources: Project  |

| Navy F3D-2 jet fighters over Elsinore, California at 12:40 p.m.       |
| sighted a delta winged UFO as it passed the first Navy jet at a speed |
| in excess of 240 knots. The UFO was half the length of the F3D-s      |
| (which is 22 feet long), had a wing span about equal to it (20 feet), |
| and had a third fin on its upper half. It was the color of gun metal. |

| 1957 - An abductee named McBride reported being abducted by aliens    |
| while driving along the highway in Lake Isabella, California at dusk. |
| The witness first spotted a white bubble-shaped object floating above |
| the trees. It descended to just 10 feet above the ground. Thin, bony  |
| looking humanoids, seven to eight feet tall, emerged from the object  |
| wearing transparent clothing. They communicated using telepathy.      |

| 1957 - At 10:45 p.m. a 29-year-old man named Fekete was bicyling home |
| along a road in Beaucourt-sur-Ancre, France when he was temporarily   |
| blinded by a light from above. Together with three of this neighbors, |
| he saw a pulsating object on the ground with the silhouettes of three |
| short men (4-5 feet tall) with large heads and a torrering gait. The  |
| light rose into sky when a car passed. A circular ground mark was     |
| found at the landing site. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and  |

| 1966 - In Marisela, an area of Caracas, Venezuela a man observed the  |
| landing of an oval-shaped object and two beings at 4:52 p.m. The      |
| beings emerged from the object through a system of light beams. The   |
| creings used strange instruments to examine a number of objects,      |
| especially some plants. They were two meters tall, had oversized      |
| heads, and appeared bright and "transparent." Their eyes were slanted |
| and they had very broad shoulders. They wore no apparent weapons, but |
| their belts were very wide and emitted light rays. They did not touch |
| anything without first illuminating it with these beams. They went    |
| back aboard their craft "as if carried by the light." (Source:        |

| 1966 - At 10:00 p.m. on or about this date, a crowd of people in      |
| Atafona Campos, Brazil were watching an outdoor movie when an unknown |
| aerial object crashed and exploded. They panicked, thinking at the    |
| time it was perhaps related to an earthquake. According to the        |
| police, a sulphurous odor and a hole in the ground 25 cm deep and 35  |
| cm wide were noted at the site. (Source: Jacques Vallee: Passport to  |

| 1967 - At 8:30 p.m. southeast of the town of Combs-la-Ville, France a |
| 1.5 meter pyramid shaped UFO landed on a road by the railroad tracks, |
| and then illuminated the surrounding area. (Source: Phenomenes        |

| 1968 - On this night in Galesburg, Illinois Grant Callison and his    |
| wife noticed three winged beings flying at an estimated altitude of   |
| 500 feet. The beings appeared to be covered with feathers or metallic |
| scales which acquired an odd fluorescence as they reflected light     |
| from the local street lamps. The strange trio lacked necks of any     |
| sort and had short, conical tails. There were other sightings of the  |
| same creatures in the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |

| 1977 - A three and a half year old girl, Maria do Socorro, had        |
| accompanied her grandmother while she did laundry in Serra Branca,    |
| Paraiba state, Brazil and then vanished suddenly at around 11:00 a.m. |
| She was missing for 22 hours. She mysteriously turned up at the       |
| doorsteps of her family's garden. She said she had seen a beautiful   |
| woman with a white scarf on her head and was irresistibly attracted   |
| to a strong beam of light which the lady ran behind. The lady spoke   |
| to the child but she "did not open her mouth to talk." Friends and    |
| neighbors spent an entire day searching the area where she had last   |
| been seen, without finding a trace. It was assumed by all involved    |
| that the phenomenon had an apparently extraterrestrial cause, but no  |
| UFO was seen. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:          |

| 1978 - A UFO abduction occurred in a forest in Emilcin, Lublin,       |
| Poland sometime after 7:00 a.m. The abductee, a 71-year-old man named |
| J. Wolski, encountered a UFO shaped like a bus, making a humming      |
| sound. The humanoid had a greenish color and wore a black helmet.     |

| 1978 - At 10:50 p.m. the witness was walking home alone in Pelotas,   |
| Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil when he observed a very bright object in    |
| the sky that began to descend at a high speed. The object came low    |
| over a nearby fenced field, and he could now see that it was a shiny  |
| circular metallic craft within a fiery ball of flames. The craft      |
| continued to descend, and projected two bright beams of white light   |
| to the ground and extended four metallic legs. The area around the    |
| witness seemed to darken, and he felt compelled to walk towards the   |
| fence. He was quickly grabbed by two short humanoids who wore shiny   |
| white tight fitting suits. Their heads were enclosed in helmets with  |
| closed visors and with two small antennas protruding from the top.    |
| The beings spoke to the witness, then took him inside the craft.      |
|                                                                       |
| Once inside he started having difficulty breathing and noticed that   |
| the air seemed warmer and dense. The room was illuminated by a bright |
| light. It was at this point that he noticed two more beings seated at |
| a strange looking console. The beings walked over to him and he was   |
| surprised to see that they were female dressed in shiny white suits,  |
| with attractive capes made of the same material. These also wore      |
| helmets with antennas. They were a little taller than the other       |
| humanoids and had hair down to their shoulders. One had black hair    |
| and the other was blond. The black haired female approached the       |
| witness and told him that he was going to be taken to their planet.   |
| The witness declined the invitation and begged to be released. At     |
| this point the blond woman walked over and ordered the others to let  |
| him go. He was then allowed to walk out and down a stairway to the    |
| ground. He stood on the ground and watched while the object ascended  |
| at high speed and vanished. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |

| 1989 - At just after midnight a 38-year-old male and a 16 year-old    |
| female driving in Farmington, Michigan were pursued by a silvery disc |
| with a greenish tinge. Electromagnetic interference effects were      |
| reported. (Source: Paul Ferrughelli, Computer Catalog of UFO Reports, |

| 1989 - La Venta del Astillero, Zapopan, Mexico - Apolonio Perez was    |
| awakened at 2:15 a.m. while sleeping in his camper by an extremely    |
| bright white light that illuminated the surrounding area. Worried     |
| about possible intruders, he searched the camper but found nothing.   |
| He returned to his bed, but a few seconds later a pencil-thin beam of |
| white light lit the left side of his face. He heard a sound           |
| resembling a welder's torch and felt facial pain. Frightened, it      |
| occurred to him that he could be having another encounter with the    |
| occupants of a UFO he had seen years before. As he lay there he next  |
| felt a jolt of electricity in his body. Upset and in pain, Perez      |
| cursed at whoever was responsible for his pain, and moments later he  |
| received a third powerful electrical jolt. He stood up and managed to |
| open the door of his camper just as the white light seemed to dim and |
| vanish. The next day he experienced severe headaches and the left     |
| side of his face became swollen and began to bleed. For the next two  |
| weeks he had a severe rash on his face that eventually left permanent |
| scaring. He would experience further encounters. (Source: Albert S.   |

| 1989 - Later that evening, at around 7:45 p.m., an elderly motorist   |
| was driving in an isolated area of Bautista Canyon, California when   |
| she saw a luminous 30-foot wide mushroom-shaped craft descend and     |
| hover just above some nearby power lines. She stopped her car and     |
| observed six to eight beings emerge from the craft and begin to work  |
| repairing the outside of the object. After 10 minutes they re-entered |
| the object, which departed at high speed emitting a loud humming      |
| sound and a burst of blue flame. They were reports of electrical      |
| outages in the area at the time. (Sources: Paul Ferrughelli, Computer |

| 1993 - In the pre-dawn hours of the night six witnesses on a road     |
| west of Fortaleza, Ceara State, Brazil recorded three hours of        |
| videotape of a nocturnal object which had several satellite objects   |
| exit from it and then merge back into it. (Source: Bob Pratt, UFO     |

| 1994 - Two cows were found dead and mutilated at the Hronich Ranch    |
| near Eagle Nest, New Mexico. Dr. Altshuler, a veterinarian from       |
| Denver, Colorado involved in cattle mutilation investigations,        |
| arrived at the site within 10 hours, and his forensic analysis        |
| revealed that the two animals had cooked hemoglobin and cauterized    |
| incisions. Both animals also had had pneumonia. (Source: Christopher  |

| 1994 - At around 11:00 p.m. three villagers in Sagrado Corazon,       |
| Cosolapa, Mexico watched a large white light come from some nearby    |
| hills and land a few meters away. A short humanoid creature exited    |
| from the object. The humanoid was dressed all in white and had a      |
| shiny belt and helmet that constantly changed colors. When one of the |
| villagers attempted to approach, the humanoid climbed back into the   |
| object. Minutes later a boy threw a rock at the object, which         |
| promptly dimmed and took off, flying back towards the hills at a high |
| speed and quickly disappearing from sight. (Source: Albert S.         |

| 1999 - A man was awakened at 3:00 a.m. by a barking dog and a strange |

| 1999 - On this evening Manuel Jimenez was driving on Route N-3333 on  |
| his way back to Los Arenales, Spain when he noticed a bright          |
| spherical light flying low over the area. Thinking it was a plane, he |
| continued driving. Five minutes later he saw a bright spherical       |
| object resting on the ground in a nearby field, about 200 meters      |
| away. Two short figures wearing shiny metallic outfits stood next to  |
| it. Sr. Jimenez stopped his truck and watched the incredible scenario |
| for awhile. Apparently the little men noticed the witness, because    |
| they quickly entered the lighted sphere, which then shot up into the  |
| sky at an incredible speed leaving a luminous trail behind. (Source:  |
