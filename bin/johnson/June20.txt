| 1952 - Central Korea. At 3:03 p.m. four Marine Corps Captains and     |
| pilots of F4U-4B Corsair fighter planes of the 7302nd Squadron        |
| sighted a 10-20 foot diameter white to silver oval object for 60      |
| seconds. The daylight UFO made a left-hand orbit of the target area,  |
| and then shot away to the east outdistancing pursuit aircraft at a    |
| terrific speed. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official |

| 1953 - Brush Creek, California. John Q. Black, one of two miners who  |
| witnessed a landing and humanoid at Brush Creek on May 20th of this   |
| year, witnessed a complete repetition of the scene, including the     |
| "little man" with the pail of water. The little man was dressed in a  |
| suit like a parka, and he descended from a 8-foot wide landed         |
| lens-shaped silver craft with tripod landing gear. The "midget"       |
| scooped up a pail of water, saw that he was being watched, then       |
| scurried back to the craft and zoomed away. His partner Mr. John Van  |
| Allen only saw the tripod landing gear marks, which were about 30 cm  |
| wide and resembled "elephant tracks." (Sources: The Humanoids, p. 53; |

| 1958 - At 11:05 p.m. Fort Bragg, North Carolina Battalion             |
| Communication Chief SFC A. Parsley observed a silver, circular        |
| object, its lower portion seen through a green haze, hover, then      |
| oscillate slightly, and then move away at great speed. He watched it  |
| for 10 minutes. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official |

| 1967 - Farmer Arvi Juntunen in Suomussalmi, Finland heard a loud      |
| humming sound at noon and saw a round, shiny gray object 50 cm above  |
| ground, 6 meters away. It had a domed top with a fin and measured 75  |
| cm in diameter. As he was about to seize it, the object rose with a   |
| blast, circled and flew away. (Sources: Gordon Creighton, FSR,        |

| 1968 - Eustaqui Zogorwski, age 63, a Polish immigrant, claimed that   |
| on this date he was drugged by a man who drove up to his house in     |
| Avellaneda, Buenos Aires, Argentina in a black car. When he recovered |
| consciousness he found himself in an otherworldly environment, where  |
| giant beings were dwelling in an aerial city.Two of these beings,     |
| over two meters tall, conducted Mr. Zogorwski to a tower in the       |
| center of the city, seemingly suspended in space. He was seated at a  |
| table around which sat 12 similar giants. They took his arms and he   |
| began to "trace signs automatically." He believed that they had       |
| "brainwashed" him. He was finally released between the towns of       |
| Brinkmann and Cotagaita, in Cordoba province, where the mysterious    |
| man in the black car picked him up and drove him to his home.         |

| 1968 - Peasants in Bulnes Nuble, Chile saw a five-foot tall being     |
| with a white head and torso, from whose arms wings extended. It was   |

| 1969 - On this evening numerous witnesses in and around the Michigan  |
| City, Indiana area, bordering Lake Michigan, saw a series of          |
| multi-colored, maneuvering lights for a period of at least two hours. |
| Among the witnesses were policemen, Coast Guardsmen, a harbor         |
| patrolman, a local newspaper photographer, and an electronics         |
| engineer. The first report was at 9:35 p.m. "The objects appeared     |
| solid and yet were a source of their own light," US Coast Guardsman   |
| Vernon Kleman stated. "They appeared as if from nowhere and could     |
| brighten up to a size much larger than when originally seen. They     |
| moved at a variety of speeds, some fast, some slow and at times they  |
| were stationary for a minute or more...The objects were colored       |
| white, green or orange and they changed colors at will." A roughly    |
| oval-shaped UFO appeared to have a rotating rim with red, green and   |
| yellow lights around its center. Increasing in intensity, the object  |
| was in view for about a minute before it "quickly diminished in size  |
| and brilliance" and disappeared. "Once a smaller object seemed to     |
| enter the water," Kleman continued. "It was submerged for 4-6         |
| seconds. Then it traveled straight upward at an excessive speed."     |
|                                                                       |
| 1969 - At 10:25 members of the Michigan City Police Department and Port      |
| Authority began seeing the UFOs. Robert G. Howington, harbor          |
| policeman, said the objects he saw disappeared to the "northwest with |
| terrific speed." Officer Ted Stantz saw lights that erratically "went |
| back and forth across the sky." Policeman James R. Coughlin and       |
| others saw the objects at the same time. "We saw about 9 or 10 such   |
| objects over a span of about two hours," Police Sgt. Lance M. Hilberg |
| stated in his report to NICAP. "One seemed to approach very close.    |
| The others were quite high and very distant. All objects appeared     |
| very bright and solid. The closest one was extremely bright [and]     |
| faded away at tremendous speed--much faster than any aircraft..."     |
|                                                                       |
| Officer Tony C. Ragle said he was cruising in his squad car when he   |
| got a call to assist personnel at the Port Authority. Looking through |
| his windshield, he saw the large bright object that "hovered over     |
| Lake Michigan for approximately 90 seconds, then went up and darted   |
| toward Chicago.” Bill Allen, a photographer-reporter for The Michigan |
| City News-Dispatch, saw an object over the lakefront at 11:30 p.m. It |
| looked like an upside down saucer with a pulsating red light around   |
| the bottom. The top was an orange-yellow color. The objects were also |
| viewed over Gary, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois. (Source: Bill Laas,  |

| 1974 - Several hundred witnesses including 15 police saw a luminous   |
| cigar-shaped object fly back and forth over the city of Sao Bernardo  |
| da Campo, Sao Paulo state, Brazil at 7:30 p.m. It reportedly          |
| responded to light signals. (Source: Inforespace, October 1975).      |

| 1975 - A luminous globe, described also like a large incandescent     |
| ball, was seen to fall into the sea some miles off the coast of the   |
| port of Genova, Italy. The report arrived from a geophysicist of the  |
| university that was completing normal surveys and that had            |
| immediately signaled the fact to the National Fire Departments.       |

| 1976 - The alien abduction of a 19-year-old married couple and their  |
| infant occurred at around one o'clock in the morning, from their car  |
| while driving on I-70 five miles west of Colby, Kansas. The Delduca   |
| family reported they had encountered a UFO that was a 150-foot wide   |
| saucer-shaped craft that stood 40 feet tall. They initially had       |
| several hours of missing time, but were able to recall their          |
| experience through the aid of hypnotic regression. They recalled that |
| there were three 5.0 to 5.5 foot tall humanoids, matching the         |
| description of short Grey humanoids, wearing helmets. They were given |
| physical exams and communicated with via telepathy. They had body     |
| marks and rashes subsequent to their encounter. (Sources: Richard     |

| 1977 - A year later another abduction occurred, this time from a      |
| bedroom in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Gayle Bever recalled under hypnosis  |
| that during a two hour period of missing time she had been taken from |
| her bedroom shortly before midnight by human-looking beings wearing   |
| coveralls. She was also given a physical exam. She has a small        |
| circular scar, 1 cm in diameter, on her shoulder in the shape of a    |
| wheel with spokes. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, November 1977, p. 1; R.   |

| 1986 - At 4 a.m. Cesar Locatelli was driving through a brushy         |
| isolated area in Mentrux-en-Joux, Jura, France searching for a swarm  |
| of wild bees he believed was nearby when he made a turn under some    |
| trees and came upon a large transparent, brightly illuminated bluish  |
| disc-shaped object partly resting on top of a large boulder. The disc |
| was about 9 meters in diameter. Inside the object he could clearly    |
| see six human-like figures of short to average height, perhaps 5 feet |
| tall. These figures were wearing white hooded tunics with cowls like  |
| the kind worn by monks. These covered their heads and obscured their  |
| faces. They all were standing around an oval table, apparently bent   |
| over it. He attempted to drive away but his car engine stalled. At    |
| the same time he could hear a high-pitched humming sound. He was      |
| finally able to restart the car and drove away. When he returned to   |
| the site several months later he was surprised to see that the large  |
| boulder was gone. (Source: Joel Mesnard & Michael Morel Seythoux,     |

| 1989 - At noon two girls in Lesozavodsk, Siberia, Russia encountered  |
| a strange being that floated above the ground towards them. It left a |
| silvery trail behind him that faded slowly. The creature was          |
| described as humanoid but robot-like in appearance, and it had        |
| silvery gray hair. As it passed the girls it emitted a strange        |
| squeaking sound and a bright light in their direction which caused    |
| one of them a headache. A number of bus passengers also saw the       |
| humanoid. As it passed in front of a car it turned a strange silvery  |
| color. It continued on and disappeared towards a nearby bridge.       |
