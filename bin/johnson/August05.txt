| 1927 - At 9:30 in the morning while climbing in the Humbolt Range of  |
| the Altai Mountains in Mongolia, explorer Nicholas Roerich and seven  |
| companions saw a huge, shiny, flying oval-shaped object that          |
| reflected the sunlight. It flew from north to south, then changed     |
| direction and flew off to the southeast. The UFO was in view for      |
| several minutes and was examined through binoculars. Witnesses of the |
| daylight UFO included members of the mountaineering expedition,       |
| Mongols, and Buriat lamas. The lamas believed it was the "Sign of     |
| Shambala." (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Anatomy of a Phenomenon, p. 22;  |
| J. Allen Hynek, International UFO Reporter, January 1982, p. 10).     |

| 1950 - On this day one of the most famous UFO movies of all time was  |
| shot in Great Falls, Montana. The 16mm film was shot by Nick Mariana  |
| and was witnessed by his secretary, Virginia Raunig. It shows         |
| aluminum colored discs, "like two new dimes", hovering in the sky at  |
| a distance of two miles. It was sent to the U.S. Air Force for        |
| analysis, but when it was returned Mr. Mariana claimed many frames    |
| from the first part of the film, those showing the best closeup       |
| images of the objects, had been deleted. The existing film consists   |
| of 280 frames of 16mm film. The UFOs first hovered, then moved        |
| smoothly at very high speed (400 mph) in an arch beind a water tower. |
| The objects estimated diameter was 50 feet. (Sources: Richard F.      |

| 1952 - Another famous case, a radar-visual confirmation, occurred in  |
| Japan on this day. A UFO hovered over the Haneda U.S. Air Force base  |
| near Tokyo and had several ground military witnesses in addition to   |
| radar tracking. It looked like a dark shape with a light, and it flew |
| at 330 knots, then hovered, then performed a variety of maneuvers. It |
| was tracked by airborne radar for 90 seconds.The UFO moved off at     |
| extreme speed, and then divided into three parts. (Sources: Project   |

| 1952 - At 5:10 a.m. an airline pilot named Quinn, flying a DC-3 for   |
| PAGA Airlines between Lima and Hueca, Peru, took a photograph of      |
| three saucer-shaped objects flying in V formation which maneuvered    |

| 1955 - Buzancy, Ardennes, France - At 2:30 p.m. Messrs. Coisin and     |
| Mahieu saw five brown, disc-shaped craft come down from the sky and   |
| fly back up again at a high rate of speed. One of them flew under the |
| others. Two discs appeared to land 300 meters away near the German    |
| cemetery. The others flew away toward the south at tremendous speed.  |

| 1962 - On a highway between Las Armas and General Pirana, Argentina   |
| in Buenos Aires province at 1:45 a.m., Sr. P. Atilli had his truck's  |
| engine fail in the presence of a glowing orange, cigar-shaped UFO.    |
| The object was 25 meters long and 300 meters away, and gave off       |
| flashes of violet and green light. It shot off toward the             |
| west. (Sources: Uriondo Oscar A. Uriondo, FSR Case Histories, December 1972, p.  |

| 1963 - Shortly after midnight in Wayne County, Illinois a car with    |
| several teenagers was followed for 10 miles between Wayne City and    |
| Mount Vernon by white light. The UFO made a humming sound as it       |
| followed them. The car radio went crazy and the engine stalled as the |
| object passed over, and the witnesses felt a sensation of cold when   |
| the UFO passed within 100 feet. Multiple independent witnesses.       |

| 1967 - At two o'clock in the afternoon three teenagers in Porthmadog  |
| near Mount Snowdon, Wales witnessed a metallic, 10-foot long, beer    |
| keg-shaped object flying low and hugging the rough terrain in a       |
| silent flight up and down the mountains. (Source: FSR, February 1978, |

| 1967 - At 11:30 p.m. two men, Ronald Sherven and Robert Bodine, saw a |
| glowing, white flying object head from the west towards the east,     |
| north of Sawyer, North Dakota. The UFO was hidden from view by a      |
| hill, but suddenly appeared again over the cemetery, came down to     |
| ground level, and then sped away to the north. (Sources: NICAP UFO    |

| 1969 - (1) At 3:30 a.m. a U.S. Marine Corp Colonel named Brandmeyer   |
| driving on Route 161 had a close encounter with a small intense light |
| over a wooded area near New Baden, Illiniois. The light made a sharp  |
| turn, approached, drew alongside, and then paced his car for a few    |
| minutes. (2) That night, at 10:15 p.m., a metallic UFO approached a   |
| car 15 miles northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina on Highway 50,      |
| being driven by a Mrs. McWhite with one passenger. The car headlights |
| dimmed, and their was interference on the car radio. Both were        |
| okay and the lights and radio functioned properly againafter the UFO  |
| left, about 30 seconds later. (3) Two and a half hours later, at      |
| 10:45 p.m. Mountain Time, five woman driving fourteen miles west of   |
| Ponoka, Alberta, Canada had a similar UFO close encounter with        |
| electromagnetic effects; the driver was a 38-year-old woman named     |
| Scott, and the incident lasted much long, about an hour. (Sources:    |

| 1970 - Around 4:30 a.m. between Plasencia and Bejar, Caceres, Spain a |
| man was driving through a forest when he sighted a brightly lit,      |
| yard-wide sphere in the sky that stopped, descended vertically into a |
| clearing in the forest, and then darkened. At 10:45 p.m. a UFO in     |
| Cazalla de la Sierra, Seville, Spain caused the furious barking of    |
| two dogs. What appeared before the four witnesses was a               |
| two-dimensional illuminated 2 m by 1 m rectangle, hovering in the sky |
| only ten meters away, perpendicular to the ground, which blocked the  |
| view of the vegetation behind it. It vanished when a gun was pointed  |
| in its direction. (Source: (1) Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos,          |

| 1974 - An apparent abduction attempt that was thwarted by two other   |
| UFOs occurred shortly after dusk in Maracaibo, Venezuela. Two         |
| peasants in their twenties, named Sr. Chiaka and Sr. Monteil, were    |
| returning home when they were blinded by a round object in the sky    |
| that was "flattened at the sides, and of a silvery color." They found |
| themselves paralyzed and unable to move as the object landed. Two     |
| humanoid beings, who were more than two meters tall, emerged from the |
| craft, wearing "lead colored clothing like the skin of sardines."     |
| They also had on blue colored goggles and dark belts. They approached |
| the witnesses slowly, making gestures, while a whistling sound came   |
| from their machine. What happened next was completely bewildering.    |
| Two other UFOs descended from the sky "and took the first UFO and its |
| occupants in tow." The witnesses were then able to move again, and    |
| made their escape. (Sources: La Razon, August 6, 1974; David F. Webb  |

| 1990 - At 3:45 a.m. the Martens family of Owens Sound, Ontario        |
| awoke to see "dancing lights" that were apparently disturbing their   |
| cattle. The lights were yellowish-orange in color and looked like     |
| their were connected to something very large. The lights gradually    |
| changed to a deep "crimson red", and began revolving around each      |
| other. Some kind of green haze or fog formed, and the object suddenly |
| vanished. That same night one son had a nightmare about a "shining    |
| angel", in the house, and the eldest daughter saw a brightly lit      |
| being in the house, who almost blinded her with light. (Source:       |

| At 10:55 p.m. a 35-year-old couple in Dortmund, Germany saw the sky   |
| brighten, and then sighted a huge 20-meter triangular object with     |
| 8-10 circular yellow-orange radiators. It sounded like a transformer, |
| flew from north to south, made an abrupt turn to the southwest        |
| at 150-200 m altitude, and 10 minutes later was seen again. (Source:  |

| 1997 - Taxi driver Ramon Velazquez Luna had just dropped off a fare   |
| at 12:45 a.m. and was driving on the Villa de Reyes highway in San    |
| Luis Potosi, Mexico when he began to see whitish orange lights        |
| following him. The lights turned off and then appeared this time in   |
| front of his taxicab. The lights then disappeared into a nearby       |
| field. Approaching the village of Chirimoya, he noticed what appeared |
| to be a "power plant," well lighted, on the side of the road.         |
| Confused by their presence, he stopped his cab and noticed that the   |
| lights were oval shaped. Quickly a fog-like smoke approached the      |
| vehicle, causing him to get scared and drive away. As he drove away   |
| he saw a strange vehicle on the side of the road nearby, and it had   |
| several large headless dark humanoid figures milling around it. The   |
| figures seemed to be signaling Luna to stop his vehicle. When he      |
| arrived at his destination he noticed that he had almost three hours  |
| he could not account for. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid        |

| 2002 - At 10:00 p.m. a triangular shaped object, large and with       |
| exterior lights, was sighted near the water in West Vancouver,        |
| British Columbia. It rose vertically. Starting at around 11:15 p.m.,  |

| and hovering between Martinsville and Mooresville, Indiana for 15     |
| minutes. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,     |

| 2006 - At around 11:00 p.m., while night hunting for wild boar, three |
| men in Bonaire, Georgia came upon a stand of oak trees alongside a    |
| field where they had just run their dogs, and saw some lights coming  |
| from the woods. They decided to investigate and walked into the woods |
| approximately 60 yards before they heard a loud whooshing sound.      |
| Their dogs then tucked their tails and began whining. When the men    |
| tried to get a closer look the lights dimmed, and another whooshing   |
| sound was heard. The men then saw two small green “midgets” run from  |
| behind a tree toward what appeared to be a large “concrete mixer”     |
| with lights on it. Later on, after waiting awhile and drinking a      |
| beer, the men ran back up the hill with their dogs. The light and the |
| object had gone, and there was an eerie silence throughout the woods, |
| so that even the insects were completely quiet. The next day, the men |
| returned to the spot and found nothing out of the ordinary. Later     |
| that next evening one of the men went to feed his dogs and found that |
| “Judo,” his best hunting dog, was sick and would not eat anything. He |
| claims the dog died later that week without any apparent reason.      |
