| 1952 - A 41-year-old farmer named N. Ferrari in Castelfranco Emilia,  |
| Italy saw a 20 meter wide plate-shaped disc hovering at 9:30 a.m. It  |
| had a five meter long cylinder rotating on the top and bottom of the  |
| object and made a sound like an electric motor. The plates separated  |
| and three human-appearing occupants were visible inside. They wore    |
| rubber suits with masks. They spoke something like                    |
| "Verren…firg…unch", and then the craft went straight up. (Sources:    |

| 1953 - At shortly after ten o'clock in the morning a huge silver      |
| sphere was seen following some jet aircraft in the San Fernando       |
| Valley. In Reseda, California some "angel hair" residue was seen      |
| falling to the ground after the UFO flyby. (Sources: ed jets.         |

| 1957 - A blinding object, red and yellow, twice landed first near the |
| Jockey Club, then near the Rural Exhibition in Bage City, Brazil at   |
| 10:30 p.m. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century   |
| of Landings, case 441).                                               |

| 1963 - On this evening in Saltwood, England four teenagers, among     |
| them painter John Flaxton and another named Hutchinson, saw a moving  |
| star turn into a reddish-yellow glow that came toward them while they |
| were walking on a country road. It next disappeared behind some       |
| trees. Shortly thereafter they saw a bright, golden light some 15-20  |
| feet wide that was seen 80 meters away, floating three meters above   |
| the ground, and a dark man-sized figure with wings like a bat and no  |
| head came toward them. They fled in terror. There was flattened       |
| bracken, and two-foot long footprints. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,      |

| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case A0576,      |

| 1966 - At 9:00 p.m. in Point Pleasant, West Virginia Mr. and Mrs.     |
| Raymond Wamsley and Mrs Marcella Bennett were driving to the house of |
| Ralph Thomas, when they saw a big red light maneuvering over the      |
| "TNT" dump area. When they arrived and got out, a "big gray thing     |
| bigger than a man, with glowing red eyes" rose up from the ground.    |
| They ran into the house, but the creature shuffled onto the porch and |
| peered into windows. It was gone by the time police arrived. Mr. &    |
| Mrs. Steve Mallette and Mr. & Mrs Roger Scarberry reported that their |
| car was followed about midnight by a gray "bird like creature" 6-7    |
| feet tall with a 10 foot wingspan. When the car headlights struck its |
| eyes, which were two inches in diameter, they glowed red. It finally  |
| scurried into a field and disappeared.(Source: David F. Webb & Ted    |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, cases 1966-54 and    |
| 55, citing John A. Keel).                                             |

| 1967 - At 5:00 p.m. Mrs. Quick and another woman in Storrington,      |
| England saw a flickering light and a deep-red, glowing object at      |
| ground level. A dark figure, seven to ten feet tall, was seen         |
| approaching it. The tall being appeared to glide rather than walk. It |
| vanished suddenly, and the UFO also disappeared suddenly. (Source:    |
| Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case      |
| 898).                                                                 |

| 1967 - Farm manager Alan Pool, age 43, saw an object, six meters in   |
| diameter and 1.5 meters high, with round and square windows, land in  |
| a field in Yerecoin, Western Australia with a whining noise at 6:30   |
| p.m. It took off and vanished, leaving no trace. (Source: Jacques     |
