| 1954 – At 3:00 a.m. on this day in Valencia, Venezuela an employee of |
| the Barbula Sanatorium saw a luminous UFO on the ground but decided   |
| not to report it until another employee, three hours later, saw the   |
| same craft. It took off soon after the second witness spotted it      |
| (Source: Passport to Magonia, A Century of Landings, case 357; Coral  |

| 1958 – At 12:55 a.m. two policemen, Officers Arboreen and Talada of   |
| the Dunellen Township police department in Middlesex County, New      |
| Jersey, watched in amazement as a glowing red, football-shaped UFO    |
| came directly at their police cruiser. The UFO came to an abrupt stop |
| a short distance away, pulsated while hovering, and then shot         |
| straight up into the sky and was gone. (Source: NICAP case            |

| 1958 - Not far from Domsten, Sweden Hans Gustavsson, age 35, and Stig |
| Rydberg, 30, saw something strange in the woods near the village of   |
| Haganas and stopped their car to observe it. They discovered that it  |
| was a disc about five meters wide, set on tripod landing gear. Next   |
| they were suddenly attacked by four gray-colored creatures described  |
| as "fluid" in appearance, but one of the men reached the car and blew |
| the horn for help. The beings then fled and the craft took off,       |
| emitting "paralyzing vibrations." (Source: Passport to Magonia, A     |
| Century of Landings, case 478).                                       |

| 1958 – On that same day at four o’clock in the afternoon in France,   |
| or nine hours later, a disc-shaped UFO was seen near the ground in    |
| Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dome department. The 20-meter diameter       |
| object caused some damage on the ground. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,    |

| 1959 – At 2:20 a.m. on a clear night with the full Moon high in the   |
| sky, eight disc-shaped craft maneuvered and seemed to be playing tag  |
| over the shoreline in Redondo Beach, California. They were bright     |
| yellow and bronze in color. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer          |

| 1965 – A 15-year-old youth named Burns was driving home in his pickup |
| truck in Herman, Minnesota at 11:45 p.m. when a glowing green         |
| disc-shaped UFO suddenly appeared, hovering six feet over the road.   |
| The object made a whistling sound while the truck’s engine stalled    |
| and its headlights died. The object began to glow red and rose        |
| straight up into the air, giving off sparks. The witness lost         |
| consciousness. When he awoke, he found that his truck had been turned |
| around and was resting in a roadside ditch. (Sources: Flying Saucer   |

| 1970 - A humanoid figure about 90 centimeters (three feet) in height  |
| was seen floating up into a transparent round object on this night in |
| Itaperuna, Brazil. Two other beings of the same stature were seen     |
| inside the object. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| 1971 – Mr. da Silva e Souza, 60, saw an intense blue-lighted object   |
| on the ground near the airport in Itaperuna, Brazil. The UFO was      |
| about eight feet long, transparent, ovoid shaped, and was illuminated |
| from within by a blue light. A short humanoid, less than a meter      |
| tall, walked around the craft once, and then seemed to float up into  |
| the air and enter the craft from above, feet first. There were two    |
| other short beings seated inside. The craft then flew away. (Source:  |

| 1973 – Two men, Klinn and Wagner, sighted a huge, yellowish glowing   |
| blob over Pacific Palisades, California at 2:15 a.m. It had flashing  |
| lights forming a triangle. They watched it through a 16x telescope.   |
| Forty-five minutes later a huge cigar-shaped UFO with four or five    |
| along the side and an appendage appeared in the sky, followed by a    |
| domed disc. The entire event lasted 82 minutes, until 3:37 a.m. when  |
| the lights went off. (Source: Flying Saucers, December 1974, p. 10).  |

| 1973 – In the afternoon Mrs. Brooker saw a cone-shaped UFO with       |
| flashing lights ascend vertically “very, very fast” leaving behind a  |
| trail of smoke in the eastern sky over Norman, Oklahoma. That same    |
| day a cattle mutilation was reported having occurred two miles east   |
| of Concordia, Kansas. (Sources: Norman Transcript, December 21, 1973; |

| 1973 – That night three teenage girls sighted an oval-shaped object   |
| with portholes while driving on a highway eight miles east of Casino, |
| New South Wales, Australia. The UFO made sharp maneuvers, circled the |
| city, flew up high in the sky and came back down to a low altitude.   |
| It changed color from red to green to white, and was surrounded by a  |
| blue haze. (Source: Richmond River (NSW) Express, January 4, 1978).   |
|                                                                       |
| 1976 – There were thirteen UFO reports in the early morning hours     |
| from various provinces of Spain, including Granada, Malaga, Valencia, |
| Murcia, Alicante, Melilla, and Cadiz. At 1:50 a.m. several witnesses  |
| watched a metallic appearing object radiate luminous rays of light    |
| and light up the sky with an intense luminosity in Malaga, Spain. A   |
| few minutes later yellow, red, and bluish green balls of light flew   |
| over Valencia, Alicante, and Almeria. Objects flew rapidly toward the |
| south or southwest. At 2:00 a.m. an enormous blue violet ball of      |
| light flew over Malaga at high speed. Ten minutes later a triangular  |
| or cone-shaped UFO, pale blue in color, flew from the north to the    |
| south over Murcia. A huge ovoid object, blue violet in color, was     |
| also seen flying in the same direction over Algeciras, Spain at about |
| the same time. On the same day the Sloop Rippe disappeared            |
| mysteriously in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida,          |
| southeast of Fort Lauderdale. (Sources: Sanchez de Medina Fermin,     |

| 1978 – At five o’clock in the morning three people on the balcony of  |
| their house south of the city of Sorrento, Italy watched a huge       |
| sphere low in the sky over the shoreline of the Mediterranean. It     |
| made an odd noise like radio static, and vanished. Less than three    |
| hours later at 7:20 GMT a silver triangle-shaped object crossed the   |
| sky at a high altitude flying from west to east over the town of      |
| Yarnton, Oxfordshire, England. At eight p.m. that evening an orange   |
| ovoid object left a dark mass near the ground for 30 minutes in the   |
| town of Tarranto, Italy. The two witnesses fled in terror. Radio      |
| interference was experienced at the same time. (Sources: Lumieres     |
