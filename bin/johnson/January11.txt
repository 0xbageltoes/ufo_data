| 1948 - Two U.S. Air Force transport pilots, Helton and Pargoe, flying |
| over Hartford, Connecticut in the afternoon observed a red            |
| disc-shaped object that flew at high speed, dove at a 45 degree       |
| angle, and had a blue center. The Air Force explained the report as a |
| daytime meteor. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case #     |

| 1963 - At 11:00 p.m. Antonio De Luca, a 43-year-old farmer in San     |
| Pietro Vernotico, Sardegna, Italy was awakened by restless farm       |
| animals and went out to calm them. Fifteen minutes later he saw a     |
| domed disc-shaped object land in a small square in the village, went  |
| towards it, and became paralyzed and unable to move when he got to    |
| within 10 meters of it. The translucent upper dome showed two dark    |
| figures moving about inside. Two minutes later the craft, 4.5 meters  |
| long and 1.5 meters high, ascended in the direction of Brindisi, and  |
| emitted a vertical beam of green light. (Sources: FSR,                |

| 1965 - The Seaside (Oregon) Signal on January 12, 1965 noted that     |
| Mrs. Paul Zimmerman Gearhart and her two sons saw a triangular UFO    |
| which came slowly out of the southeast and then "suddenly plunged     |
| into the sea some miles offshore" at Tillamook Head, Oregon. It left  |
| two trails of fire behind. (Source: Ivan T. Sanderson, Invisible      |

| 1966 - Beginning at 6:20 p.m. EST, police and citizens reported first |
| a brilliant light source, then later a bright egg-shaped object that  |
| hovered at low altitude over Wanaque Reservoir, New Jersey. It flew   |
| in circular patterns over the reservoir, occasionally making abrupt   |
| changes in altitude and other vertical maneuvers. Sightings by up to  |
| a hundred independent witnesses continued for more than an hour.      |

| 1966 - Six people were driving to a scout hall in Myerstown,          |
| Pennsylvania at 7:40 p.m. when the headlights of their car repeatedly |
| dimmed out and came back on. The radio also had heavy static. They    |
| proceeded to the scout hall without further incident. On the return   |
| trip, they saw a silent disc-shaped metallic UFO approach the car,    |
| swerve to the right, and parallel the car for several minutes. The    |
| glowing object hovered for five minutes over an open field while they |
| watched, then "got a tremendous burst of speed" and left nearly       |
| instantaneously towards the northwest. There was no electrical        |
| interference when the UFO was actually in view. (Sources: J. Allen    |

| 1967 - Mrs. Park McDaniel was outside her home during the day in      |
| Point Pleasant, West Virginia when she saw what she first took to be  |
| a small plane approaching. As it drew closer she saw that it was      |
| man-shaped and had wings. The creature swooped low over her house and |
| circled above a nearby building before going out of sight. (Sources:  |

| 1967 - That same night in Aveyron, Basses Pyrenees, France a farmer   |
| sighted a "shell" shaped object taking off from his farm. The man     |
| then proceeded to chase a ball of light in his car. The nocturnal     |
| light stayed 150 yards ahead of him until his engine died and his     |
| lights went out, when he then noticed a "saucer shaped" object        |
| descend. The saucer was slightly bigger than a Peugeot car, 9-12 feet |
| above the ground, and came down about 60 feet away. The top of the    |
| object had two transparent cupolas in each of which he could see a    |
| helmeted figure, human like and dressed in green and white coveralls. |
| He felt a wave of heat and a temporary sensation of paralysis. He     |
| watched a nearby road sign vibrating near the oval object. With a     |
| whistling sound the UFO rose to 50 meters altitude then dropped back  |
| again to near ground level. Becoming brilliantly yellow-white, it     |
| finally took off at tremendous speed. As it did so his lights came    |
| back on and he was able to start the car normally. Several days later |
| the witness experienced trouble sleeping, followed by some weeks of   |
| excessive sleepiness. The area had been the site of repeated UFO      |
| incidents for a year. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1969 - At 8:20 a.m. a weatherman at the Sibiu Meteorological Station  |
| in Romania tracked a disc-shaped object with a theodolite for 40      |
| seconds. It flew toward the northeast against the wind in a clear     |
| sky. (Source: Ion Hobana & Julien Weverbergh, UFOs from Behind the    |

| 1971 - At 2:50 a.m. a government official and three members of his    |
| family witnessed 16 ball-shaped objects as they flew over Kuusamo,    |
| Oulu province, Finland in an eschelon formation. They made no sound   |
| at all. (Sources: UFO Information Sweden, February 1971; Mrs. K.      |

| 1973 - At around 2:00 a.m. two people watched a mushroom-shaped       |
| object landed next to a barn in Fort Erie, Niagara County, Ontario,   |
| Canada. A very low flying maneuvering light also paced a car occupied |
| by a single eyewitness driving between Thorold and Stone, Niagara     |
| County, Ontario. (Source: Thorold News, January 11, 1973; J. Bernard  |

| 1976 - At 5:55 p.m. a 14-year-old boy was walking through the falling |
| snow to a friend’s house in Hamden, Connecticut when he saw a large   |
| glowing figure floating, near some sumac bushes 400 feet away. The    |
| figure was seen in profile from the waist up. There was no            |
| discernible face, and the back of the head was flat and corrugated.   |
| The glow from the head extended above the bushes that were 7-8 feet   |
| high, and extended about 9 inches from the body, with a less luminous |
| silvery outer glow that extended another 9” beyond that. The teen ran |
| to a friend’s house; then they got two other friends, and armed       |
| with a 22-caliber rifle he returned to the site. When they            |
| encountered the figure again one of them shone a flashlight on it,    |
| and it fell backwards behind a ridge. When the flashlight was pointed |
| away the figure rose up again, and remained in view for 3-4 seconds   |
| before slowly ducking back behind the ridge. When it came up a third  |
| time, he shot at it twice with the .22 aiming over its head; it       |
| slowly descended for the third and last time. One of the              |
| witnesses was unable to see the being. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted  |

| 1978 - At 9:35 p.m. a noisy disc-shaped object with a "rear spoiler"  |
| and headlights followed two 15-year-old teens in Mytchett, Surrey,    |

| 1979 - Nightly appearances of flying discs over the city of Sorocaba, |

| 1979 - On this night a short humanoid about 80 cm tall, wearing a     |

| 1998 - A juvenile sighted a domed disc-shaped UFO hovering over his   |
| house in Barnegat, New Jersey on this night. It had alternating green |
| and yellow lights around its rim. On top there was a glass dome and a |
| pilot-like figure apparently wearing some type of helmet could be     |
| seen inside. Frightened, he ran inside his house but could still see  |
