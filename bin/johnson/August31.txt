| white lights that "arrived from the sky and landed between two        |
| trees." It came down about 50 meters away. It was round with two      |
| black wheels and two small windows. Then the girls saw a tall man in  |
| black trousers and a black and brown shirt appear near the object;    |
| there was nothing unusual about his appearance. Later at the landing  |
| site was found a circle of pressed down grass. (Sources: Vicente-Juan |

| 1968 - Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina - Mrs. Emilia Larrude de  |
| Salazar was alone with her children at home this night when she heard |
| very loud knocking at the front door at around eight p.m. Without     |
| opening the door, she pulled back a curtain and saw a very tall       |
| man-like figure over two meters (6.6 feet) in height, that appeared   |
| to have no hair or ears, and with a large mouth and teeth. The being  |
| wore a tight fitting dull black outfit and had very long dangling     |
| arms. The being's eyes also shone with a brilliant light. The stunned |
| witness could not move and watched the strange figure move away       |
| backwards without taking his gaze off her. Emilia thought she could   |
| hear a muffled laugh coming from the figure. (Source: Albert S.       |

| 1972 - At ten o'clock in the morning a metallic oval-shaped UFO with  |
| a central dome moved over Route 128, a major beltway in the Boston    |
| metropolitan area, in Beverly, Massachusetts. It made a loud humming  |
| sound when it crossed over a bridge, and flew with an up-and-down     |
| motion. Many cars slowed and pulled over to look. the UFO carried a   |
| reddish-green light on top. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, case          |

| 1974 - On this night at Navegantes Beach, Santa Catarina State,       |
| Brazil Antonio De Azevedo, an angler, was on the beach with his wife  |
| when they saw a discoid object with multicolored lights land close    |
| beside them. It was shaped like "two plates with the rims stuck       |
| together." The vivid lights temporarily paralyzed the observers. From |
| the object emerged three "strange short beings wearing greenish       |
| spacesuits". Their faces "seemed to reflect the green color of their  |
| clothes." Conversing in a strange language, they quickly "examined"   |
| the angler and his wife, then seized his wife and abducted her,       |
| taking her into the object, which took off at incredible speed.       |

| 1977 - At shortly after midnight two college students, Rocco Cerullo, |
| and Michael Giovanelli, were walking from Sturno, Italy to Frigento   |
| when they saw three red lights symmetrically arranged in the midst of |
| some bushes overlooking the road, They also heard an intermittent     |
| "beep-beep" sound. Continuing on, near a quarry a mile from Sturno,   |
| they saw a figure over two meters tall that was wearing a silver,     |
| tight-fitting suit and helmet. Where the man's eyes should be there   |
| were two blinking orange lights. The witnesses fled back to Sturno    |
| where they found three friends, and all five returned by car. The     |
| group saw the strange being advancing and retreating with mechanical  |
| movements on a steep slope. He appeared to stand at an angle          |
| perpendicular to the slope. Some rocks were disturbed and rolled down |
| the slope. The abandoned quarry appeared to be illuminated as if by a |
| halo, and they became frightened and went back to Sturno, returning   |
| this time with two more witnesses. The tall humanoid was still there  |
| with emissions of intermittent light from its helmet. When one of     |
| them flashed a light at the figure, it emitted radio-like sounds.     |
| When it approached the car and the sounds ceased. It came as close as |
| 15 feet, and beckoned, as though wanting the witnesses to follow.     |
| Finally, at about 12:30 a.m. it emitted a blinding light from its     |
| helmet and disappeared. The outline of an object with portholes had   |
| been seen further down the slope. After the flash the group fled back |
| to the village. They returned again later that morning, and           |
| everything was gone. Trampled bushes were in evidence, and what       |
| looked like landing gear imprints were found in the quarry with three |
| holes arranged in an isosceles triangle. (Sources: David F. Webb &    |

| 1977 - In Mediania Alta Loiza, Puerto Rico at 8 p.m. two witnesses    |
| were sitting and chatting at the steps of their home when they        |
| suddenly noticed a disc-shaped craft flying above a nearby palm       |
| grove. The craft stopped to hover. It had a large white light on the  |
| bottom and a green and a blue flashing light, plus several brightly   |
| lit windows could be seen on its side. The object then shut off its   |
| lights and vanished. Later that night a woman had gone out in his     |
| yard to empty some cooking waste when she saw four little men wearing |
| silvery outfits standing by a water faucet. They seemed to have short |
| antennae like protrusions from their heads, large pointy ears, and    |
| were bald headed. They had small mouths and their necks were long and |
| thin. They all had their arms crossed in front of their chest. The    |
| woman screamed and ran back inside her house to alert the others, but |
| the little men had already gone when they came out. (Source: Albert   |

| 1978 - Two men, Srs. De Cesare and Martin, were driving in a truck at |
| two o'clock at night between San Juan and San Luis on Highway 147 in  |
| Argentina when they were circled closely by a group of UFOs. Their    |
| truck's engine stopped and they got out, throwing themselves to the   |
| ground and hiding among the roadside vegetation. The truck battery    |
| was totally discharged and the truck could not be restarted. At dawn  |
| dead goats and birds were found at the site. (Source: Jane Thomas,    |

| 1978 - A woman was sitting in her office on the tenth floor of an     |
| office building in London, England on the south bank of the Thames    |
| River at 7:00 p.m. when she glanced out a window and noticed an       |
| object moving at rooftop level. It was bright silver in color and was |
| shaped like an elongated parachute. At the bottom was a man           |
| protruding from its tip. The parachute or cone-shaped object moved    |
| horizontally, then stopped briefly above a building. It finally went  |
| behind the National Theater and was not seen again. (Source: Albert   |

| emerged from the larger object and reached at point in the sky over a |
| shed containing cars and machinery, and they just hung in the air for |
| awhile. (Source: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping Service, October 1978, |

| 1985 - A UFO, shape unknown, rose from the ground near US Highway 95  |
| in Laughlin, Nevada at 10:00 p.m. It directed beams of light on cars  |
| and a house, and radio interference was reported. (Source: Robert     |

| 1987 - At 10:55 p.m. a dark, domed disc-shaped UFO with a mast or     |
| antenna on top came down quickly over the high security Bangor        |
| submarine base housing, home of the Trident nuclear ballistic         |
| submarine fleet in Bangor, Washington and hovered over a playground.  |
| Two boys who were sons of military personnel, ages 8 and 10, were     |
| sitting on the swings and saw an occupant with a big head, big        |
| pointed "cat" ears, wrinkled skin, and a greenish complexion in an    |
| open hatch. It had a thin, spindly body, long webbed fingers and      |
| toes, and tabs or suction cups on the ends of the fingers and toes.   |
| It also had a wrinkled mouth "like an old grandma's." The boys        |
| estimated the being to be about six feet tall. It pointed a device    |
| that directed a beam of energy at the two boys on the swings, causing |
| the levitation of the metal swings. The boys fled quickly into the    |
| home of one of them and got his mother, who saw a row of lights in    |
| the sky as the UFO took off and flew away. Mrs. Springsteen, the      |
| mother of one of the boys, then had the boys draw separate sketches   |
| of both the UFO and the alien, which were remarkably similar.         |

| lights emerged from it. Finally, all UFOs shot away at high speed.    |
| U.S. Air Force jets arrived one hour later. (Source: Richard Hall,    |

| 1990 - At 2:00 a.m. Luis Javier Mango was on his way to his           |
| girlfriend's house in Barrio Supe, Berisso, Buenos Aires Province,    |
| Argentina riding on a friend's motorcycle, when he spotted about 100  |
| yards ahead of him two short figures that quickly crossed from the    |
| road ahead of him. Both were about one meter tall, wearing what       |
| appeared to be black hooded smocks tight around the waist, and maybe  |
| an unseen belt. He could not make out any facial features, arms, or   |
| legs. One figure followed the other, and both quickly disappeared     |
| from sight. Further inquires revealed additional witnesses, and the   |
| possibility of four to five additional humanoids of similar           |
| appearance that floated just above the ground. (Source: Albert S.     |

| 1990 - At 3:00 a.m. five small gray-colored humanoids, with large     |
| heads and huge bright eyes, walked in front of parked cars in Lake    |
| Cartagena, Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, and then down a road. They had     |
| large pointed ears, with three toes on each foot and three fingers on |
| each hand. Ten carloads of witnesses reportedly observed the five     |
| humanoids walking down the dirt road, heading in the direction of the |
| Laguna Cartagena. One of the witnesses, Miguel Figueroa, pursued the  |
| beings in his car, but as he approached them, their eyes 'lit up",    |
| and he was somehow prevented from getting any closer. When the light  |
| dissipated, Figueroa again gave chase, and managed to get a better    |
| look. He described the figures as skinny and gray, varying between    |
| three and four feet in height, with pear-shaped heads, large slanted  |
| eyes, long pointed ears, long arms, with three fingers on each hand   |
| and three toes on their feet. The beings got away by running down a   |
| ravine. The following day, there were reports of discs flying out     |
| over the Laguna Cartagena. Small footprints were found in the area.   |

| 1994 - At 9:30 p.m. six men around a campfire during a hunting trip   |
| in the woods near Mongo, Indiana saw a UFO behind some treetops. The  |
| domed disc-shaped object moved swiftly to a clearing, hovered for     |
| about 30 seconds, and quickly vanished from sight. They were able to  |
| take some photographs, which show an overexposure of a domed          |
| disc-shaped craft. (Sources: Francis L. Ridge, MUFON field            |

| 2002 - A couple, Sergey and Natasha, saw a light appear in window of  |
| their kitchen in Kearny, New Jersey at 11:30 p.m. The light came from |
| a brightly lit, disc-shaped object that was flying in the sky. It     |
| came out from behind a tree and crossed the part of the sky visible   |
| from their window. It was estimated to be larger than apassenger jet, |
| moving west or norhwest and was moving fast. They observed it for     |
| 10-15 seconds. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell, Filer's  |

| 2003 - At 10:30 p.m. a white flying ball of light, too large to be a  |
| plane or satellite, flew in a zigzag pattern, disappeared and         |
| re-appeared in the sky over Ryan, Iowa. It made no sound, and was     |
