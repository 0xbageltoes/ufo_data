| 1954 - In Monte Ortobene, Sardinia, Italy a motorcyclist saw a        |
| disc-shaped machine land near the road. He tried to turn too sharply  |
| and fell off his motocycle 50 meters away from it. A taxi driver      |
| stopped to observe the object, which gave off a soft whirring sound   |
| and soon took off. Farmers on the other side of the mountain saw it   |
| fly away. The disc, about 15 meters in diameter, was made of a        |
| silvery, rough metal. It supported a dome and showed several          |
| portholes. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of |
| Landings, p. 242).                                                    |

| 1957 - Truck driver Malvin Stevens, age 48, was driving to Memphis    |
| when, about 23 km northwest of Meridian, Mississippi he saw an object |
| that appeared to have two propellers at either end and a third one on |
| top. Getting out of his truck, he saw three little men about 1.30     |
| meters tall, wearing gray uniforms. They had "pasty white faces."     |
| They seemed friendly and willing to talk, but he was unable to        |
| understand their "chattering." "I stood there for what seemed like an |
| eternity." They got back into the machine and it took off straight    |
| up. There was no vehicle ignition interference. An eight-year-old     |
| girl from Honse, Mississippi independently reported a round object    |
| crossing the sky toward the south. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport  |
| to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 434).                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1998 - Fifteen people, including members of a Puerto Rican UFO        |
| investigation group, were on a night vigil on Monte Briton, Puerto    |
| Rico when one of the them began to feel ill. Seven members of the     |
| group then accompanied their ill friend down to the nearby road. As   |
| they reached the road they were stunned to see seven short gray       |
| humanoids staring at them. The beings had unusually large heads.      |
| Terrified, one of the group managed to blurt out over a cell phone    |
| what they were witnessing. The humanoids then apparently used         |
| telepathy to tell the group not to approach any closer. At the same   |
| time they all became paralyzed. After three minutes the beings walked |
| into the woods and disappeared and the seven were able to move again. |
