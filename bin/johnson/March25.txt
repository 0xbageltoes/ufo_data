| 1942 - At midnight U.S. Airman Sobinski and another Army Air Force    |
| crewman sighted a luminous orange object closely following their      |
| warplane over the Zuider Zee, North Holland, The Netherlands. They    |
| fired several rounds at the object. (Sources: Dominique Weinstein,    |

| 1954 - At 3:30 p.m. a U.S. Marine Corps pilot sighted a disc-shaped   |
| object flying at 3000 feet altitude over Cape Canaveral, Florida. The |
| UFO evaded being filmed by the warplane's gun camera. (Sources:       |

| 1958 - Two disc-shaped objects made fast maneuvers over the Woomera   |
| Missile Test Range at 10 p.m. in the desert of South Australia. They  |
| shimmered and changed colors as they flew. (Sources: Michael Hervey,  |

| 1960 - Making a noise like a gas turbine, a cylindrical UFO hovered   |
| over Vichel at around 3 p.m. in Puy-de-Dome department, France for    |
| more than five minutes, then shot away to the southeast, traveling    |
| sideways like an arrow. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database,    |

| 1966 - At 11:45 p.m. John King, age 22, working with the Bangor,      |
| Maine Police Department, suddenly saw above him a very bright object  |
| with a dark underside. He fired at it four times with his pistol,     |
| hearing the bullets hit a metal surface as the object flew off.       |
| (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, |

| 1967 - Three red discs hovered over Highway 10C in Joplin, Missouri   |
| in the predawn hours. They had windows with white light coming from   |
| them. The rose and flew toward the west, where they were joined by a  |
| fourth flying disc. (Source: APRO Bulletin, May-June 1967, p. 1).     |

| 1967 - An intensely luminous object woke up several residents in      |
| Iguala, Mexico at dawn. People in trains going to Acapulco and people |
| travelling by car saw the same phenomenon. The UFO came down to       |
| ground level giving off a blinding light, then took off. (Source:     |
| Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case      |

| 1971 - At 12:30 a.m. six soldiers stationed at a radar base at Monte  |
| Pani, Cabo De Creus, Spain were alerted by another soldier to a fiery |
| red, disc-shaped craft moving slowly over the area. The guard dogs    |
| began howling, and the men all watched as the UFO suddenly shot away  |
| at high speed. Moments later one of the soldiers screamed in pain     |
| from a sudden bright flash that seemed to come from the ocean nearby. |
| Meanwhile one of the soldiers released one of the guard dogs, a       |
| wolfhound with a fierce disposition, that was going crazy inside his  |
| cage. The dog ran immediately towards some nearby buildings and was   |
| followed closely by two of the men. The dog slowed down and began to  |
| grow menacingly, and one of the men felt heavy static in the air and  |
| his tongue began to itch. Both men then heard a loud noise coming     |
| from some nearby bushes. They saw a huge bulky figure that seemed to  |
| move clumsily among the brush. The men yelled at the figure to stop   |
| but it changed directions and began moving away quickly. Seconds      |
| later the men heard another noise and felt something heavy moving     |
| towards them. They fired their weapons in the direction of the noise  |
| and everything became silent. A search of the area the next day       |
| proved fruitless. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact        |

| 1971 - At 8:10 p.m. two girls riding ponies in Denton, England saw a  |
| bright orange cross in the sky emitting sparks. It followed them to   |
| the end of a road, then vanished with a bang. One of the ponies was   |
| spooked by the explosion. (Source: FSR, March 1972, p. 28).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - At 3:30 a.m. the witness was roused from sleep at his home in  |
| Soesterberg, Utrecht, The Netherlands by a loud humming sound and saw |
| a bright light from his window. Looking out, he saw a blinding white  |
| light surrounded by a fog, and thought that his car was on fire. He   |
| ran out, started his car, and began to move it. His next recollection |
| was that he found himself in a deserted moorland, and he stopped his  |
| car. Next, a "human like figure" ran past the car from the rear and   |
| then "suddenly...vanished." He got out of the car and saw a           |
| lens-shaped object on the ground to his left, about 100 feet wide,    |
| surrounded by a greenish glow. The green light came from windows in   |
| the craft, and three beams shining upward from it. In one of the      |
| windows he could see a human-like being. He approached on foot to     |
| within 10-12 feet, and he saw this figure motion to him to go back.   |
| The figure was between five foot and five foot four inches tall, and  |
| wore a tight fitting metallic looking coverall that had a belt with a |
| tube that ran to his collar. He had almond shaped eyes and seemed to  |
| be smiling. Behind him was some sort of instrument panel. Several     |
| other humanoid beings were seen standing behind other windows. Then   |
| the object then "jumped" from the ground, floated for 30 feet, and    |
| then "hurled away" with a scraping noise to the wouthwest. Traces     |
| were later found at the landing site. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, August |

| 1973 - Just after midnight Mr. Brechant, his 11-year-old son Patrice, |
| and his brother in law, Mr. Cosme, were driving in a car on a dark    |
| night on a UFO hunting expedition in Therines, Oise, France. They     |
| spotted a luminous ball in a field near Songeons only 250-300 meters  |
| away. The light diminished in intensity, and for a few seconds 4-6    |
| white luminous rectangles appeared next to it. Then next tried to     |
| drive around the field and observe the light from the rear. A second  |
| luminous ball was then seen in another field about 200 yards away.    |
| From its base emerged a triangular beam of light, with its base on    |
| the sphere and its apex pointing toward the left. Through a pair of   |
| binoculars Mr. Cosme could see two luminous silhouettes of humanoid   |
| beings, one behind the beam and one "sliding on it" towards the       |
| point, where it disappeared. They seemed to have elongated heads and  |
| enormously broad shoulders. He could not distinguish arms and legs,   |
| but the one behind the beam seemed to be carrying a sack on its left  |
| side. This silhouette gradually "evaporated," then the triangular     |
| beam went out, and next the luminous ball turned off. On their way    |
| home their car was pursued by a ball of yellow-white light, then      |
| yellowish green light at treetop level, which was first seen 300      |
| meters away and later approached to within 50 meters. (Sources: Alain |

| 1973 - At 11:00 p.m. a witness driving in Villevueve-sur-Lot,         |
| Lot-Garonne, France had a close encounter with a blazing ovoid object |
| on the road ahead. The diesel engine of the car stopped, and the      |
| driver was frozen with paralysis for over a minute. (Source: Larry    |

| 1974 - The witness was driving near Nogaro, Gers, France at 3:00 a.m. |
| when the car engine died. A 0.9 meter tall green-colored dwarf was    |
| seen by the side of the road, who had unusually long arms. The car    |
| engine restarted spontaneously after coasting past the dwarf creature |
| and the witness drove off. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, |

| Balagny-sur-Therain, Oise, France an sighted a reddish orange ovoid   |
| shaped object hovering ahead of his car. The object shot up rapidly   |
| into the sky in a vertical ascent when witness's car neared.          |

| 1981 - At 7:15 p.m. the crews of six boats saw a gray colored, 60     |
| meter tall cone-shaped UFO hovering one meter over the sea off the    |
| coast of Ayamonte, Huelva, Spain for 20 minutes. It then ascended     |
| vertically. The weather was clear at the time of the sighting.        |

| 1986 - A triangular object with rounded apexes approached and then    |
| hovered ahead of a car with three witnesses near Downingtown,         |
| Pensylvania at 12:30 a.m. It made no sound. The encounter lasted more |
| than four minutes. (Sources: MUFON UFO Journal, December 1986, p. 8;  |

| bottom of the object. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case |

| the entire sighting. They had many lights and flew off to the west,   |
