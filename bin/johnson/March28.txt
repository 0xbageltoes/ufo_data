| 1897 - The majority of the population of Omaha, Nebraska observed an  |
| object arriving from the southeast at 10:30 p.m. It looked like a     |
| huge light, flew northwestward slowly, came to low altitude. A crowd  |
| gathered at a street corner to watch it. (Source: Jacques Vallee,     |
| Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 181, citing the        |
| Chicago Times-Herald, March 30, 1897).                                |

| 1954 - After seeing mysterious lights descend over Sumner, Washington |
| five witnesses drove on this evening to an isolated area near some    |
| power lines and soon saw a white glowing ball of light wobbling and   |
| gliding down from the sky. It apparently went into a clump of nearby  |
| trees. The light then approached their vehicle, and moments later the |
| white globe of light passed in front of their car. At that same       |
| moment one of the witnesses saw a tall, well-built, broad-shouldered  |
| man standing at the same spot where the globe of light had been seen. |
| The figure was encased in a glowing white light. It suddenly          |
| disappeared in plain sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |
| Contact Database 1954, case # 1862, citing George Hunt Williamson,    |

| 1959 - On this night three witnesses encountered a seven foot tall    |
| luminous humanoid in a swampy area of Charles Mill Lake, Ohio. It     |
| appeared to be armless and had large, bright greenish eyes. It left   |
| tracks behind resembling those of the footgear worn by skin divers.   |

| 1965 - A gray ovoid object surrounded by a foggy mist followed a man  |
| walking down a road at 11:00 p.m. in Sutton Veny, England. It made a  |
| loud noise, and he felt a heavy atmospheric pressure as a result of   |
| the object's presence. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database,     |
| case 6679).                                                           |

| 1966 - The chief of police in Linden, Michigan saw red, blue, and     |
| white lights hover over his town, then speed away to the north. A     |
| truck driver In Niles, Michigan had a UFO with red, green and white   |
| lights pace his truck at two o'clock in the morning. When he blinked  |
| his headlights it veered away sharply and disappeared. Around 3 a.m.  |
| in Warren, Michigan police received over thirty phone calls from      |
| residents reporting lights in the sky zigzagging and diving into a    |
| swamp. (Sources: Mort Young, UFO Top Secret, pp. 64-65; NICAP UFO     |
| Investigator, April 1966, p. 8).                                      |

| 1966 - At eight o'clock in the evening in Fayetteville, Tennessee a   |
| man driving at a speed of about 60 mph suddenly encountered a large   |
| lighted object only one meter above the road on a hilltop. As it flew |
| off his car engine and headlights died. The light bulbs in the        |
| headlights had to be replaced. The object was oval shaped, seven      |
| meters long, dark gray in color, and showed about 30 lights along its |
| periphery. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of |
| Landings, case 739).                                                  |

| 1967 - In Conifer, Colorado at 12:30 a.m., D. Davis saw a shining     |
| light on a hill on the adjoining ranch. As witnesses drove over       |
| towards it to check it out the light went out. Two sisters who had    |
| stayed back at the ranch saw a man running down the hill. He vanished |
| near the corral. (Source: Ted Bloecher case files).                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - About the same time as the Colorado event (2:25 a.m. Eastern   |
| Time) a cone was seen hovering several feet over a field between Kent |
| and Munroe Falls, Ohio. Four or five beings, each under four-feet     |
| tall, stocky and with large heads emerged. They wore helmets and      |
| glowed an orange-red color. The witness's car hit one of them, and    |
| they saw an arm fly up w a "mitten" on the hand. The car had dents    |
| and scratches as a result of the collision. (Source: APRO Bulletin,   |
| March-April 1967, p. 1).                                              |

| 1973 - An object shaped like the Apollo space capsule (cone-shaped)   |
| made several large loops in the sky over Mount Bouquet, France at     |
| 4:00 p.m.. It flew off toward the east at 800 meters altitude.        |
| (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue no. 135).                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1975 - Two local investigators were driving around northeastern       |
| Pennsylvania in the hopes of catching a glimpse of a Bigfoot creature |
| that had been reported in the area. Around midnight they suddenly     |
| came upon two tall dark figures with red glowing eyes, who approached |
| their vehicle as if attempting to encircle them. The investigators    |
| snapped several photographs before fleeing the area. The pictures     |
| only vaguely show what appears to be the glowing eyes. (Source:       |
