| 1953 - Mrs. Deshais, a farmer's wife in Tonnerre, France saw two UFOs |
| at 9:30 p.m., a five-meter long elongated object and a sphere, both   |
| on the ground. There were three 1.5-meter (5 foot) tall men running   |
| toward the craft. They had oversized heads and wore helmets and       |
| boots. One entered the elongated object, which then spread some       |
| "wings" that made it look like a butterfly. It then shifted to a      |
| vertical position, resting on tripod landing gear, and took off at    |
| the same time as the spherical object into which the other two beings |
| had gone. Traces were found at the spot. (Sources: Phenomenes         |

| 1954 - On this morning in Obersuessbach, Bavaria, Germany between ten |
| and eleven a.m. a schoolteacher and four others sighted a flat        |
| circular, silver colored object that had a funny looking rim. The     |
| edge of the craft gave them the impression of fringe. It passed over  |
| at high speed. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight  |

| 1957 - At 8:06 p.m. four Portuguese F-84 fighter jets from Ota AFB on |
| a night training flight at 25,000 feet altitude between Cordoba and   |
| Coruche, Portugal sighted a large disc-shaped object. It was changing |
| color from green to yellow to blue. It also appeared to change size.  |
| Four small circles of light detached from a larger light. (Sources:   |

| 1964 - Shortly before 8:00 p.m. two teenagers in Glassboro, New       |
| Jersey were approached by two tall blond men, who had long hair and   |
| were barefoot. They asked the boys if they were interested in seeing  |
| a UFO. They walked to an apple orchard where they saw a red light     |
| land in the woods, and then take off. A burnt crater was found by the |
| NICAP investigator, with tripod indentations. The US Air Force was    |
| called and performed a perfunctory, sloppy investigation of the case, |
| but NICAP did a more thorough job. In addition to the burnt area and  |
| ground marks, some white powdery balls were found that were cold to   |
| the touch. After touching them the witnesses' hands retained numbness |
| for 24 hours. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, October 1964, p. 1;   |

| 1964 - That same evening two men had gone bow hunting in the forest   |
| near Cisco Grove, California. One of the men, Mr. D. Shrum, age 28,   |
| became lost and climbed a tree. It was then, at around 10:00 p.m.,    |
| that he noticed a domed object with a blinking light on top descend   |
| and land. Two short humanoid beings, wearing silvery white coveralls, |
| and a robot-looking creature got out and approached his location.     |
| They attempted to climb the tree after him in an apparent effort to   |
| capture him, but were unsuccessful. The robot released a vapor that   |
| drifted up to him and made him groggy, but before he lost             |
| consciousness he was able to tie himself to the tree trunk with his   |
| belt. He shot arrows at the robot, but the arrows just bounced off    |
| and caused no damage. The beings remained in the area, as far as he   |
| could tell, for most of the night. He stayed in the tree for eleven   |
| hours. (Sources: Coral E. & Jim Lorenzen, Flying Saucer Occupants, p. |

| 1965 - In an isolated area of the Green River Gorge, Washington State |
| a man named Salsbury encountered a landed white, disc-shaped craft    |
| from which a loud voice resembling a “loud speaker” originated. It    |
| told him not to be afraid, and to put down his gun. Once he did that, |
| an oval-shaped door opened under the lower part of the object, and a  |
| man came out walking slowly towards him. The man was described as six |
| feet tall, appearing to be about 30 years of age. He was dressed in a |
| one-piece tight-fitting suit made of some sort of metallic coating,   |
| resembling aluminum or chrome, but dull reflecting. He also wore a    |
| helmet that was very tight-fitting on his skull. On his side he       |
| carried an odd-looking sidearm with a barrel about the size of a      |
| regular flashlight, but instead of a hole in it, it had some sort of  |
| oval lens of a purplish-bluish color. He spoke to the witness in a    |
| very refined voice, telling him “Don’t be alarmed, I am not here to   |
| cause you any injury or harm.” The man told the witness that he was   |
| the captain of his craft, and invited him onboard for a brief tour.   |

| 1967 - At 5:10 a.m. police officer P. A. Andrade was on duty at City  |
| Hall in Valencia, Venezuela when he heard a humming noise and         |
| footsteps in the garage. He entered the garage and encountered a      |
| one-meter tall dwarf humanoid, with a big head and bulging, reddish   |
| glowing eyes. The being wore a silver colored, metallic-looking       |
| coverall. Andrade pointed his machine gun at the creature, but a      |
| voice from a hovering disc-shaped object said in Spanish that he      |
| should not harm the creature. The dwarf then tried to convince        |
| Andrade to come to "their world," adding it was "very distant and     |
| much larger than the Earth, and with many advantages for earthlings." |
| When Andrade declined, the creature flew back into the object, which  |
| left. (Sources: Jim & Coral Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, p. 82;  |

| 1969 - In Ngatea, New Zealand a UFO took off and flew away to the     |
| south at 7:00 p.m. A 17 meter circle of burnt brush was found at the  |
| landing site, with deep tripod indentations at the center. (Source:   |

| 1971 - An exceptional photograph of a disc-shaped object emerging     |
| from a lake was recorded by an official mapping aircraft of the Costa |
| Rican government at 08:25 am (EDT) while flying at 10,000 feet        |
| altitude over Lago de Cote, three miles north of the town of Arenal,  |
| Costa Rica at 10.583 degrees North and 84.916 degrees West. None of   |
| the flight crew or photographers saw the object at the time.          |

| 1973 - In Bavilliers, Belfort department, France at 6:50 p.m. smaller |
| UFOs cavorted over the top of a long cigar-shaped object in the sky.  |
| They vanished, and soon jet aircraft appeared apparently looking for  |
| the UFOs. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 10078,      |

| 1973 - At 11:10 p.m. a 30 meter in diameter disc-shaped object was    |
| observed in Louvroil, Nord department, France moving with a slow      |
| wobble. It shot two separate beams of light that converged on the     |
| ground. At the same time an ovoid object was seen at very low         |
| altitude in Maubeuge, Nord, France. Plants were found scorched on the |
| ground at the site. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, January          |

| 1974 - In Hierges, Nord, France dogs barked fiercely when a metallic  |
| domed disc-shaped object approached to within 70 meters only 15       |
| meters above the ground. It was dark with eight white rectangular     |
| windows illuminated from inside. A photograph was taken. When the     |
| house lights were switched off the object moved, then lifted off      |
| vertically.                                                  |

| 1992 - An oval-shaped object with a dome on top was seen at a low     |
| level in Ontario, Canada (precise location not given). There were red |
| and white light in an equatorial band around the object, running      |
| around the object in sequence like on a Christmas tree. A cloud of    |

| Cordenons, Fruili, Italy when they noticed a dazzling light emanating |
| intermittent flashes. This flash light was immediately followed by a  |
| strange whistling sound. After walking for about 100 meters the two   |
| boys next noticed a bizarre creature standing next to a light pole.   |
| It was described as short and white in color. The creature moved away |
| very rapidly in a strange, zigzagging motion and disappeared into a   |
| nearby wooded area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact      |

| resembling a bright greenish sphere encircled with red lights moving  |
| very fast over Taverny, Bessancourt, Ile-de-France, France. The       |
| object apparently landed, not far from the military base at Taverny,  |
| and several independent witnesses from separate locations saw two     |
| humanoids exit the object. The beings were described as "translucent" |
| and greenish in color with large black eyes. No legs were visible,    |
| and they seemed to move around strangely and very quickly. Two of the |
| witnesses were just 50-100 meters from the craft and beings, but were |
| too surprised and frightened to take any photos on their cellphones.  |
| The humanoids appeared to notice the witnesses, and re-entered the    |
| craft, which soon took off and disappeared. (Source: Albert S.        |
