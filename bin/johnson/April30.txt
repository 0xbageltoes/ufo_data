| followed an RAF Beaufighter from the 600th Squadron flying over       |
| Anzio, Italy during World War II. The two members of the crew         |
| reported that the light appeared to be doing evasive maneuvers.       |

| 1948 - At 10:15 a.m. at the Anacostia Naval Air Station on the        |
| Potomac River in Washington, D. C. a yellow sphere was spotted moving |

| aircraft. It flew in the opposite direction of the wind, and crossed  |
| over the no-fly zone over the nation's Capitol. (Source: Jan Aldrich  |

| witnesses in Savannah, Georgia reported seeing an upside-down,        |

| diameter. It hovered for a few seconds, then shot off toward the      |
| southeast. (Source: newspaper clipping, May 1, 1950; Michael Hitt,    |

| 1955 - In Travis County, Texas USAF Intelligence Officer Major L. J.  |
| Pagozalski sighted four black objects at 7:30 a.m. flying in a        |

| 1958 - A craft 10 meters in diameter came to rest on a hillside in El |
| Padul, Spain at dusk. It was sighted by two witnesses named Leyva and |

| 1962 - On this night Eugenio Siragusa, age 43, claimed to have met    |
| two men of normal height on Mount Mangre on the island of Sicily in   |
| Italy. They were clad in diver's suits, and had belts emitting an     |
| intermittent yellowish-green and blue light. They delivered to him a  |
| message of peace in Italian. The voice he heard had a metallic tone.  |
| A dazzling, 15 meter in diameter saucer-shaped craft was seen on the  |
| ground nearby. (Sources: Roberto Pinotti, Flying Saucers,             |

| 1964 - Gloria Biggs, her husband, and her mother observed a brown,    |
| dome-shaped object on a hilltop about 17 kilometers west of Baker,    |
| California on U. S. Highway 91. They lost sight of it for a moment,   |
| could not see it again, and found only a depression in the ground at  |
| the supposed landing site. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to       |

| 1968 - In Ipswich, Massachusetts a round gray object reflecting a     |
| flashing red light on its underside hovered low over some trees. It   |
| dropped behind the trees, then shot straight up, hovered, and         |
| streaked away at great speed. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:       |

| 1971 - At 7:45 p.m. Mr. Abrahamsson and his family saw a 10 meter     |
| wide domed disc with a transparent dome fly slowly toward the         |
| northwest at 60 kph in Asenhoga, Sweden. It had small portholes along |
| the side, and a green light. In Huskvarna, Sweden two married couples |
| also saw a large cigar-shaped object at the same time. (Sources: (1)  |

| 1973 - Four teenagers driving between Kinchela and Gladstone, New     |
| South Wales, Australia saw a bright yellow domed disc or domed-ovoid  |
| craft dive quickly toward the ground. They saw a glow from a field a  |
| mile from road that they presumed was the landing site. However, when |
| they drove towards it, their vehicle's headlights blacked out.        |

| 1974 - At shortly before 10:00 p.m. in Altamont, New York a young     |
| girl looked out a window of the nursing home where her mother worked  |
| and saw what looked like a car parked on a hillside. She told her     |
| mother who also looked out. They thought it might have been a car     |
| accident at first since they saw red lights. There appeared to be a   |
| golden glow coming from the object. The two left the building to get  |
| a closer look. Neighborhood dogs were barking and horses in a field   |
| were also making noise. As they got closer they could see a huge      |
| oval-shaped object resting on a road. It had a rounded window on top  |
| that emanated a golden glow, and the red lights were coming from the  |
| front and rear of the craft. They then noticed an indistinct          |
| "egg-shaped" figure moving around inside the craft. Another employee  |
| of the nursing home and the woman's husband also witnessed the object |
| when he came to pick them up. The UFO rose up into the sky and        |
| disappeared quickly into the dark sky. There was a large burned area  |
| 60 feet in diameter at the landing site. (Sources: Ted Bloecher,      |

| 1989 - On this night a family of nine was spending a night at an      |
| abandoned cemetery near Moscow, Russia by the river's shore, when a   |
| strong light suddenly woke them in the middle of the night. They      |
| watched as a large sphere landed on the riverbank. Two figures then   |
| appeared in front of the sphere. The lower part of their bodies were  |
| black and the upper parts were yellow in color. The sphere and the    |
| humanoids suddenly vanished in plain sight. (Source: Albert S.        |

| 1993 - At 2:05 a.m. a 30-year-old man went outside in Millville,      |
| Massachusetts and saw lights approach to a distance of 3,000 feet.    |
| The object was shaped like a triangular and had several red lights on |
| it. He waved his arm and saw a white light at the rear move to the    |
| center and beam directly into his eyes for a few seconds. The object  |
| continued in flight until it moved out of sight, at an estimated      |
| speed of 200 mph. It made no sound as it flew. (Sources: MUFON UFO    |
