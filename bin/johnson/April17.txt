| 1897 - At least a dozen farmers in Williamston, Michigan saw an       |
| object maneuver in the morning sky for an hour before it landed. A    |
| strange man nearly 3 meters (10 feet) tall, almost naked and          |
| suffering from the heat, was the pilot of the craft. "His talk, while |
| musical, seemed to be a repetition of bellowings". One farmer went    |
| near him and received a blow that broke his hip. (Source: Jacques     |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 184, citing    |

| 1950 - Three flat, metallic flying objects were sighted east of the   |
| Los Alamos AEC nuclear facility in New Mexico by 15 University of     |
| California scientists at 1:30 p.m. The sighting lasted for 20 minutes |
| and the UFO was viewed through a telescope. They estimated the size   |
| of the objects as approximately nine feet in diameter, and they flew  |
| faster than conventional aircraft. (Sources: Loren Gross, UFOs: A     |

| 1950 - At 8:15 p.m. EDT two teenagers were driving in a car in        |
| Springfield, Massachusetts when their vehicle was bussed by two       |
| glowing saucers. The objects then hopped about in the sky, ascend     |
| very fast and are gone from sight in about a minute. (Source: Loren   |

| 1952 - At 3:15 p.m. two military weather observers from the 9575 TSU  |
| at the Yuma Test Station in Yuma, Arizona watched a circular,         |
| flat-white craft with a short trail shoot across the sky from zenith  |
| to the horizon in 7 seconds (traveling at 13 degrees a second). It    |
| traveled so fast it could not be tracked with a theodolite. There was |
| a similar sighting at the same place the next day. (Sources: UNICAT,  |
| case 813, citing Loren Gross, UFOs: A History. 1952: January-May, p.  |

| 1952 - Two engineers watched several silent noctunal lights make      |
| erratic maneuvers and ninety-degree turns in the sky over Longmeadow, |
| Massachusetts at 8:30 p.m. The sighting lasted for 400 minutes.       |

| 1952 - Thirty minutes later two men in Westmont, Illinois, Mr. Harvey |
| and Mr. Hall, tracked an object traveling at a high rate of speed     |
| from the east to the north, vanishing just under the Ursa Minor       |
| constellation. No tail or exhaust were visible, nor were any signs of |
| propulsion visible. They watched the object through a pair of         |
| binoculars. (Source: Edward Sullivan, CSI--Los Angeles letter files,  |

| 1958 - Three hovering discs were observed all night long in Boa del   |
| Tigre, Argentina by several witnesses in the area. Mr. Cavalheiro, a  |
| railroad employee, and his station chief, J. Machado, wired the       |
| Tupancireta police and all saw the UFOs come to ground level about    |
| one kilometer away. At times the discs appeared to exchange signals.  |
| One of the them flew over the station itself, leaving a luminous      |
| trail and considerable heat. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to     |

| 1964 - At 7:22 a.m. local time, Airman Edward Lowe, a radar operator  |
| at the Fallon Air Force Station, Nevada picked up on his ground radar |
| unit two blips flying in stacked formation making rapid changes in    |
| altitude. They were first detected at 122 degrees, 60,000 feet, and   |
| at a range of 145 miles. Their motion was up and down. The length of  |
| the observation was 1 hour and 21 minutes, at which point the blips   |
| disappeared to the southeast. The official Air Force explanation was  |
| a mirage. (Source: Dan Wilson, www.nicap.org; Project Blue Book files |
| counted in official statistics; J. Allen Hynek case files).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1966 - Beginning at around 5:00 a.m., Portage County Deputy           |
| Sheriffs Dale Spaur and Wilbur Neff and two other officers chased a   |
| 40-foot diameter glowing disc or football shaped object from Ravenna, |
| Ohio to Atwater, Pennsylvania in the pre-dawn hours of this morning.  |
| It rose up out of the woods and stopped overhead. The UFO played      |
| cat-and-mouse with them in the pursuit: approaching, waiting for them |
| to catch up, then moving away. It beamed an intense light onto the    |
| road. They chased it for 90 minutes. It was last seen shooting        |
| straight up into the sky and out of sight. At about the same time and |
| in roughly the same vicinity, a man named George Buchert took a       |
| photograph of a double-saucer shaped object in Mantua, Ohio. Dale     |
| Spaur's psychological condition and professional career deteriorated  |
| in the months following his close encounter. This famous case was the |
| basis for the dramatic UFO chase in Steven Spielberg's movie Close    |
| Encounters of the Third Kind. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek, UNICAT, case  |

| 1966 - At 7:15 p.m. in Danvers, Massachusetts three witnesses watched |
| an elongated oval-shaped object with rotating white lights. It was    |
| estimated to be the same size as a passenger train car. It circled    |
| slowly in the sky before entering a localized cloud. At 7:30 p.m. in  |
| nearby Peabody, Massachusetts four witnesses reported seeing a bright |
| red glowing object flying in circular and zigzag patterns. It         |
| suddenly darted away at an incredible speed, faster than any          |
| aircraft. In Wakefield, Massachusetts at 8:30 p.m. a multicolored     |
| disc-shaped object shot off beams of white, then blue, and            |
| finally red light. It moved rapidly up-and-down and made a humming    |
| sound. It descended to just 50 feet above Lake Quanapowitt. (Source:  |

| 1967 - At 2:20 a.m. military witness Robert Harkinson in Vo Tanh,     |
| near Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), Vietnam saw five lluminated white |
| ovals that passed behind small scattered clouds. The formation        |
| fluctuated slightly, and then moved at five times the speed of a jet. |
| Five minutes later, several jets at high altitude were seen pursuing  |
| the same course as the UFOs. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO        |

| 1967 - At 2:15 a.m. Mr. & Mrs. Moseley of Worthing, West Sussex,      |
| England heard a loud humming noise, then saw a glowing oval like an   |
| "upturned saucer" (domed disc) that flew across the sky and behind a  |
| hill. Later, the sound was heard again and the UFO was again seen,    |
| moving sideways. (Sources: Charles Bowen, Flying Saucer Review,       |

| 1967 - A huge elliptical object with portholes was seen at 8:45 p.m.  |
| in New Haven, West Virginia. It had two light beams that were         |
| directed downward. Dogs howled and barked and a pony reacted to the   |
| beams of light, and there was also severe TV interference. There were |
| five independent reports of the close encounter, which lasted several |
| minutes.  (Sources:NICAP UFO Investigator, May-June 1967, p. 6; MUFON |

| 1967 - At 9:00 p.m. over Jefferson City, Missouri an Ozark Airlines   |
| airliner coming in for a landing had a dramatic encounter with a      |
| domed disc that was shaped like a World War I helmet, and was over    |
| 300 feet in diameter. Captain Metz exclaimed, "below me, it's huge!"  |
| It gave off an intense, bluish-white, cold light from the underside   |
| of the object. It was accompanied by two small objects the size of a  |
| DC-3 aircraft, that dropped down and made very fast maneuvers in      |
| various directions. The objects shot off to the north and also to the |
| east. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience, p. 96; Richard F. |

| 1976 - Two girls, the Melling sisters aged 12 and 9, saw a            |
| Mothman-like "bird-man" hovering in the sky over a church in Mawman,  |
| Cornwall, England. They drew a sketch of a man with wings, big        |
| pointed ears, and a large triangle in place of the nose and mouth. It |
| so frightened the entire family that they ended their vacation.       |

| 1990 - Two women driving in a wooded area of Upper Burrel Township,   |
| Pennsylvania at 10:30 p.m. first saw three bright lights ahead. They  |
| heard a "click" and then saw a sphere over a tree. Then a 40-foot     |
| long "bus" or cigar-shaped object with windows came over the tree.    |
| The women drove home and the object followed them, then it passed by, |
| glowing yellow and surrounded by mist. A U.S. defense plant is        |
| located nearby. (Sources: Dan Wright, MUFON UFO Journal, February     |

| 1993 - In Birmingham, England Peter Gregory had gotten out of bed at  |
| 2:30 a.m. to go to the bathroom when he noticed a light outside his   |
| landing window. He peered out and saw a glowing ball the size of a    |
| football. After five seconds it flew silently past the window and out |
| of sight. He fell back into a deep sleep and had a dream or vision.   |
| He saw himself in what appeared to be a control room inside an        |
| enormous object. He felt motion and heard a humming sound. The room   |
| was illuminated with an intense blue light that seemed to pulse with  |
| a hypnotic rhythm. He felt an inner state of euphoria. Without        |
| warning he suddenly then found himself inside an oval room with a     |
| console with lights in the center. On the left of the console was a   |
| cubicle about six feet high. Three humanoid figures were standing     |
| there and staring at a viewing screen, watching a transmission. The   |
| beings did not notice Gregory. He described them as human sized, with |
| piercing deep blue eyes, reddish brown hair, and heads circled by a   |
| broad silver band. He moved closer and noticed on a display screen    |
| something that read "Year 3600." He felt the message on the screen    |
| meant the destruction of human civilization. (Source: Albert S.       |

| white. The distance was estimated to be 600 feet, with an altitude    |
| higher than 300 feet. The speed of the object was slow, estimated to  |
| be around 30+ mph. There was a bright light on front when last seen.  |

| humanoid figure that he first mistook for a child. When he approached |
| the figure, intending to reprimand it for being out late, he received |
| a menacing look from the creature's fiery red eyes. The shocked       |
| policeman realized it was something other than a human child, and he  |
| quickly walked away from the area. Other local residents also         |
| reported seeing the same or a similar being. (Source: Albert S.       |

| 2007 - A circular craft with blue lights was seen by a 55-year-old    |
| man with an engineering background. At around 9:55 p.m. PST, the      |
| witness went out onto his front yard in Irvine, California for a      |
| smoke before bed. Normally he can see planes approaching Orange       |
| County Airport from the NNE and go past to the left                   |
| to land approximately 8-9 miles away, but this night was overcast so  |
| he could hear some, but not see them as they broke cloud cover once   |
| they had passed his house. While standing on the driveway, he saw     |
| some blue light aloft to the North moving back and forth, almost      |
| flittering like a moth. He first thought it was a police helicopter.  |
| What was unusual was that it was moving more in a quick,              |
| back-and-forth movement instead of what is usually a slow circle.     |
| Also, he could not see a strong searchlight or hear any engine sound. |
| It appeared that the object was 1-2 miles away. He thought this was   |
| odd, so he retrieved a pair of quality 20x binoculars from inside the |
| house. What he next saw raised the hair on the back of his neck,      |
| because the lights seemed to consist of a row of individual blue      |
| lights that first were traveling to the left. As the object reversed  |
| direction, the object appeared to be first an ellipse and then a full |
| circle; it had maybe 24-30 individual blue lights around the          |
| perimeter. It then traveled to the right and reversed the process,    |
| again forming a circle at the end of its travel when reversing        |
| direction. It traveled in each direction for 3-5 seconds. There were  |
| definitely no red/green port/starboard lights, only the blue          |
| perimeter lights and no strobe lights. He watched this object for 2-3 |
| minutes. It finally disappeared into the cloud cover. The man used to |
| fly small aircraft, so he was experienced with the shapes and types   |
| of various small aircraft. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO     |
