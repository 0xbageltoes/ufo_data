| 1952 - There are 20 UFO reports recorded for this day in the UFOCAT   |
| computer database. Outside of the continental United States there     |
| were sightings in Hawaii, Cuba, and Germany. Four occurred at         |
| military air bases and two more involved aircraft encounters with     |
| UFOs. |

| 1952 - At 10:15 p.m. a saucer-shaped object, light metallic in color, |
| flew over Heidelberg, Germany. It gave off shafts of white light,     |
| flew slowly, made a 90-degree turn, and climbed away fast. It was in  |
| sight for 4.5 minutes. A Project Blue Book "unknown." (Sources:       |

| 1956 - A green flash was seen in the sky over Brentwood, California   |
| and something crashed in an orchard there. When the unknown object    |
| passed over witnesses reported TV interference. The object gave off   |
| green sparks. Traces found in the orchard reportedly included a light |
| metal and cardboard impregnated with "unknown substances." (Sources:  |

| 1962 - A strange looking submarine-like object was seen at dawn off   |
| the coast of Avalon, California. It made no noise and left no wake as |
| it passed by a boat on the surface, and was described as having a     |
| very strange structure. Five occupants were seen on board. (Source:   |

| 1964 - At 10:30 p.m. a former Navy pilot named Lafferty and another   |
| man, both regarded as trustworthy, were at work in a field near Lake  |
| Chelan, Washington when they saw an intense light, cone-shaped,       |
| emitted from the ground. A similar light was observed in the sky when |
| the one on the ground was turned off, then the reverse took place:    |
| the cone-shaped light in the sky emitted a burst which was responded  |
| to by one from the ground. A round, aluminium-looking object, about   |
| 10 meters in diameter, with one red and one white light, then         |
| appeared and descended to ground level with a strong whistling sound  |
| similar to a small jet.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| High-pitched piercing voices, similar to those of children screaming  |
| while playing, were heard. After 40 minutes the craft took off.       |
| Before it did so, a jet aircraft flying at low altitude circled its   |
| position. On July 31st and August 1st, the densely wooded area where  |
| the light was seen was explored from a helicopter and on foot by      |
| Sheriff Nickell and a U. S. Air Force officer, but nothing was found. |

| 1966 - A photographer, Mr. Lacoste, and his wife, saw a red lighted   |
| object cross the sky in Montsoreau, France and appear to touch the    |
| ground. It then rose, hovered, and disappeared. The next day a wheat  |
| field was found flattened over a three meter wide area and covered    |
| with an oily substance. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: |
| A Century of Landings, case 783).                                     |

| 1968 - At 9:00 p.m. five young people, including Paul Sauve, age 20,  |
| and his sisters, Nicole, and Joanne, and Regent Leger and his brother |
| Dennis Leger, saw two circular objects with brilliant red halos over  |
| St.-Stanislas-de-Kostka, Quebec, Canada. One of the objects was seen  |
| to land about 1,000 feet away. When they went out with a flashlight   |
| to investigate they encountered a being about four feet tall, 50 feet |
| away from them, that terrified them so much that they ran back to the |
| house. It had a big head 'imbedded in the shoulders" without a neck,  |
| large round eyes, a flat nose, and a dark brown skin that was         |
| "wrinkled, scabby, and with bumps." When caught in the flashlight     |
| beam, it lifted a hand, which was very large, black, and rough, "like |
| the skin of a toad." It opened and closed its mouth, then it backed   |
| off toward the barn. After they were back in the house, it came up to |
| a window and knocked on the pane, making a mooing sound "like a cow." |
| Later they saw the object take off vertically. A 15-foot circle of    |
| crushed grain was found at the landing site. (Sources: David F. Webb  |

| 1968 - Near midnight a family of four in Upton, Quebec, Canada was    |
| awakened by their dog's barking. The father went out to investigate   |
| and encountered a sparkling, rotating cloud-like object in the yard   |
| that flew over him and went toward a nearby field. The object was     |
| dark on the bottom and luminous on top. He then saw cows in the field |
| being chased by four or five, three-foot tall entities with elongated |
| heads. When the object flew over, the humanoids disappeared. (Source: |

| 1971 - On this night in Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada two amateur  |
| astronomers reported that a triangle shaped UFO with multicolored     |
| lights flew by fast at a high altitude. It then made a 180 degree     |
| turn. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, August 1971, p. 3).            |

| 1975 - At six o'clock in the morning a radar installation in the      |
| mountains of Sierra Aitana, Spain had a close encounter with a dark   |
| gray football-shaped UFO. The object was described as the size of a   |
| Sabre jet (about 12 meters in length) with well defined edges. It was |
| metallic and appeared to have what looked like rivets. It was first   |
| seen at a distance of 150 meters, and moved horizontally toward the   |
| witnesses. It made a noise like an electric motor. (Source: UNICAT    |
| database, case 588, citing Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Lanib, July  |
| 1986).                                                                |

| 1976 - Fourteen boys and their camp counselor Mr. Leifer, from Camp   |
| Delaware, were hiking in the afternoon on Blueberry Mountain, three   |
| miles southwest of Winsted, Connecticut. At 3:45 p.m. the group was   |
| astonished to see a shiny, metallic domed disc hovering over their    |
| heads. It made a high-pitched whine like the feedback from a          |
| loudspeaker. They heard a second whine, accompanied by a high-speed   |
| vertical ascent, and within a few seconds the UFO had vanished by     |
| shooting straight up in the sky. (Source: International UFO Reporter, |
| November 1976, p. 6).                                                 |

| 1976 - Two women school teachers in their forties were attending an   |
| educational conference when they looked out the window of their ninth |
| floor hotel room at the Stouffers Waterfront Hotel in St. Louis,      |
| Missouri at 10:30 p.m. and saw a 100 foot in diameter disc-shaped     |
| craft fly right up to their window, stopping only about 50 feet away. |
| It had a revolving rim of lights like windows around its perimeter.   |
| It shot off after a few seconds, making a rapid ascent. It made no    |
| sound. (Source: Donald A. Johnson case files, report dated March 9,   |

| 1978 - A UFO traveling at 1200 mph was sighted over Two Rivers,       |
| Wisconsin at 11:57 p.m. What was described was the silhouette of      |
| either a cylinder or a sphere with a series of white, red, green,     |
| orange and blue colored lights, with one light at a time flashing     |
| from different positions. It flew to the northeast in an erratic      |
| flight path. At midnight the same or a similar object was seen and    |
| photographed over Two Rivers, Wisconsin and sightings continued in    |
| the next early morning hours over Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.    |

| 1989 - A domed disc-shaped object was seen over a high security       |
| rocket weapons depot in Kapustin Yar, Astrakhan, Russia at 11:20 p.m. |
| by four military witnesses, including the two main witnesses named    |
| Voloshin and Tishchayev. The UFO glowed a phosphorescent green. It    |
| circled the depot three times, accelerated and then stopped abruptly. |
| It shot away when a Soviet fighter jet appeared. (Sources: Paul       |

| 2002 - Three girls in Tahmoor, Queensland, Australia had decided to   |
| visit their rooftop as they had done the prior evening to watch for   |
| satellites. It was around 5:30 p.m. and dusk and the girls had a good |
| vantage point looking towards the east. They had a pair of binoculars |
| and a pair of walkie-talkies with them. The girls first noticed that  |
| a large orange light appeared approximately 15 degrees above the      |
| eastern horizon. The light had fluctuating colors of orange, yellow,  |
| white and pale blue. At fist they thought it was an arriving          |
| airplane, but then a second light appeared approximately 50 degrees   |
| south of the first anomaly, and about 10 degrees above the horizon.   |
| This much smaller anomaly began to perform some unusual maneuvers.    |
| From a stationary position it accelerated within a second to 5        |
| degrees closer to the ground. The first light then began to move      |
| slowly north. They lost sight of it as it moved behind a tree. Then a |
| third anomaly appeared in a valley. This third object appeared to     |
| have landed on the ground. The object was viewed through the          |
| binoculars and was described as a gray saucer with interchanging      |
| colors of green, red/orange, blue/purple and white rotating around    |
| the rim.                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| They were suddenly distracted by someone on their walkie-talkie       |
| saying, "Identify yourself." This was followed by some unusual voices |
| communicating in an unknown language. Around 6:30 p.m. the girls were |
| called down to have dinner, but at 8:30 p.m. they had gone back up on |
| the roof after dinner. To their surprise, the third ground-based      |
| object was still there. Unexpectedly, a yellow beam of light ascended |
| a few meters above the object and suddenly deviated its course        |
| towards the three girls. "It was like an orange, yellowy bright light |
| shining on us from far away." The light shone on them for a period of |
| about half a minute. At this point, it was not clear how it happened, |
| but one of the girls ended up on the ground. She became extremely     |
| hysterical and ran inside. The other two girls quickly followed her.  |
| That evening all three girls had stomach pains. One of them could not |
| sleep and did not go to school the next day. Another one of the girls |
| woke up the next morning with a nose bleed, and she mentioned that    |
| she had seen a strange small human like figure in her bedroom.        |

| 2002 - At 3:10 a.m. in a wooded area of Sedona, Arizona the witness   |
| saw what appeared to be a figure glowing all white, with black        |
| "straight" eyes, and with a black diagonal/diamond strip of           |
| "clothing" on top of its head. The man stood staring at the figure    |
| for 20 seconds and then left the area. Prior to seeing the figure, he |
| had seen lights in a large oval shaped pattern in the sky. (Source:   |
