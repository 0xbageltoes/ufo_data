| 1954 - At 11:00 a.m. in the morning Alberto Perego watched about 100  |
| white spots traveling in the sky over Rome, Italy with short white    |
| trails. They flew in formations of two, three, four, seven, and       |
| twelve for over a two hour period. They often would form              |
| lozenge-shaped formations of four objects ov V-shaped formations of   |
| seven. They executed curves, and an "angel hair" residue fell to the  |
| ground. On the same day several unknown radar blips were tracked over |
| England for a two hour period. (Sources: Alberto Perego, Flying       |

| 1957 - North of Seoul, South Korea a barrel-shaped object,            |
| bluish-white and luminous, was seen close to the ground in the        |
| morning. Its reflection could be seen in a pool of water. It rose and |
| vanished "like a light switched off." (Source: Jacques Vallee,        |

| 1957 - At a few minutes after midnight two men, Martinez and          |
| Gallegos, were driving near Santa Fe, New Mexico when an ovoid object |
| came down and hovered over their car, making a humming sound. After a |
| minute the UFO shot away. Both the car's clock and a wristwatch       |
| stopped. , 12:10 a.m. (Sources: Alexander Mebane, 1957 Saucer Wave in |

| 1957 - At 5:40 a.m. Richard Kehoe was driving near the beach in Playa |
| del Rey, California when his car engine stopped, and so did three     |
| other cars. He and the other witnesses got out of their cars and      |
| observed an egg-shaped object wrapped in "a blue haze" on the beach.  |
| The object seemed to be resting on two metal rings. Two men of below  |
| average height got out of the craft and asked them questions about    |
| their identity, what time it was, etc. They looked to be normal human |
| beings, although their skin was an olive complexion. They wore black  |
| leather pants, white belts, and light-coloured jerseys. They went     |
| back inside the craft, which left rapidly, and the cars could then be |
| started. (Sources: Coral & Jim Lorenzen, Encounters with UFO          |

| 1957 - A man in Lake County, Ohio reported to the U.S. Air Force that |
| at 6:30 a.m. he saw a UFO so bright that his eyes could not stand to  |
| look directly at it. It appeared to land on a nearby ridge, and then  |

| saw a strange object on the ground and four human-looking occupants,  |
| two men and two women who spoke in a language he thought sounded      |
| similar to German. They went back inside the craft in a manner the    |
| witness was not able to comprehend, because he saw no door. (Source:  |

| 1957 - At 6:00 p.m. in Boerne, Texas a civilian source reported to    |
| the U.S. Air Force that an oval object, about 5 meters long was seen  |
| hovering four meters above the ground. It was bright orange in color, |
| similar to glowing coals. The witness went to call his family, but    |
| the object had vanished when he returned. The case was listed as a    |
| Project Blue Book unidentified report. (Source: Jacques Vallee,       |

| 1957 - In Everittstown, New Jersey that same evening John Trasco saw  |
| a brilliant, egg-shaped object hovering in front of a barn. He was    |
| next confronted by a one-meter tall being with a putty-colored face   |
| and froglike eyes. He thought the dwarf said in broken English: "We   |
| are peaceful people, we only want your dog. " The little man, who was |
| dressed in a green uniform with shiny buttons, and wore what looked   |
| like a green tam-o-shanter cap with gloves that had shiny objects at  |
| the tips of each finger, fled when Mr. Trasco turned down his         |
| request. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of   |

| 1957 - At 8:30 p.m. two domed discs were sighted by two people        |
| driving on US highway 40 in New Castle, Delaware. The UFOs beamed     |
| down a light beam onto the highway, and the witnesses felt a          |
| vibration. One of the object came back three times, then went away    |
| quickly toward the east. (Source: Loren E. Gross, The Fifth Horseman  |

| 1957 - At 9:00 p.m. near Baskatong Lake, Quebec 180 km north of       |
| Ottawa Jacques Jacobson and three of his friends saw a bright,        |
| yellowish-white sphere that was hovering over a hilltop about four    |
| kilometers away. From the top and bottom of the object came cones of  |
| light that illuminated the countryside and the clouds. Radio          |
| reception was blocked throughout the observation, except for a very   |
| powerful signal at one shortwave wavelength, modulated, but not in    |
| Morse code. The object rose slowly toward the south. (Sources:        |

| 1957 - Twenty-eight year old Olden Moore, a plasterer, was driving    |
| home in Montville, Ohio at 11:30 p.m. when he suddenly noticed an     |
| object looking like a bright meteor split into two pieces, one of     |
| which went straight up. The other got larger while its color changed  |
| from bright white to blue-green. It hovered 60 meters above a field   |
| and came down to the ground making a soft whirring sound, landing 150 |
| meters away. After watching it for 15 minutes Moore walked up to the  |
| object, which he found to be shaped like a "covered dish" 15 meters   |
| in diameter and five meters high, with a cone on top about 3 meters   |
| tall. It was surrounded by haze or fog and pulsated slowly. Holes,    |
| footprints and radioactivity were later found at the site by Civil    |
| Defense Director Kenneth Locke. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to  |

| 1972 - During an evangelist church service in Paya, the Domican       |
| Republic, a UFO passed over the house where the service was being     |
| held and lit up everything inside, causing everyone to panick. A      |
| strange looking being entered the building, took the paster by the    |
| hand, and reportedly healed a woman of stomach cancer. She said that  |
| she felt a sensation of cold from the alien's touch. (Source: APRO    |

| 1973 - After a month of very heavy UFO activity in the Gulf States    |
| and throughout the eastern United States, a fisherman had a close     |
| encounter with an unidentified submerged object in the Pascagoula     |
| River in Mississippi sometime after 9:00 p.m. on this evening. It was |
| a bright metallic object submerged four to six feet below the surface |
| of the water, and emitted an amber beam 4-6 inches in diameter. It    |
| was moving at 4-6 knots, and the fisherman reported that he           |
| repeatedly had to beat it away from his boat with an oar. (Source:    |

| 1975 - A domed disc landed on three legs in Merxheim, France at 10:00 |
| p.m. The dome on the craft opened, and the head and shoulders of an   |
| occupant was seen partially emerging from it. The dome closed and the |
| UFO rose up into the air, then took off toward the east-southeast     |
| (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case #11518).              |

| 1982 - A brilliant round, intense light was seen in the sky over      |
| Lombard, Illinois at 3:45 p.m. There appeared to be very small        |
| airplanes circling this huge unmoving object. The witness, D. Keogh,  |
| called the nearby Adler Planetarium, but got the usual "run around."  |
| (Source: J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies files).                |

| 1988 - At 10:00 p.m. a silent, mysterious low-flying "airplane" and a |
| mushroom-shaped disc were sighted in Vittsjo, Sweden. Television      |
| interference and flashing lights were reported at the same time.      |

| 1989 - Early in the pre-dawn hours a significant and well-documented  |
| abduction case occurred on this day in Kansas, perhaps one of the     |
| most persuasive cases on the objective reality of the UFO abduction   |
| phenomenon to be reported. Two women, "Susan" and "Jennifer," were    |
| driving back from a business conference in Colorado to St. Louis,     |
| Missouri on this night. At 12:40 a.m. they had reached a point on     |
| Interstate I-70 near Goodland, Kansas when they started to notice     |
| some persistent, multicolored flashing lights that were maneuvering   |
| slowly over the fields alongside the highway. They stopped their      |
| vehicle several times to get a better look. On one of these occasions |
| a ball of light descended near their vehicle and hovered over a       |
| nearby field. They then saw a cone of soft, multicolored light        |
| directed towards the ground from under the object. They also noticed  |
| strange "black waves" resembling heat waves that were approaching     |
| their vehicle.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| They finally drove away experiencing several types of emotions and    |
| feelings. Upon reaching their destination they realized that,         |
| according to their time checks and their careful records of the       |
| amount of fuel their vehicle had consumed, they had lost track of two |
| hours of their time. Later, under hypnosis by clinical hypnotherapist |
| John Carpenter and interviewed separately, both of the witnesses      |
| recalled identical details from their abduction experience. One of    |
| them reported floating silently upwards towards a bright object       |
| overhead. She found herself in a circular room encircled by windows   |
| and panels and lit up by a diffuse pinkish white light. She           |
| encountered several five foot tall slender "Grey" humanoids with      |
| large hairless heads and tiny pointed chins. They had huge slanted    |
| dark eyes and white skin. The beings communicated with her using      |
| telepathy and seemed to glide across the floor gracefully. The        |
| witness saw no apparent clothing. She felt calm as one of the beings  |
| touched her forehead, she then watched her friend undergo some type   |
| of physical examination on a nearby table. The second woman recalled  |
| very similar details, also reporting seeing the first witness on an   |
| adjacent table. Their sketches of the humanoids were also very        |
| similar. One of the women reported experiencing a series of nose      |
| bleeds after the incident. (Sources: John S. Carpenter, MUFON UFO     |
