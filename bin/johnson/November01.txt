| 1461 - A fiery rod or cylinder hovered for 15 minutes over the town   |
| of Arras, Pas-de-Calais, France. It suddenly spiraled and twisted     |
| upward and was gone. (Sources: Data-Net Report, May 1970;             |

| 1948 - A UFO was tracked by U.S. Army radar at Goose Bay Base,        |
| Labrador, Canada on this day. It was moving at a high rate of speed,  |
| in excess of 600 mph. (Sources: Donald E. Keyhoe, Flying Saucers from |

| 1954 - At 6:30 a.m. Rosa Lotti Dainelli, age 40, was walking into     |
| Cennina, Toscana, Italy carrying her stockings and shoes, and a bunch |
| of carnations on her way to visit the cemetery, when she suddenly     |
| observed an object, shaped like double cone with a common base,       |
| resting vertically on a grassy space. Two small seats were visible    |
| inside the lower cone. From behind the object appeared two dwarfs,    |
| each about one meter tall, who approached her with friendly           |
| expressions, the older one laughing. They wore a sort of gray, tight  |
| fitting, one-piece coverall that covered their feet, short gray       |
| cloaks, and doublets with shiny buttons; on their heads were reddish  |
| helmets with what looked like leather earflaps. They were speaking in |
| an unintelligible language that sounded like Chinese, ‘liu, lai,      |
| loi.” Their mouths showed strong, rather protruding white teeth.      |
| Approaching Sr. Dainelli, they abruptly snatched the carnations from  |
| her and one of her stockings, wrapped the flowers in the stocking,    |
| and then threw them into the “spindle” shaped UFO. Then one of them   |
| took out a brown wrapped circular object, carrying it in the crook of |
| its arm. Lotti ran away, and when she looked back, after running 100  |
| yards, she saw that the little men were still there. A stonemason, R. |
| Berti, saw the object, which he described as a luminous “rocket,”     |
| rise up into the air. A deep hole in the ground was later found at    |
| the site. (Sources: Sergio Conti, FSR, September-October 1972, p. 11; |

| 1954 - At 3:30 p.m. a farmer in Modigliana, Emilia-Romagna, Italy     |
| named Adelmo Monti saw a “dark spot” just over the ground, about 500  |
| meters away from him. The object had an apparent diameter of one      |
| meter and was surrounded by a number of small cylinders. Monti        |
| observed a “very tiny, hard to make out figure” to one side of the    |
| object. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of  |

| 1954 - A fisherman, G. Seenza, was on the Dese River in Mogliano      |
| Veneto, Treviso, Italy on this foggy night placing nets in the water. |
| He noticed a greenish light through the thick fog. Because there were |
| no houses in the area, Sr. Seenza began shouting in order to make     |
| contact with the people he thought were associated with the light.    |
| When he got no reply he decided to get closer. Seenza sighted a       |
| mushroom-shaped object that had landed on the river bank. The object  |
| was emitting a green light and around it there were several           |
| small stocky beings. They were moving back and forth in an erratic    |
| manner. Seenza shouted again and made gestures so as to be noticed,   |
| but was unsuccessful. Then suddenly, the object silently took off     |
| straight up. Some beams of silver colored light emanated from the     |
| object’s “stem” illuminating the surrounding area. The object         |
| made aerial maneuvers and then disappeared. (Source: Albert S.        |

| 1954 - At 10:40 p.m. taxi driver Gonzalo Rubinos Ramos' cab broke     |
| down in Ordenes, La Coruna, Spain. He saw a strange white spherical   |
| object take off, estimated to be six meters in diameter, while at the |
| same time all the dogs in the area were barking. Other witnesses      |
| nearby reported seeing the UFO, estimated to have been 400 meters     |
| away. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Catalogue of 200 Type-I  |

| 1954 - At 11:45 p.m. a red ovoid object buzzed a man on a motorcycle  |
| at a low altitude on a road near Bucine, Tuscany, Italy. It had a     |
| blinding light that illuminated the area. (Source: Maurizio Verga,    |

| 1955 - An 800 foot long cigar-shaped object was seen during the       |
| middle of the day over the Mojave Desert in California and then a     |
| second object, disc shaped, appeared suddenly and joined it quickly.  |

| 1957 - On this morning in 1957 a South African Air Force Sabre jet pilot     |
| pursued a high altitude, hovreing craft over Johannesburg, South      |

| 1966 - A huge, circular object with two tiers of four windows that    |
| were emitting a bright yellowish-green light, was watched over        |
| Newfields, New Hampshire at 8:00 p.m. by a family of three. A very    |
| intense beam of light from the UFO knocked the mother down. She       |
| reported having an eye inflamation and pain as a result, which caused |
| her to make a visit to her doctor. (Source: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr.,   |

| 1968 - At 4:00 a.m. a Filipino farmer north of Baras in Rizal         |
| province, the Philippines saw a red light come down and land 100      |
| yards away from him, making a hissing sound like an arc welder. He    |
| approached with a flashlight and encountered a white object, the size |
| of a VW Beetle, on small wheels. It had six big exhaust tubes in the  |
| rear and a transparent canopy. There were two "ordinary Caucasian"    |
| looking pilots in the craft wearing white coveralls or flightsuits,   |
| with earphones on their heads.. The craft took off vertically without |
| making as much noise. (Sources: Colonel Aderito De Leon, APRO         |

| 1968 - A second encounter in the Philippines occurred two hours later |
| when another farmer walking to Baras felt something land behind him.  |
| He apparently witnessed the same craft, with the wheels, because his  |
| description of the object and its occupants was identical. He ran to  |
| the mayor of the town and reported his close encounter. (Sources:     |

| 1968 - A third close encounter of the third kind in the Philippines   |
| was made that same day by another farmer, bicycling near the site of  |
| the first reported incident at 11:00 a.m. He saw the same "strange    |
| car" downhill from his location. As he coasted down toward the object |
| on his bicycle he saw two men; one was outside the object "looking    |
| around" and was "very tall" and looked to be a normal Caucasian, the  |
| other man was inside the object. Both wore white coveralls and what   |
| appeared to be earphones. He stopped 20 yards past the object, looked |
| back, and saw that the man outside the object was watching him. He    |
| couldn't decide whether he should go back to speak to him, but while  |
| he was thinking this the man got into his vehicle. With a roar, the   |
| craft moved up the hill and then ascended silently into the sky.      |

| 1968 - A large orange, domed disc-shaped object approached a car with |
| five soldiers in Los Monegros, Zaragoza, Spain at 4:30 a.m. and then  |
| landed nearby. The car engine and radio stopped running and all       |
| watches stopped. After the UFO took off and car and watches operated  |
| normally again. (Sources: Antonio Ribera, FSR, January 1969, p. 34;   |

|                                                                       |
| 1968 - In the early morning, pre-dawn hours a French physician living |
| in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department of southern France, "Doctor |
| X", was awakened by the sound of his 14-month-old son crying. His son |
| was standing in his crib pointing at the window. Behind the shutter a |
| very bright light could be seen moving. After the child had gone back |
| to sleep, the doctor went out onto the balcony of his house, located  |
| on a hillside, and he saw two glowing discs in the sky, silvery white |
| on top and bright red underneath. Each had a tall antenna on top and  |
| one on either side, and they were directing a narrow beam of white    |
| light towards the ground below.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| The two objects slowly drew closer and merged into a single object,   |
| about 200 feet in diameter and 50 feet thick. The single object then  |
| approached the doctor, and tilted 90 degrees so that the beam of      |
| light struck him. He then heard a loud bang, and the object           |
| evaporated into a whitish cloud that dissipated with the wind. A thin |
| thread of light rose high into the sky before vanishing as a white    |
| dot, and exploding like a firework.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| A few days earlier the doctor had accidentally cut a vein in his leg  |
| while chopping wood, and a decade earlier he had stepped on a         |
| landmine in Algeria, leaving his right side partially paralyzed.      |
| After this close encounter incident he found that the swelling and    |
| pain from his leg injury had vanished, and the chronic after effects  |
| of the injuries he had sustained in the Algerian war improved         |
| dramatically in the days that followed.                               |
|                                                                       |
| Also a few days after the encounter, the doctor and his son each      |
| developed a strange, reddish, triangular mark on the abdomen, and     |
| this mark recurred in successive years. Strange paranormal phenomena  |
| began to take place around the doctor and his family, including       |
| poltergeist activity and unexplained disturbances in electrical       |
| circuits. The doctor began to have mysterious meetings with a         |
| strange, nameless man he called "Mr. Bied." He would hear a whistling |
| noise inside his head and would feel guided to walk or drive to a     |
| certain location where he would meet the man, who would discuss his   |
| UFO experience and paranormal matters. Mr. Bied caused him to         |
| experience apparent teleportation and time travel, including a        |
| distressing episode with alternative landscapes on a road that he     |
| knows does not exist. The stranger also once visited the doctor at    |
| his home accompanied by a three foot tall humanoid with mummified     |
| skin, which remained motionless while its eyes darted quickly around  |
| the room. The doctor experienced uncontrolled levitation on at least  |
| one occasion. (Source: John Wallace Spencer, World Atlas of UFOs, p.  |

| 1980 - A deputy sheriff on routine patrol in Lucky Point, Indiana had |
| stopped to rest at 9:00 p.m., and was standing next to his police     |
| patrol car when he noticed a large, black, triangular-shaped craft    |
| hovering at an angle about 200 feet away. The craft had large         |
| rectangular windows on its side, and five humanoids could be seen     |
| standing inside from the waist up. The beings were "Greys", having    |
| gray-colored skin with large heads, slim necks and slim bodies. No    |
| other features could be seen. As the police officer stood watching in |
| amazement he received a telepathic message. The message asked him,    |
| "Why do you hate the Iranians?" He thought to himself that he did not |
| hate anybody. At that moment one of the figures turned and faced the  |
| others, and as this happened the object suddenly shot straight up and |
| disappeared at high speed. (Sources: Francis L Ridge, Regional        |

| 1995 - Rafael Tapia was returning home on his bicycle in San Pablo de |
| las Nazas, Jalisco, Mexico at 11:50 p.m. and as he got near a         |
| neighbor's house heobserved, not more than 10 meters away, a bizarre  |
| creature. At first, because of the darkness Tapia thought it was a    |
| dog, but as he passed to within 3 meters of the creature he realized  |
| that it was a very short, man-like figure with huge glowing red eyes. |
| The strange figure turned around and stared at him. It then scrambled |
| down a grassy embankment and disappeared from sight. Stunned, Rafael  |
| ran to where the creature had gone, and flung a couple of rocks in    |
| its direction. Then he reboarded his bicycle and pedalled home. The   |
| creature wore a type of tight-fitting, high-collared coverall.        |
| Earlier that same day another witness had seen an elongated metallic  |
| object that flew at a low altitude and then descended into a field.   |
| UFO investigators recorded strange magnetic disturbances in the area. |
| Five days earlier, on October 27, a house under construction in the   |

| location. The object hovered about three meters above the water on    |
| the other side of the river. It was round with small windows around   |
| its circumference. Behind the windows they could see two figures      |
| wearing helmets with antennas on the right sides of the helmets. The  |
| craft hovered over the river for four minutes, and then disappeared   |
| from sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1999 Humanoid Contact         |
