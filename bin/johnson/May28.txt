| 1956 - A blue glowing disc flying on edge pursued a car in Kwekwe,    |
| Zimbabwe in what was then Rhodesia. It made instantaneous maneuvers,  |
| and illuminated a farm as it flew over. (Source: Cynthia Hind, UFO    |

| 1961 - A luminous disc was seen by airmen circling below at sea level |
| northeast of Florianopolis, Brazil on this night. It climbed to the   |
| altitude of the DC-3 and circled the plane, then paced the aircraft   |
| as it flew to the northeast. (Source: APRO Bulletin, November 1961).  |

| 1965 - The crew of an Ansett-ANA DC-6B airliner flying over the       |
| Bougainville Reef between Brisbane, Queensland, Australia enroute     |
| to Port Moresby, New Guinea called Townsville Air Traffic Control at  |
| 3:25 a.m., and said they were being paced by a UFO. They took several |
| photographs of the spherical, slightly oblate object, which was flat  |
| on the top and bottom. The aerial encounter lasted 10-15 minutes,     |
| resulting in several photographs. The film was conficated by the      |
| Australian military and never returned. The audio tapes of the        |
| conversation with air traffic controllers were also confiscated and   |
| the operator on duty, William Orr, was told to "shut his mouth" about |
| the incident or face dismissal. (Sources: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr.,     |

| 1967 - A glowing object flew over Murray Bridge, South Australia at   |
| two o'clock in the morning. It flew to the west at a speed under 100  |
| mph. (Source: UFO Research South Australia, report # SA67005).        |

| 1967 - A bright reddish orange domed ovoid objecty swooped over the   |
| town of Mankato, Minnesota at 12:30 a.m. It made a roaring "swoosh"   |
| sound as it did. (Source: NICAP files, report dated May 30, 1967).    |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 12:01 p.m. a cigar-shaped object with windows and           |
| protrusions flew over Wallingford, Connecticut. With clouds as a      |
| reference in the background, it was estimated to be about 3000 feet   |
| distant, and moved at an estimated speed of 500 mph as in went behind |
| some clouds. (Source: NICAP files, report dated June 5, 1967).        |

| 1968 - At 10:15 three objects were spotted suddenly descending over   |
| Roxbury, Massachusetts making an intermittent roaring sound. The      |
| closest object was oval shaped with a blue glowing square on its      |
| underside. A buzzing sound vibrated the witness's eardrums and was    |
| felt in the stomach. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler case files, report    |
| dated June 14, 1968).                                                 |

| 1969 - At two a.m. farmers in Caltowie, South Australia watched as a  |
| bluish white object followed two young men home. It started to        |
| revolve making a whining noise, then a high-pitched beeping. Four     |
| legs protruded from the bottom of the object. A second orange UFO     |
| appeared. Ground traces of a landing were found in a nearby field,    |
| and some soil appeared to have been taken. (Source: Michael Hervey,   |
| UFOs Over the Southern Hemisphere, p. 184).                           |

| 1974 - A 50-75 foot diameter UFO landed on a nearby hill on this      |
| night in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The witnesses were too afraid to    |
| approach it. After awhile it lifted off, rotated on its central axis, |
| and moved away rapidly. A grayish residue was found at the landing    |
| site. (Source: J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies case files).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - At 3:10 a.m. a large dark box-shaped object shot up from the   |
| ground near a utility pole in St. Roch, France lighting up the area.  |
| Traces were found at the site. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,        |
| October 1978).                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| 1993 - Near Victoria, Entre Rios province, Argentina four witnesses   |
| noticed a bright light floating very close to the ground at 10:20     |
| p.m. within a wooded area. It rose above the treetops and illuminated |
| the ground with a powerful beam of light. Its movements were erratic  |
| and sometimes slow, and it soon disappeared from sight. After ten     |
| minutes another four witnesses arrived and the craft returned, this   |
| time closer to their position. It seemed to float about five meters   |
| above the ground. Using binoculars they were able to see several very |
| tall human-like silhouettes, about 2.7 meters in height, moving       |
| around on the ground in front of the light. A similar object was seen |
| the next day in the same woods. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |
| Contact Database 1993, citing Raul Oscar Fantini).                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1999 - At 11:30 in the morning a metallic triangular shaped craft was |
| videotaped flying at a high speed only six feet above the rolling     |
| hills near Wessenden Reservoir in England. It disappeared over the    |
| crest of a hill. (Source: George Filer, MUFON UFO Journal, July 1999, |
| p. 15).                                                               |

| 2003 - A fast moving "shimmering shadow" with orange triangular       |
| leading edges moved through the sky over Boise, Idaho at 11:00 p.m.   |
| It shimmered as if emitting a great deal of heat. It flew in a        |
| straight line and crossed the sky in 8 to 10 seconds without making a |
| sound. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,       |
| Seattle).                                                             |
