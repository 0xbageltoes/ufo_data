| 1954 - At 9:30 p.m. Georgette Mongot and Mr. and Mrs. Alexis          |
| Lartillot in Froncles, France observed a large, bright object         |
| oscillate, then land. It changed color and was lost to sight behind   |
| some trees. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia, p. 212;    |

| 1954 - At "Le Grand Tertre" in St-Amand-Montrond, France Mr. Mercier, |
| a vintner, observed that someone had stolen grapes from his vineyard. |
| He decided to stay late and catch the "robbers." Around 10:30 p.m. he |
| was amazed when he saw a luminous mass descend from the sky about 50  |
| meters away, and found himself paralyzed while three figures emerged  |
| from the light and moved about. He lost consciousness. When he came   |
| to his senses, everything had vanished. (Sources: Aime Michel, A      |

| 1954 - At 11:10 p.m. near St. Nicolas de Redon, France two railroad   |
| engineers, Emile Gerard, age 49, and Victor Paroux, age 40, were      |
| bringing a locomotive from Nantes to Auray. When they reached "La     |
| Butte Rouge" they saw a dark object take off with a purple glow and   |
| follow them for 10-15 seconds before veering off. Mr. Paroux was so   |
| agitated he had to see a doctor. (Source: Le Parisien, September 30,  |

| 1954 - At 11:45 p.m. in Albias, Tarn-Garonne department, France a     |
| three meter wide disc was seen resting on legs in a field by a single |
| witness. Three beings were seen outside the craft for two minutes.    |
| When they reboarded the UFO rose vertically up into the air, then     |
| shot away horizontally at high speed. (Source: Larry Hatch, U         |

| 1966 - A witness with the last name of Clarke reported to the U.S.    |
| Air Force that three round, oval-shaped, aluminum-colored objects     |
| with rotating rings around them appeared over Wilmington, Ohio at     |
| 3:38 p.m. Two of the objects remained stationary while the third one  |
| varied its altitude, and rose vertically. The sighting lasted 90      |
| seconds. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).       |

| 1969 - On this night in Izmir, Turkey eleven people watched a black,  |
| segmented rectangular object fly toward the northeast over the bay.   |
| The flight path of the UFO curved upwards, and it made no sound as it |
| flew. (Source: Claude Poher, Etudes Statistiques Portant sur 1000     |

| 1970 - Nocturnal lights and ovoid objects circled and zigzagged in    |
| the sky over the town of Reze, France in Loire-Atlantique department  |
| at 8:30 p.m. A triangular object flew to the west, then turned back   |
| and shot away toward the east. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer       |
| database, case #9173, citing LDLN Lecteurs).                          |

| 1970 - Two hours later in Warminster, Wiltshire, England a man        |
| sighted an eleven-foot long beetle-shaped object that had landed on   |
| tripod landing gear by an old Roman road. Ground marks and metal      |
| fragments were found at the site. (Source: Eileen Buckle, FSR Case    |
| Histories, February 1971, p. 4).                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - At 3:40 a.m. in Santa Isabel, Cordoba province, Argentina      |
| truck driver Luftolde Rodriguez was making a delivery to the Ika      |
| Renault plant four and a half hours after another UFO close           |
| encounter, and he had driven into the northeast sector of the plant   |
| to unload. He was driving a 1957 Dodge dumptruck. Having unloaded his |
| cargo, he was just starting off when he noticed the whole area light  |
| up. He heard someone approaching from behind, and when he looked out  |
| the right window he saw, in profile, the torso of a very tall figure  |
| pass close by. Only when he could see this figure through the         |
| windshield could Rodriguez see its head. At that point the being      |
| stopped, did a right about turn stiffly, and looked straight at him.  |
| He did another right turn, and walked slowly and awkwardly ahead,     |
| finally crossing diagonally to the left and disappearing behind some  |
| pallets. He had been in view from 60 to 90 seconds. The entity was    |
| dressed in a tight one-piece coverall of luminescent blue-green       |
| color, identical to the one seen by Moreno four hours earlier. He was |
| over 2.5 meters tall and his head was bald, with the skull flattened  |
| at the rear. He hadlong, narrow pointed ears. His eyes were numerous  |
| circles with no eyelids or eyebrows. The nose was straight and the    |
| mouth rudimentary. His complexion was very white. Legs and arms were  |
| extremely long, and he did not bend his legs as he walked. In his     |
| left hand he held a small white sphere the size of a billiard ball.   |
| He had on a wide silver belt and large, square silver boots.          |
|                                                                       |
| A number of physical effects occurred simultaneous with the being's   |
| appearance: the truck's engine and lights died, and these effects     |
| lasted until it was 25-30 meters distant. Rodriguez was immobilized   |
| in his seat. Although he could follow the movement of the figure with |
| his eyes, he could not move either his arms or legs. He heard a       |
| humming noise, similar to bees, while the figure was in view. He sat  |
| there for several minutes after the figure vanished, not knowing what |
| to do. Finally, some other workers approached to ask what was wrong   |
| and he told them what he'd seen. A search disclosed no sign of the    |
| intruder, nor where there any traces. Subsequent inquiries disclosed  |
| there were a number of independent UFO observations in the area       |
| during the evening of September 27-28. (Sources: Oscar A Uriondo, p.  |

| 1974 - A huge glowing disc, the size of a Boeing 747, was sighted     |
| flying to the south on a wavy trajectory east of Eugene, Oregon       |
| during the day. It was clearly outlined in the sky. (Source: NICAP    |

| 1978 - Between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. a 40-year-old woman in the          |
| Izmailovskiy region of Russia noticed a short humanoid figure         |
| standing on the balcony of her house and facing the window. She       |
| stared in fascination at the figure, which she described as having a  |
| disproportionately large, wide head with definite Asian features. It  |
| had narrow pale lips, a small chin, and snub nose with large visible  |
| nostrils. The eyes were of normal size but slanted. Somehow the       |
| creature gave the witness an overall impression of curiosity and      |
| benevolence while it stared directly at her. She could not see any    |
| ears and had something dark covering its head. The color of its face  |
| was brilliant yellow. The creature moved its head from side to side   |
| and then vanished. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| Springs, Kansas from Interstate 70, in Wyandotte county. (Source:     |

| 1978 - At two o'clock in the morning two twenty-year-old female steel |
| company employees were driving in a residential area in Omaha,        |
| Nebraska when they drove by a dark, cone-shaped UFO with three white  |
| rotating lights on the underside. The tape casette in the VW car's    |
| tape player erased as the car drove close to the object, but other    |
| casette tapes in a cardboard box on a car seat were undamaged.        |

| 1980 - At 2:45 in the afternoon two bright yellow UFOs shaped like    |
| hamburger buns spproached to within 200 feet of an airplane flying    |
| over Boca Raton, Florida near Pompano Beach. The UFOs circled the     |
| plance 8-10 times maintaining a distance of approximately 1500 feet.  |

| 1988 - A 28-year-old couple driving in Atherton, Indiana saw          |
| intensely bright lights approach their car and move overhead. The     |
| lights turned out to be from a triangular shaped object. When         |
| directly overhead the automobile's electrical system failed, and a    |
| clock and their wristwatches lost three minutes. There was also a     |
| loud humming sound. Both witnesses were very tired for the next       |
| couple of days. (Source: field investigator Mike Palmiter, MUFON      |

| 1989 - At around 10 p.m. ten calls were received by the Coast Guard   |
| and KTIL radio reporting small explosions and red and white flying    |
| lights in Tillamook county, Oregon. Sightings occurred in Oceanside,  |
| Oregon and for seventy miles north along the coastline. In Tillamook  |
| Bay a circle of nocturnal lights were seen moving toward the          |
| northwest. Each nocturnal object consisted of a ring of light.        |
