| Airport,  saw a bluish metallic pecan shaped object 5’ x 10’ land on  |
| 4 legs, with a hum or whine. In its nose was an orange light. There   |
| was a Plexiglas type section in the forward end, which contained the  |
| pilot. There were four pole-like appendages, two at each end, which   |
| supported parallel aerials. A blond man 5’10” tall, wearing a gray    |
| aviator suit got out of a door located in the Plexiglas section, he   |
| approached the witness & spoke in an unknown language; he understood  |
| neither Portuguese nor French. He patted the guard’s shoulder, got    |
| back into his craft, fastened safety belts, and took off, turning     |
| almost straight up. (Sources: Jacques & Janine Vallee, Challenge to   |

| 1954 - Late on this night two men, Srs. Atencio and Garcia, watched a |
| luminous object in the sky for about an hour as they waited for       |
| roadside assistance next to their stranded vehicle that they had      |
| driven into a ditch. Later, they saw a luminous craft, which          |
| resembled a full moon, land behind a grove near Monte-Brandsen,       |
| Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Two one-meter tall dwarves dressed  |
| in white with big silver helmets got out and walked in their          |
| direction. When they saw the two frightened witnesses they glided     |
| back in the direction of the craft, which promptly took off fast.     |

| 1957 - At 8:05 in the evening Sergeants H. T. O'Connor and H. D.      |
| Bridgeman at Kadena AFB on Okinawa observed an object shaped like a   |
| coke bottle without the neck. It was described as translucent and     |

| 1971 - At 1:45 a.m. Osvaldo Nestor D'Annunzio, age 19, was returning  |
| by truck along an isolated road from a local ranch in Estacion Gil,   |
| near Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina when he noticed a bright   |
| white object quickly approaching him at high speed. The object        |
| rapidly approached the ground in an unnatural manner by making a very |
| wide curve. As the object got closer it looked more like a reddish,   |
| triangular light. When it came even closer it changed into a          |
| top-shaped craft that emitted a cloud of red and white flame. The     |
| craft swung from right to left in a descending pendulum trajectory,   |
| finally slipping behind the tops of some nearby trees near the edge   |
| of the road. Once the object went behind the trees, a powerful        |
| reddish glow transformed the night into day, and he felt heat         |
| emanating from the object. At that moment he blacked out.             |
|                                                                       |
| When he recovered consciousness he saw the UFO ascending, and it      |
| disappeared behind a nearby eucalyptus forest. He did not know how    |
| long he had been unconscious. Upon arriving home, D'Annunzio felt     |
| a paralysis in both his arms. He could walk, but his arms became so   |
| completely paralyzed that he could not use them to open the door, and |
| he had to kick the door to attract attention. He was immediately      |
| rushed to a local military hospital for treatment. His paralysis      |
| continued until four p.m. the next afternoon.For the next seven       |
| months he suffered from paralysis in his arms, starting at midnight   |
| and lasting until early in the morning. He also suffered facial and   |
| scalp burns. Later he had further memories of the incident, recalling |
| that he saw numerous cows and sheep standing strangely still at the   |
| edge of the road as the UFO descended, and the craft seemed to have   |
| split in two as it disappeared behind the trees. He further described |
| the UFO as shaped like a child's top, metallic blue in color, and     |
| encased in a red glow with a flame shooting from the bottom. It was   |
| about three meters in length.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| Other witnesses in the area reported seeing the same or a similar UFO |
| flying low over the area, including a man who reported vehicle        |
| interference as a result of the passage of the object. Later, local   |
| UFO investigators discovered dozens of cows and sheep dead and        |
| scorched alongside the road. Using a Geiger counter they measured a   |
| high level of radioactivity in certain areas. In the place where the  |
| object had descended they also found a burned circular area of grass  |
| about 10 meters in diameter. In addition, several metal telephone     |
| lines in the area were found severed along what appeared to be the    |
| object's trajectory. A last unusual detail is that D'Annunzio         |
| apparently managed to drive the last eight kilometers in only two     |
| minutes, so some levitation and translocation may have been involved. |

| 1973 - Julian Garside was riding home from work at night on a         |
| friend's motorbike near Halifax, Yorkshire, England when the two      |
| young men saw three bright triangular lights, or shapes, gliding      |
| uphill through the woods near the road. They stopped and, out of      |
| curiosity, decided to follow. The shapes sped up and the boys noticed |
| an odor like burning oil. When they reached the top of the hill, a    |
| quarter mile from the road, the figures had vanished; above them,     |
| however, they observed a small, round orange light, like a            |
| road-crossing beacon. It vanished in about a minute. There had been   |
| no path through the woods, and the three objects (or figures)         |
| appeared to glide straight through the undergrowth, leaving no        |
| traces. The odor of oil was the only trace left behind. (Source:      |

| 1973 - A series of reports occurred in Sidney, North Carolina         |
| starting on September 20. Though several people reported seeing       |
| something, the main witnesses were members of the Williamson family   |
| from the town of Sidney. They saw at least one humanoid with large    |
| red glowing eyes, a gray face, long hair, pointed ears, and a hooked  |
| nose. It was dressed in a brown shirt and black pants and had a small |
| brown cap on its head. It walked with a limp and had one hand         |
| missing. It was said to leave no tracks and to leap 50-60 feet in a   |
| single bound. It had a metal medallion on its chest, which was said   |
| to be used for communication and disappearing. (Source: David F. Webb |

| 1979 - Miroslaw Goralski and Krzysztof Kobus had been working in      |
| their garden in Sztum, Poland late in the evening and at 9 p.m. were  |
| cleaning their tools when a UFO descended abruptly into their         |
| enclosure. One witness described the UFO as resembling a "ring," and  |
| the other--who saw it from a different angle--said it looked like     |
| "two silver deltas connected by a cross." Both men experienced a high |
| frequency squeaking sound in their heads. As they approached to       |
| investigate they were engulfed by a dense white "fog" and illuminated |
| by bright light. They both felt inertial effects as if rising up into |
| the air at high speed. Kobus propped himself against a soft object    |
| like an "armchair," which later vanished, and he experienced a        |
| kaleidoscope of colors and other odd sensations as if thoughts were   |
| flowing into his brain from an external source. Goralski asked        |
| questions of what he supposed were unseen entities, and obtained      |
| partial answers in an unspecific fashion. "What is matter?" he asked, |
| and the answer he received was, "The most important attribute of      |
| matter is its ability to pervade through other matter." Goralski      |
| leaned over to the edge of the "fog" and could clearly see the town   |
| below. He experienced a visual display like a "time tunnel,"          |
| including people in costumes of bygone days. Suddenly they fell, as   |
| if from a height of about 30 cm, and landed back in the garden.       |
| Goralski ran home, arriving there at 9:30 p.m.. The witnesses were    |
| administered psychological test, that indicated their personalities   |
| were normal. (Sources: Emilia Popik, MUFON UFO Journal, August 1980,  |

| Italy. As he approached the object he noticed a very tall figure who  |
| was wearing a shiny luminous outfit. The being had very large dark    |
| eyes. Initially frightened, the witness became very calm when the     |
| being gazed at him with a very gentle stare. After a few moments the  |
| being boarded the cylindrical object that was partly hidden behind    |
| some bushes. The object then rose and disappeared quickly from view.  |

| tattoos who both appeared to be incoherent. He saw tables and cows in |
| the room, and beings that seemed to be removing things from the cows. |

| smile-shaped parallel ridges on their faces. The smaller beings       |

| complete recall at this point, and the next thing he remembers was he |
| was back in his bed sweating. (Sources: Joe Murek, MUFON              |
