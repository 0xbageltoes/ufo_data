| 1950 - Four people flying over Camaguey province, Cuba in a Beech     |
| Bonanza aircraft sighted a circular object with a diameter of 70-80   |
| feet flying at terrific speed at 7:40 p.m. (Sources: Dominique        |

| 1954 - Lucien Fisch saw an object land near Route N83 in Issenheim,   |
| Haut-Rhin, France. It was luminous. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport |

| 1954 - At 2:30 a.m. Lazlo Ujvari, age 40, saw a dark domed disc in    |
| Raon-l'Etape, Vosges, France that made a whining noise. He was        |
| suddenly confronted by a man wearing a jacket, boots, and some type   |
| of cloth headgear, like a pilot's leather helmet. The man pointed a   |
| gun at him and said something he could not understand. When Ujvari    |
| spoke to him in Russian, the man answered in the same language. He    |
| asked whether he was in Spain or Italy, and how far he was from       |
| Germany. When he asked the time, Ujvari said "2:30." The man took out |
| a watch and said "You lie, it's 4:00." Then he wanted to know how far |
| away and in what direction was Marseilles. He forced Ujvari to walk   |
| with him on the road, and they soon came to a gray craft with an      |
| antenna on top. The man left him there and went aboard. When Ujvari   |
| had walked about 200 meters from the craft he heard a soft whistling  |
| sound and saw it fly straight up, then take an oblique trajectory.    |

| 1954 - On or about this date, in Binghamton, New York a Mr. White     |
| reported that he met two humanoids dressed in metallic snowsuits on   |
| the golf course. They spoke English with a peculiar accent, and said  |
| they would intervene in the event of a nuclear war. The UFO they      |
| arrived in was round, disc-shaped with a glass ring on the rim.       |
| Ground traces included burnt soil in a circle 14 feet in diameter.    |

| 1954 - During a rainstorm on this late afternoon in the Lusigny       |
| Forest in Aube department, France Roger Reveille saw an oval flying   |
| object close to the ground. It was six meters long and hovered at     |
| treetop level. He felt intense heat coming from it. It shot up        |
| vertically at great speed. Inside the woods the heat had become       |
| intolerable and a cloud of dense smoke had formed under the rain.     |
| After 15 minutes the witness was able to approach the site, and he    |
| found the trees, grass, and ground perfectly dry. (Sources: Aime      |

| 1954 - Several unknown objects maneuvered for two hours near the      |
| village of St-Valery, Somme, France. One of them was very brilliant   |
| and landed in a pasture. Two others were seen near a cliff in Mers,   |
| France. They appeared to be in communication with UFOs in another     |
| group by means of light signals. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to |
| Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 235, case 293; Paris Presse,       |

| 1954 - In Turquenstein, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France at 6:30 p.m. Mr.   |
| Schoubrenner, a 25-year-old truck driver, saw a bright light in the   |
| distance and soon found his road blocked by a strange object. The     |
| engine died, and he felt paralyzed: "My hands were as though glued to |
| the wheel." He also felt a sensation of heat inside his vehicle. The  |
| craft looked like an inverted cone, the lower part phosphorescent,    |
| the middle dull, and the top luminous with a yellow or orange point.  |

| 1954 - On this evening Mr. Renzo Pugina, age 37, had just parked his  |
| car in the garage at his residence in Parravicino d'Erba, Italy when  |
| he saw a strange being wearing a "scaly" luminous suit. It stood near |
| a tree and was about 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) tall. The entity had what  |
| looked like a flashlight, and aimed a beam of light from it at him.   |
| He felt paralyzed and was unable to move until he made a clenching    |
| motion with his fist on the garage keys that he held in his hand.     |
| Freed from the temporary paralysis he ran to attack the intruder, who |
| fled with a soft whirring sound. An oily spot was found at the site.  |

| 1955 - Manuel Gonzalez Vazquez and his neighbor Erminda where in a    |
| field tending some cattle in Portela de Pau, Orense, Spain in the     |
| late afternoon when they felt a slight tremor that lasted a few       |
| minutes. Moments later they saw an undetermined figure inside a       |
| “screen-like” image in the sky. The figure had a definite human       |
| shape. Seconds later they spotted a second flying figure approaching  |
| under the clouds. As the figure approached they could tell that it    |
| was a female figure, flying at three meters above the ground. It      |
| resembled an 18-year-old girl, and was a little over a meter in       |
| height. Her hair was gathered up in a bun and she was wearing a light |
| turquoise colored cloak. The woman flew by the two witnesses and      |
| turned to look at them but did not say anything. It eventually glided |
| away and disappeared from sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid |
| Contact Database 1955, citing Gaceta OVNI).                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - In the evening Mr. Mars Walker, a student at the University of |
| Georgia in Athens, Georgia observed a vague, purple shape about 50    |
| yards from the house. A humanoid being with tentacle-like protrusions |
| about the head came from it . He had hands with three or four         |
| fingers. It wore a belt that had several odd objects hanging from it, |
| and appeared to be taking readings with them. The being completely    |
| ignored the witness for the 30 minute period that the encounter       |
| lasted. It was bathed in a green light from the UFO. Eventually it    |
| was "taken back into the vessel." (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted       |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1973-51; David  |
| F. Webb, 1973: The Year of The Humanoids).                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - The witness, a young women college student, had left college   |
| for home and was then reported missing, her car having been found     |
| abandoned in Indiana with the hood up by the side of the road. She    |
| turned up four days later at a police station, and reported that she  |
| had been driving along a deserted highway when her vehicle's engine   |
| sputtered and died at around ten p.m. She stepped out to check on it  |
| and was suddenly grabbed from behind by three creatures. She          |
| described them as wearing white face masks, or having white faces     |
| like molded plastic masks. Their eyes were large and set close to the |
| sides of the head, and they had three-fingered, claw-like hands. They |
| all wore metallic blue coveralls with a white stripe down the side.   |
| She was floated onboard a domed, disc- shaped object that was sitting |
| on a nearby field. She was forced into a room, stripped, and then     |
| strapped to a table. Then she was given an extensive medical exam in  |
| which several needles were inserted into her body. She was left       |
| briefly alone in the brightly lit room, and then strapped to a chair. |
| There several electrode-like devices were attached to her body and    |
| the creatures interrogated her at length. She was later given water   |
| and some food, which she did not eat, and released on a lonely        |
| stretch of road. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |

| Scenario).                                                            |

| 1973 - A 48-year-old homemaker in Gerena, Sevilla province, Spain was |
| in her kitchen washing dishes at 11:15 p.m. when she saw her patio    |
| suddenly light up. She next saw an oval-shaped object descend and     |
| emit a loud grinding noise. On each end of the object there was a     |
| bright red square, while the object's central section appeared        |
| transparent. She saw two dark figures inside the UFO. The object      |
| descended very close to the ground, emitting a loud sound, and then   |
| then shot upwards while increasing in luminescence. (Source: Albert   |
| S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1973, case #81, citing          |
| Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos & Fernandez Peri, Enciclopedia De Los    |
| Encuentros Cercanos con OVNIS).                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - Late at night nine campers, a group of students led by three   |
| adults, had gone to El Yunque Mountain Park in Puerto Rico hoping to  |
| "contact" UFOs and their occupants. They made camp high up on a       |
| mountain trail. Mr. Heriberto Ramos, the group's leader, said that at |
| one point during their ascent they met three persons heading down the |
| trail. There was nothing "alien" about the trio aside from the fact   |
| that they all dressed exactly alike and had similar features. One of  |
| the group members, who had stayed behind, took a photo of the three   |
| mysterious walkers, but only a patch of mist appeared on the          |
| developed film.                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| Later that night the campers found themselves surrounded by five or   |
| six vaguely humanoid figures who darted about the thick vegetation.   |
| They had claw-like hands and elongated ears. Some of these "monsters" |
| blocked the precipice flanked trail that constituted the only way     |
| down from the mountain. Mr. Ramos tried walking cautiously toward pne |
| being, hoping to show that his intentions were amicable. He got to    |
| within ten feet from the creature, and was able to describe it as     |
| having a triangular head and "extraordinary" eyes. He even he managed |
| to touch the strange being, which did not stir. Its skin felt neither |
| cold nor rubbery. Almost simultaneously, one of his students lit a    |
| large, powerful flashlight flooding the area with light. The clawed   |
| creature reacted by racing away from the scene, literally tearing a   |
| path right through the dense vegetation.                              |
|                                                                       |
| The path led to a 100 foot drop, giving Ramos the impression that     |
| they had frightened the being into jumping. But to his amazement it   |
| reappeared instantly at the side of its companions, who were still    |
| blocking the downhill path. From then until the sky began to lighten  |
| the besieged campers were watched by the beings, who remained in      |
| constant motion around them. Terror had led one of the students to    |
| bang himself repeatedly on the head with a flashlight, hoping to      |
| escape the situation by passing out. Seized by an inexplicable urge,  |
| another camper expressed a desire to take a walk in the woods.        |
| Fearing for his mental state, one of his companions offered to walk   |
| with him. Before they'd taken more than a dozen steps, they found     |
| what could only be described as a glimmering, polychromatic "egg"     |
| lying on the ground. While entranced by the curious flashing object,  |
| neither one felt brave enough to touch it.                            |
|                                                                       |
| Later that night they saw it in the claws of one of the alien         |
| creatures. At sunrise the campers made a mad dash for their cars that |
| were parked at the bottom of the mountain. No trace of the aliens     |
| remained aside from their footprints, which were much larger than a   |
| human's and appeared to have been made by heavy creatures. The        |
| campers made plaster casts of the prints and photographed them. These |
| materials were stolen by unknown parties some months after the        |
| incident. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue   |
