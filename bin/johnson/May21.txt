| 1950 - A huge round object hung in the sky over Montrose, Colorado.   |
| It was joined by a second large object. Both started heading to the   |
| north, but turned and flew off to the east. (Source: Loren E. Gross,  |

| 1953 - According to a letter by Fritz A. Werner to J. Allen Hynek     |
| dated May 15, 1973, 16 AEC engineers were taken by the U.S. Air Force |
| on this day into the desert outside Kingman, Arizona aboard a bus     |
| with its windows blackened out to view a crashed disc. The object was |
| oval shaped, 30 feet in diameter, and with a surface that looked like |
| a highly polished brushed metal. In a nearby tent was a dead body, 4  |
| feet tall. The body was clothed in a silvery metallic suit with a     |
| skull cap. The dead pilots body had brown skin, with the other        |
| unusual feature being a small mouth. (Sources: Center for UFO Studies |

| near Knoxville, Tennessee making a noise. It then hovered in silence, |
| and may have made a possible landing behind some trees. (Sources:     |

| 1968 - At 8:50 a.m. at Union High School in Roosevelt, Utah a silver  |
| oval or disc-shaped object, quite large, changed speed, hovered,      |
| maneuvered, and dropped nearly to the ground. Twenty-two students and |
| teachers watched the display for 6-7 minutes. (Source: Frank B.       |

| 1969 - Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil - At midnight Jose Antonio |
| Da Silva had a sudden impulse to get out of bed and go into his       |
| garden. He stepped out his door and saw three of the same short       |
| entities he had a frightening encounter with earlier that month at    |
| Bebedouro, Minas Gerais, Brazil dressed in the same flightsuits. They |
| stood motionless, looking at him. He quickly stepped back inside and  |
| bolted the door, without saying a word or hearing a sound from them.  |
| He then explained to investigators that they wanted him to "work      |
| against my own people" and expressed his great fear that our world    |
| was in great danger, without knowing from where the danger would      |
| come. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of     |

| 1971 - A man was driving home near West Leisenring, Pennsylvania at   |
| 1:10 a.m. and he had just rounded a bend in the rural road when he    |
| noticed an unusual object hovering 20 feet above the ground. The      |
| craft was disc shaped with a dome on top and an antenna like          |
| protrusion. It had a door like opening to the left of its center; the |
| opening emitted an reddish orange glow from inside. It also emitted a |
| faint humming sound. He stopped his car to watch, and after two       |
| minutes he saw a figure walk back and forth within the doorway of the |
| object. The humanoid being was dressed in a grayish white metallic    |
| suit with a hood and stood about six feet tall. The craft itself was  |
| dull gray in color and appeared to have burnt areas along the bottom. |
| The witness, sitting behind the wheel of his vehicle, turned his head |
| to his left and saw a similarly garbed figure only three feet way     |
| from the driver's door. He then heard a click and two seconds later a |
| blast threw him against the vehicle's console. A loud explosion moved |
| the car forward and the witness drove away as fast as he could. He    |
| then drove to the emergency room of a local hospital where he was     |
| treated with what looked like pellet wounds. (Source: Albert S.       |

| 1973 - In a wooded area near the town of Kristianstad, Sweden a group |
| of men reported seeing an incredibly huge, black bird-like creature   |
| that passed within one hundred feet of them. One witness had a camera |
| with a telephoto lens and attempted to take a picture, but his film   |
| jammed. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of   |

| 1976 - A luminous UFO shaped like coolie hat paced a car in the       |
| desert near Alamogordo, New Mexico containing three occupants. One of |
| the passengers, a 28-year-old woman named Bryant, experienced five    |
| hours of missing time and later related an abduction experience. She  |
| reported being taken aboard the UFO where she was given intensive     |
| medical examinations and had several body samples taken. Among other  |
| procedures they scraped her skin, and drew fluid from one of her      |
| eyes. The occupants were short, about four feet tall, and had large   |
| hairless heads with large dark almond-shaped eyes. They also wore     |
| uniforms that resembled police uniforms. (Sources: Thomas E. Bullard, |
| UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery, case 093, citing the San    |

| 1977 - At 12:24 a.m. a taxi driver and his passenger saw a white      |
| football-shaped object in the sky in Leicester, England. At one point |
| it looked like five balls joined together in a circle. It or they     |
| hovered silently, then moved off and disappeared from sight. (Source: |

| 1977 - Two close encounters involving UFOs with coherent light beams  |
| occurred on this night in Dorset county, England. At 10:55 p.m. Mr.   |
| Morse, age 26, witnessed a large silver disc-shaped object that       |
| hovered over a field in Canford Heath, Poole, England. A green cone   |
| of light extended from the object as a coherent beam of light. It     |
| flew off to the west. Fifteen minutes later a car with two            |
| 30-year-old women was followed by another disc between Longham and    |
| Wimborne in the Dorset countryside. It had a solid beam that cut      |
| through the terrain. The energy beam had a definite, abrupt end to    |
| it. The disc dropped to the ground, but the women did not stay around |
| to investigate. There were six other sightings reported that night in |
| the area. (Source: Leslie Harris, FSR, January 1978, p. 5).           |

| 1988 - Townshend, Vermont - Jack and May Weiner recalled an abduction  |
| experience while at their mountain home. This was Jack's second       |
| abduction experience, the first occurring while on a camping trip     |
| with three other men in the Allagash Wilderness area of Maine. Jack's |
| dog wanted to go out and when he let the dog outside, late on this    |
| evening, he noticed a blue light shining through the kitchen window.  |
| He went outside and saw a glowing object hovering over a nearby       |
| field. He recalled walking back inside the house. Under hypnosis he   |
| recalled that several short beings with large heads and eyes entered  |
| his bedroom. The beings lifted Jack and his wife and floated them     |
| towards a bright light. They were taken in front of the large         |
| hovering object that glowed a bright blue from its bottom. It hovered |
| silently and there was a strong smell of ozone in the air. They were  |
| both taken inside the object and given medical exams by the beings. A |
| lump was allegedly discovered and the cyst removed. Later they were   |
| both floated across the lawn, into their house and back inside        |
| through the unopened front door. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, MUFON    |

| 1990 - On this evening a disc flying from the southwest to the        |
| northeast was involved with a near collision with a KC-135 tanker     |
| aircraft over Lancaster, California. The passage of the UFO appeared  |
| on radar and rocked the wings of the plane as it shot past. (Source:  |

| 1990 - At 9:00 p.m. four witnesses in Trenton, New York saw a large   |
| delta-shaped object fly overhead, making a faint humming sound. It    |
| flew in a slow glide and then made sudden jumps. It had lights on its |
| three corners. (Source: Keith Conroy, field investigator, MUFON       |
| investigation files database, case 930506E).                          |

| 1996 - Four youths camping in Charleston, Illinois saw a large white  |
| light in the sky at 11:58 p.m., then a huge triangular UFO with two   |
| red lights on one side. It lit their campsite with a "spotlight" beam |
| but made no sound. (Sources: James Easton, internet list of           |

| 1999 - A witness reported to the National UFO Reporting Center that a |
| UFO positioned itself directly over his car in Harrison, Ohio. It     |
| hovered silently in the air and shone two white beams of light down   |
| on him. (Source: Peter Davenport, UFO Reporting Center, Seattle, May  |
