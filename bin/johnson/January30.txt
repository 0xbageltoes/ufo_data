| 1897 - A mystery airship with an immense artificial bright light was  |
| sighted in the early evening by several "sober observers" in          |

| perhaps 800 feet in the air. Days later it was seen 40 miles south of |
| Invale, Nebraska. (Sources: Omaha Bee, February 2, 1897; Philip Rife, |

| observed, about 15 feet in diameter, descending from the sky. It      |
| hovered for about eight minutes at a 150-foot altitude, glowing red.  |
| A truck and a bus were also affected by the presence of the UFO.      |

| 1959 - A truck driver driving this night on U.S. Route 52 near New    |
| Richmond, Ohio saw a bizarre gray "ugly" creature with tentacles      |
| crossing the road ahead of the truck. Two hours later, just across    |

| 1965 - Sid Padrick, age 52, was walking on the beach in Manresa       |
| Beach, Santa Cruz County, California just before 2.00 a.m. when he    |
| heard a sound and saw a large dark disc-shaped object that approached |
| from the Pacific Ocean. He started to run from it, but heard a voice  |
| frpm it saying, “Do not be frightened, we are not hostile.” It        |
| descended to within two feet of the beach. Mr. Padrick was invited by |
| the voice to come onboard, which he did. The UFO, which bore no       |
| lights, was shaped like a 50 foot sphere with top and bottom cut off, |
| and surrounded by a horizontal flange. The witness entered through a  |
| brilliantly lit antechamber, and was met by a young man dressed in a  |
| tight fitting, bluish white two piece uniform, continuous with the    |
| boots. The UFO occupant identified himself as "Zeeno" and said that   |
| he came from a planet invisible to us, as it is always behind one of  |
| the planets we can see. He further explained that their society had   |
| no sickness, vice or crime. Padrick saw on a TV screen another such   |
| vessel, identified as their “navigating craft.” He was taken for a    |
| ride to a spot in the mountains and brought back to the beach         |
| after two hours. (Sources: Major Damon B. Reeder, U.S. Air Force for  |

| 1965 - A triangular UFO was spotted about 8:30 p.m. by Chad Rayfeld,  |
| a 17-year-old high school senior, and several friends in Newport      |
| News, Virginia. They estimated it was three times bigger than an      |
| automobile, very bright, and moving fast across the James River in    |
| the direction of Richmond. At the base of the triangle was an orange  |
| light with a white light at the leading apex. The triangle made no    |
| noise, and was visible for about 20 minutes. (Sources: Newport News   |

| 1967 - At 8:04 p.m. CST Delton Schwanz, a commercial pilot with 29    |
| years experience and a past U.S. Air Force serviceman, was driving    |
| with his wife Della and children Robert, Roger and Diane five miles   |
| southwest and 20 miles west of Crosby, North Dakota when they saw a   |
| bright white, sharply outlined lozenge-shaped object in the western   |
| sky. It had a length to width ratio of 4:1 and an elevation of        |
| 15°-20°. It momentarily stopped, then moved in level flight to the    |
| left, making a smooth climb in the southwest and dropping white       |
| "strips" of light that descended vertically. It disappeared to the    |
| south at azimuth 170° by ascending to about 30°-45° elevation. Two    |
| other men were independent witnesses, driving by car west of Crosby   |
| near the intersection of Highways 5 and 85, where they reported       |
| seeing a large white light moving rapidly from west to south and      |
| dropping a "piece" of the object, then vanishing suddenly. (Sources:  |

| disc-shaped object in Pierceland, Saskatchewan, Canada. The           |
| disc-shaped object had windows and "legs" and moved slowly over a     |
| field, close to the witnesses. (Source: Frank Ducks, 1995 Canadian    |

| 1997 - The abductee received a telepathic warning in advance that she |
| would be taken from her home in San Bernardo, Santiago Province,      |
| Chile. At 10:00 p.m. the young woman was abducted for three hours.    |
| Her fetus was reportedly taken, and she was found all wet when she    |
| was returned. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case #       |

| 2000 - A huge black triangular object hovered silently above a crab   |
| fishing boat at 11:15 p.m. while the fisherman was engaged in hauling |
| up a line of traps off Farlon Island near San Francisco, California.  |
| The man was onboard his 25 foot boat with his dog but had no other    |
| witnesses around, when he was hit by a beam of white light from the   |
| craft, which caused him fall backwards into the boat's cabin. He      |
| grabbed his Rugger 10-22 rifle and fired 100 rounds of .22 caliber    |
| ammunition at the bottom of the craft, trying to shoot out the light. |
| While grabbing a second magazine clip he saw a hatch open up on the   |
| bottom of the object and two men leaned out, shouting "Stop shooting  |
| at us you idiot." He also heard a hissing sound like air escaping     |
| from a punctured tire. The object then moved off to the south. A      |
| helicopter then appeared and hovered over the boat. The chopper was   |
| flat black in color, and it was silent with no markings on it. As the |
| chopper hovered a flash of light was again directed at the boat. He   |
| last saw the triangle gain altitude and disappear towards the south.  |
| The helicopter was last seen heading towards the Golden Gate Bridge.  |
| It is uncertain if what the witness allegedly encountered was a       |
| secret U.S. government project, or something even more strange.       |

| 2004 - At 9:30 p.m. witnesses in Willard, Missouri saw a orange       |

| 2006 - Around two o'clock in the morning two friends awoke to a low   |
| humming sound, and a clattering noise against all the windows of the  |
| country house they occupied in Bragg Creek, Alberta, Canada. They     |
| looked outside and saw 20 or more tiny blue lights in the sky. They   |
| quickly picked up a video camera and began to film. The lights        |
| were high in the sky, and maneuvered freely in all directions, at     |
| times hovering together, one on top of the other. This continued for  |
| about an hour. They then noticed the objects getting much larger as   |
| they slowly descended to earth. They claimed they managed to get one  |
| or two close ups on video, but the quality was not great. The         |
| ridge about 1 ½ miles to the north then began to emit a day-like      |
| glow. Most of the objects were now no longer visible, but the humming |
| sound had become almost deafening. Suddenly a strong wind began to    |
| blow out of the north, and the light on the ridge pulsated along the  |
| horizon, while clouds of smoke appeared to rise up slowly from each   |
| of six lit up areas. One of them next tried to make a phone call to a |
| neighbor, but the phone was not working and instead made an unusual   |
| buzzing sound. They both leaned out the window to get a better view.  |
| Soon after, they heard a very eerie howl, not like any coyote they    |
| had ever heard, and almost like a siren but not as perfect. It was    |
| followed by a loud blood curling scream, definitely unhuman. A warm   |
| strong breeze next came out of the north, and it had a smell like     |
| burning plastic. A security light outside kept turning on, and they   |
| heard crashing and banging against the house, followed by a           |
| scratching along the walls on every side. Both of the witnesses then  |
| saw a tall, very pale humanoid figure with glowing eyes that          |
| ran across the driveway. Petrified, they shut themselves inside but   |
| continued to listen intently. When they next looked out the window    |
| they could see the smoke puff up from the illuminated hilltops again, |
| and once again saw tiny blue lights that shot up into the sky,        |
| hovered briefly, and began to get smaller as they flew to a high      |
| altitude in the sky, where they remained visible for a long time.     |

| 2007 - At 9:25 a.m. a disc-shaped UFO was sighted over Interstate 270 |
| N in Rockville, Maryland. At 6:44 p.m. CST a smaller object slowly    |
| merged with a larger disc-shaped object over Round Lake, Illinois.    |
| Then both vanished in a second as it shot up vertically from          |
| approximately a mile above the earth into outer space. In Quincy,     |
| California at 10:50 p.m. a tri-colored cylinder-shaped object was     |
| seen flying at about 500 feet altitude. It disappeared into the       |
| mountains 5-10 miles away. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO     |

| 2008 - Just after midnight a crescent-shaped object with red, green,  |

| 2009 - At about nine o’clock on a clear sunny day in San Diego,       |
| California, when the witness looked out the window of the train he    |
| saw two silver disc-shaped objects side by side very close together   |
| in the sky. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,  |

| 2012 - The witness was driving on Interstate 95 near exit 26 in       |
| Waltham, Massachusetts at 8:55 p.m. At the time there were            |
| construction crews working on both sides of the highway. He next saw  |
| a rectangular craft in the sky flashing red and white lights at about |
| the height of a street light. It stretched across the three left      |
| lanes of the highway. The craft did not move and appeared dark with   |
| flashing lights and a couple of dome-shaped windows. It made          |
| absolutely no noise. It had a narrow beam of light that was directed  |
| down at the state troopers. The sighting lasted 30 seconds. Half an   |
| hour later, driving on the opposite side of the highway, the witness  |
| noted that the construction crews had gone, but the state troopers    |
| were still there, looking confused. (Source: Peter Davenport,         |
