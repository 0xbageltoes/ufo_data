| 1896 - Many witnesses in Red Bluff, California witnessed a light      |
| maneuvering in the sky for several minutes at 7:00 p.m. In Visalia,   |
| California several observers saw a "vessel" in the sky moving at the  |
| speed of a train; it moved up-and-down and left-and-right, and        |
| departed quickly to the northwest. At 11:30 p.m. two witnesses in     |
| Tacoma, Washington watched a flying object beam vari-colored rays of  |
| light in all directions. It then flew to the southeast and examined   |
| the Mount Rainier mountain peak. (Sources: Oakland Tribune, November  |

| 1965 - James Allen Aldridge and his family heard a loud blast outside |
| their mobile home trailer in Cooper City, Florida and saw a flash in  |
| the western sky at 18:45 p.m. Aldridge went to his barn to check on   |
| his stock and there he saw a man about five feet tall, with wide      |
| shoulders and a narrow waist. He shouted at the man but got no        |
| response. His dog was shaking with fright at the sight of the strange |
| figure. Aldridge then drove off to get the police, but when they      |
| returned they could find no one. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted         |

| 1966 - At 7:15 a.m. Mr. Thomas Ury was driving home when the          |
| "Mothman", a bird-like creature six feet tall and with a ten foot     |
| wingspan, circled over his car. He sped up to 70-75 miles per hour    |
| but the creature kept up with his car. He had been close to the area  |
| of the TNT dumpsite in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. That same night |
| Mary Myer, a newspaper reporter, saw the red eyes of "Mothman" when   |
| she visited the abandoned power plant in Point Pleasant, West         |
| Virginia where it had been seen before. (Sources: UPI, November 25,   |

| 1967 - At 2:30 p.m. Sr. Ugo Battaglia, a radio technician, and his    |
| 14-year-old assistant Carlos Alberto do Nascimento, were in an eighth |
| floor apartment building repairing a phonograph in Rio de Janeiro,    |
| Brazil when they heard a high-pitched sound. They looked out a window |
| facing the coastal hills and saw a brilliant metallic disc-shaped     |
| object. It landed on a hill opposite the apartment building. The UFO  |
| struck and shattered a tree as it came down. Underneath at either end |
| was a red light, and on top was a spinning cupola with slat windows.  |
| Three men clad in white coveralls came out of the UFO, which hovered  |
| just above the ground. They walked around it side by side with their  |
| arms hanging by their sides. After about five minutes they returned   |
| to the disc and disappeared underneath it. The two witnesses          |
| continued their work and left the building at 2:55 p.m., noticing     |
| that the disc was still in the same spot, but by the time they        |
| reached a nearby corner the UFO was no longer in view. They had not   |
| seen it depart. (Sources: Irene Granchi, APRO Bulletin,               |

| 1967 - At 9:30 a.m. EST a witness named King in Tuscumbia, Missouri   |
| observed a silver banded, cone-shaped UFO that flew silently toward   |
| the east, then circled 360 degrees three times before heading back to |
| the west. (Source: Ted R. Phillips, FSR Case Histories, December      |

| 1968 - On this evening five teenagers in Southall Ridge, near Ripley, |
| West Virginia saw a 150 foot in diameter domed disc over a house. It  |
| landed in a nearby field, and was shot at. It dodged bullets from a   |
| .22 caliber rifle. The first bullet made a "whomp" sound, like it had |
| hit a solid object, but the later bullets had no reported effect.     |

| 1970 - At seven o'clock in the evening a compact "cloud" UFO emitting |
| rays from the top was seen by hundreds in Belo Horizonte, Brazil      |
| during a time when part of the city experienced a power outage. At    |
| the same time Moyses Santos, a resident of the city, found himself    |
| surrounded by half a dozen three-foot tall beings in his room "who    |
| went around touching and upsetting everything." They floated about in |
| the air, and had a translucent quality. They "looked like ice." When  |
| they got near a table lamp, they "lit up in many lights." One of them |
| handed Santos a piece of paper on which he drew a flying saucer,      |
| without knowing why. The being then took the paper back. Finally they |
| disappeared by passing through the walls. He went outside in time to  |
| see the UFO above the city, flooding the area with brilliant light.   |
| Other sightings occurred about the same time in several Brazilian     |
| cities. (Sources: Irene Granchi, APRO Bulletin, November-December     |

| 1970 -  That same evening two men in Centralia, Illinois had nearly   |
| identical experiences with a UFO while driving home. At 5:45 p.m. Sam |
| Alli saw a glowing white-and-yellow globe hovering in the sky. It was |
| fuzzy at first but then became perfectly clear. It began to move in   |
| circles, then rapid spurts. It slowed to a complete stop when he      |
| turned into his driveway. The second witness, Larry Peterson, next    |
| reported a similar experience. (Sources: Skylook, January 1971, p. 1; |

| 1973 - A photograph of a domed ovoid UFO was taken at 5:00 p.m. in    |
| the Piedmont region of Italy. A 23-year-old man named Contin took the |
| photo of the object in Susa, Italy as it was making seemingly         |
| impossible maneuvers. Jets were later seen chasing the object.        |

| 1974 -  According to the Spanish Air Force, at 7:50 p.m. a light      |
| descended from 8,000 to 6,000 feet and paced a Fokker F-27 IB         |
| aircraft for one minute while flying between Tenerife and Las Palmas  |
| in the Canary Islands. The UFO disappeared when the airplane turned   |
| toward the light. The visual sighting lasted for three minutes, while |
| radar returns were recorded at 8:20 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Independent    |
| witnesses included a Spanish Air Force Lt. Colonel and his daughter   |
| driving in a car. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, UNICAT       |

| 1976 - A cone-shaped object with a light followed a truck on a        |
| highway in New Albany, Indiana at 10:30 p.m. It went away when other  |
| vehicles approached, but reappeared when they were gone and was seen  |
| for more than an hour. It left by departing toward the east. There    |
| were 13 witnesses to the close encounter. (Source: International UFO  |

| 1977 -  At 10:10 p.m. a UFO came out of the southwest, flying over a  |
| ranch following some high tension power lines in the town of La       |
| Aurora, Uruguay.  It changed colors and caused radio interference.    |
| There was a 10 minute power failure in the city of Salto. (Source:    |

| 1978 -  Sr. Gordillo and three friends were out hunting in the        |
| pre-dawn hours around 3:30 a.m. in a wooded hilly region near the     |
| River Guadiamar in Gerena Guadiamar, Sevilla province, Spain when     |
| they all saw a red light on the ground in a nearby eucalyptus grove.  |
| They all carried bright lanterns and continued looking for game.      |
| They  crossed the river, and temporarily forgot about the red light   |
| for a few minutes. They then noticed that the light was now in a      |
| nearby clearing in the woods. Two of the witnesses approached the     |
| area, while the others remained behind. The two men saw, partially    |
| hidden by some trees, a large bowl-shaped or jug-shaped craft with a  |
| red light on top and numerous multicolored lights on the front; it    |
| rested on two shiny silvery legs. Next to the object stood a tall,    |
| heavy set human-like figure, who appeared to be wearing a large round |
| black helmet with a glass visor over the face. His clothing was       |
| silvery and he wore large boots. The being walked slowly back and     |
| forth in front of the object, at one point approaching the witnesses  |
| briefly. It made low humming noises. The men became frightened and    |
| left the area. Large footprints were found at the site. (Sources:     |

| 1978 - Sr. D'Ambros, age 61, had gone into a nearby woods at 11:45    |
| a.m. near Gastagh, Italy to gather some firewood and had sat down on  |
| a log to rest. He was horrified to suddenly see two strange looking   |
| beings looking at him. The beings were hovering very close to the     |
| ground. They were described as a meter tall and thin with large       |
| pointed ears. One was shorter than the other. They had yellowish      |
| skin, large smooth and bald elongated heads, long pointed noses and   |
| large mouths with two long pointed fangs. They were clad in dark,     |
| tight fitting coveralls that started below the knee and extended up   |
| to their necks. They also had huge hands and feet with extremely long |
| fingers and nails. The shorter of the beings approached the witness   |
| and began making sudden "sliding" moves around him, never touching    |
| the ground. The witness screamed for help and asked who they were but |
| they only answered him with mumbling sounds. The taller creature now  |
| approached and attempted to take the witness's pruning axe from him.  |
| After a brief struggle the creatures fled into the woods. The witness |
| chased after them but lost sight of them. He then came upon a         |
| clearing where a solid, metallic disc-shaped craft with a dome on top |
| rested on four legs. He saw a pair of long hands close a small trap   |
| door on the dome, then the disc took off silently and at high speed   |
| emitting a burst of red flame from its bottom. During the same time   |
| other independent witnesses had watched a similar object maneuvering  |
| over the area. Ground traces found in the area included a 12-foot     |
| wide burnt circle, with vegetation whirled counterclockwise, U-shaped |
| imprints 20 cm long and 3 cm deep, and uprooted bushes. (Sources:     |

| had four colored lights--a row of red, blue, green, and amber         |
| lights--at the base of the dome. It made no sound as it passed left   |
| to right just above the tress, and then hovered. The object tilted,   |
| and two strong headlights from the front of the UFO shown directly    |
| down on his pickup truck. The object was revolving counterclockwise,  |
| and left towards the east. The truck's electrical system (alternator  |
