| 1897 - Two policemen, Sumpter and McLenore, were riding northwest of  |
| Hot Springs, Arkansas when they saw a bright light in the sky. About  |
| seven km farther they saw the light again coming down to the ground.  |
| One km farther the horses refused to walk. Two men were seen carrying |
| lights. The lawmen took their rifles, called the strangers, and were  |
| told that they crossed the country with a flying craft. The profile   |
| of the 20-meter long machine could be seen in the clearing. There was |
| a woman with an parasol or umbrella nearby. It was raining, and the   |
| younger man was filling a large container with water. The elder man   |
| had a beard and suggested to the policemen that they fly with them    |
| "to a place where it does not rain." The same witness went back to    |
| the same spot 40 minutes later but found nothing there. (Source:      |

| 1949 - On this day, a decorated Soviet test pilot named Apraksin was  |
| flying over the Volga River in Russia, 40 kilometers north of the     |
| city of Saratov, when his aircraft's electrical system was knocked    |
| out of operation by a cone of light from a cucumber-shaped UFO after  |
| he attempted to approach it. He was blinded by the light, but managed |
| to land the crippled aircraft despite his incapacitation in an abrupt |
| emergency landing. He then lost consciousness and was confined to     |
| hospital to recuperate. (Sources: Felix Zigel, unpublished            |

| 1949 -  At 8:30 a.m. EDT witnesses Stump, Herman and Quinn in Sidney, |
| Ohio saw a bright object about half a mile to the west moving south   |
| at high speed. It left no trail and made no sound. One of the         |
| witnesses said it was too bright to tell what shape it had, but the   |
| others said it had a flat, circular shape. It was in sight for two    |
| minutes. (Sources: Project Blue Book files; Jan Aldrich, Project      |

| 1949 - At 9:35 a.m. a witness named C. G. Green reported to the U.S.  |
| Air Force that two shiny disc-shaped objects circled each other and   |
| banked over a field in Livermore, California. One of the objects      |
| shot straight up with a gray trail. The sighting lasted five minutes. |

| 1949 - At Killeen Base, Camp Hood, Texas a UFO observation network    |
| set up two days earlier, employing Army artillery observers, tracked  |
| their first object. They sighted and triangulated on a brilliant      |
| light 4000 yards in the distance. It moved very slowly, dropping from |
| an altitude of 1200 feet to 440 feet. It was the apparent size of a   |
| half dollar at arm's length. Its color was pinkish to green, and was  |
| in sight for 50 minutes. The main witness was Lt. Mardell E. Ward.    |

| 1965 - At 9:10 a.m. local time the crew of a US Navy ship heading     |
| west at 265° at 15 knots in the Philippine Sea sighted approaching    |
| aircraft at bearing 0°. At 9:14 a.m. the radar detected four targets  |
| at ranges up to 22 miles for the next 6 minutes flying at extremely   |
| high speed (3,500 mph) and performing various maneuvers. The craft    |
| were viewed through binoculars and appeared as 3 lighted objects.     |
| Next, the UFOs hovered directly over the ship for 3 minutes as        |
| confirmed visually and on radar by the Commanding Officer, bridge     |
| crew and others on deck.  The objects departed to the SE at extremely |
| high speed. (Source: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience, p. 81,       |

| Carnestown in the vicinity of Naples, a shaken motorist made a        |
| statement to Naples police about his car being approached from behind |
| by a "large white light" that came within about 100-150 feet of his   |
| car, changing color to blue-green. He tried to flee, but the UFO      |
| zoomed past him making a "whooshing" noise, and circled around to the |
| left and disappeared. (Sources: Miami Herald, May 7, 1966; NICAP      |

| 1967 - A 24-year-old man named Campeadore was driving on the main     |
| highway 17 miles west of St. George, Utah at 12:43 a.m. when he heard |
| a loud humming sound and stopped his car to investigate. He got out   |
| of his vehicle and saw a 40-foot wide, amber colored domed disc       |
| hovering only 20-30 feet over his head. He took out his pistol and    |
| fired a complete clip of bullets at the object. He reported that he   |
| heard the bullets ricochet off. He also suffered some physiological   |
| after effects as the result of his close encounter. (Sources: NICAP   |

| 1967 - A mechanical engineer and his daughter were driving between    |
| Durango and Mazatlan, Mexico around 11:00 a.m. when they sighted a    |
| disc-shaped object on the ground off to the side of the highway. The  |
| engineer took three photographs while the UFO took off. Two parts of  |
| the landing gear are shown in first photo, while the second showed no |
| legs and presumably had been retracted. The third photo missed the    |
| object. (Sources: Jim and Coral Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, p.  |

| 1967 - Raymond Schirrmann, his wife, and two children of Schirmeck,   |
| Bas-Rhine department, France first sighted seven or eight black,      |
| lenticular objects at 7:00 p.m. over a grove of trees at an estimated |
| distance of two kilometers. They were aligned in a straight, diagonal |
| line in the sky, and each was surrounded by a halo of smoke. At 9:00  |
| p.m. a large lens-shaped object, 15-20 meters in diameter, was seen   |
| close to the ground near their chalet only 25 meters away. A coherent |
| beam of light snaked away from the object, ending in midair. It       |
| detached, then retracted into the object. Following this some landing |
| legs appeared. The event lasted three hours, and the UFOs were        |
| tracked by radar at a nearby military base. (Sources: Michel Figuet   |

| Australia, including a woman named Korn, sighted a UFO traveling      |
| slowly at 30,000 feet that changed course to the south. It was        |

| which shot north. The main light made an abrupt turn, then zig-zagged |
| to the east. (Source: Gladstone Observer, May 9, 1973).               |

| 1975 - A ground ring was discovered this day in a pasture in          |
| Doughboy, New South Wales, Australia. It was an almost perfect circle |
| of dead grass, with an inside diameter of 3.3m and an outside         |
| diameter of 4.6m. The circle deteriorated, leaving behind bare earth. |
| A cowpad in the circle was completely flattened. (Source: Bill        |

| 1996 - Near Mata do Buraquinho, Minas Gerais State, Brazil at 9:00    |
| p.m. Marcelo Barbosa and his wife Vaudeline were fixing windows in    |
| their house when they saw some bright multicolored lights--white,     |
| yellow, and blue--coming from some woods about 50 meters away. Sr.    |
| Barbosa decided to go out to investigate, and he saw a large white    |
| cloud descend slowly into the woods. From within the cloud a          |
| luminous, disc-shaped object emerged. It was about 8 meters in        |
| diameter, and had a revolving light on top that resembled that on a   |
| police car. It also had two or three bright lit windows. Inside one   |
| of these he was able to see several figures moving around. The object |
| descended and landed briefly, becoming dark, and then bright again.   |
| Before it landed both witnesses saw an L-shaped ramp that had come    |
| out from the bottom of the object. At the object became bright again, |
| it quickly took off a high speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1996    |
