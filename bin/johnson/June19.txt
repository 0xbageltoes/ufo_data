| 1951 - In Sonderborg, Denmark Joseph Matiszewski, a mechanic, heard a |
| whistling sound and saw an object land in a meadow. Approaching       |
| within 50 meters, he found himself paralyzed and observed that birds  |
| had stopped singing and cows seemed to be similarly unable to move.   |
| From the object emerged four handsome men who had brown skin and wore |
| black shiny suits and translucent helmets. Eight objects also emerged |
| from the craft and hovered above it. Other men inside the craft and   |
| on its deck appeared to be making repairs, then the objects flew to   |
| about 100 m altitude and climbed rapidly out of sight. Only then did  |
| the paralysis subside. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia:  |
| A Century of Landings, p. 195, citing UFO Nachrichten, May 1959).     |

| 1968 - On this night Romulo Velazquez, age 25, a miner, saw a UFO     |
| land in Poopo, Oruro, Bolivia. From the landed craft emerged a tall   |
| thin being, to whom the witness felt drawn "as if by a magnet." When  |
| the witness got closer the humanoid took hold of his right wrist and  |
| he then felt paralyzed and lost consciousness. Neighbors, including   |
| police officers, saw the UFO maneuvering for some minutes over Poopo  |
| at a low altitude, illuminating the village like daylight. Emitting   |
| blue rays, it rose and disappeared. Velazquez was found paralyzed on  |
| one side by a stroke, caused by a cerebral hemorrhage. At the landing |
| site there was a wide area of burnt grass. (Sources: David F. Webb    |
| and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case         |
| 1968-33, citing FSR, September-October 1968; Albert S. Rosales,       |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1968).                                      |
