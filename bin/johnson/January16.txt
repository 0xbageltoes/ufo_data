| 1947 – At 11:30 at night in the North Sea an RAF Mosquito pilot       |
| picked up a strange object on radar 50 miles north of the coast of    |
| Holland. The UFO seemed to be taking evasive maneuvers when           |
| approached by the fighter aircraft. The UFO was pursued for 30        |
| minutes until over the Norfolk, England coast, at which point the     |
| object darted away. (Source: APRO Bulletin, December 1977, p. 7).     |

| 1955 – At 1:00 p.m. a pilot of a light plane flying over Talara, Peru |
| encountered a domed, disc-shaped UFO maneuvering at 20,000 feet. It   |
| focused a beam of light onto his plane. He gave chase but the disc    |
| ascended to an altitude too high to follow. (Source: Dominique        |
| Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p. 24, citing the APRO Bulletin). |

| 1957 – The crewmen of a USAF B-25 flying northwest of Fort Worth,     |
| Texas sighted a round, white light at eight o’clock in the evening    |
| making rapid maneuvers in the night sky. It made several 45-degree    |
| turns. The radio compass flipped over toward the UFO and held there   |
| during the duration of the 40-minute sighting. (Source: USAF Project  |
| Blue Book files counted in official statistics).                      |

| 1958 – At 2:30 a.m. a doctor in Villa Velha in the Brazilian state of |
| Espirito Santo and three others witnessed a large silent metallic     |
| Saturn-shaped UFO hovering offshore. It directed a beam of light      |
| downward into the ocean. Later than same day a famous set of          |
| photographs of a Saturn-shaped UFO was taken at 12:15 p.m. from a     |
| Brazilian Navy ship participating in the International Geophysical    |
| Year explorations, and anchored at Trindade Island in the Atlantic    |
| Ocean. Sr. Barauna, the ship’s photographer took the photographs, but |
| over 100 witnesses aboard ship witnessed the maneuvering UFO. The     |
| four photos are somewhat over exposed, but show the object reversing  |
| direction and flying back over a craggy mountaintop. (Sources: Loren  |

| 1966 – At four o’clock in the morning, Mr. Coquil, age 23, was        |
| driving by a pasture in Kerrodien en Bolazec, France when he saw a    |
| luminous, box-shaped UFO rise from the roadside. The object was about |
| five meters in length and had portholes and red lights on the         |
| corners. It passed over his car and landed in a field on the other    |
| side of the road. (Sources: Phenomenes Spatiaux, March 1966; APRO     |

| 1967 – At 6:10 p.m. a man in Charleston, South Carolina saw two round |
| objects in the sky. They were described as silver and blue with a red |
| ring. A beam of light projected from the end. Radar contact with the  |
| object was initially confirmed but later discounted by later analysis |
| of the weather conditions at the time. Six people traveling in a car  |
| between Mount Sunapee and Warner, New Hampshire at around 7 p.m.      |
| encountered a dark, battleship-gray Manta Ray shaped UFO with two     |
| lights. It paced their car for three minutes and later swooped low    |
| over a home. (Sources: Gordon D. Thayer, in Edward Condon (ed.)       |

| 1969 – While driving down a highway in Las Pajanosas, Spain in        |
| Sevilla province a man and his dog encountered an illuminated         |
| rectangle on or near the ground at 10:30 p.m. His dog began howling.  |
| The silhouettes of beings could be seen moving around in front of the |
| lighted source for the ten minutes the UFO was on the ground. Later   |
| investigation found three apparent landing imprints, arranged in a    |
| triangle six feet apart. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos,       |

| 1973 - At 7:00 p.m. a domed, metallic object followed a car near      |
| Winston-Salem, North Carolina and the car was raised off the road by  |
| the object. The two witnesses felt weightless and they could not      |
| control the car until the object had departed. (Source: Mark          |

| 1977 – On a clear and cloudless morning a giant flying saucer         |
| appeared over the southwestern part of Moscow, Russia. It was         |
| photographed as it hovered for more than an hour. It had a            |
| grayish-blue surface, but was distinctly visible against the blue     |
| sky. (Source: Paul Stonehill, The Soviet UFO Files, p. 69).           |

| 1979 – Two women teachers, Ms. Griselda and Ms. Gonzalez, in the city |
| of David in Panama, sighted an oval-shaped UFO in the evening while   |
| walking home from night school. The UFO was spinning and gave off     |
| orange and blue lights. It stopped and changed direction without      |
| turning, and made no sound. (Source: Jane Thompson, UFO Newsclipping  |
| Service, March 1979, p. 15; citing El Sol, January 18, 1979).         |

| 1991 – Three notable reports occurred on this evening. At eight p.m.  |
| in Bettignies, France a car’s headlights dimmed and the car radio     |
| experience radio interference when a huge black, delta-shaped craft   |
| passed by at a low altitude. The UFO rose to a higher altitude and    |
| flew off rapidly toward the east. At 7:50 p.m. in Gulf Breeze,        |
| Florida a red ball of light was sighted over the Sikes Bridge. It     |
| moved west, hovered, and then drifted in the sky for five minutes.    |
| That same evening in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma a UFO that first         |
| appeared as a white light made an abrupt turn and revealed four red   |
| lights. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, January 1997; Bruce S.       |

| 1992 – At four o’clock in the afternoon a gray disc swooped down over |
| a car with four passengers and pursued it for seven minutes in        |
| Columbus, Georgia. (Source: Paul Ferrughelli, Computer Catalogue of   |

| 1995 – A 40-year-old man looked out of the window of a store at 5:45  |
| p.m. and saw a UFO over a shopping mall in Miami, Florida. He ran     |
| outside to view it more closely. The multi-colored disc-shaped object |
| was rolling in loops on a trajectory that passed in front of a nearby |
| building. It continued rolling as it flew away, and was in view for   |
| three minutes. (Source: Mary Margaret Zimmer, MUFON field             |

| 2003 – Several interesting cases occurred on this day. At 4:25 a.m.   |
| in Marbella, Spain a round UFO with three flower petal-like shapes    |
| around its center was seen in the sky for five minutes. It was silver |
| in color with black circles, and a silver framework was visible on    |
| the object. At 1:34 a.m. EST in Westchester county, New York a        |
| witness in Portchester sighted a large dark object in the night sky   |
| with a watery reflection. It looked to be cylindrical in shape. At    |
| 4:30 p.m. in Wildrose, North Dakota a man called to report that he    |
| saw a gray triangular UFO in the sky that was making a buzzing or     |
| humming noise. He reported that he got to within an eighth of a mile  |
| of the object before it flew away. (Source: Peter Davenport, National |
