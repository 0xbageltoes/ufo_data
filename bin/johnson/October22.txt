| 1954 - At four o'clock in the morning an object that resembled a      |
| white cloud with lights on each end descended over a country road in  |
| Segre, Maine-et-Loire, France. It illuminated the road like daylight. |

| 1954 - At 7:20 p.m. engine of a motorcycle died in Ecaillon, Nord,    |
| France and then a cigar-shaped UFO was seen in a field by the rider.  |
| Four of more beings were seen inside the craft. One spoke an          |
| unintelligible language which sounded like "Chinese" to the listener. |

| 1954 - At 11:00 p.m. a disc-shaped object emerged from the ocean off  |
| the coast of Guethary, Pyrenees-Atlantiques, France. When it dove     |
| down it illuminated the surface of the water. It then made a final    |
| ascent and flew away. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case |
| 4040, citing Jean Sider, Dossier 1954 et l'Imposture Rationaliste, p. |
| 118).                                                                 |

| 1954 - At 3:15 p.m. a cigar-shaped object with portholes maneuvered   |
| in the sky over a school in Marysville, Ohio accompanied by many      |
| smaller discs. It was witnessed by 60 students of Jerome Elementary   |
| School and teachers Rodney Warrick and Mrs. George Dittmar, as well   |
| as thousands of witnesses at an afternoon high school football game.  |
| The silver cigar-shaped object traveled at high speed, and wafted a   |
| blanket of a web-like material, commonly referred to as "angel hair," |
| which fell to the ground over a three mile area. The UFO flew off     |
| quickly in a westward direction. Within minutes of touching the       |
| substance it would disappear, leaving a green stain on the fingers.   |

| 1957 - UFO was seen on the ground near the beach in Praia Grande,     |
| Santa Catarina state, Brazil. It Illuminated the area with beams of   |
| light, it took off toward the east, then ascended vertically into the |
| sky very fast. (Source: Loren E. Gross, The Fifth Horseman of the     |

| 1959 - A disc-shaped object paced a car in Cumberland, Maryland at    |
| dusk, and stayed 50 feet overhead while the car's engine, lights and  |
| radio stopped working. The disc then shot up into the clouds, and the |
| car returned to normal operation. (Source: Coral & Jim Lorenzen,      |

| 1967 - Tracks of tiny creatures were discovered in a field in         |
| Charleswood, British Columbia, Canada clustered around a small pile   |
| of stones laid in a circular heap, after 17 witnesses reported seeing |
| mysterious lights in the area. (Source: Dennis Stamey, Flying Saucers |

| 1972 - Enrique Mercado, who had been involved in other alien          |
| encounters, was lounging on the terrace of his house in Mexico City,  |
| Mexico at 8 p.m. when a very tall young man suddenly appeared behind  |
| him. The man asked: "Enrique, do you want to come with me?" Enrique   |
| agreed. The young man straddled Enrique as he grabs a girdle on the   |
| man's coveralls. Then they fly through the air, inside an apparently  |
| invisible beam, into a hovering saucer-shaped object. Inside the      |
| craft Mercado is surprised at the apparent simplicity of the craft's  |
| furnishings. There is a table with multi-colored buttons, a screen on |
| the wall, and two armchairs. The saucer then flew into a hovering     |
| mothership, around which other saucers were hovering. Mercado is then |
| given a green coverall to wear and he is introduced to the commander  |
| of the vessel, a huge man over two meters tall, who wore a blue       |
| coverall. The commander's name was Yastek, and he showed Mercado what |
| he called "sky charts". Enrique is informed he is at a point some     |
| 100,000 kilometers above Mexico City. Suddenly, he finds himself on   |
| the balcony of his house, and two hours have elapsed. (Source: Albert |

| 1973 - At 7:35 p.m. two people and three dogs in a car just west of   |
| Blacy, Marne, France encountered a silent, faceted sphere over the    |
| roadside, causing them temporary paralysis. The object turned and     |
| flew to the north, then shot off to the east. (Source: Bernard        |

| 1973 - At 2:00 p.m. a globe-shaped object was seen hovering in the    |
| sky for 30 minutes over Sudbury, Massachusetts by Ms. J. Margolin and |
| a friend. Some web-like "angel hair" material fell from the sky.      |
| (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, March 1974, p. 1).                   |

| 1973 - The first in a series of three independent observations of two |
| silver-suited, four foot tall humanoids occurred in Hartford City,    |
| Indiana on this night. While driving home Ms. Debbie Carne saw the    |
| creatures slowly cross the road in front of her. As she drove past    |
| them on the roadside they made a loud noise and raised their arms as  |
| if to scare her. About 15 minutes after the first encounter by Ms.    |
| Carne, Mr. & Mrs. Donathan approached the same area in a car and saw  |
| the same or a similar pair of beings on the road. They were described |
| as wearing bright silver suits, straight in form and with no features |
| noticed except box-like feet. The pair moved in a clumsy, flopping    |
| manner as they tried to get off the road ahead of the approaching     |
| car. Mr. Donathan described this as a dancing effect. A snake-like    |
| pattern of lights was seen dancing over the field. The next day       |
| imprints were found in the field where the beings had last been seen. |

| circled buildings in downtown Covington, Kentucky and then hovered.   |
| It had rotating lights.  (Sources: Leonard H. Stringfield, Skylook,   |

| 1977 - At 7:30 p.m., in the second sighting by Dr. Wellaide Carvalho  |
| in Colares, Para State, Brazil a bright metallic object, thimble      |
| shaped, was seen spinning over a beach at 100 meters altitude and a   |
| distance of 1500 meters. It moved in a wavy rocking motion, making    |
| quick stops. (Source: Bob Pratt, Operacao Prato, p. 15).              |

| 2002 - At 10:25 p.m. in Granisle, British Columbia a large glowing    |
| orange disc hovered over an old copper mine on an island in the lake. |
| It rose up, stopped, moved sideways, then dropped down. The intensity |
| of its light changed when it moved. It cast a reflection on the lake, |
| and finally flew off toward the north at a low altitude. (Sources:    |
