| 1869 - Around midday a luminous square body settled near the center   |
| of an empty lot in Adamstown, Pennsylvania in Lancaster county. It    |
| shot up a shiny column four feet high and two feet thick that         |
| glittered like burnished silver. It gradually faded away, and was     |
| gone in 10 minutes. It frightened the four witnesses, but left no     |
| traces. (Source: Skylook, March 1972).                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - At 7:30 p.m. Gabriel Coupal, age 13, and another boy were out  |
| riding a horse when they saw a luminous, nine foot wide sphere land   |
| 150 feet away from them in Hemmingford, Quebec. After landing the     |
| sphere turned black. A door opened, and "a big tall man with big      |
| round eyes" got out. He was dressed in a skintight black rubber diver |
| suit that covered his entire body except his head, and was carrying   |
| what looked like a "machine gun." There was a "buzz like a bee." The  |
| man approached and the boys galloped their horse for the house. The   |
| UFO rose, passed close by them, and landed again near the horse barn. |
| It "had a black cable with a square thing hanging" from it. In the    |
| moonlight the landed UFO looked "like a soap bubble," and three men   |
| were seen walking around it. Mrs. Coupal telephoned Hemmingford to    |
| get another witness, but when three more people arrived the object    |
| took off, glowing orange. It had been present for an hour or more.    |
| There was a circle of flattened grass 30 feet in diameter where the   |
| object had rested. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:    |

| Dittmar, Civilian Saucer Intelligence; newspaper clipping, August 17, |

| 1954 - On the same evening at 11:28 p.m. the German military in       |
| Kaiserlautern, Rhineland-Palatine, Germany witnessed a UFO that       |
| changed shape from an ovoid object to a sphere, and then to a dome.   |

| 1961 - On this day in Heaton Morr, England near Manchester a          |
| cigar-shaped cloud was seen to release 20 or more smaller objects as  |
| it passed overhead. (Source: Jacques                                  |

| 1962 - At just before midnight a nocturnal light was sighted over a   |
| Titan nuclear missile silo near Oracle, Arizona in Pinal County. Air  |
| Force jets were scrambled to chase the object. The light flew away    |
| and came back, then rose vertically and was gone. (Sources: APRO      |
| Bulletin, September 1962, p. 1; Coral E. Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole    |
| Story, p. 235).                                                       |

| 1965 - At four o'clock in the afternoon a medical doctor--a           |
| gynecologist--and two other witnesses saw a yellow luminous           |
| disc-shaped object, 50 feet in diameter, land in San Pedro de los     |
| Altos, Venezuela. A shaft of light came down from the object. Inside  |
| the beam descended two 7-8 feet tall men with long blond hair. They   |
| wore seamless metallic coveralls. They communicated telepathically    |
| with the witnesses. (Source: Horacio Gonzalez Ganteaume, FSR,         |
| March-April 1969, p. 21).                                             |

| 1967 - At 2:00 a.m. Pedro Riera of San Bernardino, Caracas, Venezuela |
| was awakened when his bed was suddenly shaken, and he saw in front of |
| him a small being with an unusally large head wearing a "rubber       |
| suit." Sr. Riera jumped out of bed and grabbed the little man, but he |
| wriggled free and went out the second floor window of his bedroom.    |
| Riera looked out and saw a round, multicolored luminous object so     |
| brilliant that he had to close his eyes. In the morning he found      |
| deposits of a rust-like substance, and small footprints in this       |
| "rust" on the pavement below his balcony. Several neighbors had       |
| observed the UFO. Two teenagers and a child saw a saucer-shaped       |
| object on the ground on the same street as Riera lived. (Sources:     |

| 1967 - That afternoon in Caracas, Venezuela a physician, Dr. Sanchez  |
| Vegas, had a most unusual visit from a four foot tall alien in his    |
| office at the Caracas Hospital. The man wore a silver suit, spoke     |
| perfect Spanish, and moved strangely. The creature talked to the      |
| doctor and told him he wanted a physical exam. The being had no ear   |
| orifices, round shaped eyes, ten teeth, a higher than normal          |
| temperature, and a faster than normal heartbeat. (Sources: APRO       |

| Whole Story, p. 75; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of |

| 1967 - That evening at 9:00 p.m. a motorcyclist named Alcazar in      |
| Igries, Huesca province, Spain saw a disc-shaped UFO object fly 150   |
| meters above him and land. It was white in color and blinked three    |
| times as it landed. The witness panicked and fled, but others saw it. |
| (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Catalogue of 200 Type-I UFO    |
| Events in Spain and Portugal, case 49).                               |
| 1968 - On this date a very important and well investigated abduction  |
| case occurred on the shores of Lake Champlain near Milton, Vermont.   |
| In the late afternoon at a private camp called Buff Ledge two teenage |
| camp counselors, a man and a woman, had stayed behind from a campwide |
| swimming meet and were relaxing by the dock on their day off. They    |
| saw a large, glowing cigar-shaped object swoop low over the lake in   |
| the distance. Three small round objects left the large "mothership,"  |
| which then departed. Two of the small objects also left, but the      |
| third, a domed disc-shaped craft, descended close to the witnesses.   |
| It had a transparent dome and a revolving rim. The craft approached   |
| the dock and hovered very close to the witnesses. Two beings could be |
| seen inside the dome. They had large elongated heads, huge eyes, two  |
| nasal openings, and small mouths. The beings apparently communicated  |
| telepathically with the witnesses. They had no conscious recollection |
| of what happened next, and the next thing they remembered it is       |
| getting dark and they heard the campers returning from their swim     |
| meet. They had lost track of at least an hour of time.                |
|                                                                       |
| They never talked about the incident because the camp ended the next  |
| day and they went their separate ways. Years later the man contacted  |
| UFO investigator Walter Webb about his missing time experience. He    |
| remembered that the girl was planning to attend a college in the      |
| southeastern U.S. By knowing the name of the woman's college, Webb    |
| was able to track the second witness down by contacting her college's |
| alumni department. He called her and asked her if she would like to   |
| come back to New England and talk about the incident. She agreed, and |
| through hypnosis both witnesses independently recalled nearly         |
| identical accounts of their abduction experience.                     |
|                                                                       |
| They gave separate but nearly identical accounts of what happened to  |
| them. When the UFO moved over the dock they were bathed in light from |
| the object, and both witnesses went into a trance state. They were    |
| taken onboard the craft, although they had no recollection of how     |
| they had gotten there. They were both given medical examinations on a |
| table. They both gave independent accounts of recalling seeing nearly |
| identical instrument panels and other instruments. There sketches of  |
| the aliens and the UFO craft were quite similar. When they awoke on   |
| the dock it was evening. An independent witness, a camper who had run |
| down to the lake ahead of all the others, saw the lighted UFO as it   |
| departed the scene. (Sources: Walter N. Webb, Encounter at Buff       |

| 1970 - At 11:30 a.m. in Saladare, Ethiopia a red glowing ball of fire |
| swept through the village, destroying houses, uprooting trees, and    |
| melting asphalt. It seemed to hover in place and then back-tracked.   |
| It caused eight serious injuries and the death of a little girl.      |

| 1976 - At ten p.m. a father and son in Malone, Wisconsin saw an       |
| object the size of a small camper, with revolving multicolored        |
| lights, land in a hayfield. The son drove to the landing site and saw |
| in his car headlights two green men, five foot seven inches tall. The |
| beings put their hands over their eyes, and vanished. (Sources: Fond  |
