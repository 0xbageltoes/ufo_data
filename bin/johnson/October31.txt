| 1952 - At 7:40 p.m. in Fayetteville, Georgia on highway 85 USAF Lt.   |
| James Allen watched an 80 foot long orange, blimp-shaped object. It   |
| flew at treetop level and crossed over Allen's car. As Lt. Allen's    |
| car passed underneath it his radio went completely dead. The UFO      |
| hovered for 20 seconds, then climbed up at a 45 degree angle and      |
| climbed out of sight at a tremendous speed in 30-40 seconds. The      |
| sighting lasted one minute. (Sources: U.S. Air Force Project Blue     |

| 1953 - At Logansville, Ohio at 7:30 p.m. a huge, Ferris wheel shaped  |
| object with many multicolored lights appeared in the sky. It's        |
| apparent size was 30 cm at arms length. It flew rapidly to the west,  |
| and turned and shot off to the south. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs:  |

| 1954 - Mr. P. Petit and his employee, Mr. Tillier, with shop owner    |
| Mr. Pecquet, saw an oval object on the ground in Corrompu, Somme,     |
| France. When it took off the lights of a tractor went out. It         |
| measured about 4.5 meters (15 feet) in length and emitted a bright    |
| light similar to a welder's torch. It came back, turned, and flew off |
| toward the southwest. It reportedly made the same noise as a swarm of |
| bees. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of     |

| 1957 - At midnight in Longchaumois, France a businessman and his wife |
| saw a large, lighted object with openings, which hovered, came to     |
| ground level, and took off with a great increase in brightness as it  |
| flew away at very high speed, but without noise. (Source: Jacques     |

| 1958 - At 3:50 p.m. an elliptical, aluminum object was first spotted  |
| flying at two kilometers altitude in Caledon East, Ontario but it     |
| quickly descended to just four meters above the ground. It flew       |
| up-and-down by sudden jumps at the ground level, less than 200 meters |
| away, for five minutes. It had a red light at one end that changed to |
| a fiery color, then the object exploded. The witness ran. (Source:    |

| 1959 - Two brothers with the last name of Hawkins were followed for   |
| 95 kilometers between Marton and Matamata, New Zealand by a luminous  |
| object that looked like a large street lamp. The UFO maneuvered       |

| 1963 - At 4:15 a.m. Jim Davidson saw an object about three meters     |
| long in Daylston, Victoria, Australia with orange and red lights. It  |
| approached his pickup truck, flew ahead of him, then flew off and     |
| seemed to land behind a hill. Two other witnesses independently       |
| reported a maneuvering light. (Sources: Sylvia Sutton, Flying Saucer  |

| 1963 - At two p.m. a farmer, Sr. Issuo Oikiti, another adult, and a   |
| child saw a luminous object resembling a huge aluminium ball near the |
| Peropava River in Iguape, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. It "writhed and    |
| struggled" in the air, hit a palm tree, changed direction while       |
| spinning, crossed to the other side of the river, and plunged into    |
| the water. The water seemed to boil after the object fell into the    |
| water. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, January-February 1964, pp. 1-2; Jim & |

| 1971 - At 8:30 p.m. a witness out for a walk in Tinley Park, Illinois |
| saw three lights in the sky that got closer together, very low in     |
| sky. A lot of dogs started barking wildly at the time. The UFO leaned |
| toward the witness, 200 feet away, revealing a disk silhouette. The   |
| witness got scared, then it backed away, and floated out of sight.    |

| Reconquista, Santa Fe Province, Argentina on Route 98, Alphonzo L.    |
| and his wife saw, about 400 meters away something that looked like a  |
| railway car, but with a double row of small windows. It was weakly    |
| illuminated by a yellowish light. Inside it they could make out a     |
| group of humanoid beings of tall stature, moving around in a hurried  |
| manner. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of   |

| 1976 - At about 6:00 p.m. the witness was being driven back home by   |
| her husband on his motorcycle, and was going west on Figueroa Avenue  |
| in Los Angeles, California. As they drove in front of a hotel, she    |
| looked up and saw a metallic disc-shaped craft, shooting up from      |
| behind the buildings. The object remained at a height of 100 feet as  |
| it traveled in a straight line, occasionally dipping by 30 feet.      |
| Rounding a curve, the sun shone on the object, and it appeared to     |
| turn transparent. Inside, she was able to see three or four human     |
| like figures. Two of them were looking at her, and they were leaning  |
| over a console or platform. She commented that the men looked very    |
| handsome. She gave them the peace sign, but they did not respond,     |
| displaying no emotion just curiosity. The couple attempted to follow  |
| the object but eventually lost sight of it. (Source: Albert S.        |

| 1976 - Woody Polston's abduction occurred on this night from a        |
| campsite in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. He made contact with  |
| a big cylindrical kind of disc-shaped object, then a second huge      |
| craft. He watched the two craft for 2-3 minutes before he entered     |
| a semi-conscious state, followed by his alien abduction experience    |
| for the next 12 hours. After the abduction he was plaged by           |
| nightmares, and his watch was affected. The watch was 10 hours slow.  |

| 1978 - A group of ten youngsters were sitting around chatting in a    |
| field in Loose Valley, near Maidstone, Kent, England at around        |
| midnight. After about 45 minutes of talk a boy named Will leapt to    |
| his feet and began slapping his head, saying that there was a bee in  |
| his hair. He looked absolutely terrified. A girl named Dorothy and    |
| another witness then saw a tall, thin figure wearing a hat, "dancing" |
| behind him. Will said later that it was as if a terrifically loud     |
| buzzing was coming up through the top of his head. However, only one  |
| other person present, Rachel, heard any buzzing. Partially satisfied  |
| that they had stumbled on a bee's nest they moved a distance away. As |
| they moved Dorothy and Will saw a ring outlined in the grass that     |
| enclosed where they had been sitting. Eventually it started to rain,  |
| so the group headed for Rachel's house. As they left one of the young |
| men turned around and saw the same thin black figure walk across the  |
| opening between some trees to where they had been sitting.            |
|                                                                       |
| Later, while sitting in Rachel's bedroom, one of the young men looked |
| at Will and saw an amorphous black blob drop out of his hair onto the |
| bed. He was the only one who saw this. A few seconds later a black    |
| shape started whizzing around the room. The main movement was from    |
| bottom left to top right and getting larger during its flight. This   |
| created a great fright among those present. Altogether four witnessed |
| this strange phenomenon. Later on the girls slept in a room together, |
| and Rachel and Dorothy again saw a black blob in the curtains during  |
| the night. Upon awakening, one of the young men saw the thin black    |
| figure silhouetted against some wardrobe doors. (Source: Albert S.    |

| 1981 - Shortly after 9 p.m. a huge, bright, round object was observed |
| flying at 180 meters altitude through the sky in Marcos Juarez,       |
| Cordoba, Argentina. It was witnessed by Pedro Heslop of Austral       |
| Airlines and Alberto Paracampo of Aerolineas Argentinas, pilots       |
| of commercial flights coming in for landings. (Sources: Joe Graziano, |

| lights in a V-formation. One dozen more people watched it with her.   |
| Mr. Wescon, a 44-year-old engineer, watched the 12 or more lights in  |
| the V-formation fly over his location; it had steady red and white    |
| lights. When the object stopped to hover, its lights began to flash.  |

| 1989 - A woman named Iva Gospina, who had previously witnessed        |
| various UFOs maneuvering over the area of Brovary, Kiev region,       |
| Ukraine, woke up in the early morning hours around three a.m. feeling |
| apprehensive, and suspecting someone had broken into her apartment.   |
| She checked around the apartment and found her family sleeping, and   |
| everything else seemed in order. She then looked out the window, and  |
| noticed to her surprise a short woman wearing a tight-fitting black   |
| suit standing at her door. The woman had long straight white hair     |
| down to her shoulders; there also appeared to be a small black dog    |
| standing next to the woman, but since it was dark the witness could   |
| not see any other details. Still feeling apprehensive, she walked     |
| back into the living room and attempted to sleep on the couch.        |
| Suddenly, a large luminous yellow circle slowly entered through the   |
| closed blinds of the window. Three figures, similar to people, then   |
| appeared standing on her carpet. The figures wore diver’s suits       |
| similar to cosmonauts or robots, and were approximately 140-150 cm in |
| height. Two of them wore diving suits similar in color to frosted     |
| glass, and the third wore a golden, scaly suit. The yellow light was  |
| now arranged in a semi-circle above the figure’s heads. The beings    |
| stood quietly without moving or speaking. In a state of panic she     |
| mentally commanded the figures to depart. Immediately they vanished,  |
| and the luminous yellow circle floated slowly out the window. The     |
| room became absolutely dark again. Iva stood up and rushed to the     |
| window, feeling some regret that the figures had left, and she yelled |
| out for them to return in despair, thinking that she had lost a       |
| unique chance in her life to communicate with extraterrestrial        |
| beings. Later that night as she attempted to sleep she heard and      |
| “felt” a large figure enter her room and stand over her. She then     |
| felt completely paralyzed and was unable to move, and couldn’t even   |
| open her eyes from fear. Again she panicked and mentally commanded    |
| the alien to leave. The next morning she learned from her neighbors   |
| that a red luminous object had been seen hovering over the area. She  |
| then believed that the three aliens who had entered her apartment had |
| come in peace, and she regretted panicking during her contact         |
| experience. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1989 Humanoid Sighting        |

| dazzling object descending towards the ground in Mezhriybaza,         |
| Uzbekistan. After the object landed, a tall, robot-like being wearing |
| a silvery suit emerged from the object. Terrified, Saidov was unable  |
| to move, and apparently next lost consciousness. Waking up later, he  |
| found himself in a desert-like location standing among the sand       |
| dunes. He could see hills and pyramids around him. He saw a man and   |
| woman exit one of the pyramids, but he remained paralyzed, and felt   |
| the ground under him become soft. He soon lost consciousness again.   |
| Later, he found himself standing next to his car close to the         |
| village. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1989 Humanoid Sighting Reports   |

| 1989 - On this evening a couple was watching several hovering orange  |
| lights in a "W” formation in Greenville, South Carolina, and decided  |
| to videotape them. Later, while playing back the results, they        |
| discovered a small, two-foot tall humanoid figure running past their  |
| bedroom window on the SW corner of the house. The figure appeared to  |
| be holding his arms up to his face. (Sources: MUFON UFO Journal,      |

| 1990 - An employee at a local forestry preserve was doing some work   |
| at the pheasant hatchery in County Tipperary, Ireland at 6:30 p.m.    |
| when he noticed a yellowish light fall into the forest area. He       |
| rushed over to the site in his truck, thinking that it might have     |
| been a plane crash. Arriving there, he saw no trace of an aircraft,   |
| but did see a 5-foot-tall man sitting on a wooden railing that        |
| surrounded that part of the forest. The man had long hair and wore    |
| brand new, large jeans and a checkered shirt. Questioning the man,    |
| the witness was told that he was just there to help the poplar trees  |
| in the forest. He acted in a strange fashion and proceeded to explain |
| to the witness in very scientific terms ways the method to cure and   |
| correct tree disease. The witness felt that this last part of the     |
| experience had a dream-like quality to it. He last saw the short man  |
| walk off into the forest and disappear. Later the witness saw a       |
| bright light zigzagging over the forest. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,  |

| 1992 - On this evening a witness driving a pickup truck on a rural    |
| road on Gaither Mountain, Arkansas saw, standing by the roadway, a    |
| short gray-skinned humanoid with a large head and huge black eyes     |
| only 15 feet away. The witness apparently blacked out and experienced |
| at least 30 minutes of missing time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1992 |

| 1995 - At 7:00 p.m. in Tacoma, Washington a witness called the UFO    |
| Reporting Center to report a bright ball of light landing in a nearby |
| field. Two hours later a second witness saw a nocturnal light zigzag  |
| through the sky and shoot off into the distance. (Source: Peter       |

| 2001 - At 4:00 a.m. a well defined blue object, which was fat at both |
| ends but slim in the middle, was seen over Wisbech, Cambridgeshire,   |
| England. (Source: British Ministry of Defense, case 2001-173).        |

| 2001 - Derek Holmes, age 66, spotted a round, white airborne object   |
| with curved edges while driving while driving home on Bonsall Moor,   |
| Cromford, Derbyshire, England at 10:32 p.m. Slowing down, he looked   |
| but could not find a safe place to stop on the narrow road to capture |
| the brilliant image on filme. Despite having a camera with him in the |
| car, he was too slow to get a photo. The size of the light went down, |
| as if someone hit a dimmer switch, and it went yellow. It moved into  |
| the distance and then disappeared. (Source: George A. Filer & David   |
