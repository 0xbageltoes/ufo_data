| 1897 - At 12:30 a.m. in Bay City, Michigan a large object was sighted |
| high in the sky. It gradually descended and was estimated to be       |
| around 50 to 70 feet in length. It had a red light at each end, that  |
| gave the conical shaped craft a dull red glow. It moved at a rapid    |
| pace, then slowed. (Sources: Lucius Farish newspaper files; Saginaw   |

| 1897 - On the same night a man named Williams in Greenville, Texas    |
| came upon a landed airship. He described it as an "immense            |
| cigar-shaped vessel" with large wings, and having a "sidewheel like a |

| 1956 - Two police officers, Perkins and Williams, in Lexington,       |
| Kentucky sighted a small, pale-red light in the western sky at 11:55  |
| p.m. They drove closer to get a better look. After 5 minutes the      |
| object disappeared; it left a glow in the sky for a few seconds. The  |
| object appeared to change shape, from round to ellipse, and then back |
| to a circle again. (Sources: Lexington Herald, April 17, 1956;        |

| 1974 - At around 12:50 a.m. a classic Italian CE-III case that has    |
| defied explanation occurred in Santa Maria del Tempio, Casale         |
| Monferrato, Piemonte district, Italy. Mauro Bellingeri and his wife   |
| had just arrived home when a luminous disc-shaped object came out of  |
| the sky at them, and then stopped over their house 40 feet up. The    |
| craft had a central ring of revolving red, green, and yellow lights   |
| that revolved around the cabin. The object made no sound as it        |
| hovered there. The couple could see a round, clear, dome-shaped cabin |
| on the upper portion of the object that was 30 feet wide and six feet |
| high. Inside the cabin there were three seated beings who were        |
| visible, wearing fishbowl or globe-shaped helmets. After several      |
| minutes of just hanging silently in the sky, 4-5 jets of flame were   |
| emitted from the underside of the craft, and the outer rim began to   |
| turn more rapidly. The object started making a whistling sound. With  |
| a strong blast of air that nearly knocked the witnesses down, the     |
| object then took off and flew away. (Sources: Renzo Cabassi, FSR,     |

| 2004 - There was no sound coming from a triangle-like craft seen near |
| Fort Benning, Georgia by a mother and daughter. At 10:20 p.m. a       |
| 47-year-old woman was driving home from Columbus with her 16-year-old |
| daughter when they thought they saw a military helicopter from the    |
| Fort. Upon getting closer the mother thought it resembled more of a   |
| Stealth Bomber with a triangle shape. They slowed down and rolled     |
| down their car windows, which revealed there was no sound coming from |
| the craft. Near Ellerslie, in Harris County, Georgia, they then       |
| observed the dark triangle hovering at a relatively low altitude. It  |
| had blinking red and green lights at the rear, and it was projecting  |
| a spotlight beam with an adjacent blue light under each wing. The     |
| daughter became a little concerned and said they needed to get out of |
| there, get home, and tell her dad. The mother reported to the MUFON   |
| investigator that she had observed a similar triangular craft before, |
| along with her older daughter, but had never reported it (Source:     |
