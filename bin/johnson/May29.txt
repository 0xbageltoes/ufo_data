| 1950 - At 9:15 p.m. an American Airlines DC-6 flying at 8000'         |
| altitude, climbing from Washington, D.C. and approximately over       |
| Rappahannock, Virginia encountered a spindle-shaped UFO. The          |
| object changed course to parallel the plane, then circled the         |
| aircraft, and reversed direction before it went out of sight very     |
| fast. It had a blue light on its front end. The sighting lasted       |
| approximately one minute, and the object was not detected on radar.   |
| There were three witnesses among the crew: Sperry, Bates, and         |
| Arnholt. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, p. 39; UNICAT,  |

| glowing objects--at least 30--over Downey, California. (Sources: H.   |

| 1952 - Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys -- At approximately 1700   |
| hours two eliptically shaped objects, larger than a fighter aircraft, |
| were observed from the USN aircraft carrier Oriskany CV-34. One       |
| observer watched the objects through a telescope, while the radar     |
| officer viewed the objects on the radar scope. The objects had a      |
| bubble dome on the top. Each object flew at an estimated altitude of  |
| between 10,000 and 15,000 feet at a supersonic speed and left a white |
| vapor trail. The objects' course paralleled that of the carrier. The  |
| duration of the sighting was from 15 to 20 seconds. (Source: Francis  |

| 1955 - Five rhomboid-shaped objects circled the airport at Pisco,     |
| Peru at 11:00 p.m. They flew at one kilometer altitude, and were      |
| viewed through a theodolite. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, August 1955;    |

| 1967 - A "glowing red scallop" shaped object rocked slowly in the sky |
| over Saugus, Massachusetts ay 2:45 a.m., and then shot straight up    |
| out of sight. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs: Interplanetary        |

| 1967 - At one o'clock in the afternoon a small UFO, three feet in     |
| diameter, traveled across Trout Brook Lake in New Brunswick, Canada.  |
| It moved in a "spinning fashion, spraying water seven to eight        |
| feet high, noisy, zipped into bushes. It came back and submerged."    |
| (Source: report form in NICAP files from a military witness named     |
| Nason).                                                               |

| 1968 -  A blindingly bright circular UFO hovered at a low altitude    |
| over Mosinee, Wisconsin at 10:00 p.m. while dogs in the town barked   |
| furiously. There were electromagnetic effects during this close       |
| encounter, and one of the six witnesses felt pressure on his          |
| eardrums. (Source: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience, p. 239).       |

| 1971 - At 4:00 a.m. four men out fishing on Buffumville Reservoir in  |
| Oxford, Massachusetts were approached twice by a dark, domed          |
| disc-shaped object that had a lighted rectangular window. It flipped  |
| on edge to reveal a row of glowing ports around its peimeter. The     |
| object moved up-and-down and back and forth in a pendulum motion.     |

| 1974 - Turis, Valencia, Spain - At 11:00 a.m. Sr. Palmero Camanez, a   |
| 70-year-old farmer, was working in his fields on a sunny, hot day     |
| when he heard what sounded like a police siren. He then saw a         |
| metallic disc-shaped object with a cupola, only 150 meters away from  |
| him. He estimated it was 2.5 meters in diameter and two meters in     |
| height. (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, OVNIS y la Ciencia, p. |

| 1975 - Two metallic hat-shaped discs flew southeast to northwest very |
| quickly over Montlucon, France at 7:00 p.m. They banked to one side   |
| but continued on in a straight line, emitting beams of light.         |

| 1979 - There were two high quality reports of aircraft encounters     |
| with UFOs on this day. The first occurred at five minutes after       |
| midnight over Hailey, Idaho when a Braniff Airlines crew, as well     |
| as private pilots flying in the area, independently reported sighting |
| five orange objects in a line, moving to the left of the airliner.    |
| The objects performed up and down and other maneuvers. The plane's    |
| engines ran rough, and the compass and ADF system temporarily         |
| malfunctioned. The second occurred around noon local time and         |
| was tracked by ground radar at Cerro Moreno Air Force Base in Chile,  |
| who were in radio contact with airborne military personnel, who had a |
| visual sighting of a black triangular object with two small tails.    |
| The object made a turn, then moved in the opposite direction from the |
| aircraft.  (Sources: (1) Richard H. Hall, MUFON UFO Journal, February |

| 1986 - On this night Sr. Flores was lying in his bedroom at home near |
| the city center of Santa Rosa, Argentina when he heard a loud buzzing |
| sound coming from outside. Simultaneously a powerful light came       |
| shining through his window, while dogs in the neighborhood            |
| began barking. As he looked outside he saw an object hovering above   |
| the treetops near his house. He was confronted by two eight-foot tall |
| beings who were blocking his door. These creatures seemed to lack     |
| mouths, noses, and ears; but they had dark eyes and long thin hands   |
| with only three fingers, the middle one being the longest. The beings |
| wore silvery, tight fitting overalls with a wide belt having some     |
| kind of tools or accessories hanging from them. He could also see     |
| that each wore a necklace with a medallion on it. The beings were     |
| busy making quick gestures, when they suddenly vanished. Sr. Flores   |
| could then step outdoors and witnessed a ball shaped object moving at |
| high speed towards the south. (Sources: Patrick Huyghe, A Field Guide |

| 1990 - A disc-shaped object landed by a garage in Frunze in the Asian |
| republic of Kyrgistan at 8:45 a.m. A three meter tall giant and six   |
| short humanoids exited the craft via a ladder, and gathered samples   |
| of oil and soil. (Source: Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1992, p. 67).  |

| 1990 - At 9:45 p.m. a "stingray" shaped craft flew over Evansille,    |
| Indiana at a slow steady pace and low altitude. Its multicolored      |
| lights were yellow, green, and red, and there were at least 15. It    |
| flew over a populated area at only 200 feet from west to east on a    |
| curved flight, and made no sound. (Source: Francis L. Ridge, Regional |

| 1994 - At two o'clock in the morning on Funen Island, Denmark a dog   |
| whined as a UFO with a row of windows went slowly by to the west. An  |
| orange, crescent-shaped object was seen in another town at the same   |
| time. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case # 16392, citing |

| 1998 - A close encounter occurred in North Bend, Ohio in Hamilton     |
| County at 1:30 a.m. A triangular shaped object was seen moving slowly |
| from the northeast to the southwest, crossing the Ohio River at 50    |
| meters altitude. It was making a humming sound, similar to the sound  |
| of static from high tension wires. (Source: Peter Davenport, National |

| 2003 - An early-morning  jogger saw a cross-shaped object with three  |
| big lights that was hovering at a low altitude over Watertown Square  |
| in Watertown, Massachusetts. It was estimated to be no more than 30   |
| stories above the ground when it was seen at 4:45 a.m. It emitted     |
| beams of light that filtered through the fog and mist. It changed     |
| direction, and then silently lifted away. (Source: Peter Davenport,   |

| 2007 - At 11:45 a large triangular shaped object was seen flying at   |
| about 100 feet altitude between Pontrobert and Meiford in Wales,      |
| United Kingdom. It had bright green and blue lights. A second object  |
| with pink pulsating lights was also sighted. (Source: British         |
