| 1935 - In Aznalcazar, Spain a large brilliant, round object descended |
| from the sky 450 meters away and hovered just above the ground in a   |
| field. Several small beings got out and walked around for ten         |
| minutes. The witness, Mr. Mora, thought he had seen an emanation from |
| God. (Sources: Alfredo Moacyr Uchoa, Phenomenes Spatiaux, June 1971,  |

| 1943 - A military pilot reported that over Long Beach, California at  |
| 9:50 a.m. a round, orange object flew alongside and then dove at an   |
| Army Air Force BT13A trainer aircraft. It subsequently shot away.     |

| 1948 - At 2:00 in the afternoon at Holloman Air Force Base, New       |
| Mexico three base personnel reported having witnessed two silent      |
| disc-shaped objects, 35 meters in diameter, executing a series of     |
| violent turns and maneuvers. The discs made no noise during the 30    |
| seconds they were in view, and were viewed through a theodolite. One  |
| of the discs shot up vertically. Project Blue Book listed this as an  |
| "unidentified" case. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Anatomy of a           |

| 1952 - At 10:40 a.m. Mr. and Mrs. L.G. Ryan, R.L. Stokes, and D.      |
| Schook of Phoenix, Arizona watched a large, dull gray disc-shaped     |
| object fly by, followed by two more objects. All three flew straight  |
| and level at high speed. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO  |

| 1952 - Miami, Florida. At 9:15 p.m. four dark circular objects with   |
| mostly fuzzy edges, crossed the face of the Moon. Each was half the   |
| apparent diameter of Moon. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook    |

| 1952 - At 11:30 p.m. Lt. W. R. Holder and Lt. A.M. Jones, the flight  |
| crew of a USAF F-94 jet interceptor, saw a small luminous object      |
| approach Kadena AFB, Japan from the north. It flew straight and level |
| at first at an estimated speed of 1,000 knots, but then began to      |
| maneuver and zigzag. Airborne radar tracked the target for 90         |
| seconds. Control tower operators watched for 50-60 minutes while a    |
| dark shape with a light flew as fast as 330 knots (380 mph). It       |
| hovered, flew curves and performed a variety of maneuvers. (Sources:  |

| 1960 - An orange disk landed in Beira, Mozambique with a hissing      |
| sound, then exploded, while four dwarfish figures ran off into the    |
| brush. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of     |

| 1966 - At 3:00 a.m. Lillian Louis sighted a vapor-like sphere         |
| hovering at a low altitude in Lycoming, New York. The object hovered  |
| low over the ground and was spinning, shooting its exhaust onto the   |
| ground below. The entire episode lasted about a minute. (Source: Don  |

| 1966 - In Alto, Tennessee at 11:55 p.m. witness W. Smith sighted an   |
| oval object with a dark top. The object appeared cone-shaped when     |
| moving. It made a high-frequency noise. The sighting lasted 2.5       |
| hours. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).         |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 5:15 p.m. on Highway 50 west of Sedalia, Missouri a truck   |
| driver reported that a silver disc hovered over the cab of his truck  |
| for more than a minute. (Source: Ted Phillips, Skylook, February      |
| 1968, p. 2).                                                          |

| 1967 - Ninety minutes later, at 7:45 p.m. EDT between Jonestown and   |
| South Lickdale, Pennsylvania on Highway 72 Justice of the Peace John  |
| H. Demler saw a ten-meter diameter blue disc making a humming sound   |
| like an electric motor. The object flew over his car emitting a       |
| chemical odor and sparks. The car's headlights and engine died, and   |
| the car was buffeted about as the object took off. The witness was    |
| very nervous and agitated after the close encounter, and the top      |
| layer of his skin peeled off the next few days. (Sources: NICAP UFO   |
| Investigator, May 1967, p. 6; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A  |
| Century of Landings, case 832).                                       |

| 1967 - At the same time as the Pennsylvania close encounter, the     |
| Dauncey family saw a small glowing sphere with a metallic band around |
| the middle in Peterborough, Ontario. The object emitted two vapor     |
| trails and, making a humming noise, approached and paced the          |
| witnesses' car. (Sources: NICAP files, citing newspaper clipping      |
| dated April 14, 1967; Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A    |
| Thirty-Year Report, p. 335).                                          |

| 1969 - The two witnesses were parked in a remote area of West Nyack,  |
| New York at 7:00 p.m. when they saw a light approach. They got out of |
| the car and saw a large oval-shaped craft with lights around its edge |
| and a beam of light shining from its center. A memory lapse occurred, |
| with one witness vaguely recalling the object landing and shining a   |
| beam of light towards them. Later one of the witnesses remembered     |
| being inside a circular room lying on a white Formica table. He was   |
| surrounded by several humanoids described as being five-foot tall     |
| with pale gray skin, large round heads, and large black eyes. These   |
| beings were well built and wore tight fitting grayish green           |
| coveralls. One being appeared to be the examiner, and he wore a       |
| turtleneck garment and peered intently into the witness's face. At    |
| one point one of the witnesses remembered struggling and thought it   |
| felt that he had been ripped to pieces and then reassembled again.    |

| 1993 - A Houston, Texas UFO abductee had gone to a professional       |
| hypnotist and was given a post-hypnotic suggestion instructing her to |
| defend herself from alien abductors during any subsequent abduction   |
| attempts. On this night she was asleep in her bedroom when she awoke  |
| and saw two short Grey humanoids with large black, oval-shaped eyes   |
| come in through the wall. As one of the beings approached the bed the |
| witness grabbed what seemed to be a black protective eye shield from  |
| the humanoid's eyes. His skin felt rough as she tore the eyepiece     |
| off. A moist liquid fell on the witness arm, described as a           |
| mucus-like substance. The beings then retreated through the wall and  |
| left. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1993,     |

| 2004 - At 11:00 a.m. a witness in Newport, Tennessee spotted a        |
| bizarre flying creature resembling an arrowhead flying backwards,     |
| with what looked like a head or knob on the front. It didn't look     |
| mechanical, it was more like some kind of animal. It did not have     |
| extended wings like a bird but seemed to have some stubby wings which |
| may have been part of the body, like some type of bat. They protruded |
| out near the end and tapered back to a point at the rear. The         |
| creature appeared to be around three feet long and a little over two  |
| feet wide. It was moving very fast in a straight line, at an altitude |
| of approximate 150 feet. The witness did not see any method of        |
| propulsion, such as wing movement. It just seemed to be gliding but   |
| at a high speed. It maintained a level flight path moving westward,   |
| where the witness eventually lost sight of it. It was light brown in  |
| color along the sides of the wings, with a dark body color, possibly  |
| dark brown or black. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact     |
