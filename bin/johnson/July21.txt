| 1947 - At 10:15 a.m. Mr. James E. Petteway of Boise, Idaho briefly    |
| sighted an oval object flying on a straight steady course to the      |
| north-northeast. It was bright, like polished silver, and flew at     |
| an estimated speed of 600 miles per hour, at 7000 feet altitude.      |

| Northrup Aircraft Factory in Los Angeles, California watched as two   |
| flying saucers were sighted hovering and cutting capers over their    |
| aircraft plant for more than an hour. This occurred for a total of    |
| four evenings in a row, beginning at around 7:00 p.m. The objects     |

| 1960 - On this evening a power failure occurred in Miami, Florida     |
| after a misty blue cloud with a bright center was seen. A crowd       |
| chased a "spaceman" wearing bubble headgear "with gold in it" down    |
| Collins Avenue, but lost him. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,  |

| 1965 - In Macias, Entre Rios province, Argentina at eleven o'clock at |
| night Felipe Martinez reportedly met with humanoid UFOnauts for the   |
| third time since they had first contacted him. He was told that the   |
| "space people" would soon show themselves to people everywhere on     |
| earth. They also told him that on December 3 that year they would     |
| return to take Martinez and his family, and then they would then burn |
| up the entire earth as punishment for our disbelief in their          |
| existence. Obviously, none of these prophesized events subsequently   |
| occurred. Four of the crew he met with were little men less than      |
| three feet tall, while the fifth man was over six feet tall and       |
| blond. This last crew member wore metallic plates on his arms, which  |
| had numerous small lights. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,     |

| 1966 - At 7:30 p.m. a man saw a UFO land in the desert near his home  |
| in Van Horn, Texas. Approaching its reddish glow, he ran into three   |
| small creatures standing near a scrub tree. They spun around toward   |
| him, and one of them yelled something in a high-pitched, child like   |
| voice. The little beings then all ran back to the saucer-shaped UFO,  |
| which flashed away seconds later. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted        |

| 1967 - At 12:30 a.m. a 40-year-old witness was out in his garden in   |
| Wissons, France when he noticed a greenish glow on the ground. The    |
| glow was in a nearby field next to a cemetery. Within the glow he     |
| could see two shiny silvery figures moving about, apparently floating |
| just above the ground. The figures soon disappeared from sight.       |
| Later, two V-shaped depressions were found on the ground in the same  |
| area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1967,     |

| 1967 - At 2:30 a.m. Barbara Fawcett, age 18, and her sister saw a     |
| yellow "jagged" object rise above a swamp near Jewfish Creek,         |
| Florida. A dog riding in their car became fearful of the low flying   |
| yellow light, which flew just 15 feet above the roadway in Pompano    |
| Beach. The UFO then veered off to the right and landed on a sand dune |
| to the east of the road. Air Force investigators found a very large   |
| scorched area at the spot. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, July-August 1967, |

| 1967 - On this afternoon in Pamlico County, North Carolina            |
| 14-year-old Ronnie Hill was playing in the garden when he noticed a   |
| strange odor in the air, and his eyes began to tear. He then saw a    |
| spherical object about three meters in diameter descend from the sky  |
| and land in a nearby field. Thinking that nobody would believe him,   |
| he ran inside his home and obtained a small Kodak camera. Once back   |
| outside he saw a small figure emerge from behind the object. The      |
| figure was about 1.25 meters in height, wore a tight-fitting silvery  |
| suit and carried in its hand a black object that it inserted into the |
| ground, The entity then returned to the object, which took off into   |
| the sky at high speed. The odor was described as resembling propane   |
| gas. Ronnie Hill also noticed a total lack of sound during the        |
| encounter. A controversial photograph of the humanoid and UFO         |
| was taken and subsequently publicized. The photograph is widely       |
| regarded as a hoax by UFO investigators, with an eggshell used to     |
| model the UFO. (Source: John A. Keel, FSR, January-February 1969,     |

| 1967 - At 10:15 p.m. a security guard, Sidney Zipkin, age 50, was     |
| driving through a large parking lot in Churchville, New York when he  |
| observed a 16-meter-long cigar-shaped object with green lights under  |
| it land on the parking lot pavement. He stopped his truck within 30   |
| meters of the object with the truck headlights aimed on it, and was   |
| surprised to see two dwarfs dressed in shiny black uniforms rush by   |
| his vehicle and enter the craft, which took off straight up in a      |
| vertical ascent. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A      |

| 1969 - At 1:00 a.m. a bang was heard at the door and the dog          |
| began barking in Cannes, Alpes-Maritime Department, France. Looking   |
| out, two boys saw a small white sphere that was hovering over a rose  |
| bush outside. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case # 8911, |

| 1969 - Waldo, Maine - Randolph Whitcomb had just pulled off Route 137  |
| onto Birches Road at 1:45 a.m. when his car radio "went haywire",     |
| fading into static. Then he noticed that his car hood was reflecting  |
| a red glare. Looking up, he saw a large, glowing red object hovering  |
| low over his vehicle. Startled, Whitcomb raced the three miles home.  |
| The UFO paced him the entire distance and "moved off fast" as he      |
| turned into his driveway. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator,            |

| 1972 - At 8:30 p.m. in Pinelands, Western Cape Province, South Africa |
| a witness by the name of Alexander saw a bright red object only two   |
| or three meters from the ground. It turned orange and then a golden   |
| color. As it rose up it made a large circle in the sky and then shot  |
| off. (Source: Argus, July 22, 1972; FSR, November-December 1972,      |

| Corsica, France felt paralyzed at the same time as the lights, radio, |
| and engine of their vehicle died. They also felt very cold, and while |
| they were unable to move they witnessed a bright shining object rise  |
| from ground, and then shoot into the sky. (Sources: FSR, April 1978,  |

| 1975 - A 40-year-old artist named Malichev, living in Solnechnogorsk, |
| Russia not far from Moscow claimed he had communicated telepathically |
| with three UFO occupants. Their leader, a woman, told him he had a    |
| stable psychological system, which was why they had contacted him.    |
| They arrived in the middle of the afternoon on this day in a          |
| disc-shaped craft with three antennae. He was taken on an             |
| otherworldly journey, apparently to a planet with three moons.        |

| 1977 - At 4:15 a.m. Police Officer John W. Bruner, a deputy sheriff,  |
| was on duty In Porter, Texas and was the first person to observe the  |
| UFO. Officer Bruner and his partner Officer Coogler were parked west  |
| of the object, which appeared to be approximately hald a mile to a    |
| mile away. Bruner and Coogler got out of their vehicle and tried to   |
| observe the object better by shinning their light on it. The object   |
| moved toward the men and the officers turned off the light because    |
| they became nervous at seeing the object's response to their light.   |
| The object then moved back to its original location. They agreed that |
| the object appeared to have six portholes surrounding a type of       |
| framework. The two officers observed the UFO for approximately 45     |
| minutes. During that time period, the UFO appeared to stand still in  |
| mid air, pulsate, travel at incredible speeds, and fly erratically.   |
| The officers described the UFO's apparent size to be about that of a  |
| grapefruit at arm's length. Officer Bruner was convinced that the     |
| object he saw was neither a balloon nor a helicopter. (Source: NICAP  |

| 1991 - Two flying humanoids, a man and a woman, landed on the hood of |
| a truck moving at 50 mph down a highway near La Tigra, Argentina,     |
| and remained seated there until they got to town. They were described |
| as very tall and very pale in complexion, and had blond hair and      |
| wore tight-fitting white uniforms.The lone male truck driver said     |
| that the beings remained sitting on the hood until the truck          |

| 1991 - Three young girls (ages 10-12) had stayed up late to watch a   |
| TV program and had gone into the backyard to play on a trampoline in  |
| Springfield, Missouri at two o'clock in the morning. They noticed a   |
| white, oval-shaped light moving rapidly from the side of the house to |
| a corner of the backyard, where a large tree stood. One of the girls  |
| then noticed a strange-looking humanoid figure standing near the      |
| trampoline. It was about 4½ feet tall and completely white in color,  |
| with thin long arms and a huge pear-shaped head that was completely   |
| bald. It had two large black almond-shaped eyes, and it was very      |
| skinny with long skinny fingers on its long arms. The girls next ran  |
| back into the house and attempted to tell an older cousin of the      |
| incident, but the cousin ignored them and went back to bed. The girls |
| then went back into the den and resumed watching television. Moments  |
| later their cat began acting strangely and the television screen went |
| blank. At this point all three then saw the same humanoid again,      |
| looking at them through a window. The humanoid moved its head in a    |
| jerky mechanical manner. The girls ran and hid in the basement, where |
| they stayed for the remainder of the night. (Sources: David F. Webb & |

| 1994 - At two o'clock in the afternoon an oval-shaped object was      |
| observed hovering over Taharti Lake, British Columbia, Canada for     |
| three minutes. It was about the size of a car. All of the witnesses   |
| returned to their cabin, but that night all five witnesses are unable |
| to account for the next 24 hours. Their UFO sighting and the missing  |
| time incident is reported to the RCMP. (Source: Frank Ducks, 1994     |

| 1997 - A craft flying at 15 meters altitude with three white fixed    |
| lights was seen in Cholet, Maine-Loire department, France. Its speed  |
| was slow, and the encounter lasted 10 minutes. A deafening buzz could |
| be heard during the passage of this object. (Source: GEIPAN, case #   |

| 2002 - Argentine Policeman Guillermo Arias was on patrol in Chaj'n,   |
| Cordoba Province, Argentina at 11:00 p.m. when a radio call alerted   |
| him that police in neighboring Achiras had sighted lights heading     |
| toward them.  As he was driving his police patrol van he spotted a    |
| formation of seven lights, and followed them for 10 kilometers down a |
| rural dirt road when his vehicle's engine died, his dashboard lights  |
| and interior lights began turning on and off, and his radio went      |
| haywire with the dial displaying random frequencies. The van also     |
| filled with an acrid odor like burnt wiring. Badly frightened, Arias  |
| ran from his van and in the process lost his mobile phone. At this    |
| point an immense light rose from an adjacent field, coming from a     |
| large, 200 meter long, triangular object. He described it as looking  |
| like a "floating city" with a long row of about 100 windows.          |
|                                                                       |
| Sr. Arias then saw something moving behind him, which he described as |
| "non-human" in appearance. Numerous beams of light came out of the    |
| giant triangle craft, directed at the ground for several seconds. The |
| object suddenly rose and sped away, illuminating the area like        |
| daylight. Recovering from his fear, Arias returned to the van and     |
| notified his fellow officers of his experience. He was told that      |
| reinforcements were being sent out to meet him. Patrolman Barrios     |
| from Achiras talked to him over the radio, trying to keep him calm,   |
| while Sgt. Medina was the first backup officer to arrive on the       |
| scene. He was joined by Sgt. Cordoba, among other officers, who       |
| reached the rural location to lend their assistance to their comrade  |
| in distress. (Source: George Filer & David E. Twitchell, Filer's      |
