| 1889 - On this evening in Catonsville, Maryland near Baltimore a      |
| luminous cylindrical object passed overhead, then appeared to descend |
| nearthe village while following the course of the Patapsco River. The |
| landscape beneath the object was lit up as bright as a carbon-arc     |
| light, causing alarm among the residents. (Source: Jerome Clark,      |

| 1960 - At 4:40 p.m. a silver cigar-shaped object streaked through the |
| sky over Nome, Alaska on a curved flight trajectory. There were four  |
| or more witnesses. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, March 1960, p.   |

| 1965 - Walking along the beach near Guarani, Brazil five local        |
| residents saw a large flying object land. Two of them approached to   |
| within 60 feet and hid behind a sand dune. They saw three eight-foot  |
| tall beings, very thin in build, emerge from the craft. They wore     |
| dark, tight-fitting one-piece suits. There were later found landing   |
| imprints and footprints at the landing site. (Source: Timothy Green   |

| 1967 - In Tuscumbia, Missouri at seven o'clock in the morning a Mr.   |
| Edwards saw a disc hovering just off ground. It was apparently        |
| resting on a shaft in a muddy field, and was rocking back and forth.  |
| Several small humanoid beings, grayish green in color, moved around   |
| rapidly beneath it. The creatures had very wide set eyes and no       |
| visible legs, but they did have quick moving arms. After about five   |
| minutes they disappeared behind the shaft, the object rocked, took    |
| off, then sped away. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, September-October 1969, |

| 1974 - Two brothers were moving some of their possessions in a truck  |
| near Ely, Nevada. At around 4:15 a.m. the engine of the truck began   |
| missing and the lights flickered, so they shifted into neutral. They  |
| then felt a blast of wind shake the truck and saw an orange colored   |
| light moving low to the ground from right to left. They stopped the   |
| truck and saw six different lights or objects surrounding them: three |
| blue stationary lights, a red pulsating light, a silver colored       |
| saucer, and a reddish-orange saucer. The red light then came directly |
| at the truck, passed close by, and continued on behind them. After    |
| the objects had finally disappeared, they found the rear axle on the  |
| truck broken in half. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving  |

| 1998 - At 1:45 a.m. the two witnesses were parked in an open field in |
| Drente, The Netherlands when there suddenly appeared a flashing blue  |
| light over the field and they both saw an object resembling a         |
| "stealth fighter" with more rounded wings, hovering above a nearby    |
| road. The craft descended vertically and landed. Several figures came |
| out of the object. They had long arms and small heads. They looked    |
| around briefly and then went back inside the object. The object then  |
| rose straight up and in a few seconds it was gone. Others in the area |
| reported seeing a bright light over the area around the same time.    |

| 1999 - In El Paso, Texas at midnight a witness saw a bright green     |
| light descending and it seemed to get brighter as it got closer. It   |
| dimmed, revealing a silver disc-shaped object that was spinning.      |
| There were several lighted windows around its rim, and through them   |
| the witness could see several “shadows” inside. (Source: Albert S.    |
