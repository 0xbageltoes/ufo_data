| 1950 - At 4:50 p.m. a UFO shaped like a hemisphere with a flattened   |
| lower part, and estimated to be 70-80 meters in diameter, maneuvered  |
| in the sky five miles away from a C-45 transport plane flying from    |
| Pope AFB in Halifax County, North Carolina. The C-45, flying at an    |
| airspeed of 160 mph, could not catch up with it. The object           |
| oscillated with a pendulum motion. The Air Force explanation was that |
| the object sighted by military pilots Fehrevach and Edwards was a     |
| balloon. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official        |

| 1953 - At 1550 hrs. in Suwon, Korea two 0.36 meter diameter discs     |
| were spotted by an airman in the sky to the east of the airfield.     |
| They were lost from view in the clouds. (Source: Richard F. Haines,   |

| 1957 - At around 11:00 a.m. an airman and two others on the ground in |
| Chippenham, Wiltshire, England witnessed a dark saucer-shaped object  |
| with a black stripe that appeared behind a jet. It abruptly vanished. |

| 1958 - An unidentified object followed behind Sputnik II while        |
| orbiting over Brooklyn Park, South Australia on this evening.         |
| It travelled fast to the east, and then swung to the north before     |
| disappearing. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs Over the Southern         |

| 1959 - Mr. Armstrong and a second person in Centennial, Sydney, New   |
| South Wales, Australia heard skyquakes at 11:30 a.m. They then        |
| observed a metallic, cigar-shaped object hovering for 5 minutes.      |
| It made 90 degree turns, then shot away extremely fast. It was        |
| absolutely silent. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs Over the Southern    |

| 1963 - On this day a U.S. Post Office safety engineer in Lexington,   |
| Kentucky saw a large round UFO traveling east to west, and a          |
| delta-wing aircraft traveling from north to south. The line of flight |
| of the disc-shaped UFO intersected the aircraft's path at a right     |
| angle. (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, p. 140; Paris         |

| 1967 - A 14-year-old youth with the last name of Kirsch took a        |
| photograph of a disc-shaped structured object over Yorba Linda,       |
| California at 5:25 p.m. The photo was reported in the Santa Ana       |
| Register newspaper, and subsequently evaluated by NICAP as that of a  |
| genuine (not hoaxed) flying object. (Sources: Santa Ana Register,     |

| 1967 - At 8:10 p.m. Nicholas Rinaldi, a 37-year-old commercial        |
| artist, as well as 19 other people driving along Interstate 91 in     |
| Cromwell, Connecticut spotted a 300 foot long dark cigar-shaped       |
| object flying low over some highway construction on the new Route 9   |
| interstate highway extension. Rinaldi drew a sketch of the object,    |
| which had three bright red lights, one at each end and one in the     |
| center. The UFO made a whirring sound. The total duration of the      |
| sighting, based upon the times reported by the independent witnesses, |
| was 15 minutes. The Air Force attempted to explain the craft as a     |
| mis-identified helicopter, based on the notion that a helicopter      |
| would have had three red running lights. (Sources: Donald A. Johnson, |

| 1968 - At around 3:00 a.m. two men watched from the shore at Henley   |
| Beach, South Australia as a yellow shaft of light shot down from a    |
| UFO in the dark night sky. The shaft of light was about four inches   |
| wide and lighter in color than its yellow source. (Source: Michael    |

| 1968 - John Everhart was driving home in Indiana, Pennsylvania at     |
| 3:30 p.m. when he saw a round, saucer-shaped object with a dull       |
| aluminum finish hovering over a pond some 100-200 feet away. Its top  |
| section was transparent, and he could see two men, normal in every    |
| appearance, wearing light gray coveralls inside. He could also see    |
| levers and little lights as might appear on a computer. Under         |
| hypnosis he remembered "hearing" them talk, perhaps telepathically.   |
| They were engaged in fixing something and hurried when they saw him   |
| watching them. In a subsequent hypnotic session he recalled being led |
| into the UFO by a slender man in black. Inside were four seats on     |
| pedestals, and the light inside the craft was so bright that it hurt  |
| his eyes. He was sent by elevator into the room where the repairs     |
| were going on. The men spoke to each other in English. He was         |
| instructed to sit in a chair that rendered him immobile. There was a  |
| time lapse in his memory of several hours between his leaving work    |
| and his returning home. This case is apparently an early abduction    |
| report describing apparently normal human-looking abductors. No       |
| further hypnotic regression sessions were attempted. (Sources: David  |

| 1968 - At 10:20 p.m. two Saturn-shaped objects were sighted over some |
| woods in Fayette County, Indiana. One of the objects landed, while    |
| the other passed over a house, making a motor sound. (Source: Francis |

| 1968 - Numerous witnesses reported seeing a huge glow in the sky that |
| flew over Concepcion del Uruguay, Entre Rios, Argentina to the        |
| southeast.  This was followed by a huge power blackout at 11:00 p.m.  |

| 1970 - A witness named Herbosch reported a blindingly bright          |
| saucer-shaped object that was seen at ground level at 7:45 p.m. in    |
| Rhode-St. Genese, Brabant, Belgium. It was absolutely silent, but     |
| despite its closeness gave off no detectable odor nor heat. (Sources: |

| 1974 - A young woman returning home at Aische-en-Rafail near          |
| Lierneaux, Belgium at 4:03 p.m. saw an object shaped like a flattened |
| cupola resting on the ground. The engine and radio in her car both    |
| failed and she stopped near the object. It had three sections,        |
| colored red, yellow, and black. After about 30 seconds, it rose up    |
| slowly and disappeared behind a line of trees. The car's engine came  |
| on by itself as the object left. There were two other sightings that  |
| evening in France and another in England. (Source: Mark Rodeghier,    |

| 1974 - On this night in Souppes-sur-Loing, Seine-Marne department,    |
| France two witnesses watched an ovoid UFO give off flashes and change |
| color. It also made multiple stops and starts, before finally         |
| shooting off rapidly to the north. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,    |

| 1975 - On this night an orange glowing ball flew over Barham, Kent,   |
| England at a low altitude and illuminated the area. It stopped and    |
| hovered for awhile, then engaged in some maneuvers. It finally flew   |
| off toward the south. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case |

| 1978 - Between Leicester and Hinckley, England at least 17 people saw |
| a delta-shaped object shortly after 7:00 p.m. It flew low overhead,   |
| making no noise. It had steady red, blue, and yellow lights and as it |
| headed south from Leicester it was seen by 12 more witnesses in       |
| Hinckley. There was also a sighting earlier that evening of an        |
| unusual nocturnal light by a married couple in Patcham, East Sussex,  |
| England. (Sources: Philip J. Imbrogno, Contact of the 5th Kind, p.    |

| 1979 - In this day in Toquilla near Tunja, Colombia a dentist and     |
| three students were traveling by car when their engine suddenly       |
| stalled. They then saw two metallic disc-shaped objects land on       |
| tripod landing gear nearby, and three men wearing tight fitting,      |
| silvery outfits and large helmets who exited from a hatch in one of   |
| the objects. A sudden whirlwind surrounded their vehicle and they     |
| could no longer see either the figures or the objects. When the       |
| "whirlwind" abated both the figures and the UFOs were gone. (Sources: |

| 1979 - Driving near Lindale, Texas at around 10:00 p.m. 20-year-old   |
| John Scott Cates had stopped his car and gotten out to relieve        |
| himself when a blue beam of light from the sky struck him. It caused  |
| his hair to stand up like an electric static charge. Two UFOs with a  |
| violet-red light moving between then appeared, and he experienced a   |
| six-hour long memory lapse. His next recollection was sitting in      |
| front of the car on the ground. He was scared, shaky, cold, and his   |
| stomach was in knots. He noticed that his engine restarted when a     |
| ringing noise sounded. He had a memory loss and the clock in his car  |
| was found to be 5 1/2 hours off. He was left with holes in his shirt, |
| holes in his trousers and socks, and a 5-inch wide diamond-shaped     |
| burn on his chest. His hair was also somewhat burned. (Sources:       |

| 1992 - A 50-year-old woman and her husband were in the kitchen of     |
| their home in Mezobereny, Hungary when a short, dull black,           |
| egg-shaped figure suddenly crossed the room and passed into the       |
| adjoining room, making a strong "snorting" sound. The upper half of   |
| the being was blue-gray in color. Next, a vibrating vertical line     |
| became visible. Next to the stripe a beautiful woman appeared and     |
| looked at the woman. The main witness then followed the two beings    |
| into the room where they vanished. The husband was somehow prevented  |
| from witnessing this encounter. Three days later, at 6:30 p.m., the   |
| woman heard a loud female voice and felt compelled to go out to the   |
| garden. There she saw an ovoid, cabin-like object on the ground. She  |
| entered it, and inside she found herself in a large gray room where   |
| numerous naked children and women stood around. She then lost         |
| consciousness, and later woke up back in her bed. The next day large  |
| red sunburn-like spots appeared on her upper belly, and the lower     |
| parts of her breasts. (Sources: SOS-Ovni Phenomena, issue 12; Albert  |

| 2000 - At 12:30 a.m. a group of friends were sitting in a house in    |

| distinguishable features as the entire body was dark, but its body    |
| fluctuated in and out of transparency. The witnesses had apparently   |
| seen this and multiple other humanoid figures on other occasions, in  |
| different locations. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact     |
