| 1909 - A dark silent cigar-shaped object flew slowly at a low         |
| altitude over Waihi, New Zealand at 8:30 p.m. It had windows on each  |
| side and an intense blue-green light in front. Later that same        |
| evening a man was thrown from his horse in Waipawa, New Zealand when  |
| a gray cigar or torpedo-shaped object hovered overhead and frightened |
| the animal. Three human looking figures stood on deck, and one waved  |
| and shouted. The craft had lights at both ends. It rose to a higher   |
| altitude, circled, and then went behind hill. (Sources: Luminieres    |

| 1948 - At 8 a.m. a long metallic cylinder with no wings flew at a     |
| very high altitude and was seen in the skies 25 kilometers northwest  |
| of Moscow in Russia. It moved silently and very fast towards the      |
| northeast. (Sources: Project Blue Book, August 1948; Larry Hatch, U   |

| 1952 - At 3:13 p.m. eight military witnesses and radar confirmed the  |
| presence of two silver colored discs in the sky over Hamilton AFB in  |
| Marin County, California. The discs appeared to be dogfighting. They  |
| were joined by six other discs and formed a diamond formation. They   |
| sped away as USAF F-86 fighter jets were scrambled. The sighting      |
| lasted 75 minutes. (Sources: Project Blue Book; Donald E. Keyhoe,     |

| 1953 - At 12:04 p.m. over the Amarillo Airport, Texas a transparent   |
| disc stopped and hovered in the sky. A second, identical object was   |
| seen behind it. They were not balloons, according to the official Air |
| Force investigation. A Project Blue Book "unidentified" case.         |

| 1965 - On or about this date Dr. Antonin Kukla and Mrs. Audrey        |
| Lawrence saw an oval object dive toward them at 8:00 p.m. while       |
| driving in Carnarvon, Western Australia. They switched off the car's  |
| headlights and got out of the vehicle to observe the object, which    |
| hovered at ground level. Its color changed from orange to fluorescent |
| green before it took off at high speed. (Sources: NICAP UFO           |

| 1965 - There were at least 15 reports recorded for this day from      |
| Australia, China, Sweden, Switzerland, Hawaii, and the midwestern and |
| western United States. Among the more interesting reports, a young    |
| man saw an object rise from the lake at Lake Hefner, Oklahoma. Also   |
| on this day a famous set of UFO photographs was taken by Ray Heflin   |
| in Santa Ana, California. At 12:38 p.m. he took four photographs of a |
| metallic hat-shaped UFO, estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter,   |
| with a Polaroid camera from his Orange County pickup truck. The U.S.  |
| Air Force claimed the object was a hubcap thrown in the air, but most |
| UFO researchers regard the photos as genuine. (Sources: (1) Jacques   |

| 1965 - Two boys, Doug Knopka, age 9, and Tim Dietz, age 8, were       |
| vacationing at Doehler’s Beach in northeastern Pennsylvania with      |
| their families, and were walking along a wooded road at 10:30 a.m.    |
| when they saw a “dirty white” disc-shaped object. It had a            |
| transparent dome, was 15 feet in diameter, and was on or near the     |
| ground just 50 feet away from them. Next to the craft stood a small   |
| four and a half foot tall figure with yellow eyes, and inside the     |
| dome was another figure moving about. Frightened, the boys ran from   |
| the spot. As they ran they heard a “swishing” sound, and saw the      |
| round object rise over the treetops and disappear from sight as it    |
| flew out over the lake. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,        |

| 1967 - At 11:35 a.m. in the town of Perigueux, Dordogne, France a     |
| silent disc-shaped object made five falling leaf maneuvers in the     |
| sky. (Source: GEPA Phenomenes Spatiaux, March 1974, p. 22).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 8:00 p.m. J. Vieira, a lawyer, and his driver Amauri, were  |
| at kilometer 15 on the Miguel Peraira Highway when they saw two       |
| yellowish lights, then many others, about 500 meters away to the      |
| left. The lights would blink and fade. Similar lights were seen again |
| at Conrado, Brazil. When the driver blinked the car's headlights the  |
| objects seemed to respond. A domed disc-shaped object that            |
| illuminated the whole area was next seen resting in some woods.       |
| Physiological after-effects included headaches, dizziness, and        |
| jaundiced facial skin. (Sources: Irene Granchi, APRO Bulletin,        |

| 1967 - At 11:30 p.m. a married couple named DeSoto in Caracas,        |
| Venezuela saw a luminous, disc-shaped whitish object, 10 meters in    |
| diameter. The entire yard was illuminated and a humming sound was     |
| heard. A door opened in the base of the craft and something like a    |
| light bulb lowered itself to the ground. This, too, had an opening    |
| from which stepped a small man about three feet tall, dressed in      |
| silvery luminous clothes. His head was surrounded by vapor. He was    |
| only about five meters away from the witnesses, and they watched him  |
| pick up stones, examine them, look up, and appear to communicate with |
| the disc-shaped craft. He then dropped the stones and stepped into    |
| the "bulb" that reentered the craft, which took off. (Sources: Jim &  |
| Coral Lorenzen, UFOs Over the Americas, p. 43; Jacques Vallee,        |

| 1972 - While driving in Pinnaroo, South Australia Mrs. Venning and    |
| two traveling companions saw a greyish-white oval object to her left  |
| in a paddock. It had lights on both sides, was 30 meters off the      |
| ground, and was silent. She drove past without stopping but said      |
| that her hair stood on end during the sighting. (Source: Keith        |

| 1973 - A brightly lit football-shaped object ascended into the sky in |
| staircase maneuvers over Villeneuve-sur-Lot, Lot-Garonne department,  |
| France. It made halts at the corners in its step-function climb.      |
| (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 133).                           |

| 1975 - Numerous townspeople watched as a multi-colored cigar-shaped   |
| object, predominantly orange in color, settled onto a nearby hill in  |
| Antofagasta, Chile. It gave off a chemical smell, which burned their  |
| noses, and the witnesses "eyes filled with tears." The whole area was |
| lit by a yellow-orange glow while the object was in the area. After   |
| several minutes the UFO shot away to the west toward the Pacific      |
| Ocean. (Sources: Charles Bowen, Saga UFO Report, December 1976,       |

| 1977 - In Thaxted, Essex, England a 24-year old man named Stevens was |
| driving at around 3:30 a.m. when his car lost power from 50 mph to 35 |
| mph despite applying full throttle. Two orange-red oval lights were   |
| seen hovering nearby at the time, at a distance of 300-400 yards.     |

| 1977 - On this day in Campos, Brazil a gray disc-shaped object was    |
| seen on the ground and three tall, thin, baldheaded figures were seen |
| moving around the object performing various tasks. They wore gray     |
| coveralls with green belts. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |
| Contact Database 1977, citing Antonio Faleiro).                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - Caferina Vargas Martin, age 20, of Escalada, Huelva, Spain     |
| left her home at 7:30 p.m. to walk to her grandmother's house in La   |
| Corte, about three kilometers distant. The pathway between the two    |
| villages winds along a creek at the foot of a mountain, with lush     |
| vegetation along the way. While walking along the footpath, at around |
| 7:55 p.m., she was momentarily blinded by a bright reflection of      |
| light. About 20 meters further on, another flash of light again shone |
| in her face. She believed it was a bicycle headlight, but she quickly |
| felt her strength ebb away as the light source was replaced by two    |
| strange humanoid figures: a woman two meters tall and a slightly      |
| shorter man. The woman had long platinum hair that hung to the middle |
| of her back, but the man's hair was shorter and slightly disheveled.  |
| Their facial features were "repulsive" to the witness because the     |
| woman had very large eyes, and only two holes where her nose should   |
| be, with a slit-like mouth that moved without opening. Both figures   |
| were dressed in tunics; the woman's was a dark green color, but shiny |
| as if made up of many tiny points of light, with wide long sleeves    |
| that went to her hands. The tunic extended to the ground so her feet  |
| were unseen. The man's tunic was a light chestnut color, and also     |
| with brightly reflecting points of light. It came to his knees, below |
| which was a narrow, darker tunic that extended to the ground. Their   |
| skin was citron yellow in color. While the woman gesticulated with    |
| her arms, both beings remained indifferent to the witness's presence. |
| Feeling faint, Caferina sat down on a rock and then passed out. When  |
| she came to there was no one there and it was then dark. Frightened   |
| and upset, she ran back home. It was 8:50 p.m. when she got home,     |
| nearly an hour after her encounter began. She suffered from           |
| psychological shock and had nightmares for the next several nights,   |
| and was treated by doctors. Some personal belongings of hers also     |
| turned up missing. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:    |

| Darnaude, Joaquin Mateos, Manuel Filpo Jose Ignacio Alonso & Antonio  |

| 1997 - On this night Edsom da Silva heard some shots coming from a    |
| nearby wooded area in Bocaiuva do Sul, Brazil and ran over to         |
| investigate. He saw something hiding behind a tree. He was carrying a |
| bright lantern so he pointed the light at the nearby "form" on the    |
| ground. He saw it was a strange creature with two huge reddish eyes,  |
| which had a bizarre crest on its back. Frightened, he ran away from   |
| the area and did not see the creature again. (Source: Albert S.       |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1997, citing Carlos Albert         |

| 2000 - At 10:00 p.m. in Uniontown, Pennsylvania a witness saw a       |
| five-foot-tall being with long slender extremities for about one      |
| minute. It carried a brown staff that was about five feet long, and   |
| the creature glided six inches above the ground. Another unusual      |
| feature of the encounter was that all normal background sounds were   |
| absent. (Sources: Stan Gordon, PASU website, citing Jim Brown; Albert |
| S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2000, case # 3469, citing       |

| 2008 - On this morning two witnesses were backpacking around near     |
| Glenorchy on South Island, New Zealand  when they encountered a       |
| landed UFO. The weather had cleared that day and they had decided to  |
| go for a tramp on the Mount Aspiring track, but before they reached   |
| it they spotted what looked like a landed disc-shaped UFO in a        |
| paddock. The craft was round and about five meters tall, with legs    |
| for landing gear and pulsing yellow white lights around its           |
| perimeter. The witnesses attempted to approach to take photos but     |
| several “men” in white suits confronted them, taking their cameras.   |
