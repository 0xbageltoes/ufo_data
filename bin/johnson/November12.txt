| 1885 - Cape Race, Atlantic Ocean - A huge sphere of fire was observed |
| rising out of the ocean by witnesses aboard the ship "Siberian." It   |
| rose to an altitude of 16 meters, flew against the wind, and came     |
| close to the ship, then "dashed off" toward the southeast. The        |
| sighting lasted five minutes. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to    |

| 1953 - At 5 p.m. two silver discs exited a solidary white cloud in    |

| vanish. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, March 1954; Larry Hatch, U computer  |

| 1954 - A fisherman watched a three meter wide transparent globe       |
| descend at eight o'clock in the morning, stop and hover momentarily,  |
| and then dive into the canal in Arqua'Polesine, Italy leaving behind  |
| a cloud of vapor. At eleven o'clock that same morning a Brazilian     |
| priest working at the Vatican's Castel Gandolfo mountain residence in |
| Italy had a close encounter with two UFOs. (Sources: Verga Maurizio,  |

| 1954 - A spherical UFO hovered for a long period over Louisville,     |
| Kentucky. U.S. Air Force jets chased it over Kentucky, Indiana and    |
| Ohio. It was also observed from the ground through a theodolite.      |

| 1955 - A clearly defined disc-shaped object flew over the Thames      |
| River at Goring, Oxfordshire, England, shooting sparks. (Source: UFO  |

| 1958 - A brilliant blue glowing disc with two domes flew low over a   |
| main highway in Caracas, Venezuela at five o'clock in the morning. It |

| 1963 - On this night off the Argentine Coast of the South Atlantic, a |
| UFO followed the Argentine Navy ship "Punta Medanos." Electronic      |
| interference was reported at the time. (Source: NICAP UFO             |

| 1966 - On this night a domed disc-shaped object with portholes        |
| hovered over Fort Ontario, New York and was witnessed by a radar      |
| operator. It shot straight up until it was gone from sight. (Source:  |

| 1966 - During the day five men digging a grave in a cemetery in       |
| Clendenin, West Virginia saw something that looked like "a brown      |
| human being" that flew from some nearby trees and maneuvered low over |
| their heads. It was in sight for about a minute. (Source: John A.     |

| 1967 - At nine o'clock in the morning an ovoid object came down       |
| slowly into a field of maize in Centeno, Santa Fe province,           |
| Argentina, its major axis vertical. It gave out orange bursts of      |
| flame, and disappeared behind some trees. No landing traces           |
| were found. (Source: Oscar A. Uriondo, FSR Case Histories, December   |
| 1973, p. 18).                                                         |

| 1976 - Jose Maria Trejo and Juan Carrizosa Lujan were on sentry duty  |
| at Talavera La Real Air Force Base in Badajoz, Spain when at 1:45     |
| a.m. they heard a very loud, penetrating whistle that continued for   |
| five minutes, stopped, and then started again. When it stopped the    |
| second time they saw a light in the sky in the direction of Badajoz,  |
| “like a flare,” which lit up a wide area beneath it. After about 20   |
| seconds it vanished. A third sentry, Jose Hidalgo, joined them and    |
| accompanied by a guard dog they went to search the fuel stockpile     |
| area. They had gone about a thousand feet when they experienced a     |
| localized “whirlwind,” which alarmed them and caused them to load     |
| their rifles. Then they heard a sound like branches being broken in   |
| the direction of some nearby eucalyptus trees, so they released the   |
| guard dog. The dog charged off toward the trees, but after a few      |
| seconds came staggering back and whimpering. Four more times they     |
| ordered the dog to go to the trees, but each time he came back in the |
| same manner. Then Trejo glimpsed a green light out of the corner of   |
| his eyes, and when he turned around he saw a luminous humanoid figure |
| at least ten feet tall, only 50 feet away. The thick, luminous figure |
| seemed to consist entirely of small points of light, and more intense |
| around its periphery. The small head appeared to be covered by a      |
| helmet. The arms seemed to be crossed, and legs and feet could not be |
| seen. Trejo tried to fire his rifle, but was unable to because he     |
| felt a sudden sensation of weakness, and collapsed to the ground. The |
| other two men then caught sight of the entity and fired at it.        |
| Between the two of them they fired 40-50 shots. At the instant the    |
| firing began the apparition vanished. The other two men helped Trejo  |
| to his feet, and at this time all three heard the whistle again,      |
| coming from the direction of the eucalyptus trees. It lasted for      |
| 10-15 seconds and then ceased. At dawn 50 men searched the area. They |
| found nothing. Particularly mystifying was the fact that they could   |
| not find a single spent cartridge case. Moreover, the adobe wall of   |
| the base, which was just behind where the being stood and should have |
| been pockmarked with bullet holes, showed not a single                |
| bullet pockmark. A few days after the incident Trejo lost his vision, |
| and then fell unconscious. He was hospitalized, but his hospital      |
| tests showed nothing abnormal. About two weeks later he again lost    |
| his vision for about 15 minutes. He was hospitalized for a month and  |
| during that time suffered from severe headaches. (Sources: Juan Jose  |

| 1976 - At 6:15 p.m. James Howard, age 15, and his friend Brian        |
| Hollis, age 14, observed an object with pulsating red, green, and     |
| blue lights, which stopped in the air and descended into some nearby  |
| woods in Tarboro, near Edgecombe, North Carolina. They were alarmed   |
| and ran home. Looking back, they saw a nine foot tall milky white     |
| figure wearing a diamond shaped red helmet, who came floating out of  |
| the woods about 150 yards away from them. Under the helmet its        |
| head appeared to be blackish gray, and its short legs seemed to have  |
| no feet. It stopped and seemed to look at the boys, then floated on   |
| and disappeared behind a nearby billboard. The entire incident        |
| lasted about 15 minutes. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1978 - At 1:30 a.m. in Saluzzo, Piedmonte, Italy a yellow and red     |
| domed disc-shaped object swooped down over the roadway and            |
| illuminated a car and the surrounding area, causing the car tape deck |
| to stop working. It had four legs or landing gear appendages.         |

| from the sea. One descended and crossed the flight path of incoming   |
| airliners. (Sources: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping Service, March     |

| 1981 - At 6:00 p.m. NATO jets were scrambled from the Hortiati NATO   |
| Air Base in Macedonia, Greece in pursuit of UFOs tracked on military  |
| radar. UFOs played hide-and-seek with them, disappearing and then     |
| reappearing 45 minutes later. UFOs were also seen and reported in the |
| villages of Kalokorio, Mihaniona, and Laina, as well as the cities of |
| Gianitsa and Edessa. At 6:45 p.m. objects shaped like flaming         |
| parachutes, emitting powerful lights, hung in the sky over the city   |
| of Edessa, Greece for 30 minutes. Most city residents saw them,       |
| including some with binoculars. (Source: J. Allen Hynek,              |

| 1987 - In Ringsted, Denmark an observer spotted a short child-like    |
| figure in a field at 8:20 p.m. Upon closer investigation he also saw  |
| a three meter in diameter glowing ball float up and then spin into    |
| the sky at high speed. The witness felt the short figure may have     |
| entered the ball shaped craft. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer      |

| 2006 - The pilot of a Boeing 767 observed a fast moving light cross   |
| in front of his aircraft while flying over Gagetown, New Brunswick,   |
