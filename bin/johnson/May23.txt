| 1953 - A cigar-shaped object darted into a high altitude cloud over   |
| Melbourne, Victoria, Australia at noon on this day. It then flew back |
| out again. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs Over the Southern           |

| 1957 - At 8:15 in the morning over Kansas City, Kansas four discs     |
| were sighted flying in a box formation. Two of the objects turned and |
| flew to the northwest, while two shot ahead to the north, joining     |
| another pair also going to the northwest. (Sources: Loren E. Gross,   |

| 1961 - A round, silver bowl-shaped object flew slowly to the south    |
| over Napier, New Zealand in Hawke's Bay at a few minutes after 3:15   |
| p.m. It was witnessed by a Mrs. Church for two minutes. It reached a  |
| position over the local aerodrome and then vanished in place.         |

| 1962 - In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania a domed disc with portholes flew |
| over the city for an estimated 40 minutes, playing a game of cat and  |
| mouse with jets at an estimated altitude of 750 meters. The Air Force |
| explanation lists this case as caused by a reflection. (Source:       |

| 1965 - A school teacher in Kailua, Hawaii watched a small white disc, |
| perhaps one meter in diameter, fly by very fast from northeast to     |
| southwest at an estimated altitude of only 100 feet. (Source: APRO    |
| Bulletin, January-February 1966).                                     |

| 1969 - At midnight in Kalamunda, Western Australia nocturnal lights   |
| zigzagged through the sky and were picked up as blips on radar as     |
| they maneuvered to the north. (Source: Bill Chalker, The Oz Files, p. |

| 1971 - Twelve photographs were taken of a silverly metallic disc in   |
| St. Lorenzen, Austria at 12:30 p.m. The disc was estimated to be 12   |
| to 15 meters in diameter and was seen moving in and out of clouds. It |
| jumped from location to location, and appeared to be spinning when    |
| hovering. (Source: UFO Nachrichten (Germany), September 1971).        |

| 1973 - A round spinning UFO with red, green, blue and purple lights   |
| buzzed a car with three teenagers in Mount Gambier, South Australia   |
| at 7 p.m., terrigying them. In an undulating course the UFO first     |
| hovered, then came straight at their car. It flew up and over them,   |
| and passed low over the other side and away. (Source: Border Watch,   |
| May 1973, p. 24).                                                     |

| 1975 - A dog and cat reacted with panic when a bottle-shaped silver   |
| UFO flew near a mountainside at 9 p.m. in Sedona, Arizona. There were |

| 1977 - A fiery looking torus-shaped object hovered and tilted over    |
| Santiago, Chile at six o'clock in the morning. A beam extended from   |
| the object, and swung back and forth like a pendulum. At ball of      |
| light was at the end of the beam. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,     |
| January 1978).                                                        |

| 1982 - At 3:30 a.m. a nocturnal light paced a car in Bowna, New South |
| Wales, Australia only 3 meters above the ground. It hovered when the  |
| car stopped. A diamond shaped object was seen hovering over the car's |
| destination. (Source: Australian Center for UFO Studies files).       |
|                                                                       |
| 1983 - A disc-shaped object with a black top, blue sides, square      |
| windows, and a reddish golden metallic bottom maneuvered over trees   |
| in McHenry, Illinois at 7:30 p.m. It was witnessed by an art teacher  |
| as it then rocked violently, levelled out, and flew off following the |
| contour of the land. (Source: J. Allen Hynek, International UFO       |
| Reporter, January-February 1985, p. 7).                               |

| 1988 - A black cylindrical object hovered in the northern sky for 30  |
| minutes, as seen from Fredericia, Denmark at 4 p.m. It then appeared  |
| to vanish. (Source: Scandinavian UFO Newsletter, issue #12).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1999 - In Mambau, Malaysia at 4:30 a.m. 17-year-old Fahmi Mohd was    |
| awaken by the sound of wind blowing. He noticed some bright lights    |
| outside his house. When he went out the back door he was surprised to |
| see an object hovering low over some nearby bushes. It was about      |
| 20-30 feet away and gave off a very bright blue light. He could not   |
| tell its shape because of the light's brilliance. He watched in       |
| amazement, forgetting to wake his parents. Next he saw a small being, |
| about half a meter tall, come out from the bottom of the hovering     |
| craft. Again, because of the bright blue light he could not           |
| distinguish many features, but he could see that it had drooping ears |
| and a slightly pointed head with very long arms. Frightened, he went  |
| back inside his house. He looked out again to see the object shoot up |
| at an angle and disappear into the sky. He did hear a mechanical      |
| sound right before the object shot up. Several small footprints were  |
| found at the site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |
| Database 1999, case #3428, citing Ahmad Jamaludin, Malaysian Centre   |

| 1999 - A wedge-shaped object with blue and red flashing lights,       |
| described as "something weird," flew over Surrey, British Columbia at |
| 10:15 a.m. (Source: Geoff Ditman, Canadian UFO Survey 1999, case #    |
| 87).                                                                  |

| 2003 - Three very big disc-shaped objects, bobbing up and down, were  |
| seen over Melbourne, Victoria, Australia at 8 p.m. They flashing      |
| different colors in a blue to white to red sequence, and were         |
| estimated to be 30 feet in diameter. A man and wife and their         |
| 23-year-old son drove under a dark, slow moving triangular shaped     |
| object on Highway 17 north of Webster, Iowa at 9:30 p.m. The UFO had  |
| bright orange lights at each apex which did not light up the entire   |
| craft. It also had a light gray circle in the center and stripes      |
| extending out to the corners. Later that night at 11:35 p.m. MDT in   |
| Havre, Montana three white lights arranged in a triangle formation    |
| moved through the sky perfectly spaced, suggesting they belonged to   |
| one craft. The UFO made no sound and had no blinking or colored       |
| lights. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,      |
