| 1914 - Flight Commander C. E. Rathbone of the Felixstowe Naval Air    |
| Station, Suffolk, England returned from an early morning patrol in    |
| his seaplane to make perhaps the first report of a UFO sighting by a  |
| military officer. He reported that, "At 5:35 a.m. whilst on patrol, I |
| sighted an airship steering south-southeast with a silver-colored     |
| envelope on the horizon, while flying at 1,300 feet, 27 miles south   |
| of Orfordness." (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell, Filer's |

| 1947 - Four sailors, including a Richard Cruthers, onboard the US     |
| Navy oiler Chipola in the Persian Gulf spotted eight round spots of   |
| light flying in a group. They passed within half of a mile of the     |
| ship, made a climbing turn in echelon formation, and then went out of |
| sight. They were a white or blue color. (Sources: Jan Aldrich,        |

| 1952 - At 10:10 a.m. fourteen people in Enfield, Connecticut watched  |

| "bang," and the UFO then shot upwards at a high speed, executing a    |
| 90-degree angle. (Source: Loren Gross, UFOs: A History. 1952:         |

| 1969 - At 11:00 p.m. a strange man stared into the bedroom window of  |
| Mrs. Barbara Robinson in Springdale, Arkansas. She called the police  |
| and Officer Ken Speedlin “discovered that anyone who looked through   |
| the bedroom window would have to have been at least seven feet        |
| tall…there was nothing in the area of the window on which a prowler   |
| could have stood.” (Source: John Keel, Operation Trojan Horse, p.     |

| 1973 - On this night a woman passenger in a semi-trailer truck on     |
| Route 2 was enroute to Perth and between Penong and Ivy Tanks,        |
| Western Australia. She had been sleeping but awoke to observe a       |
| bright egg-shaped object on the ground off to the left side of the    |
| road. Walking towards an open door was a normal sized figure of human |
| appearance. A second occupant was seen seated inside the object,      |
| through a squarish window. He was looking up at something in the      |
| craft. As the truck drove past the light rapidly faded until by the   |
| time she got the driver to stop only a single white light was visible |
| in the distance. Both figures wore white silvery suits. She said she  |
| had been awakened by a "voice" just prior to her observation.         |

| 1976 - At around eight o'clock in the evening a 60-foot wide UFO with |
| windows landed only 100 feet from a truck in Accopampa, Peru. The     |
| truck motor stalled. Two men emerged from the UFO. They stood about   |
| 5" 8" tall (1.8 m), wore shiny spacesuits, and carried lamps. One     |
| touched one of the witnesses, who felt a hot searing sensation and    |
| suffered from temporary paralysis. He later claimed to be healed of   |
| his arthritis pain. Landing traces were found at the site. (Source:   |

| 1978 -  The young witness, Juan O. Perez, had gone out at dawn to     |
| bring in a herd of horses in Venado, Tuerto, Argentina. At 6:45 a.m.  |
| as he rode his horse through the morning fog he felt something fly    |
| overhead. Next, several objects appeared and began maneuvering        |
| overhead, emitting powerful beams of multicolored, changing lights.   |
| His horse panicked and he barely managed to ride back home. When he   |
| got home, his father reprimanded him and ordered him to go back to    |
| get the horses. Back in the field he encountered a large round object |
| on the ground; it had a dome on top with several round windows. A     |
| door in the craft opened, and a seven-foot tall being wearing gloves  |
| and a cylindrical helmet appeared. The being seemed to be attached to |
| the object by some type of breathing apparatus. He invited Juan to    |
| come inside. They boy then tied his horse to the craft's ladder and   |
| climbed in. Inside, he was able to see a panel with buttons, tables,  |
| and a small robot-like being that was apparently busy                 |
| disecting the large bones of some animals resembling either cows or   |
| horses. Afraid, the boy jumped out of the object and onto the ground. |
| The tall being followed him out. He then requested that the giant     |
| give him one of the giant's gloves, as proof of the experience, and   |
| when he removed the glove he then saw that the being had green,       |
| claw-like hands with blue metallic nails. The being then pricked      |
| Juan's right arm, apparently extracting some blood in the process. As |
| he rode back toward home carrying the glove, two flying objects       |
| caught up with him and emitted a small slab and sphere that descended |
| and brushed by the horse, pulling off the glove like a magnet.        |
| Another curious feature of his report was that while inside the UFO   |
| the young witness attempted to touch the being and the object several |
| times, but was prevented from doing it by what appeared to be an      |
| invisible barrier. Six days prior to the incident the witness's       |
| father had found a mutilated cow in one of his pastures. (Source:     |

| 1995 - The witness had fallen asleep in a chair in Ashland, New       |
| Hampshire when shortly after eleven p.m. he found himself lifted into |
| a globular object and transported over a city where he saw people     |
| looking up at him. He then flew above what appeared to be an African  |
| savannah and muddy river, whereupon the craft then went up through    |
| the atmosphere an into outer space. He was then placed inside a       |
| transparent tub or tank filled with breathable fluid by two short     |
| Grey humanoids, while a third being observed. He remarked that he was |
| surprisingly calm about the experience although he would normally be  |
| panicked. After a few more minutes he was allowed to walk to a window |
| or screen. A huge metallic cylinder, apparently somekind of space     |
| station, began to fill the view from the left side of the window.     |
| There were white and blue lights running the entire length of it.     |
| Later, before being returned, he saw four other species of beings     |
| together in one place. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact   |

| 1998 - A bedroom visitation also reportedly occurred in Bothell,      |
| Washington on this night. At two o'clock in the morning the witness   |
| was awakened by a white light appearing suddenly in a dark bedroom.   |
| Sitting up in bed, the witness observed two creatures staring up her, |
| surrounded by the white light. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO |

| 2000 - Three days after a witness had filmed a strange UFO over the   |
| area, 31-year-old Gloria Siboa was walking home at 1:30 in the        |
| afternoon in Santa Cruz, Manila, the Philippines when she was         |
| approached by four women wearing black nun's habits that obscured     |
| their facial features. They seemed to be lost, and asked Gloria for   |
| directions. They failed to understand her directions, and invited her |
| to board their van and accompany them to their destination.           |
| Strangely, she felt unwilling to resist and got in the van. As soon   |
| as she boarded the van one of the women covered her nose and mouth    |
| with a drug-laced handkerchief, knocking her out. Three days later,   |
| Siboa woke up still in the van that was headed to an unknown          |
| destination, and she was still blindfolded. She jumped out screaming  |
| for police. She could not explain where she had been for the last     |
| three days. Her abductors had taken her wallet and ID. (Source:       |

| headed off the the south very fast. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 2008      |
