| 1952 - At 10:30 a.m. eight crescent-shaped objects flew over Walla    |
| Walla, Washington. A dull gray disc with a hump in the middle,        |
| looking something like a fin, was seen at 2:30 in the afternoon by    |
| the Gmyrek family in Browerville, Minnesota. The disc made no sound   |
| at first but as it was fading away behind some trees "we heard a very |
| low hum." It left no vapor trail, and flew at an estimated speed of   |
| 300 mph. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official        |

| 1952 - A flying disc was sighted in Tuxedo, Manitoba at 8:26 p.m.     |
| Four minutes later several discs and cylindrical UFOs were sighted in |
| Molson, Manitoba. The UFOs were changing colors quickly, and one      |
| object stopped in flight, reversed direction, and backtracked by      |
| shooting off toward the north. At 10:15 p.m. there were two separate  |
| sightings of nocturnal lights glowing green and white in Winnipeg,    |
| Manitoba. One of the lights made a ninety-degree turn and turned back |
| in flight toward the south. (Sources: Winnipeg Free Press, April 23,  |

| 1967 - Driving near a dam 10 miles south of Ephrata, Washington two   |
| couples had a close encounter with a UFO on the road at 1:30 a.m.     |
| They braked to avoid collision with the object and stopped 10 feet    |
| away. When the UFO took off, it went behind their car, and paced them |
| for five minutes. The engine of the car missed when it was passed on  |
| left by the oncoming white and yellow-orange blinking lights of the   |
| craft. The witnesses were badly shaken by the incident. (Sources: J.  |

| 1967 - At 4:00 p.m. EDT a domed, disc-shaped UFO was seen hovering to |
| the west of Cocoa Beach, Florida. It tilted as a small plane passed   |
| beneath it. The airplane then reversed course in an apparent effort   |
| to take a closer look at the UFO. (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO      |

| 1967 - A pewter colored object shaped like a storage tank landed in   |
| South Hill, Virginia at 9:00 p.m. It stood 4.9 meters high including  |
| the legs, which were an estimated 1.1 meters long. A white burst of   |
| flame came from the object, which shot up into the sky. There were    |
| four imprints on the asphalt road forming a rectangle with sides from |
| 3.35 to 3.66 meters in length. There was also a burnt spot in the     |
| center measuring 0.9 meters in diameter. There were two male          |
| witnesses named Crowder and Martin. (Source: NICAP investigation      |

| 1967 - While driving home from work in Rapid City, Michigan at 9:00   |
| p.m. Charles D. Scott saw a large round, bluish white lighted object  |
| descend to land in a wooded area. When he got home he notified the    |
| sheriff's office, then drove back to the site with his wife and       |
| children and accompanied by a deputy sheriff. While Mrs. Scott and    |
| the children waited in the car, Mr. Scott and the officer searched    |
| the wooded area and became separated. The deputy found nothing, but   |
| the witness came upon the craft resting on small legs in a marshy     |
| area. Standing next to it was a medium sized man. He called out       |
| "hello" but got no response; he then repeated the greeting and this   |
| time received a mental warning, "Get away from here!" He turned and   |
| fled to his car, badly frightened and in an agitated state. When he   |
| returned home he told his wife about his encounter. (Source: David F. |

| 1967 - At 9:55 p.m. a yellow dome-shaped object, flat on bottom, was  |
| seen by two women in Tucson, Arizona. A light beam was directed       |
| upward from the object, as it descended tipping and swaying in a      |
| falling leaf motion, apparently attempting to land. (Source: APRO     |

| 1969 - Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez were driving through the countryside      |
| between Penaranda and Macotera in Salamanca, Spain when they noticed  |
| some lights ahead, perhaps a kilometer away. As they got closer they  |
| noticed a UFO low over the roadway. It had a red rotating central     |
| light that was flashing and intense, and two smaller green lights     |
| separated by 20 meters. They approached to within 70 meters, when the |
| UFO suddenly took off. It was raining hard at time, and their close   |
| encounter lasted less than a minute. (Sources: Vicente-Juan Ballester |

| 1969 - Three extremely bright discs were seen spinning over a major   |
| intersection at a low altitude in Guanabara, a city in Rio de Janeiro |
| State, Brazil. There were many witnesses.  (Source: Walter Buhler,    |

| 1972 - EM effect: a car stalled while driving through a forested area |
| in the Charente-Maritime department of France near the village of     |
| Ste.-Soulle at 10.00 p.m. A 16 meter diameter domed disc-shaped       |
| object descended and landed on four legs, then a one-meter tall dwarf |
| exited from the craft. The witness was frozen with paralysis during   |
| the event, which lasted 45 minutes. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit,  |

| 1974 - At 12:20 a.m. in Gosselies, Hainaut, Belgium a 10-meter        |
| diameter glowing metallic ovoid object halted at 100 meters altitude, |
| made a loud noise, then zig-zagged away. There were two witnesses     |
| named Vanderclausen. Four minutes later a loud wailing sound was      |
| heard in Jumet, Belgium and a green, 11-meter orb was seen hovering   |
| by three witnesses. It shot away to the south. It was back again at   |
| 12:30 a.m., then it moved off quickly to the southeast. At 12:30 in   |
| Loverval a domed disc-shaped object emitted a sound like American     |
| police sirens as it had a close encounter with four witnesses; it     |
| flew off to the east. At the same time in Marcinelle, Belgium 11      |
| witnesses, including a 16-year old teenager who was the main witness, |
| watched as a small gray disc with a 40 cm thick base and a three      |
| meter high dome oscillated slightly at a distance of only 30 meters.  |
| The craft had ten equally spaced windows, which alternated            |
| yellow-green and red in color. Half of the dome was illuminated. It   |
| too emitted a siren sound. (Sources: Michel Abrassart, Inforespace,   |

| 1976 - In Harbor City, Los Angeles County, California while driving   |
| on the San Diego Freeway at 11:00 a.m. two witnesses reported         |
| sighting a large white metallic domed disc. It was estimated to be    |
| between 200 and 300 feet in diameter, and was flying at 3,000 feet    |
| altitude. It moved slowly at 5-10 mph, with a titled orientation of   |
| 45 degrees to its direction of flight. The craft had a window on its  |
| dome. (Source: CUFOS News Bulletin, September 1976, p. 5).            |

| 1976 - At 10:30 p.m. a 23-year-old woman stopped her pickup truck on  |
| a bridge three miles east of Stacy, Minnesota on Highway 19 in        |
| Chisago County when she noticed a green pulsating light off the road. |
| It passed overhead at an estimated 300-400 feet altitude. She         |
| estimated the orb was 12-15 feet in diameter. RF interference         |
| consisted of CB radio static during the close encounter. After 45     |
| seconds of even flight it shot straight up when it departed. (Source: |

| 1977 - Bill Bartlett, age 17, was driving on Farm Street in Dover,    |
| Massachusetts with two friends at 11:30 at night when he saw a        |
| creature on the top of a stone wall, about 20 feet away. It was       |
| between 3.5 and 4 feet tall and had a small, slender body with a very |
| large melon-shaped head, showing no features except two large round   |
| orange glowing eyes. Its skin was gray, "like the color of a shark,"  |
| and it had large hands and feet with digits that appeared to wrap     |
| around whatever supported them. It turned its head slowly to stare at |
| them. Bill drove away quickly, but his companions had not seen it. An |
| artist, he made a drawing later for investigators, now widely         |
| reproduced in many sources. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,    |

| 1979 - On this night two Grey aliens materialized briefly in abductee |
| B. Herrmann's home in North Charleston, South Carolina. They appeared |
| in a blue-green haze, and left behind a metal bar with peculiar       |
| markings, which they said was a gift of "understanding and respect".  |

| 1989 - At 9:15 p.m. in Crestview, Florida a man's dog barked as a     |
| 90-foot diameter disc-shaped object hovered nearby. The man aimed a   |
| .22 rifle at the hovering disc, which had a brilliant white light on  |
| the underside and made a humming sound. A light beam engulfed him,    |
| his rifle misfired, and the object sped away. (Sources: Allen         |

| 2003 - An employee of a local manufacturing plant in Concord, North   |
| Carolina had just finished his shift at 8:00 p.m. and had stepped out |
| onto a dock behind a large stack of pallets to have a smoke. He then  |
| had the feeling of being watched, and he whirled around expecting to  |
| see a co-worker. Instead he saw a large purple light emanating from a |
| teardrop-shaped craft with a round bottom, hovering nearby. The craft |
| had a concave windshield, and behind the windshield he could see two  |
| glowing lights or eyes. They moved independently from one another.    |
| Terrified, the witness ran but was unable to scream, so he pointed    |
| out the object to a forklift operator. Next a beam of white light     |
| shot out of the UFO and struck the forklift. Immediately the          |
| electrical system of the vehicle shut down and the operator began     |
| screaming. The witness's next memory was of sitting in the plant      |
| manager's office. Someone was giving him oxygen and wiping his        |
| forehead with a cool cloth. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |
