| 1953 - At 11:58 a.m. in Shreveport, Louisiana a USAF airman and       |
| private pilot spotted five yellow discs making circular turns and     |
| fluttering in the daytime sky. Three of the discs vanished while the  |
| other two flew objects flew erratic square turns for a total of four  |
| minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).       |

| 1960 - A nocturnal light trailed after a white, fan-shaped UFO in the |
| skies over Rome AFB, New York at 6:27 p.m. Five military witnesses    |
| including control tower officer Capt. J. Huey and four other tower    |
| operators witnessed the two UFOs. They moved slowly in a three to     |
| four minute descent. (Sources: US Air Force Project Blue Book files   |

| 1961 - A ship's crew watched an oddly shaped flying object twist,     |
| turn, and fall into the sea between Lewis and Harris Islands in the   |
| Western Isles off Scotland. On that night at 10:15 p.m. a red sphere  |
| with light rays projecting out ahead of it was seen by Mrs. Lapham    |
| and her daughter for ten minutes in Bark River, Michigan. Her dog     |
| howled during the time that the UFO was present. (Sources: Janet      |

| over Braybrook, Victoria, Australia. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs    |

| 1966 - An eighteen year old was driving near Keith, South Australia   |
| when he saw a bluish disc-shaped UFO with lights, about 5 meters in   |
| diameter. The object hovered, and then vanished. (Source: Michael     |

| 1967 - There were seven good UFO reports made in North America on     |
| this day. Two 12-year-old boys in Bunkie, Louisiana saw two points of |
| light with tails moving in spurts through the sky for about ten       |
| minutes at 1:30 a.m. At eleven o'clock in the morning, an engineer    |
| named Scott sighted a round, luminescent object the size of a dime at |
| arm's length flying in a "lazy, lackadaisical manner" for 40 seconds  |
| in Newburgh, New York. A resident of Topeka, Kansas noticed a wide    |
| top-shaped UFO with red and blue body lights at 7:05 p.m. local time. |
| The sighting lasted three minutes, and he noted that there was        |
| electrical interference on his television at the time. Less than 15   |
| minutes later, at 8:19 EST, a multicolored oval object with red and   |
| green lights and a bright white light in the middle, made a ninety    |
| degree turn in the sky and then shot out over a road in Grand Haven,  |
| Michigan. It stopped in place, then shot away at a speed that was too |
| fast to follow with the eye. At 7:30 p.m. MST in Vernal, Utah a       |
| luminous orange dome-shaped object, blue-green and with occasional    |
| red flamelike lights on the underside, dipped low and then            |
| disappeared over a hill after more than 30 minutes. In Port McNeill,  |
| British Columbia at 7:30 p.m. PST four witnesses named Flick,         |
| Harrison, and Siemens watched a large, bright, oval-shaped UFO that   |
| was white on top and blue on the bottom. They viewed it through a 45x |
| telescope for several minutes. It later changed color to a bright red |
| as it went straight, left, right, and disappeared and reappeared      |
| several times. Finally, at nine p.m. MST a cigar-shaped object        |
| briefly hovered over a hospital in Edmonton, Alberta. It was white on |
| top and red on the bottom, and made a sound like a siren. (Sources:   |

| 1970 - A boy saw a UFO that landed on four legs in Terrace, British   |
| Columbia around noon. He encountered a humanoid with a greenish tint  |
| who jabbered at him in an unintelligible language. (Source: John      |

| 1971 - Matt Dickson of Lawton, Oklahoma heard something out the front |
| of his house early this evening. He looked out and in the dark caught |
| a glimpse of a vaguely human-like figure kneeling on the front lawn   |
| near a nearby empty fishpond. Curious, Dickson decided to find out    |
| who the stranger was. He stepped out on his front porch for a better  |
| look and was terrified to see a wolf-like man attempting to scoop up  |
| puddles of water from the bottom of the fish pond, crouched on its    |
| hands and knees. The sight was so shocking that Dickson suffered a    |
| heart attack and had to be rushed to Comanche County Memorial         |
| Hospital. In a report to the police Dickson described the creature as |
| tall, with a lot of hair all over its face and body. It was dressed   |
| in an indescribable manner. Others saw the same or similar creature   |
| that same night. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |

| 1974 - On a highway one mile east of LaTrobe, Tasmania two witnesses, |
| Thornton and Lamprey, sighted an orange colored UFO with a dome on    |
| top at 9:45 p.m. It was either disc shaped or delta shaped with three |
| rounded corners, and it paced their vehicle. The object was about the |
| size of a car. When they turned their car headlights off, the UFO     |
| responded by rapidly approaching. Their encounter lasted three        |
| minutes. (Source: W. K. Roberts, FSR, November 1975, p. 47).          |

| 1975 - In Harris county, Texas a cow and a second dead animal were    |
| found mutilated. Both of the eyes and the tongue were removed from    |
| the first animal. The sexual organs were removed from the second      |
| animal. (Source: Richard Hall, Zetetic Scholar, 050-016, citing the   |

| 1977 - Nils Toms Labba, age 51, a reindeer keeper in Ovre Soppero,    |
| Norrbotten province, Sweden was out on his motor scooter in the       |
| woods. At 10:00 a.m. near a lake beachfront he observed four strange  |
| beings dressed in brown. They seemed to be just staring blankly.      |
| Nearby them was a UFO about the size of a car that appeared to be     |
| transparent. When he approached to within 500 feet they quickly       |
| entered the object, and it ascended silently into the sky. When it    |
| took off the light made his eyes irritated. He drove to the landing   |
| site on his scooter but found no traces. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek,    |

| Lancashire, an ovoid UFO hovered over the York bridge for several     |
| seconds before shooting behind some clouds. (Source: UFO Newsclipping |

| 1996 - Flashing lights in a triangular formation flew over Beufort,   |
| Sabah province, Malaysia on this night. A car was levitated by a UFO  |
| or UFOs in Lugo, Spain and put down on the opposite side of the road  |
| at 1:45 a.m. The car's dashboard clock also stopped working. The      |
| nocturnal lights associated with the UFO or UFOs were witnessed by    |
| independent witnesses. A pilot of a small aircraft over Saginaw,      |
| Michigan had to dive to avoid a collision with a very bright ball of  |
| light that appeared to jump out at his plane at around 10:00 p.m. In  |
| Seattle, Washington a very short dwarf appeared in a woman's bedroom  |
| during the night. (Sources: Ahmad Jamaludin, Centre for Malaysian UFO |

| 1997 - In Burnie, Tasmania a clear jelly like substance with yellow   |
| flakes in it was discovered on a lawn over a one-meter wide area. The |
