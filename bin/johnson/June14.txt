| 1947 - At noon in Bakersfield, California a man saw 10 flying saucers |
| fly over in a triangular formation. Their speed was estimated to be   |
| 900 kilometers per hour. The report was one of the early cases        |
| investigated by the FBI. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, January     |

| 1958 - At 10:46 a.m. airport weather observer O. R. Foster in Pueblo, |
| Colorado using a theodolite, sighted a domed disc-shaped object. It   |
| was silver in color but gave off no metallic luster. It flew overhead |

| 1964 - Charles Englebrecht, age 18, went outside at 9:30 p.m. in      |
| Dale, Indiana when his TV and all house lights suddenly failed. He    |
| saw a glowing blue-white object, about 30-cm in diameter, land about  |
| 18 meters away in a field. He felt a mild electric shock when he      |
| tried to approach it and was unable to move forward toward the        |
| object. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of    |

| 1964 - That same evening at 9:30 p.m. three prominent citizens of     |
| Salta, Argentina--a lawyer, an engineer, and a businessman--were      |
| driving along highway 9 when a rectangular shaped UFO, reddish-orange |
| in color, dove down several times in front of them. The first time    |
| the UFO caused such tremendous condensation on all their windows that |
| they had to stop and wipe the windows. When the thing reappeared they |
| saw that it was about 16 feet high, 20 feet wide, and had what        |
| appeared to be two big blades revolving clockwise as it flew along    |
| silently above the road. Some distance ahead there was a stationary   |
| rectangular dark red light about 50 cm square. To their amazement     |
| they saw the larger object scoop up this light and vanish at high     |
| speed. (Source: Gordon Creighton, "Argentina 1963/64--Part IV", FSR, May      |

| 1967 - A man sitting in his yard in Eastern Henrico County, Virginia  |
| saw a bright UFO overhead that dropped a substance that struck his    |
| arm. He received burns on his arm and the left side of his face.      |

| 1968 - At 45 minutes after midnight Mr. Pedro Pretzel, a 36-year-old  |
| hotel proprietor in the resort town of Villa Carlos Paz, Cordoba,     |
| Argentina sighted a UFO with two very intense beams of red light      |
| while walking home. A short while later his 19-year-old daughter      |
| Maria, who had been working as the hotel receptionist, encountered a  |
| six and a half foot tall blond man dressed in a sky blue diver suit,  |
| holding a sky blue sphere in his left hand. On his right hand was a   |
| huge ring, like a gauntlet covering half his hand. The ends of his    |
| fingers and toes emitted light, and whenever he pointed his hand at   |
| her she felt faint and began to lose consciousness. He smiled and     |
| spoke to her in an unintelligible language for some minutes before    |
| leaving. (Sources: Charles Bowen, FSR, September-October 1968, p. 11; |

| 1968 - A few hours later in Cabanas, Cuba a soldier fired 48 rounds   |
| from his machine gun at a landed UFO. Shortly after midnight several  |
| bursts of machine gun fire were heard coming from a location in the   |
| vicinity where militia member Isidro Puentes Ventura was on guard     |
| duty. At dawn, Puentes was found unconscious by an Army patrol and    |
| taken to a hospital in Pinar Del Rio, where he remained in shock and  |
| unable to speak for six days. Removed to the neurological ward at the |
| Naval Hospital in Havana, Puentes was diagnosed to be suffering from  |
| emotional trauma, remaining in shock for another week. At the site    |
| where Puentes had been posted, Cuban and Soviet intelligence          |
| investigators found forty-eight spent cartridges and fourteen bullets |
| apparently flattened by impact, as well as equally spaced             |
| indentations in the ground, indicating that a heavy device had        |
| landed. At the landing site three indentations were found suggesting  |
| tripod landing gear, inscribing a circle about four meters in         |
| diameter. Tests revealed that the soil had been exposed to a high     |
| degree of heat.                                                       |

| When Puentes recovered consciousness he reported that he had come to  |
| within 150 feet of a brilliant disc-shaped object on the ground, with |
| a dome and several antennas on top. Convinced that the device was an  |
| American helicopter, Puentes fired at it. The craft turned orange and |
| emitted a loud whistling sound, Puentes last recollection before      |
| losing consciousness. Soviet intelligence specialists subjected       |
| Puentes to a fifty-hour interrogation after which he was examined by  |
| a team of psychiatrists and put through fifteen hypnosis sessions. No |
| contradictions were found in his story. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, UFO |

| 1968 - At 6 p.m., or about the same time that the widely publicized   |
| asteroid "Icarus" passed close to Earth, strange events were reported |
| in the northern Italian province of Abruzzi. A semi-hysterical woman  |
| phoned the Celano, Italy police station reporting that three huge,    |
| disc-shaped UFOs were hovering outside of town. The objects glowed a  |
| pale red. Lt. Germonde took the call. Minutes later other witnesses   |
| reported seeing "spinning discs" the size of houses slowly descend to |
| the ground in a wooded area near the town. But soon it got much       |
| weirder. Lt. Germonde received a call from a bar-restaurant owner     |
| reporting "huge birds with tiny wings and with faces like humans."    |
| According to the witness there were four or five huge birds or flying |
| humanoids flying towards Celano. The strange creatures were described |
| as three-feet in height and flying upright, as if they were men being |
| propelled above the ground by some unknown force. No wings were       |
| visible, only a blur above their shoulders like the fast-moving wings |
| of a hummingbird. Whatever kept them flying was small and moving very |
| fast. The creatures reportedly flew at a height of only a few feet    |
| above the ground. They appeared to have trouble moving in heavily     |
| wooded areas. Their faces were reported to have been human like, but  |
| contained blank looks. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact   |

| 1968 - Late on this same night in La Armonia, Argentina a man was in  |
| his bed resting when two very tall human looking figures appeared in  |
| his room. They were thin and wore tight-fitting green shiny           |
| coveralls. The men sat on the edge of the witness's bed and one of    |
| them raised his hand making the witness feel dizzy, he then lowered   |
| it and the witness felt better, they then left. (Source: Albert S.    |

| 1969 - At 2:30 a.m. in Tucson, Arizona four people saw a glowing red  |
| light in the northwest sky. It flew from 30 degrees elevation and     |
| passed near zenith overhead. One witness viewed the object through    |
| binoculars, and he described a point source coming out of the light,  |
| orbiting, and then re-entering. Someone shot some motion picture film |
| of the object. (Source: APRO Bulletin, July-August 1968, p. 8).       |

| 1974 - A maneuvering disc-shaped object was seen by independent       |
| witnesses in Nashua, New Hampshire at 12:35 a.m., 12:50 a.m., and     |
| 2:00 a.m. over Nashua. It was described as a large metallic object,   |
| dark on the lower half, with red lights around the rim. The same or   |
| similar object was seen zigzagging over Nashua airport. (Source: Center for   |
| UFO Studies case investigation files, received July 17, 1974).        |

| 1974 - Earlier that same day, Santiago Pulido Romero, age 46, was    |
| driving to his father's farm in Medellin, Spain at 4:30 a.m. when he  |
| saw a bright light, then a "pot-shaped" object flying rapidly towards |
| him at a low altitude. The object paced his car at a distance of some |
| 70 meters to the right. When his headlights were turned on the UFO    |
| would approach. When he turned them off the UFO moved away. The       |
| object hovered over the farmhouse he entered, illuminating the area   |
| "like daytime". It rotated as it hovered, with a slight back-and      |
| forth, pendulum motion. No sound was heard. The UFO had a conical     |
| turret on top, which emitted a brilliant yellow light. Inside the     |
| turret he could see three beings more than two meters tall, moving    |
| stiffly, with something like helmets on their heads. The object was   |
| in view for more than 90 minutes and was seen by others. It departed  |
| as the sun rose. (Source: Eileen Buckle, Spanish UFO Fiesta, FSR, December    |

| 1974 - At 10:15 p.m. in Wallers, France a dark object and some        |
| nocturnal lights were sighted low behind some trees. Two lights flew  |
| all over the place, while a huge ball of light was seen to land.      |
| Ground traces were reportedly found at the site. (Source: Lumieres    |

| 1978 - At 10:40 p.m. a 60-foot diameter disc directed beams of light  |
| at two boys in Williamson, West Virginia. The boys found they were    |
| paralyzed and couldn't move. They reported an episode of missing      |
| time. Others heard an odd noise while this was taking place. (Source: |

| 1980 - There were over 30 reports of luminous ring-shaped UFOs from   |
| Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay and Brazil this evening.  At around 7 p.m. twenty kilometers west of   |
| Junin, Argentina a circular object approached a car with five people  |
| inside from behind, forcing the driver to pull over. The object was   |
| dark in the center with luminous white points around the rim. It      |
| descended by the highway with a vertical motion and hung about 1.5    |
| meters above the ground. It left a trail of white smoke. (Source: UFO |

| 1980 - At the same time pilots, crew, and passengers of some          |
| commercial airplanes were forced to delay their takeoffs while a UFO  |
| flew toward the Ezeiza, Argentina runway. It nearly crashed into a    |
| building, but gained altitude and flew away. It was tracked on radar  |
| at the Jorge Newbery airport in Ezeiza. (Source: UFO Newsclipping     |

| 1980 - At 7:05 two reporters for the La Capital newspaper in Rosario, |
| Argentina said that a "fleet of flying saucers" was seen by several   |
| witnesses and themselves from Independencia Park. One was shaped like |
| a "teething ring", the second was smaller and white in color, and the |
| third object was like a dot with a halo around it. (Sources: UFO      |

| 1992 - Topanga Canyon, California -- According to the Lost             |
| Hills/Malibu sheriff's office, a badly shaken man reported that an    |
| unidentified bright light followed him and his girlfriend sometime    |
| after midnight in Topanga Canyon. "Suddenly it was over us, we lost   |
| control of the car and it lifted us up in the sky--lifted us over the |
| ground." What happened next was vague, according to the driver, who   |
| reckons they both lost memory for "maybe a couple of minutes, and     |
| then we were put down. Suddenly it wasn't there anymore." Shortly     |
| afterwards another call was received by the Sheriff's office from     |
| another witness, who together with his girlfriend saw three flying    |
| disks high up in the Canyon. "They were following us above the car,   |
| and we stopped and got out…we watched them and within maybe three     |
| seconds, they were gone--straight up into the air." (Source: Timothy  |

| 2005 - The main witness, June Mark M. Sepe, and some friends          |
| were camping near some woods in a small clearing next to Lake Nice    |
| Francisco in Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental, The Philippines. After |
| dinner they sat around the campfire planning their next day           |
| activities. At around 9:20 p.m. they were surprised to see a          |
| car headlight like light glowing behind some trees. They went closer  |
| to investigate and came upon a landed cone-cylindrical shaped craft,  |
| with no visible doors or windows. It stood about 8-10 feet high and   |
| was resting on top of what appeared to be tripod landing gear. No     |
| sound came from the craft, but they heard some rustling of grass and  |
| leaves, which came from three human looking beings making repairs on  |
| the craft. They were wearing metallic silver jumpsuits and black      |
| “bonnet-like helmets.” The men hid in the bushes and observed the     |
| scene for about 15-20 minutes when they heard a voice call out from   |
| within the craft. They could not understand the language, but the     |
| quality of the voice was soft and metallic like. After awhile the     |
| three beings went back into the craft, entering through the bottom of |
| the craft, and they appeared to quickly float upwards (just like      |
| being sucked up by a vacuum cleaner). There was a high-pitched        |
| swooshing and humming noise, and then the craft lifted off and shot   |
| out of the forest, and at the same time the witnesses felt a gust of  |
| cool wind. One of the witnesses attempted to photograph the object    |
| with his mobile phone, but the picture was totally blurry. The five   |
| other witnesses were Rodel Rulona, William Gomez, John Rabuyo, Jude   |
| Igar, and Rolly de Gracia. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |
