| 1954 - In the predawn hours a 30-year-old mechanic, Joseph Roy, was   |
| returning home by motorcycle on National Highway 51 from Reims        |
| to Rethel, France. Near the Isles-sur-Suippe he noticed a             |
| sharp reddish gleam on the road ahead of him. It suddenly             |
| disappeared, and when he arrived at the point where he had seen the   |
| light he noticed an odd looking object in a field. It was about three |
| meters in length and had the form of a large artillery shell with     |
| several portholes on the front. He was also able to distinguish a     |
| vague dark silhouette of a small humanoid figure. However, seized     |
| with fright he did not stay longer to investigate and sped away as    |
| quickly as he could. Three other workmen reported seeing the same     |
| gleaming light in the area.  (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,  |

| 1954 - At 7:15 p.m. an astronomer named Potter and one other witness  |
| in Norwich, England viewed a domed disc hovering for three minutes    |
| through a telescope. It had lit windows in the dome, and at one point |
| made a 180 degree turn. (Sources: Leonard L. Cramp, Piece for a       |

| 1954 - On this evening Mr. and Mrs. Laroche from Paris saw a fiery    |
| sphere land near Chantonnay, Monchamps, France. At 9:30 p.m. near the |
| military barracks in La Fere, Aisne, France two soldiers saw a        |
| strange luminous torpedo-shaped object on the ground 300 meters away. |
| As one of them approached the four meter long craft, which stood      |
| about 80 cm high, he found himself paralyzed.  Finally, at 10:30 p.m. |
| two women, Mrs. Salabrino and her adult daughter, saw a whitish light |
| in the western sky in Villers-le-Lac, France. It seemed to slowly     |
| approach the ground, and was later seen between the railway station   |
| and the bridge 100 meters away from their house. When it moved, a     |
| very bright light was visible under its dark mass. It gave off a flow |
| of sparks and rose, hovered for a moment, and then flew away rapidly. |

| 1967 - At seven o'clock in the evening numerous strong radar targets  |
| were detected at the same time that elliptical, fuzzy objects with    |
| red and green lights were seen overhead at Vandenburg AFB,            |
| California. At least two objects were picked up on five               |
| separate radars. Scrambled jet fighters did not find them. They moved |
| at speeds of 80 knots, and changed altitude. Most targets were over   |
| the ocean. The various Air Force explanations of mirages, birds, and  |
| anomalous propagation have been judged to be lacking in credibility.  |

| 1967 - An abduction and sexual encounter occurred in Belfast,         |
| Northern Ireland at 10:45 p.m. Eugene Browne was walking home from a  |
| jazz club when he saw a craft in the sky. A yellow light came from    |
| it, which danced around him and made him feel dizzy and soon lose     |
| consciousness. He awoke on an exam table in a windowless, oblong room |
| that was lit by a blue light from the floor. He was strapped by metal |
| bands attached to an apparatus on the side of the table. Four men and |
| a woman surrounded him; although they were human in appearance they   |
| had a bluish aura. The tallest was dressed in a dark one-piece        |
| uniform and said, "at last, someone who will do," and released him.   |
| The woman had long blond hair, high cheekbones and was very fair with |
| a freckled complexion. He had sex with her and she told him they were |
| "from another galaxy" and were experimenting to obtain human seed.    |
| Afterwards he was tied up and told it would not be long before he was |
| returned. He blacked out again and recovered in a field about a mile  |
| from his original location. He had been abducted for about 40         |
| minutes. He saw the object leave, which took off with a whistling     |
| sound as it retracted its tripod landing gear and flew off. He        |
| reportedly suffered somephysiological effects after the encounter.    |

| 1970 - At 4:30 a.m. two married couples, the Morrises and the         |
| Willies, traveling together on US Highway 63 twelve miles north       |
| of Rolla, Missouri had a close encounter with a luminous              |
| crescent-shaped object that descended very rapidly. The UFO appeared  |
| to have a saw-toothed bottom edge, and seemed to be dripping a        |
| liquid. It approached to within 50 feet of the ground, and then took  |
| off at a 70 degree angle at high speed, leaving behind a glowing      |
| trail. (Source: Kansas City Times, October 6, 1973; Mrs. K. Smith,    |

| 1973 - Shortly after midnight a married couple in                     |
| St.-Mathias-de-Chambly, Quebec saw bright lights on their property.   |
| Later that morning they observed a dome like a "tent" about a third   |
| of a mile away. A second, smaller object emerged from it and moved    |
| across the ground to a distance of about 200 feet from them. Five     |
| figures of small stature, wearing bright yellow garments and helmets, |
| moved quickly back and forth between the two objects for a time. When |
| the witnesses next looked, both the objects and the humanoids had     |
| vanished. Ground traces were found at the sight the next day          |
| consisting of three rectangular imprints arranged in a triangle with  |
| 34 foot sides. There was a 50 foot in diameter circle of burnt grass, |
| and a second circle 12 feet in diameter next to a spring. The         |
| daughter, who investigated, subsequently suffered from nausea         |
| and headaches. (Sources: Canadian UFO Report, Spring 1974, p. 22;     |

| 1975 - On this night in Santa Clara, California three witnesses had a |
| close encounter with a saucer-shaped disc with a bluish white glow    |
| underneath. (Source: CUFOS News Bulletin, February 1976, p. 8).       |

| 1976 - At 7:20 p.m. six witnesses saw a domed disc-shaped object over |
| a factory in Rive-de-Gier, Loire, France. A figure was seen moving    |
| about inside the dome. The object turned extremely bright and shot    |
| away rapidly to the east. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, March       |

| 1977 - A housewife in Fiesole, Italy had gone to visit the pediatric  |
| ward of the local hospital, and was looking out the window at 10 p.m. |
| when she noticed a pulsating red light on the ground beside a nearby  |
| hill. It was the apparent size of a full moon. Moments later two      |
| similar pulsating lights descended at a 45 degree angle and came down |
| near the witness. The woman opened the window and was able to see one |
| of the lights dim, then stop and hover, as if preparing to land. At   |
| this point she was joined by other witnesses. The light turned        |
| silvery white in color and landed. It then began changing colors,     |
| first to red and then to silvery white. When the color was silvery    |
| white two human like figures could be seen moving slowly inside the   |
| length of the illuminated object. The other witnesses became tired of |
| watching after awhile, and left to got to bed. Later, the original    |
| witness saw another light appear again in the same location. (Source: |

| 1979 - The witness had been watching television late at night by      |
| himself in Toms River, New Jersey when around midnight a sense of     |
| apprehension overcame him and an intense blue light appeared inside   |
| the room. It brightened and then faded. The witness armed himself     |
| with a handgun and went outside to investigate. He saw a bright light |
| among the nearby trees. Something then touched his neck and he        |
| dropped his gun and fell to the ground, unable to move. Several       |
| shadowy, short humanoids came up to him. They had bright eyes, long   |
| fingers, and skinny arms. The beings seemed weak and fearful of him.  |
| They also felt cold to the touch. A light surrounded the witness and  |
| he floated towards a black cloud with a light inside. He next         |
| remembered being in a room where the beings touched him with lights   |
| and "drained him of energy." The beings never spoke to or otherwise   |
| communicated with the witness. (Sources: Thomas E. Bullard, UFO       |

| 1979 - A 28-year-old stone mason and his companion driving between    |
| Capulin and Des Moines, New Mexico at three o'clock in the morning    |
| had a close encounter with an octagonal UFO that came in low in front |
| of the car. It was several times larger than the Moon, with light     |
| that was shining through sections of the object. It appeared to be    |
| metallic, with bolts "like a tank," and passed slowly and silently    |
| over the car headed eastbound. (Source: Allan Hendry, International   |
