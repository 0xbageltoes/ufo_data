| 1950 - At 4:55 a.m. in Durban, South Africa three men in a truck and  |
| several other people witnessed a dark red, torpedo-shaped object that |
| had a dark center, flying straight and level. (Sources: Project Blue  |
| Book files counted in official statistics, case # 896; Don Berliner,  |
| Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).                                       |
|                                                                       |
| 1953 - In Malang, Indonesia on the island of Java a metallic          |
| disc-shaped object was seen twice, at high and low altitudes. It rose |
| up very fast, and shot off quickly to the north. (Source: Loren E.    |

| 1965 - At least 50 members of the Toba Indian tribe in Chalac,        |
| Formosa Province, Argentina watched as a group of UFOs were seen      |
| flying overhead at around 9 p.m. One of the craft, bathed constantly  |
| in light beams emanating from small wing-like projections, landed in  |
| a pasture, and three tall beings enveloped in luminous halos emerged, |
| causing the local population to go down on their knees. The beings    |
| approached slowly, with gestures that dissuaded one of the Indians    |
| from coming any closer to the UFO. A voice was then heard, telling    |
| the witnesses to remain calm for there was nothing to fear, and that  |
| the space people would return to bring peace on earth. The humanoids  |
| then returned to their craft, which then took off with a blinding     |
| luminosity. Photographs were said to have been taken by local police  |
| officers. (Sources: Donald B. Hanlon, Flying Saucer Review,           |

| 1967 - Mrs. Wolf, a nurse, was driving down a road in Toledo, Ohio at |
| 7:40 p.m. EST when she had a close encounter with an orange-yellowish |
| flattened sphere. It hovered over the road at treetop height,         |
| pulsating, and then emitted a wide beam of light downward. It started |
| pacing her car. Her speedometer was affected and her wristwatch       |
| stopped. She also reported that as a result of the close encounter    |
| her skin condition cleared up. (Sources: NICAP case files, letter     |
| dated March 8, 1967; Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A     |

| 1967 - Two hours after the Toledo close encounter, another close      |
| encounter involving electromagnetic effects and physical traces       |
| occurred in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. At 8:40 p.m. CST dogs began yelping |
| when a UFO flew by fast and low. The object's light went out, and the |
| object dropped to the ground. A high-pitched whine with an undertone  |
| of humming occurred later for 30 seconds. A 15 foot in diameter ice   |
| area was found at the landing site, which caused a compass to spin.   |

| 1968 - On this night at 12:12 a.m. Ms. Cecilia Brewer and five        |
| companions were driving home from work between Barkhamsted and        |
| Winsted, Connecticut and heading west when their car's engine started |
| to miss and they encountered a silvery domed disc-shaped UFO on the   |
| left side of the highway in a forest clearing. The object was at a    |
| distance of about 150 feet, and had a cone of white light coming from |
| the bottom of the object. It also had a green lit, rectangular window |
| in the dome. They stopped to watch the UFO before it flew away, the   |
| total duration of their close encounter being around 15 minutes.      |

| Winsted, Connecticut Close Encounter - 1968                           |

| 1968 - At eleven o'clock that night Miss Amato, a 12-year-old girl,   |
| heard a "bloop-bloop" noise outside her bedroom window and looked out |
| her window at the abandoned Winsted, Connecticut railroad station     |
| behind her family's house. She saw a white egg-shaped UFO, a little   |
| larger than a station wagon, hovering close to the ground beside the  |
| building and railroad tracks. A short beam of light came out of the   |
| craft, pointed downward at an angle like a ramp, and 15-20 little men |
| about three feet tall walked down the light beam in single file and   |
| jumped from the end of the beam to the ground. They were dressed in   |
| dull silver coveralls and wore fishbowl-type helmets. They proceeded  |
| to climb up the side of the station, one after another, with a hand   |
| over hand movement as if they were swimming or had suction cups on    |
| their hands. When they reached the roof, they spread out in different |
| directions and appeared to be interested in looking down inside the   |
| building through a skylight. The girl became frightened at this point |
| and went to bed, covering her head with the bedcovers. The building   |
| was being used as a storage site for ammonium nitrate fertilizer.     |

| 1968 - At dusk a woman living in a cabin near the coast on Keats      |
| Island, British Columbia saw a single object maneuvering 60           |
| feet above the ocean. It had frosted yellow side lights with a bright |
| red light in the middle, and it slid back and forth across sky as if  |
| on rail. Then a "big boat" lit up on the water's surface, and shot    |
| six amber 4-foot-wide balls of light up into the sky. (Source: John   |

| 1979 - In Littleborough, Greater Manchester, England a rotating       |
| object landed in a quarry at two o'clock in the morning. Police and   |
| two others went to investigate, but found nothing. Later that evening |
| in Oakenholt, Clywd, Wales a woman out walking her dog at 6:15 p.m.   |
| was surprised when the animal suddenly laid down on the ground and    |
| began whining for no apparent reason. Glancing ahead of her, she saw  |
| a bright orange hovering spinning sphere. She then looked to her side |
| and saw nearby, standing in the shadows among some bushes, two        |
| silvery-garbed humanoid figures who appeared to be smiling. Her dog   |
| temporarily distracted her, and when she looked back again the        |
| figures were gone. The bright orange sphere then vanished, and the    |
| dog ran home barking. (For a nearly identical incident, but one       |
| involving missing time, see the account on February 18, 1990 in       |
| Germany). (Sources: (1) Paul Devereax, Earth Lights Revelation, p.    |

| 1995 - A young man driving in Council Bluffs, Iowa at 7 p.m. saw a    |
| huge, gray triangle-shaped object with three solid lights. He pulled  |
| off the highway to watch the craft with "archways" silently fly over. |

| 1995 - At 8:00 p.m. in Hanret, Hainaut Province, Belgium Veronique    |
| V., who had been involved in previous UFO close encounters, had gone  |
| outdoors with her car mechanic to fetch her car which had broken      |
| down. Once outside both saw an unusual light in the sky. The mechanic |
| thought it was a plane left to tow the car, while Veronique stayed    |
| outside and watched the light descend towards her house. She begins   |
| to panic and rushes inside her house, switching off the lights and    |
| turning on the television. At the same time her dogs began howling in |
| the backyard, and her small Yorkshire terrier began growling as if    |
| there was a stranger in the house. Veronique went upstairs and looked |
| out a window. She then noticed that her room appeared "to be without  |
| walls" and she saw a hovering triangular UFO direct a beam of white   |
| light towards her. The white beam of light lasts for about 10         |
| seconds. On the triangle's front apex she could see different colored |
| lights. The object then began circling the house and Veronique felt a |
| strange attraction to the object, but she fought against it. Suddenly |
| the UFO vanished and everything returned to normal. (Source: Albert   |

| 1999 - In Bangues, Minas Gerais state, Brazil Jose Joaquim Dos Santos |
| was parked on the side of the road resting in his car at midnight     |
| when he looked up and saw a short figure with a very large head       |
| looking inside his car through a rear passenger window. Frightened,   |
| he got out of the car and saw the short figure disappear into the     |
| distance up the roadway. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |

| 2005 - A man and his son spotted a huge triangular shaped UFO flying  |
| over Southfield, Michigan at 6:30 p.m. It flew at a high rate of      |
| speed, then suddenly stopped and made a quick turn, and finally shot  |
| off into the atmosphere. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO       |
