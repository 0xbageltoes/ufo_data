| 1953 - Two miners in Brush Creek, California, John Q. Black, age 48,  |
| and John Van Allen, reported that they saw a silvery object land on a |
| sand bar 50 m away from them. It was 2.5 meters in diameter with      |
| tripod landing gear. An occupant described as a broad-shouldered      |
| dwarf, wearing clothing that covered the head and body was also seen. |
| His arms and legs were covered with tweed-like cloth fastened at the  |
| wrists and ankle. The UFO occupant filled a shiny pail with water and |
| handed it to someone inside the craft. He then appeared to notice Mr. |
| Black and jumped into the craft, which made a hissing sound when it   |
| departed. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of  |
| Landings, p. 202).                                                    |

| 1954 - Mr. Nigel Frapple was cycling home from a dance in Wincanton,  |
| England. At Redlynch crossroads he saw an orange glow in a field and  |
| stopped to observe it from a hedge. The glow came from a huge object  |
| on the other side of the hedge only 35 meters away, hovering less     |
| than seven meters above the ground. It made a throbbing sound. After  |
| a minute it moved toward away the northwest, accelerating and         |
| climbing into the sky. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia:  |
| A Century of Landings, pp. 206-207).                                  |

| 1959 - At 5:30 p.m. two hunters named Sanchez and Fogliani observed a |
| landed silvery metallic disc in Tres Lomas, La Pampa, Argentina.      |
| Grass at the landing site was flattened. (Sources: La Razon, May 24,  |

| 1963 - On this evening a 17-year-old witness named Bushbridge,        |
| driving his car between Glencoe and Mount Gambier, South Australia    |
| saw what he at first thought was a bulldozer by the side of the road. |
| He came within 20 meters of it, and then was blinded by a strong      |
| light as his car suddenly stopped. The object crossed the road and    |
| flew away. The light was as intense as a welder's torch. The          |
| witness's father later testified that his son came home white and     |
| visibly terrified. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, November 1963, p. 6;      |

| 1965 - At 7:00 p.m., six members of the McDonald family in Leroy      |
| Township, Ohio saw a silvery-white disc with a row of  portholes that |
| were about one-foot in diameter.  The disc skimmed over the rooftop   |
| of their house making a low buzzing or purring sound, and was         |
| estimated to be the size of a car.  At the time of the object’s       |
| passage, neighbors noted unusual TV and radio interference, and a     |
| horse and dog reacted strongly. The dog ran and hid, while the horse  |
| ran back and forth on its tether with its ears back and eyes wild.    |

| 1967 - Polish-born Steve Michalac, age 52, an industrial mechanic and |
| prospector, saw two red-glowing objects flying at high speed while    |
| prospecting at Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada. One of them landed      |
| nearby, and blew up vegetation as it landed. It was surrounded by a   |
| glow, and he watched it for 30 minutes before a door opened,          |
| revealing a purple glow inside. A high-pitched humming sound and an   |
| odor resembling a burning electrical circuit were noted. Seeing no    |
| further activity Mr. Michalac approached the landed craft, but he     |
| then heard voices, and when he touched the craft he burned his        |
| rubber-coated glove, and he was blown backwards by a hot blast of     |
| air. The object then started spinning. The witness felt dizzy,        |
| suffered minor face burns, and second and third degree burns on his   |
| chest. He vomited frequently for the next four days, and was          |
| hospitalized, losing over 10 kilograms. The landed craft was          |
| estimated to be 11 meters in diameter and three meters tall, with a   |
| one meter high superstructure. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, May-June      |

| 1969 - Jose Pereira Sacramento was awakened by a noise outside his    |
| home in Vila Operaria, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Going outside through    |
| his back door at 1:00 a.m., he saw "the white face of an animal" and  |
| a light in the sky which came down toward him. He was paralyzed and   |
| could not move to re-enter the house or call out. An "enormous        |
| object" landed beside him, and he was "pulled through an opening"     |
| into the ship, finding himself inside a small elevator, which went up |
| into a brightly lit circular compartment with a curved ceiling, about |
| 45 feet in diameter. In this room were six small humanoid beings only |
| 31 inches tall. They had big heads and they wore tight-fitting,       |
| plastic like outfits, entirely covering their bodies and heads, light |
| cream in color, having openings only for their eyes and ears. Their   |
| eyes were slanted. Each entity stood inside a cylinder three feet in  |
| diameter and 15" high, and above its head was a curved plate with a   |
| lever. They spoke among themselves in a language of short shrilly     |
| sounds, "like pigs grunting." After four or five minutes one of the   |
| beings moved a control and the illumination increased in brightness   |
| to such a point that Pereira lost consciousness. At 6:00 a.m. he woke |
| up in his bed, not knowing how he got there. He had an inflammation   |
| of the eyes lasted a month, and a year after the event he still felt  |
| light-headed and had difficulty concentrating. (Source: David F. Webb |

| 1974 - A young man of 20 was swimming at 12:30 a.m. at Hampton Beach, |
| New Hampshire when he saw a domed disc-shaped object approach from    |
| the ocean. It landed on the beach about 80 yards away. It had a domed |
| bulge above and below the central rim, and was about 50 feet in       |
| diameter. It stood on four legs and had several lights on the main    |
| body of the object. It also gave off heat and emitted a humming or    |
| pulsating sound. A hatch folded down and a ramp slid out, and a motor |
| like noise was now also audible. A six-foot tall occupant emerged     |
| down the ramp, dressed in a head-to-foot light-colored coverall. Two  |
| hoses ran from the chin area to behind the head, with one hose        |
| running down the back. The figure stepped out briefly onto the sand   |
| and then re-entered the object, which ascended and moved off out to   |
| sea. The man searched the landing site and found a "deep, rose        |
| colored paste and thick liquid" in the four, deep landing marks. He   |
| also found a spot of red where the hatch had opened. Traces had been  |
| obliterated by the tide the following morning, before the             |
| investigator could gather samples. The landing site is not far from   |
| an outflow vent that would later be built for the Seabrook nuclear    |
| reactor. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of  |

| 1974 - At 9:30 p.m. two children in Haisnes-lez-la Bassee, France,    |
| age 10, witnessed an ovoid or football-shaped object that descended   |
| with an oscillating movement. Ground traces were later found were the |
| UFO came down. At 11:00 p.m. an enormous luminous ball of light       |
| approached Haisnes-lez-la Bassee, France and then flew off to the     |
| northwest in the direction of Auchy-les-Mines. The estimated diameter |
| of the object was 42 meters. (Source: Michel Figeut & Jean-Louis      |

| 1982 - A couple driving near a golf course in Caboolture, Queensland, |
| Australia saw a bright light descend. They noted that it was a        |
| saucer-shaped object with portholes around the lower part. It emitted |
| blue beam of light at front of car. They had a period of missing      |
| time, but do recall witnessing a two meter tall silver-suited being.  |
