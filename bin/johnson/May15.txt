| 1879 - Witnesses aboard the ship "Vultur" in the Persian Gulf saw two |
| very large "wheels" spinning in the air at 9:40 p.m. They watched     |
| them slowly descend to the surface of the ocean. Their estimated      |
| diameter was 40 meters, with a distance between the objects of 150    |
| meters. They moved at an estimated speed of 80 kmph. The sighting     |
| lasted 35 minutes. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A   |

| 1909 - Shortly after 1:00 a.m. two witnesses watched as a             |
| cigar-shaped object hovered still over Casnewydd, Wales. Two lights   |
| from the object scanned the Newport Bridge for 10 minutes, then it    |
| flew away. At 11:30 p.m. an observer on the shore in Lowestoft,       |
| Norfolk, England heard a motor sound, then watched a bottle-shaped    |
| object fly overhead. There was a pilot sitting in the                 |
| front. (Sources: (1) Carl Grove, FSR, November 1970, p. 17; Brinsley  |

| 1952 - An U.S.A.F. F-51 aircraft flying over North Korea watched an   |
| unidentified object following a jet interceptor at 6:35 p.m. The      |
| object was subsequently in front of the F-51, with a positive radar   |
| lock-on. At 6,000 yards distance the object pulled away with an       |
| acceleration of 20 G's. At 8:00 p.m. a silvery oval object was seen   |
| below two F-86E jets flying south of Changson-Ni, North Korea at      |
| 8,000-10,000 altitude. The object was estimated to be 20 miles away,  |
| and travelled at a speed of 1,200 -1,500 mph in a "rolling maneuver." |

| 1956 - Two police watched four 30 meter diameter discs exit from a    |
| 150 meter cigar-shaped mother craft over Johot Baharu, Malaysia at    |
| 9:15 p.m. The discs then flew to the south in a V formation. (Source: |

| 1963 - Mr. and Mrs. D. of Carignan, France saw an object on the       |
| ground to the left side of the road as they were driving between      |
| Bergerac and Bordeaux, beyond the Yvrac intersection, 2.5 km from     |
| Maille, Gironde department. They stopped to observe it, and the       |
| object then followed them for part of their trip. The sighting lasted |
| 10 minutes. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century   |
| of Landings, case 570, citing Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 71)      |
| 1964 - At noon two school children in Wheatfield, Indiana saw two     |
| small humanoids on the top floor of a church. At 2:30 p.m. a          |
| 10-year-old girl saw a little man, three feet tall, reclining under a |
| shrub pine tree. He had white hair, a small goatee, long arms, a      |
| reddish-blue complexion, and wore greenish clothing. He looked        |
| injured and appeared to be bleeding. He had more fingers on his hands |
| than a normal human. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |

| 1964 - A circular UFO with very bright headlights flew in "an         |
| extremely wavy motion--like a float bobbing on the water" north of    |
| Lewistown, Montana at 10:28 p.m. It was witnessed by five people from |
| two families. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, August 1964, p. 7;    |

| 1966 - A dark donut or tyre-shaped object with a hole in the center   |
| hovered and wobbled over Itaguai, Rio Janeiro State, Brazil at 5:30   |

| 1967 - After attending an amateur astronomy club meeting, Benito      |
| Hamburgo Valenzuela returned to his home in La Paz, Baja California,  |
| Mexico at around 11:00 p.m. where he encountered a giant, nine foot   |
| tall man. The man had large blue eyes, red hair, and very large ears. |
| He wore a tight fitting red coverall like garment with short sleeves, |
| boots, and bracelets on both arms. On his chest he wore an insignia   |
| of white dots, and he wore a white cap on his head that looked        |
| nickel-plated. He also wore a wide belt, from which hung a small box  |
| with a small antenna. The collosus pulled up a large piece of wood    |
| and sat down on it. He greeted Hamburgo in slightly accented Spanish, |
| and introduced himself as "Wirkle, Chief of the Guard." He answered   |
| Benito's questions, anticipating them before the witness actually     |
| spoke them. He said he was from a very distant "region" and that they |
| were an advanced race, concerned about the misuse of atomic energy.   |
| When he left he refused to shake hands, explaining that contact with  |
| him would aggravate Benito's cardiac condition. (Sources: David F.    |

| 1967 - A pilot and police along with several other witnesses in       |
| northeast Indianapolis, Indiana sighted a fat, multi-colored          |
| cigar-shaped UFO with a brilliant light in front at 11:15 p.m. There  |
| were no blimps flying at the time. It shot straight up (or at a very  |
| steep angle) very rapidly. The object was confirmed on radar.         |
| (Source: Frank Edwards, Flying Saucers - Here and Now! p. 246).       |
| 1971 - Fifteen-year-old Michael D. of Passapatanzy, West Virginia was |
| on his way home with his dog after camping out the previous day with  |
| two other boys. He was crossing a grassy field at 10:00 p.m. when he  |
| saw a bright object slowly approach at a low altitude, passing over   |
| some high-tension wires that crossed the field. He crouched down in   |
| some tall grass as the object landed with a bounce, about 100 feet    |
| away. The silvery UFO was higher than it was wide and had a "walkway" |
| that ran around its circumference. It had red and white revolving     |
| lights on top and made a humming noise. A door "came down" out of     |
| which emerged a "huge" figure who was hunched over and walked in a    |
| "stiff legged, bouncing" fashion. The humanoid being had long arms    |
| and wore shiny, light reflecting clothing. In one hand it held a      |
| glowing box. The humanoid giant appeared to be approaching the tall   |
| grassy area where Michael was hiding, so the teenage ordered his dog  |
| to attack the figure. The being then turned and re-boarded the craft, |
| and within a couple of minutes it took off. His companions from the   |
| camping expedition came and found Michael a short time later still in |
| the grass, moaning and very frightened. The next day seven holes      |
| where found in the ground at the site. They were 2.5 inches wide at   |
| the top and a foot deep into the soil. Two days later, Michael and    |
| several other family members saw a bright disc-shaped object, which   |
| had been pursuing his sisters as they drove in a car up the long      |
| driveway to their house. (Sources: John Carlson, NICAP UFO            |

| 1973 - At 3:10 a.m. northwest of Tosny, Eure Department, France a car |
| experience radio interference in the presence of a UFO. The           |
| disc-shaped object then arced up into sky, changed shape into a       |
| rocket, and vanished. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 141).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - At around 4:00 p.m. Fay, a 7-year-old girl, was with a boy     |
| about her own age on the golf course in Sandown, Isle of Wight,       |
| England when they heard a wailing siren at around 4 p.m. They         |
| followed it through a hedge into a swampy meadow, where the noise     |
| ceased. As they were crossing a brook by a footbridge a strange       |
| figure came out from under the bridge. This person fumbled with a     |
| book, dropped it in the water, retrieved it, and then went with "a    |
| strange hopping motion, with knees raised high" to a metallic "hut"   |
| with no windows.                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| The being was nearly 7-foot tall and neckless. He wore a yellow,      |
| pointed, hood with a black knob on top with "wooden" antennae or      |
| horns on the sides, and a green tunic with a red collar. "His face    |
| had triangular markings for eyes, a brown square of a nose and        |
| motionless yellow lips." Other round markings were on his paper-white |
| cheeks, and a fringe of red hair fell onto his forehead. "Wooden      |
| slats" protruded from his sleeves and from below his white trousers.  |
| There were only three fingers on each blue-gloved hand and 3 toes on  |
| his bare, white feet. The being took from the hut a black knobbed     |
| microphone, into which he spoke to the children, now 50 meters away,  |
| saying "Hello, are you still there?"                                  |
|                                                                       |
| Since his tone sounded friendly, they approached him. He then wrote   |
| in a "notebook", in a large hand, "Hello and I am all colors, Sam."   |
| Talking without the aid of a microphone, his lips did not move, and   |
| his speech was unclear. They asked about his clothes, which were all  |
| ripped, and "asked if he was really a man." "No", he replied, with a  |
| chuckle. When they asked if he was a ghost, he answered "Well, not    |
| really, but I am in an odd sort of way." "What are you then?" they    |
| asked, but he replied, "You know." He also said that he had no name,  |
| and "confided that he was frightened of people."                      |
|                                                                       |
| At his invitation, the children crawled through a flap into his hut,  |
| which he told them he had "just made." It contained two levels. The   |
| lower, which "had plenty of headroom", was "wall papered" in blue     |
| green and covered with a pattern of dials; there was an electric      |
| heater and simple wooden furniture. The upper level, less spacious,   |
| had a metal floor. He told the children that he fed on berries, and   |
| drank the river water after cleaning it. He said he had a camp on the |
| mainland. Inside the hut he removed his hat to reveal round, white    |
| ears and sparse brown hair. Before eating a berry, he performed an    |
| "odd trick" with it; he placed the berry in his ear, where it         |
| disappeared and reappeared at one of his triangular eyes."repeating   |
| the process, the berry traveled to his mouth." The children talked to |
| this being for at least half an hour, then rushed across the golf     |
| links to tell the firs man they had seen a ghost. (Source: David F.   |

| 1973 - There were several reports from England late on this evening.  |
| At 11:00 p.m. several saw a silvery disc-shaped object in the sky     |
| over Fenham, West Moor, and Spennymoor, Durham. At 11:15 p.m. an      |
| ovoid UFO being watched by two on the road between Routh and Wawne,   |
| Humberside, England abruptly vanished. At 11:30 p.m. a sole observer  |
| in Cottingham, Humberside watched an object that was first round in   |
| shape, but later assumed a cigar-like configuration. Finally, there   |
| were several reports from independent witnesses and photographs of a  |
| silvery disc-shaped object from Rothbury, Northumberland. (Source: J. |

| 1974 - On this day a businessman and a teacher had a UFO pace their   |
| car as they drove on the road in Pedroche, Spain. The object was      |
| described as round object and the size of table. When it intercepted  |
| their course they turned the car around and fled. (Source: Richard H. |

| 1974 - At 1:00 p.m. a dull gray, banana-shaped object was sighted     |
| hovering 60 meters over an electronics plant in Arroyo Grande, San    |
| Luis Obispo County, California; it made no noise, and the sighting    |
| lasted four minutes. There were independent witnesses. (Source: Larry |

| 1977 - Two twin sisters had gone into Middle Cliff field, at St.      |
| Brides, Pembrokeshire, Wales not farm from their home at Ripperston   |
| Farm, to play games. It was just after three o'clock when they saw a  |
| silver-suited figure walking away from them, about 60 to 70 feet      |
| away. The being went up to a hedge and seemed to walk through the     |
| barbed-wire fence adjacent to it. It then disappeared. On the other   |
| side of the field a silvery-white disc-shaped object with a red light |
| landed. A a ramp-like stairway came out and a red "box" was ejected   |
| down the stairway to the ground. The stairs were then retracted, and  |
| the door in the object closed and the UFO took off. The girls ran     |
| home for their mother, but when they returned to the field there was  |
| no sign of the object or the being. The UFO was seen again that day,  |
| flying seaward, and large footprints were found in the grass at the   |
| landing site. (Sources: Allan Hendry, International UFO Reporter,     |

| thoughts telling him that the cube was not occupied, but soon         |
| human-like beings would arrive on Earth. After conversing with the    |
| voice for an hour he was told, "soon we shall return to chat with     |

| 1986 - On this night a 70-year-old farmer named Joaquim, who lived    |
| near Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil watched a lighted object    |
| hovering about 50 paces away and approximately 15 meters above the    |
| ground for about 30 minutes. The object flashed a beam of light       |
| around the terrain, and it occasionally struck the witness as he      |
| stood in his doorway. Because of the brilliance of the light, he      |
| shielded his face with his left arm, but at one point the light       |
| struck his right eye. Joaquim said he heard voices, but couldn't      |
| understand the language. As the object glided away it hit some        |
| electric wires and broke one of them. He reportedly lost about 80% of |
| the vision in his right eye, and he had a sunburn-like burn on his    |
| left arm. (Sources: Richard Hall, MUFON UFO Journal, August 1987;     |

| 1991 - At 10:35 a.m.  in West Middlesex, Pennsylvania a man and a kid |
| observed a dull gray blimp-like object with two appendages in the     |
| sky. It was surrounded by mist, while the center of the object glowed |
| multicolors. It moved slowly at first, moved and dipped repeatedly.   |

| 1991 - On this afternoon a short green humanoid with red oval-shaped  |
| eyes and huge pointed ears was spotted on the grounds of the local    |
| elementary school in Mini Mini, Puerto Rico. It apparently tried to   |
| communicate with one of the children from the kindergarten class. It  |
| spoke to the child in a "chatter" type of language, but ran off       |
| quickly into the bushes when some other children approached. Later    |
| that afternoon, two boys were playing in the area close to the        |
| earlier encounter when they heard a noise and saw the same or similar |
| strange being emerge from the woods. They described him as short and  |
| bright green in color. He had an oval head with large almond-shaped   |
| eyes and huge pointed ears. He was thin with very long arms, and      |
| hands with only three digits on them. The being stood looking at the  |
| boys, emitting a strange "chatter" like noise. The boys threw fruit   |
| at it and then chased it, but it ran quickly and disappeared down an  |
| aqueduct. At one point the creature caused one of the boys to fall    |
| down by grabbing him by the foot. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |

| 1994 - At 11:45 p.m. prison surveillance cameras caught a two-foot    |
| wide UFO scanning the huge mesh perimeter fence of the Glenochil      |
| Prison in Alloa, Scotland. The object was a "bright white light with  |
| a big hole in the middle, like a giant polo mint" or donut. It was    |
| observed by two prison guards on the security video cameras, but was  |
| not visible to the naked eye. (Sources: UFO Newsclipping Service,     |

| 1995 - On this evening Sr. Dolores Torres had gone out in his         |
| backyard in Barranquitas, Guayama, Puerto Rico to cut down some       |
| banana plants when everything around him became illuminated by        |
| multicolored lights of blue, yellow, red, and white. He looked up and |
| saw a small transparent cylindrical object, only 14 inches long and 3 |
| inches wide, suspended in the air. It appeared to be held in place by |
| a dark cable coming down from above. At the same time he could hear a |
| loud buzzing sound. Moments later Sr. Torres saw a large dark "form"  |
| that floated or flew down towards him. He could see that it was a     |
| humanoid figure enclosed in a dark "wing-shaped" outfit hovering over |
| him. The being had a human-like face, was gray in color and had huge  |
| eyes that appeared to be closed. It wore a tight-fitting helmet or    |
| cap. The figure attempted to approach the witness, and he began       |
| swinging at it with his machete. Finally, the being and the           |
| multicolored cylinder glided away. Mr. Torres had a nervous collapse  |
| and had to be hospitalized. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |

| 2003 - Two daylight disks were seen hovering over a mountainous ridge |
| at the extreme southwestern point of the Crimean peninsula, Ukraine   |
| between 2:00 p.m. and 2:20 p.m. The disks were metallic, 10-12 meters |
| in diameter, six meters high with central domes, and smaller, smooth  |
| protruding undersides. They approached the Black Sea and were in view |
| for 20 minutes. A white-yellowish light was seen over the city of     |
| South Simferopol' that evening, changing brightness and pulsating,    |
| moving directly to the east. It appeared every other night from May   |
| 13 to May 21. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell, Filer's   |

| 2004 - A woman reported seeing several objects hovering above her     |
| townhouse in Towson, Maryland at 12:30 a.m. She also reported that a  |
| Grey humanoid came into her home, and feeling a strange giddiness at  |
| the time unlike anything else she had ever experienced. She had a     |
| missing time experience, lasting at least 35 minutes. She has         |
| requested a complete investigation by MUFON. During the encounter the |
| being made telepathic contact with her, and she experienced feelings  |
| of peacefulness, describing the entity as an "old friend". She felt   |
| that the entity seemed to express concern for her. (Source: Albert S. |

| 2004 - A UFO allegedly crashed in the early morning hours in a remote |
| jungle region close to Guri Dam in southeastern Venezuela. The        |
| hydroelectric station at Guri Dam is at the north end of the man-made |
| lake, Lago de Guri. The dam is on the Rio Caroni, 100 km south of     |
| the Orinoco River at Ciudad Bolivar. The incident was witnessed by    |
| workers at the dam and took place northwest of their location.        |
| Soldiers of Venezuela's Guardia Nacional reportedly proceeded to      |
| cordon off the area, and undertook stringent security measures        |
| further north. In Puerto Ordaz residents saw low-flying, black        |
| helicopters cross the overcast sky, heading south towards the dam.    |
| The presence of U.S. military personnel was also reported, although   |
| relations between the governments of Venezuela and the United States  |
| are not cordial. The seismology unit at the University of Caracas     |
| reported movement at the time of the crash. Access to the crash site  |
| was difficult due to the torrential rains at the site during this     |
| time of the year. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2004 Humanoid Contact   |

| 2005 - At 12:16 a.m., when the witness saw a glow coming from behind  |
| a hill near the airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico, it turned out to    |
| be a luminous triangular object, making a buzzing sound. The          |

| 2008 - At 11:43 in Coquitlam, British Columbia a witness sighted two  |
