| 1954 – On or about this date a UFO landed in Thin le Moutiers, France |
| only thirty meters away from a woman, who promptly fainted. Following |
| the incident the witness suffered from a skin condition that she      |
| linked to the encounter. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Challenge to       |

| 1954 – In Cier-de-Riviere, France Guy Puyfourcat, age 22, was coming  |
| back from the fields leading a mare by her halter when the horse      |
| surprised him by suddenly becoming restless and jumpy. Rising from    |
| the side of the road, a gray object about 1.5 meters in diameter flew |
| over them. The mare rose about three meters into the air and the      |
| witness had to release her. Then the animal fell to the ground like a |
| mass and for 10 minutes was unable to move. At last, it got up and    |
| attempted to walk, but it was still trembling and stumbling with      |
| fear. The object had long since flown away at high speed. The witness |
| himself had felt absolutely nothing. (Source: Jacques Vallee,         |

| 1954 – At 5:30 p.m. in Mazaye, France Mr. Bachelard was driving a     |
| light truck on road D52E between Chanat and Couhay when suddenly the  |
| engine seemed to slow down and he felt "paralyzed. " He then saw in a |
| field near the road a brown object about 10 m long, 2. 5 m high.      |
| Silent, it gave off no light and showed no opening. (Sources: Aime    |

| 1954 – Dr. Robert, driving through Baillolet, France at nightfall,    |
| saw four objects flying slowly in echelon formation at about 300      |
| meters altitude. One of UFOs dropped abruptly to the ground with a    |
| falling leaf motion, landing only 100 meters away. The witness felt   |
| an electric shock as the engine and headlights of his car died, and   |
| his car stopped the moment the object touched the ground. Incapable   |
| of moving, Dr. Robert watched as a figure about 1.2 meters (4 feet)   |
| tall moved around in the light of the object, then all went dark.     |
| Some time later the headlights came back on by themselves, and Dr.    |
| Robert saw the craft take off toward the north. (Sources: Aime        |

| 1954 – Messrs. Deschamp and Laclotre saw a craft, about 20 meters in   |
| diameter and two meters tall come within four meters of the ground in |
| Dompierre, France. The object stayed near the ground for 3-4 minutes. |
| It gave off a yellowish light and a glow extended around it for an    |
| estimated distance of four meters. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport  |
| to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 232).                           |

| 1954 – Two objects were seen in Quasso, Italy one of which made a pass |
| at treetop level. It was top-shaped, and a small, gesticulating human |
| figure was seen under it. The witness was a bus driver, Mr. De Rossi. |

| 1954 – At midnight several people saw a landed object in a meadow in  |
| Siena, Italy. It appeared phosphorescent and to be large in size. It  |
| took off very suddenly. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: |

| 1957 – Sao Francisco de Sales, Brazil. A famous alien abduction and   |
| sexual encounter case occurred in the early morning hours of this     |
| day. Alone in the fields on a clear night, Antonio Villas-Boas saw a  |
| big, red star which soon took on the appearance of a luminous,        |
| egg-shaped object that stopped and hovered 50 meters above his        |
| tractor. Its light was brighter than that of the tractor headlights   |
| as it landed 15 meters away. The top part of the UFO was spinning,    |
| and it became green as it slowed down. It then appeared as a          |
| flattened dome. Three legs emerged from the machine as it settled     |
| down. Sr. Villas-Boas's tractor engine stalled and he tried to run    |
| through the furrows in the freshly plowed field, but he was quickly   |
| seized by unknown individuals who dragged him aboard the craft, where |
| he was medically examined. After being stripped and sponged down with |
| what he took to be a disinfectant liquid he was then left alone with  |
| a woman of short stature with whom he had sexual intercourse.         |
| Villas-Boas reported that the woman had high cheekbones and a sharp   |
| chin. He was allowed to redress himself and spent a short time        |
| subsequently with the other crew members. He reported they wore       |
| tight-fitting, white uniforms with a light on the belt, heelless      |
| white shoes, big gloves, and opaque helmets with a slit at the level  |
| of the eyes. Their language was shrill, and he could establish no     |
| verbal communication with them. (Sources: Flying Saucer Review,       |

| 1959 - A worker was alone at a local water plant in El Cobre,         |
| Algeciras province, Spain at three a.m. when suddenly all electricity |
| and lights at the plant were shut off. He went outside to see what    |
| had caused the outage and felt a strange electrical sensation in the  |
| air. He then saw a hovering luminous object about 200 meters away     |
| that was very close to the ground. It was shaped like a half egg on   |
| top of a plate, and it emitted brilliant orange, green and purple     |
| lights. Next to the object stood two tall human-like figures wearing  |
| shiny silvery-orange outfits. One of the beings bent down under the   |
| object and appeared to look inside. All the time the witness was not  |
| able to move a muscle, holding a flashlight in his hand. Somehow he   |
| was finally able to turn the flashlight on and when he did so both    |
| beings re-entered the object, which then ascended slowly, emitting a  |
| loud buzzing sound and increasing in luminosity. Ground traces were   |
| found at the site. The witness nearly suffered a nervous breakdown    |
| afterwards. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database     |

| 1969 – On October 8, 1969, or eight days earlier, ten-year-old Steven |
| with another youngster had sighted a UFO at the base of a cloud in    |
| Waterville, Iowa and took a snap shot. The UFO apparently landed at   |
| the time, leaving traces. On the 16th at around 5 p.m., Steve watched |
| a spherical UFO, ten feet wide and 6-7 feet high, land not 60 feet    |
| away from him. His attention was caught by the humming sound it       |
| emitted as a ramp came smoothly out of the craft. A little man, 3 to  |
| 4 feet tall, with long arms and hands with only two digits, emerged   |
| with a bow-legged gait. He wore a disproportionately large            |
| yellow-brown helmet, which he took off to wipe his brow. The boy      |
| could see that he was bald and had a pale green complexion. He had    |
| large eyes set close together, a slit like mouth and a double slit    |
| where the nose would be. He was dressed in a white spacesuit. The     |
| being looked directly at Steven, then put his helmet back on and      |
| re-entered the UFO. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:    |

| 1971 - Six members of a rock band were returning from a performance   |
| and were driving in a van near St. Catharines, Ontario when they saw  |
| a large disc-shaped object with brightly lit portholes and blue beams |
| of light shining on the roadway. The group tried to turn back but the |
| van came under the control of the object and it drove directly        |
| towards it. They got to within 20 feet of the craft and the van       |
| stopped. They all felt heat at this point. They then saw a face with  |
| large black eyes staring at them through the window. The back door of |
| the van was opened and four humanoids stood there. They had large     |
| hairless heads and large black eyes. The beings communicated          |
| telepathically with the witnesses telling them they would not be      |
| hurt. Three of the witnesses were taken inside the object and tested  |
| with numerous instruments. At one point the aliens told one of the    |
| witnesses that there was not a "correct religion on earth." (Source:  |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1971, case # 298, citing |
| Lawrence J Fenwick, SBI Report # 40).                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 – At 2:00 a.m. Gabriella Versacci was driving on the motorway    |
| and had just passed the Langford Budville, England exit. The highway  |
| seemed completely deserted, but she saw the glare of a single         |
| headlight ahead of her that seemed to be stationary. As she got       |
| closer she saw that it was too bright to be a headlight. Her car      |
| suddenly began to lose power. The headlights flickered, dimmed, and   |
| then cut out. Next the engine faltered, sputtered then fell silent.   |
| Panic-stricken Mrs. Versacci pressed her face to the windscreen       |
| struggling to steer the car to a halt in the almost complete          |
| darkness. Thinking she could not stay there alone in the vehicle, she |
| climbed out the car. She fumbled with the car hood as she lifted it,  |
| and as she stood there feeling helpless she noticed a humming sound,  |
| faint at first that seemed to be growing stronger. She could not see  |
| the source of the hum. As she stood facing the car a heavy hand came  |
| down on her shoulder and pushed her to the ground. She struggled to   |
| face her assailant and saw a tall, dark-colored metallic figure.      |
| Gabriella then saw flickering multi-colored lights and blacked out.   |
| When she came to she was standing in a field. The "robot" like figure |
| was standing next to her, and before them stood a strange bright      |
| object. It was half-moon shaped, rounded on top and flat on the       |
| bottom. It was silver gray in color and rested on thick legs, of      |
| which she saw two but there might have been more. It was about 20     |
| feet in height and forty feet across, and it had large, oblong        |
| windows in the middle from which yellow lights issued.                |
|                                                                       |
| Gabriella now realized that the humming sound came from this object.  |
| She then blacked out for a second time. She awoke inside a strange    |
| room.It was circular, and she was strapped to a table in the center.  |
| She was naked but covered with a light blue blanket. Her wrists were  |
| bound to the table by what she described as "large rubber bands." Her |
| spread eagle legs were restrained in the same manner, with the bands  |
| holding her ankles to the cold surface of the table. The inside of    |
| the craft was freezing. She glanced over to a far wall where the      |
| "robot" stood inactive. To her right was a console covered in buttons |
| and dials. The floor was covered in what appeared to be black colored |
| rubber matting. A few moments later, three men that came into view    |
| proved her. Two stood to the left of the table while the third went   |
| to the foot of the table and picked up some boxes or cubes. He placed |
| three of the objects on a rail, which ran the length of the table,    |
| one by her head, one by her feet and one in the middle. As soon as    |
| the cubes were placed on the rail they began to glow.                 |
|                                                                       |
| The three men were all about the same height, five feet six inches to |
| five feet eight inches tall. Fair skinned and slim in build, they     |
| wore the same garments. All wore a skullcap, tied at the back of the  |
| head and ending just above the eyes. Facemasks covered the nose and   |
| mouth, so only the eyes and upper face were visible. No hair was      |
| visible, but she could make out the hair bumps under the caps. The    |
| eyes were more rounded than normal human eyes, and seemed             |
| emotionless. All three men wore a tunic with a gray colored edging,   |
| long gloves that went to the elbows and very long aprons that fell as |
| far as their ankles. Thick-soled boots covered their feet. Every      |
| piece of clothing was light blue in color. Throughout the episode     |
| none of the man spoke or made any other noise. They looked at each    |
| other frequently, and nodded occasionally. Furthermore they did not   |
| appear to breathe, making no respiratory noises. During the           |
| examination none of the three beings touched Gabriella. The man at    |
| the bottom of the bed took a number of gray colored instruments,      |
| which he used one by one. A small knife like implement was used to    |
| take a nail paring from her right hand index finger. A blood sample   |
| was taken with a small plastic looking bottle with tubes and wires    |
| attached. Her blanket was removed and a thin pencil-like device was   |
| used to prod and probe her and a large black rubber suction device    |
| was used on the area around the groin. Soon the examiner placed       |
| another blanket over her, which provided badly needed warmth.         |
|                                                                       |
| Noticing her frequent glances towards the now inactive "robot" the    |
| examiner now spoke to her in perfect English. The robot was a trained |
| retriever device. It did all the manual work outside the ship. It     |
| brought specimens for examination and study. It was merely a          |
| non-thinking intelligence that was programmed to do certain tasks.    |
| The examiner spoke in a deep male voice, although Gabriella could not |
| see his mouth move beneath the mask. His eyes never blinked, not even |
| once. His movements appeared practiced, deliberate and precise. When  |
| he completed his task, all three men left the room together. After    |
| several minutes Gabriella caught sight of the robot again. A flashing |
| purple colored light was coming from it. It did not move but remained |
| by the wall.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| Soon one of the men came into view from behind her and walked to the  |
| far end of the table. He lifted the end of the blanket form the       |
| bottom and stared at her body. At this point she felt something awful |
| was going to happen, and Gabriella struggled with her bonds but could |
| not free herself. The being took a small pin and placed it on her     |
| thigh. Gabriella stopped struggling immediately. The device caused    |
| numbness in every part of her body apart from her head. The being     |
| climbed slowly on the bottom of the bed and slowly and without        |
| emotion raped her. She felt discomfort but no pain. Soon the three    |
| men came into the room and released her from the table. Gabriella     |
| looked down on the floor to see her clothes before passing out one    |
| more time that night. When she next regained consciousness Gabriella  |
| was standing, fully clothed, next to her car in the deserted country  |
| road. Distraught, she drove home. (Source: Thomas E. Bullard, UFO     |

| 1973 - Seventeen and one-half hours later, at 11:30 a.m. in Burbank,  |
| California another domed disc was seen making a buzzing sound. Two    |
| children, ages 2 and 4, reported a UFO with a pointed dome and rays   |
| emanating from the bottom. It made a buzzing sound. As many as four   |
| occupants were mentioned. They invited the older boy to look in the   |
| object. When the boy's father stepped into the backyard minutes after |
| the sighting, the family dog was barking furiously. No other          |
| information. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:          |

| 1973 - Upon arriving home in Albany, Ohio in the evening a woman saw  |
| a "ghost like" figure floating about 50 feet above the ground a 1000  |
| feet away. It was about four feet tall and thin, "like a person       |
| draped in a close fitting sheet." It was seen only briefly. She then  |
| noticed a bright white object moving about, approaching to within 200 |
| feet before going away. It was about 20 feet in diameter and 25-30    |
| feet off the ground. Later, she saw a "little blue green thing" look  |
| in an open door. It was about 2.5 feet tall and had stumpy arms, and  |
| a face with "spiky things at the tops and side of the head." It       |
| quickly disappeared from sight. UFO sightings occurred about the same |
| time in nearby Athens and elsewhere. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted    |

| 1973 - Later this night a cab driver reported that he was confronted  |
| by a blue, oblong UFO that landed in front of his cab on Interstate   |
| 90 between Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi. His car stalled and its  |
| lights and radio died. He heard a tapping on the windshield and saw a |
| crab-like thing with two shiny spots for eyes. The driver reportedly  |
| later confessed to a hoax, but this has never been confirmed.         |

| 1973 - A woman was abducted from her home in Lehi, Utah as well as    |
| possibly three of her children and a neighbor boy, and given a        |
| medical examination on board a craft. Carrying a "machine" of some    |
| sort, three beings lifted the woman from a couch and carried her by   |
| the arms. Her next memory was of a big, bright room with lots of      |
| "lights and buttons" and glass tubes containing liquid. She observed  |
| four or five humanoids on the craft and at least two human like       |
| beings. The humanoids did not communicate with her, were coldly       |
| efficient, and made her feel like a guinea pig. They were 40-5 feet   |
| tall, with head coverings, no noses, long fish like mouths, orange    |
| hands (gloves?) with two or three big claws or fingers that opened    |
| "like a clasp." They had large oval eyes that wrapped around the side |
| of the head. The pupils were big, black, and round and move a lot.    |
| Their suits were a fluorescent 'silvery and blue," in contrast to the |
| three beings that took her from her home who wore shiny, bright white |
| uniforms. During the exam she was hooked up to a machine, probed with |
| needles, given a blood pressure test and a gynecological exam. The    |
| beings were able to read her mind. One of the humans was bald, about  |
