| 1953 - At 1:13 a.m. PST a B-36 was flying in the vicinity of Rosalia, |
| Washington inbound to Spokane AFB when a round white omni-directional |
| light was sighted. The light was at an altitude of approximately      |
| 7,000 feet on a southeasterly course, and began circling the B-36 and |
| rising above it as the aircraft approached it.  The light was         |
| visually observed for a period of three to five minutes. The B-36     |
| made a 180 degree turn toward the light which was estimated to be     |
| moving at a speed of 150 to 200 knots.The report contains a very      |
| accurate sighting description, showing that the object circled as the |
| B-36 approached it, and the light commenced flashing at short         |
| intervals. (Sources: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, p 133; Donald E. |

| 1963 - A 21-year-old painter name Salmaso, walking through the snowy  |
| woods outside of Padua, Italy saw a very large, round luminous UFO.   |
| Nearby stood a man wearing a garment that appeared to be made of a    |
| cellophane-like material. He took four photos before the man climbed  |
| aboard the craft and took off. (Sources: James Moseley, Saucer News,  |

| 1966 - At 5:05 a.m. Mr. & Mrs. K. R. Gulley of Nederland, Texas       |
| sighted a yellow lighted disc or tadpole-shaped object at 500 feet    |
| altitude. It cast a pulsating red glow that illuminated their lawn.   |
| Their house lights went out, and a high frequency sound disturbed the |
| ears of both witnesses.The sighting lasted from 5-10 minutes.         |

| 1966 - A domed disc-shaped object maneuvered through the sky over     |
| Obispo Trejo, Cordoba Province, Argentina for over a minute  at 2:30  |
| p.m. There were five witnesses. (Source: Roberto Enrique Banchs,      |

| 1966 - At 8:00 p.m. Vicente Ortuno and another man observed a bright  |
| luminous orange disc-shaped object, about 11 meters in diameter and   |
| with three legs, which came down making a humming sound, landed in a  |
| pasture on the "El Relajal" estate in Aluche, Madrid province, Spain  |
| and took off again shortly thereafter at high speed. It left behind   |
| three rectangular holes 15 cm x 30 cm, 6 meters apart, and a circular |
| area of burned grass at the landing site. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,   |

| 1967 - Mr. Donald Guseman and Mrs. Marie Guseman spotted a large,     |
| Saturn-shaped object at 8:45 p.m. in Odessa, Delaware. The UFO was 50 |
| feet in diameter and 20 feet in height and had two bright lights, a   |
| green light on one side and a red light on the other. It hovered      |
| motionless over some trees, then slowly moved north and suddenly      |
| vanished after two minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook   |

| 1967 - Miss R. Ford was driving between Deming and Las Cruces, New    |
| Mexico at about noon when a cigar-shaped object started pacing her    |
| car. It was green with a long row of shiny windows, and had two small |
| propellers atop each end. It hovered over the highway, while a second |
| object rose from ground and joined up with the first, and then        |
| both sped out of sight in seconds. Note: Deming contains copper       |
| mines. (Sources: NICAP case files, citing the Lubbock Aval. Journal,  |

| 1969 - At 7:30 a.m. people in Pirassununga, Sao Paolo, Brazil were    |
| excited about a mysterious disc-shaped object on a hillside. Tiago    |
| Machado, age 19, got out his binoculars and went up the hill,         |
| approaching to within 30 feet. It had a narrow dome on top, was       |
| aluminum colored, about 12 feet in diameter and 5 feet high. A hinged |
| door was open in the top of the dome, and from this two humanoid      |
| figures emerged and seemed to float to the ground. Two others were    |
| visible inside the craft, through windows. The beings, 4.5 feet tall, |
| were dressed in tight, silvery garments without buttons, covering     |
| them from head to foot. Their facial features were seen through       |
| transparent helmets. Their skin was yellow, and they had slanting     |
| eyes, and mouths with thin, slit-like lips. They came to within 3-4   |
| meters of the witness. When they laughed at the witness, who was      |
| smoking a cigarette, he could see that they had black teeth. He       |
| tossed the cigarette pack close to one, who put his hand above it,    |
| and the pack floated up into his hand. The thumb of his hand was set  |
| further back than on a human hand. The beings spoke in “hoarse,       |
| guttural” sounds. When a friend called out to the witness the         |
| entities walked backward and re-entered through the door. The second  |
| one, when halfway through, pointed a tube at Machado, which emitted a |
| bluish flame that “floated” toward him. When it hit him, he felt pain |
| and was paralyzed; as the UFO took off, almost horizontally, the      |
| witness fainted. A red welt remained where the flame had struck him.  |
| On the ground were found three landing gear leg marks. (Sources:      |

| 1969 - Barbara Mina Da Silva was weeding a rice field later that same |
| morning at a place called Chacara Do Benedito, Pirassununga, Sao      |
| Paulo State, Brazil when two boys, Joao Batista Da Silva, age 9, and  |
| Benedito Paulino Ramos, age 13, called to her attention a “shining    |
| little tent” 500 meters away. She described it as white, looking like |
| one of the triangular tents used by exterminators of the sauva ant.   |
| Nearby were three men with helmets, whom she took to be the workers   |
| fighting the ants. The boys told her that the men’s clothing was      |
| shining, but she described it as gray. She continued her work, when   |
| suddenly the boys cried out, “Look, the little tent has disappeared.” |
| She saw that both tent and men had indeed gone. Shortly afterward the |
| boys pointed out a “luminous ball the size of the sun” stationary     |
| just above the woods. It disappeared after 30 minutes, and soon after |
| a Brazilian Air Force helicopter appeared and descended about two     |
| kilometers away. The helicopter was seen on several occasions during  |
| the next few days. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:     |

| 1980 - Mr. Pavao, a 55-year old farmer from Montargil, Portugal had   |
| just left his farm and was taking his sheep to the fields at around   |
| eleven o'clock in the morning. He heard a noise and had a feeling     |
| that something was happening behind him. At the same time his dog     |
| started to panic. He turned and was surprised to see two eight-foot   |
| tall humanoids standing close to him and staring at him. The          |
| humanoids looked very strong and were dressed in gray suits. Their    |
| faces looked human except their eyes and skin appeared different.     |
| Their hands were hairy and very big. The beings approached him with   |
| friendly gestures and touched his left shoulder and several other     |
| parts of his body. At the same time they spoke in an unknown language |
| with a modulation similar to human speech. One of the beings then     |
| pointed to the sheep, and Mr. Pavao told him the type of animal it    |
| was. Meanwhile the two beings kept talking and laughing. The witness  |
| then gave an order to his dog to fetch one of the sheep. When he      |
| looked back towards the beings he saw an intense flash of light that  |
| blinded him for a few seconds. After that the beings had vanished.    |

| 1989 - On this night a woman in Perm, Russia saw a bright disc-shaped |
| object hovering over the area. The craft brightened suddenly and the  |
| witness became disoriented. She could only remember that her own dog  |
| attacked her. Later, under hypnosis, she recalled confronting two     |
| very tall figures within a light. The beings touched her on the back  |
| with a very cold metallic triangular device, which had the effect of  |
| blocking her memory of the experience. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, UFO  |

| 1996 - At around 7:30 p.m. farmer Louis Boisvert, 19, saw a very      |
| large metallic triangular craft with a set of red lights hovering     |
| over his barn in Thurso, Quebec while he was plowing snow with his    |
| tractor. This was on the same night that witnesses saw a large        |
| triangular vessel hovering over the town of Buckingham, Quebec. The   |
| craft flew very slowly over the barn. The light coming from the       |
| triangle did not illuminate the ground or even the roof of the barn.  |
| After the craft left Boisvert and his father noticed that their       |
| electric water pump was not working. Troubled by recurrent dreams,    |
| Boisvert underwent hypnotic regression. He was then able to remember  |
| that he had hopped off the tractor and ran to the barn where his      |
| father was working. As he rushed into the barn, he saw his father     |
| standing there with a blank expression on his face. Besides him stood |
| two reptilian looking creatures with long faces, scaly leathery skin, |
| black eyes, clawed hands, and gaunt arms and legs. Both Boisvert and  |
| his father were taken onboard the triangular object by the humanoids  |
| and later released. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact      |

| 1998 - A family of three living near San Francisco, California        |
| remembered hearing noises during the night and waking up thinking     |
| somebody was in the house. Later they remembered seeing lights. In    |
| the morning they all woke up with bloody noses. Their young son       |
| remembered seeing a tall, greenish colored being in his bedroom. The  |
| being was over 6 feet tall, and it communicated with him, although he |
| couldn't recall the message. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid     |
