| creature flying off over the neighborhood rooftops. It was surrounded |
| by a yellow glow. Gumersindo Neiro, her brother in law, got the best  |
| view from his own room. When he heard her screaming he looked out his |
| window and saw a little being shove off from the window sill. It      |
| "soared as if he were lighter than air, with its hands and feet       |
| pointed backwards." The creature flew eastward and out of sight among |
| the tall buildings in that part of the city. They all said he was     |
| wearing a kind of metallic suit, and the odor of "melted iron"        |
| lingered in the air. (Sources: Jim & Coral Lorenzen, UFOs over the    |

| 1974 - In Bizeneuille, Allier, France an intensely bright red dome,   |

| 1974 - At around 10:30 p.m. and continuing until 1:30 a.m. the next   |
| morning, residents of Causses, Herault department, France saw an odd  |
| red-orange light, then a luminous sphere that rose from behind a      |
| hill. A married couple with their child were driving in town when     |
| they observed the sphere. The driver signaled the UFO by blinking the |
| car headlights a couple of times, and it immediately shot toward them |
| and stopped overhead emitting a humming sound, its light illuminating |
| the terrain.After a while the object disappeared. This man and others |
| in the area later saw a large, luminous orange-red disc-shaped object |
| moving around near the ground, its light illuminating a dock, a       |
| distillery, grapevines and other terrain features. One witness noted  |
| that no light rays or beams were visible between the luminous object  |
| and the illuminated ground. Still later, nocturnal lights danced      |
| about in the sky all over the town. (Sources: Richard Hall, MUFON UFO |

| 1974 - In Sioux City, Iowa a 16-year-old youth was awakened in his    |
| basement room at 3:30 a.m. by a loud noise like a sonic boom. A few   |
| minutes later he saw a bright purple light flashing outside his       |
| basement window, lighting up the interior of his room. The            |
| neighborhood dogs were carrying on, although the usually chirruping   |
| crickets in the basement were now silent. Three minutes after the     |
| purple light was seen a bright white light the size and shape of a    |
| baseball passed in front of the window. He heard a "scratching" sound |
| on the screen door to the backyard, and the purple and white lights   |
| again came in through the window. Hearing a "tapping" nose outside,   |
| the witness got up and looked out and saw a three-foot tall figure    |
| carrying a purple light like a flashlight. He was standing between    |
| two garbage cans. The youth yelled and dashed upstairs, just as "an   |
| enormous gust of wind" hit the house. The sounds woke up two girls in |
| the house. The following morning a dark scorched mark, three feet in  |
| diameter, was found on the concrete patio. (Source: David F. Webb &   |

| 1976 - At 3:00 a.m. a 25 meter ovoid object hung in the sky low over  |
| a gully in Elephant Pass, Tasmania. A nocturnal light also hovered    |
| nearby the witness, and the witness reported feeling a tingling       |
| sensation. (Sources: Keith Basterfield, citing Tasmanian UFO          |

| oval-shaped object then hovered 50 meters above a witness named       |
| Torres; it was 10 meters in length. A luminous beam came from the     |
| object, and the witness felt a sensation of intense heat while the    |
| object oscillated smoothly in the air. He later had a sunburn as a    |
| result of his exposure to the beam. The power outage was documented   |

| the headlights of their car upon the figure it suddenly vanished.     |
| Moments later both men saw what appeared to be a group of small       |
