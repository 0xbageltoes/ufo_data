| 1909 - Mr. Lethbridge was walking along a road around 11 p.m. near    |
| the mountains in Caerphilly, Wales when he saw on the grass a large   |
| tube-shaped machine. Aboard the craft were two men wearing furs and   |
| talking excitedly in a language the witness could not understand.     |
| There was a depression in the grass at the site after the object had  |
| flown off. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of |

| 1954 - Two people witnessed the landing of a lens-shaped object, the  |
| size of a house, at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. It came to the ground     |
| near the railroad tracks, kicking up a small sandstorm in the desert. |
| One witness started to approach it, then ran away in fear. (Sources:  |

| 1959 - A truck driver in Girard, Kansas reported that at 2:00 a.m. an |
| orange disc-shaped object landed on the highway and covered both      |
| lanes. It rose up vertically after a short while and flew away. A     |
| separate witness was not identified. (Source: Loren E. Gross: The     |

| 1963 - A 15-year-old student was out camping at 10:30 p.m. near New   |
| Plymouth, New Zealand when he heard a wild animal on a nearby hill    |
| wailing. He next saw a crescent or semi-disc shaped UFO flying in the |
| sky, looking like a stingray. It changed color from red to dark blue  |
| as it changed speed and direction. (Sources: Project Blue Book files  |

| 1964 - At 7:30 a.m. a ten-year-old boy in Hubbard, Oregon saw a       |
| silver colored, square object 1.2 meters high resting on four shiny   |
| legs in a wheat field. With a soft beeping noise, it rose slowly to a |
| height of a telephone pole, then "shot up like a rocket." Ground      |
| marks were found at the site: three imprints forming a 90 cm          |
| equilateral triangle, with the wheat flattened from the center about  |
| 1.2 meters in diameter. There was also the odor of gas fumes. At 5:15 |
| p.m. in Mount Vernon, Virginia a man named Meyers watched a small     |
| glowing white oval split apart twice after moving from the right side |
| of the Moon to the left. At 10:15 p.m. an Army pilot at the Lawrence, |
| Massachusetts airport sighted a yellowish white light in the sky      |
| traveling through the sky. It made a 360 degree turn, then sped off   |
| at an estimated 1,000 mph without making a sonic boom. (Sources: (1)  |

| 1969 - At around 10:00 p.m. an extremely bright white disc-shaped UFO |
| stopped over a tractor on a farm east of Denilquin, New South Wales,  |
| Australia. It then shot up vertically into the clouds at high speed.  |
| There were nine witnesses, and the encounter lasted six minutes.      |

| 1973 - Behencourt, Somme, France. At 10:30 p.m. a 20-meter wide domed |
| disc glowed, hovered, and revolved only 30 meters above the ground,   |
| but made no noise. Animals stared dumbfounded at the object. (Source: |

| 1975 - A triangle of lights was sighted over some woods in Rainhill,  |
| Merseyside, England at around 10:00 p.m. Some huge footprints were    |
| found in the area later, along with some other ground marks. (Source: |

| 1976 - At 10:45 a.m. in St. Job-in-'T Goor, Antwerp province,         |
| Belgium, two young women, a 19-year-old and a 21-year-old, saw an     |
| aluminum colored UFO disappear behind some trees at 10:45 a.m. At     |
| 10:30 p.m. a man and his family observed a large, house-sized object  |
| hovering close to a nearby hill in Sant'Onofrio, Abruzzi, Italy. The  |
| object approached the witnesses' home and from its top section a      |
| strong yellow light was directed over the area. The UFO had a large   |
| round opening from which a red light shone. From inside the porthole  |
| a dark, shadowy, man-like figure could be seen looking out at the     |
| witnesses for a brief period. It then moved away. A second object     |
| resembling a gray sphere with a ring around it was seen hovering      |
| above an abandoned house at the same time. (Sources: (1) Rudy de      |

| 1977 - At 6:30 p.m. two 10-year-old girls, named McLennan and         |
| Morrison, heard a strange whirring sound while playing in a field     |
| near their house in New Elgin, Morayshire, Scotland. It appeared to   |
| come from a nearby woods. When they approached and saw a domed        |
| cylindrical object near the ground about 300 meters away. It had a    |
| steady red light on top of the small dome. The object was metallic in |
| color and about 30 feet long, and it had a red band encircling the    |
| lower section. The girls believed the object was hovering two feet    |
| above the ground---the same height as a fence situated between them   |
| and the object. They could not see any landing gear. To the right of  |
| the object was a very tall, thin "man," partially hidden by some      |
| bushes. He stood at least six-foot tall, and his arms were            |
| disproportionately short. He wore a silver coverall uniform. When he  |
| started to move toward them, the girls became frightened and fled.    |
| When they reached a safer distance, they turned around and saw that   |
| the man had disappeared. The object then began to ascend, moving off  |
| in three jerky "stepped up" maneuvers, and finally ascending          |
| vertically at a terrific speed. They hurried home and told their      |
| parents, who said they had heard the humming sound. The police were   |
| notified, and a circular area of scorch marks was found at the site,  |
| with minor damage over an area of about 100 yards including singed    |
| trees and underbrush. (Sources: Jenny Randles, FSR, January 1978, p.  |

| 1990 - In Kairma, near Frunze, Kirghizia (in what was then the USSR)  |
| Dima, age 10, came running home at 9:40 p.m. yelling that "space      |
| creatures" were outside. His mother looked out and saw several        |
| one-meter tall helmeted figures wearing glowing suits with stripes on |
| their sleeves and pants legs. The beings had hands with three         |
| claw-like fingers. Dima reported that when they noticed him, they     |
| pulled out a box-like device from behind and aerial appendages        |
| appeared on their heads. When a car appeared the beings jumped into a |
| nearby ditch and stayed there until the car had passed. While in the  |
| field the aliens appeared to clean their suits, and then perform what |
| appeared to be somersaults on the wet grass. A powerful vibrating     |
| sound permeated the air during the encounter. Later, during a local   |
| power outage, several witnessed a huge red disc-shaped object         |
| hovering over the area. That same night humanoids also visited the    |
| home of one of Dima's teachers. They appeared inside her house and    |
| invited her to go with them, but she refused and the aliens left.     |

| 1991 - At 11:40 p.m. just offshore of St. Osyth, Essex, England three |
| fishermen saw a saucer-shaped object on edge, hovering low over the   |
| water. The object had six windows along its rim and several man-like  |
| figures could be seen moving about inside and looking out. The UFO    |
| vanished in the sky. (Source: Timothy Good, UFO Report 1992, p. 151). |

| 1993 - On this night 31-year-old Astrid Ramos reported seeing a       |
| hovering circular object near Lisbon, Portugal from which descended   |
| several small humanoids. The humanoids then took her onboard the UFO. |
| She was paralyzed while the humanoids performed several medical tests |
| on her. They inserted a long thin tube into her nose, which caused    |
| her to feel a strong pressure inside her head. She was eventually     |
| released and soon began suffering from severe headaches. A Dr. Borja  |
| examined her and reportedly located an implant deep within her brain  |
| case. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1993,     |

| 1994 - At 8:40 p.m. a silent, yellow-colored onion-shaped UFO flew    |
| east to west over the Ouse River in York, England at the speed of a   |
| jet. It maneuvered about as it flew. (Source: UFO Newsclipping        |

| 1997 - In a hilly area known as Ponte a Mensola, east of Florence,    |
| Italy a local merchant watched a tall human-like figure descend       |
| slowly from the sky into a nearby field at 10:30 a.m. The figure was  |
| about 1.60 meters tall, and totally covered in a black, tight-fitting |
| diver's suit. He wore a red belt around his waist and a black helmet  |
| with wide dark goggles. He landed in a vertical position among the    |
| high grass. A few minutes later he rose back up into the sky          |
| vertically, and disappeared from sight. Others in the area reported   |
| seeing bright red lights flying in a zigzag pattern over the area.    |

| 1997 - At 11:10 p.m. Mr. Tosti and two other men saw several bright   |
| objects over a power plant in Bloomington, Indiana. In response to a  |
| flashlight signal, two of the objects descended. Their car engine     |
| stalled as the objects approached. The objects were small domed discs |
| with square windows and a blue glow. Through the windows some         |
| silhoetted figures with large heads could be seen. (Source: Joseph    |

| 2006 - Some men at the Greenwater Lake Provincial Park in             |
| Saskatchewan, Canada first observed a disc-shaped object hovering     |
| over the lake at around 1:00 a.m. Later they observed some            |
| camoflauged beings in the water and on the land nearby. The sighting  |
| lasted five hours. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 2006 Canadian UFO Survey,  |
