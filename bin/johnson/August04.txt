| 1947 - The pilot and co-pilot of an airliner flying over Everett,     |
| Massachusetts at 4:00 p.m. sighted a bright glowing orange            |
| cylindrical object, 15 feet long and shaped like a cigarette, flying  |
| at 150 mph. It had a glaring jet exhaust. At dusk two more pilots on  |
| a civilian cargo plane saw another UFO that looked like a fuselage    |
| without wings while flying over Bethel, Alaska. This second UFO       |
| outdistanced their airplane. (Sources: Bruce Maccabee, MUFON UFO      |

| 1950 - In the Atlantic Ocean approximately 100 miles southeast of New |
| York City (39.58 degrees N, 72.41 degrees W). At 10:00 a.m. EDT       |
| Master Nils Lewring, Chief Mate Jacob Koelwyn, and the Third Mate of  |
| the M/V Marcala sighted a ten-foot long cigar or ovoid object at      |
| 50-100 feet altitude, flying with a churning or rotary motion. The    |
| UFO was shaped like an egg cut lengthwise, and wobbled as it flew. It |
| also "sparkled in the sunlight." It accelerated away toward the end   |
| of their fifteen-second observation. (Sources: Project Blue Book      |

| 1959 - At 7:00 p.m. a white spherical object was sighted hovering     |
| over Wakwapu, Papua New Guinea by Mr. R. Smith. It had coherent light |
| beams. There were green rays of light emanating from the base of the  |
| object, one on either side at an angle of 15 degrees from the         |
| vertical, and one aimed straight up vertically. All beams receded     |
| into the UFO in a coherent fashion like retracting appendages.        |

| 1963 - Ronnie Austin and Phyllis Bruce, age 18, were driving to       |
| Phyllis Bruce's home in Wayne City, Illiniois when they had a close   |
| encounter with a humming, yellowish orange ball of light on Highway   |
| 15 at 11:30 p.m. It paced the car to the woman's house, crossing      |
| and recrossing the highway, and then hovered over a nearby barn when  |
| they parked the car.While the UFO was hovering it changed its color   |
| to a dull orange. They continued to watched the object from her house |
| with her family members for nearly an hour. When Ronnie left          |
| the object buzzed his car repeatedly. He felt a cooling effect and    |
| heard a loud whining sound on the car radio as the UFO made passes at |
| the car. His engine also missed and the speedometer was effected.     |

| 1965 - At 1:30 a.m. on Highway 15, truck driver Don Tenopir, age 44,  |
| had reached a point 25 miles from Abilene, Texas when his headlights  |
| blinked and failed, but his truck's diesel engine did not. A          |
| metallic, domed disc-shaped UFO swooped low from behind and dove      |
| towards his grain truck, then landed on the road 30 meters ahead      |
| causing a car coming from the opposite direction to leave the road in |
| order to avoid it. The object had an orange glow and was five meters  |
| in diameter, 1.5 meters high, and had a "black spot" on its dome. It  |
| took off toward the west, then turned south. The UFO made a sound     |
| like wind blowing through trees, and gave off bluish sparks.          |

| 1968 - On this evening in Cordoba, Argentina 11-year-old Graciela     |
| Lourdes Gimenez was playing outside her home when she experienced a   |
| bizarre event. "I wanted to go back indoors and watch TV," she told   |
| reporters from the newspaper Cordoba, "and then just as I was about   |
| to turn around...a white cloud, like mist, appeared on the front      |
| path. It gradually came towards where I was, and then I could no      |
| longer see the other houses, and I couldn't move or call out to       |
| Mummy...and after that...I don't know anything more...until I found   |
| myself on a square where there were lots of people and lots of little |
| boys..." She knocked at a nearby house, and the residents turned her  |
| over to the police. She had somehow traveled from her Cordoba suburb  |
| to the Plaza Espana in the heart of the city. After the incident, the |
| child suffered fits of weeping and cold chills. (Source: John A Keel, |

| 1973 - A week to ten days after observing a mysterious light          |
| maneuvering in the sky, the witness had to return to Phoenix and she  |
| asked her brother to go along with her for company. At around ten     |
| o'clock on this night, while driving up a hill somewhere in the       |
| vicinity of Indio, California she began to receive pictures in her    |
| mind and had a sense of presence. These "images" came in grays and    |
| browns, and she tried to counter them by thinking of bright colors.   |
| She found the gray images unpleasant, and had the sense of an         |
| interior, with gray green walls, which had three vague "forms" in it. |
| Believing she was daydreaming and tired, she forced her concentration |
| back to her driving when she noticed colors reflecting on the         |
| dashboard and asked her brother if there was something in the sky.    |
| Both of them briefly observed a light over the highway changing       |
| colors from blue, to green, to red, to yellow, and then to a          |
| brilliant white. Then it vanished. It was in view for less than a     |
| minute.                                                               |

| Her brother was very excited. The trip continued and seemed to be     |
| uneventful. However, later under hypnotic regression she was asked to |
| examine her image of a gray interior more closely. She described the  |
| gray-green walls, with at least one black line, or slot, on the back  |
| wall. She was with three vague shapes or shadows. It didn't feel like |
| a pleasant place, and she felt she had had another such experience at |
| another time. She was asked to go back to that experience and she     |
| found herself in another room with a window looking out on an orange  |
| sky. There was a white bench in the room, and the room seemed very    |
| sterile. Then she found herself in a huge place with a domed ceiling, |
| and she was standing beside a 20 foot high crystal, set at an angle   |
| so that it pointed towards the sky. It was green on the bottom half   |
| and it revolved. There were other similar crystals in this place,     |
| about five in all, and they were hooked up to a large piece of        |
| machinery that was similar to a generator. The crystal was connected  |
| to the machine by a rod. The whole room hummed. There were two other  |
| people with her; one dressed in gray, looking older with grayish      |
| hair. The younger man, wearing black, is taller. They pointed out a   |
| formula to her, which was on the wall. It was composed of script      |
| letters. She was brought out of the trance and given a post hypnotic  |
| suggestion that she will recall the formula and be able to reproduce  |
| it on a piece of drawing paper, which she does. (Source: David F.     |

| reflection of the object's brilliance in his rear view mirror. Both   |

| “extraterrestrial beings", about 1.20 or 1.30 meters high, on this    |
| evening. They had green eyes and noses and wore silvery clothing.     |
| They said nothing, but shone a light on the boy as they stood next to |
| a motorcycle. He watched them for five minutes, and then went to get  |
| other local residents who, upon returning to the spot, saw nothing    |

| the residents pointed a gun in the direction indicated by the boy,    |

| 1979 - At 10:35 p.m. a 60-year-old woman and her grandson watched a   |
| glowing object approach their location in Canoga Park, California     |
| from the west. It then hovered silently above a nearby apartment      |
| building. They described it as a domed metallic saucer with a         |

| 1980 - At 4:50 in the afternoon Edith Sage was walking down an alley  |
| on her way to some nearby shops in Medway, Kent, England when she saw |
| a ring of smoke and sparks coming from a spot nearby, and an unusual  |
| craft suddenly materialized. It resembled a small helicopter without  |
| any rotor blades, doors or engines. There was a large transparent     |
| dome at the front of the object, and it had green and tan camouflage  |
| markings on the side. She could see two men seated inside, who were   |
| of normal height and wore gray jumpsuits. They looked very much alike |
| except one had long blond hair and the other had dark hair, and both  |
| had olive skinned complexions. All sounds area suddenly ceased and    |
| there was also a sweet odor in the vicinity. The men apparently       |
| communicated with her via mental telepathy, but we don't know the     |
| content of their communication. The craft then suddenly disappeared   |
| in plain sight. (Sources: Jenny Randles, MUFON UFO Journal, issue #   |

| 1991 - A couple in Flint, Michigan were stargazing in their backyard  |
| at 1:30 a.m. when a white ball of light came overhead. The man shot a |
| flashlight beam at it, and it made a "sideways loop" before           |
| continuing on. (Source: Shirley Coyne, MUFON case files, case #       |

| 2001 - At 12:40 a.m. a large, circular object was seen in the sky     |
| surrounded by a number of small fragmentary objects, the size of 10p  |
| pieces over Ricksmanworth, Hertford, England. The large object was    |
| white and had a glow of red and blue, and was described as very       |
| bright. At the same time in Port Talbot, Wales two large shining      |
| white golf ball like objects were seen moving in and out of the       |
| clouds. An hour later another strange formation of lights flew        |
| overhead in Bushey, Hertford. At 2:30 a.m. over Glasgow, Scotland a   |
| small white light was seen moving toward and away from a larger white |
| object. (Sources: British Ministry of Defense 2001 reports, cases     |

| 2001 - At the local "Hospital del Torax" in La Paz, Bolivia nurse     |
| Wilma Huanapaco was working the night shift in the intensive therapy  |
| wing on the first floor when she was suddenly seized by a strange     |
| stupor that paralyzed her body. She was unable to move her arms,      |
| legs, or even her eyelids. Using tremendous effort, she finally was   |
| able to turn around and was confronted by the figure of a tall man,   |
| who was enveloped in a green aura and apparently headless. The figure |
| suddenly vanished in plain sight. Wilma remained in the stupor for    |
| several more minutes. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |

| 2007 - There were three more reports from England on this date. At    |
| 3:00 p.m. two white circular objects were sighted over Dorking,       |
| Surrey, moving at high altitude and speed. At 10:45 p.m. two strange  |
| objects were sighted over Sheffield, West York followed by three      |
| others. They were all bright and fiery colored, spinning and moving   |
| very fast across the sky. Finally, at 11:15 p.m. a circular light was |
| seen zig-zagging across the sky over Worthing, West Sussex.           |
