| 1950 - A 30-foot wide cone-shaped object flew in over the shoreline   |
| at Alameda Naval Yard in California. There were six military          |
| witnesses in total, and the sighting lasted several minutes. One      |
| witness reported it as possibly a plane with engine trouble. (Source: |
| newspaper clipping dated February 9, 1950).                           |

| 1953 - An orange light was seen in the sky over Korea and an F-94     |
| fighter jet was scrambled to intercept it. The F-94 pilot saw the     |
| bright object change speeds and altitude, then pull away from him.    |
| The UFO's presence was confirmed on radar. (Sources: Richard Dolan,   |

| 1963 - At 11:45 p.m. three people in two separate airplanes sighted a |
| disc-shaped object over a missile site near Charlottesville,          |
| Virginia. It shot off at a speed in excess of 2000 knots. (Sources:   |

| 1967 - At 11:55 p.m. two married women in Oakhurst, California        |
| watched as a solid round object sprayed out many contrails and        |
| disintegrated in the sky. Next, a silver cigar-shaped object hovered  |
| vertically, then flew away rapidly to the southwest. (Source: NICAP   |
| case files).                                                          |

| 1969 - Shortly after 7:00 a.m. in Pirassununga, Sao Paulo State,      |
| Brazil the shouts of people exclaiming about a mysterious             |
| bluish-white object that had landed on a hillside awakened Tiago      |
| Machado, age 19. He grabbed his binoculars and went to look at it,    |
| approaching to within 30 feet. It was a domed disc, aluminum colored, |
| about 12 feet in diameter and five feet high. A hinged door was open  |
| on the top of the dome and from it two humanoid figures emerged and   |
| floated to the ground. Two more beings were visible through windows   |
| inside the craft. The beings were 4.5 feet tall and dressed in        |
| tight-fitting silvery coveralls without buttons. Their facial         |
| features were visible through transparent helmets. Their skin was     |
| yellow, their eyes slanting, and their mouths were thin and           |
| slit-like. They came to within 3-4 meters of Tiago. When they laughed |
| at him while he puffed a cigarette, he could see that they had black  |
| teeth. He tossed the cigarette pack close to one, who put his hand    |
| over it and the pack floated up into his hand. The thumb of his hand  |
| was set further back than it would be on a human's hand. The beings   |
| spoke in “hoarse, guttural” sounds. When a friend shouted out to      |
| Tiago the entities walked backward and re-entered the craft through   |
| the door. The second one pointed a tube at Machado when halfway       |
| through, and it emitted a bluish flame that “floated” at him. When it |
| hit him he felt pain and was paralyzed. The UFO took off in a         |
| horizontal direction just as the witness fainted. A red welt remained |
| where the flame had struck him. On the ground were found three        |
| landing-leg marks. (Sources: Irene Granchi, APRO Bulletin,            |

| 1970 - In New Martinsville, West Virginia an oval-shaped silver disc  |
| with lights around the rim turned, hovered silently over a house,     |
| then vanished as USAF jets drew near. The lights on the object        |
| rotated counterclockwise. Their were six witnesses from the Moore     |
| family. (Source: Bob Teets, West Virginia UFOs: Close Encounters in   |

| 1972 - A triangular object was tracked on radar and sighted by        |
| several observers on the ground at Sarajevo Airport, Yugoslavia at    |
| 7:30 p.m. as it increased speed, and then disappeared. (Source: Milos |

| 1976 - A man and a woman reported they had five hours of missing time |
| that occurred near a wharf on Talbot Island, in Duval County, Florida |
| at 10 p.m. Under hypnosis they revealed an abduction experience,      |
| including a table exam onboard a craft, with a screen image of the    |
| inside of the woman's body. There were seven different humanoid       |
| types, a body implant, and communication to the woman that she was    |
| "coming along real well." (Source: CUFOS files, letter from           |

| 1977 - At 12:30 p.m. school students from a school in                 |
| Newcastle-under-Lyme, England saw a gray flattened cigar-shaped       |
| object moving slowly through the sky, surrounded by a vapor or mist.  |
| It changed color to orange, then to green, and flew off toward the    |
| east-southeast. The sighting lasted 10 minutes. (Sources: Northern    |
| Network files, case report dated March 1, 1977; Awareness, July 1977, |

| 1978 - The International UFO Reporter reported that a 23-year old     |
| police officer named Linnevold was fired from his job for chasing a   |
| UFO during a sighting that occurred on this night shortly after 1:00  |
| a.m. in Calmar, Iowa. (Source: International UFO Reporter, July 1978, |

| 1984 - The witness awoke to a loud humming at four o'clock in the     |
| morning in Atco, New Jersey and a bright light illuminated the        |
| bedroom. Outside a bright white 10-foot wide circular UFO with a hump |
| in the middle--a domed disc--was hovering over a neighbor' s yard,    |
| 200 feet away. It ascended in a zigzag at a high rate of speed. A     |
| lawn ornament figure was reported missing. (Source: Robert Gribble,   |

| 1987 - On this night three motorists in Potters Mills, Pennsylvania   |
| and the Seven Mountains area encountered a large 300 foot long        |
| hovering oval object. It had lights around its perimeter, and the     |
| mountainside terrain was brightly illuminated by its presence.        |

| 1989 - At 10:30 p.m. several witnesses were driving together along an |
| isolated section of Route 4 in Sassovivo, Italy when they started to  |
| see intermittent circular flashes of light ahead of them. As they got |
| closer they saw five circular objects on the ground alongside the     |
| road. The vehicle's engine stalled as five humanoids, about 90 cm     |
| tall, emerged from the crafts and surrounded the vehicle. The         |
| humanoids wore white, astronaut like suits, and had black hair and    |
| large staring eyes. They moved rapidly around the vehicle, completely |
| ignoring the witnesses. For some time their vehicle was prevented     |
| from moving. After awhile the humanoids went back into their circular |
| objects and then these craft disappeared from sight. The source       |
| indicated that the driver died soon after the encounter, but provided |
| no information as to the cause of death. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,  |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1989, citing CUN).                          |

| 1989 - A 17-year-old girl observed a small sphere with red and blue   |
| lights hovering only 3 meters over her backyard in New Haven,         |
| Connecticut. It was 60 feet away, and reportedly caused her a         |
| temporary tingling sensation. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer       |

| 1990 - Jaroslav Novotny was on his way to his parent's home in the    |
| evening when he saw a large orange, spherical object that descended   |
| with a falling leaf motion close to the ground in a garden in         |
| Ostrozke Nove Uesi, Czechoslovakia. It emitted three bright           |
| oval-shaped beams of light from an extended antenna that illuminated  |
| the surroundings quite clearly. A large figure with an oval-shaped    |
| head was seen in a window in the object. It had almost human facial   |
| features, but it had large yellow eyes and what appeared to be a      |
| large mouth.  As the craft left it appeared to create an air          |
| turbulence that caused trees in the garden to bend over. (Sources:    |

| 1995 - Nocturnal lights, alone and in a triangular formation, were    |
| sighted near the Bangor Nuclear Submarine Base from U.S. Highway 101  |

| 1996 - At 9:30 p.m a nocturnal light flew over Sydney, New South      |
| Wales, Australia and was observed from Turramurra. It stopped in      |
| midair, next made several zigzag maneuvers, followed by 70 degree     |
| turns, and shot off to the south. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer    |

| 1997 - Two children in Westbury, Tasmania, Australia reported that    |
| they had witnessed a cigar-shaped object at 9:00 a.m. It flew to the  |
| west slowly, turned vertical, and went up-and-down rapidly. They then |
| lost sight of it while it was making a descent. Their sighting lasted |
| a couple of minutes. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case  |
| # 17869).                                                             |

| 2008 - At 12:10 a.m. a white orb made sharp turns in the sky at high  |
| speed over the local paper mill in Iroquois Falls, Ontario, Canada    |
