| 1903 - A priest named Ivanku Petrovszky saw a glistening ball of      |
| light illuminate the countryside in Szuhabaranka, Hungary. The object |
| landed and shadowy figures returned to it. A man who had gone to a    |
| well at the same time was never seen again. The case of his           |
| disappearance was closed ten years later but still unsolved. (Source: |

| 1944 - A red ball of light climbed to the altitude of a Beaufighter   |
| from the 415TH NFS squadron while it was flying over Karisruhe,       |
| Germany on this night. The two man crew, Baker and McFalls, watched   |
| the light pace their aircraft for awhile and then climb away from     |
| them. (Sources: Kenneth Arnold and Ray Palmer, The Coming of the      |

| 1953 - Ten silverly oval-shaped objects were sighted flying           |
| horizontally over El Cajon, California at 8:04 a.m. Two Navy F-9F     |
| Panther jets attempted to catch up with them but failed. The UFOs     |
| were flying at 50,000' altitude at a speed in excess of 400 knots.    |

| 1960 - A domed disc, estimated to be 20 feet in diameter, was seen    |
| near a mountain top in Durango, Colorado at midnight. It had a ring   |
| of lights around its rim. It pulsated and was in view for 15 minutes. |
| A dog panicked in an agitated reaction, and later died. (Source:      |

| 1963 - At 7:25 p.m. in Rowarth, Cheshire, England a farmer named      |
| Chandler had his car battery die while a UFO flew by. His cows also   |
| became ill. (Sources: Orbit, April 23, 1963; Mark Rodeghier, UFO      |

| 1965 - At 6:36 p.m. a yellow colored flying object with three bright  |
| spotlights was sighted by 13 young women working at a factory as it   |
| flew from the northwest to the west over Gifu prefecture, Japan. It   |
| kept changing its speed and apparent size as it flew. Fourteen        |
| minutes later a disc shaped object with a flat bottom and two         |
| spotlights flew toward the northeast on a horizontal trajectory. It   |
| was seen for four minutes. (Source: Y. J. Matsumura, Flying Saucers,  |

| 1967 - On this evening a couple driving near Tucson, Arizona saw a    |
| blob of red light. The engine and headlights of their car then quit.  |
| The light came near the car, passed overhead, and moved away to the   |
| south. The engine and lights both came back on as it departed. Two    |
| minutes before this sighting, both witnesses had seen a star-like     |
| object fall to earth. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving  |
| Vehicle Interference, case 230, citing CUFOS).                        |

| 1970 - Two independent sets of photographs showing luminous balls of  |
| light in motion were taken on this night in Alamogordo, New Mexico.   |
| Three teenagers--Larsh, Neal, and Sellars--took a photograph of two   |
| lights in parallel motion at 10:00 p.m. They had had sightings of     |
| similar phenomena earlier in the week and were prepared to take a     |
| time exposure on this night. They made their photograph using a       |
| Pentax camera on a tripod. The two lights were also seen by another   |
| resident, Hjalmar Bowlby, earlier that same evening. Remarkably, they |
| weren't the only ones who were able to catch an image of a UFO using  |
| a camera that night. At 10:35 p.m. Jerry Mozer, also of Alamogordo,   |
| New Mexico took a photo of a luminous point in motion, making an      |
| abrupt change of course resulting in a "buttonhook" effect on the     |
| image. Both photographs are reproduced below. (Sources: Alamogordo    |

| 1972 - The Romanian ship Maldoveanu while in the Atlantic Ocean off   |
| Cape Chidley, Labrador, Canada sighted a UFO at 3:00 a.m. The object  |
| continually changed shape and color, from round to oval, and from red |
| to yellow to a bluish white. (Source: Ion Hobana and Julien           |

| 1975 - A huge disc covered the entire N19 highway in Bar-sur-Aube,    |
| France. It vanished at 8:10 p.m. when a car approached. (Source:      |
| Lumieres dans la Nuit, May 1976).                                     |

| 1975 - At 10:00 p.m. power circuit breakers were tripped four times   |
| when a glowing ball of light came down near the ground in             |
| Ploubazlanec, Cotes-du-Nord, France. A 0.2 meter area of burnt grass  |
| was found at the site were it apparently touched down. (Source:       |

| 1989 - At 5:50 p.m. a man in Sambreville, Belgium took a ten minute   |
| video of a round white shape in the sky. It could be seen moving and  |
| rotating slowly. An hour later, at 6:50 p.m., a woman made another    |
| videotape, this time of a luminous globe in the sky over Nimy,        |
| Belgium. The videotape shows a white ball with a black ring around it |
| and plasma. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 303; Timothy Good, |

| 1989 - At 11:00 p.m. a Russian L29 Trainer flying between Chelyabinsk |
| and Korkino, Russia sighted a yellowish white cigar-shaped object     |
| flying at 8000 meters altitude. It vanished when the pilot attempted  |
| to approach. (Sources: Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1992, p. 61;      |

| 1992 - Twenty civilian witnesses and police southwest of Monroe,      |
| Louisiana watched a silent, boomerang shaped UFO with bright beams of |
| light pass over cars in a forested area at 6:00 p.m. and bounce up    |
| and down for six minutes. The object was videotapted by one of the    |
| witnesses, a 39-year-old man. (Source: W. L. Garner, Jr., MUFON UFO   |
