| 1948 - At 4:50 p.m. two Kirtland Air Force Base Sergeants on a        |
| fishing trip with their families to San Acacia Dam, New Mexico saw a  |
| group of seven aluminum circular, possibly spherical, objects         |
| approach from the south at 20,000 feet and pass overhead at 1,500     |
| mph. They shifted from a V formation to an L formation, and then to a |
| circular formation and finally to no regular formation, at which      |
| point a regular pulsating flashing light appeared amidst the group at |
| 30° from zenith to the north. At this oblique angle the objects no    |
| longer appeared circular. They made no noise nor did they leave a     |
| trail. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official          |

| 1952 - At 11:00 a.m. an elliptical object was sighted from Lockbourne |
| AFB, Ohio with a pinpoint of flame at the rear that would             |
| occasionally flare. The object had a resonant beat as it moved        |

| 1952 - At 3:10 p.m. a woman saw two large flying discs over White     |
| Plains, New York flying on their edge and making a whirring sound.    |
| They were in sight for 5-6 seconds. A Project Blue Book               |

| 1952 - In the evening a Master Sergeant near Rapid City, South Dakota |
| saw 12-14 glowing orange objects in the sky. They flew straight and   |
| level, and seemed to be going faster than jet aircraft. A Project     |
| Blue Book "unidentified" case. (Source: Project Blue Book files       |

| 1955 - Shortly before noon in Bexleyheath, England and while driving  |
| a country road with two passengers, Mr. Fry noticed a dark shadow     |
| hanging over the road. His car began to slow down, and stop and start |
| intermittently. Above was an gray oval-shaped disc 100 to 150 feet in |
| diameter. It was spinning and making a swishing or humming noise. The |
| UFO flipped over and rose up into the sky. (Source: FSR, November     |

| 1955 - At dusk a man in Meopham, Kent County, England had taken his   |
| dog out for a walk through some local fields when he suddenly felt    |
| that he was being watched. Also, his dog was acting peculiar and the  |
| hairs on his dog's back were standing straight up. He looked up and   |
| saw a very large, hovering cigar-shaped object with large rounded     |
| windows, almost directly overhead. The windows were brightly lit and  |
| inside he could see several humanoid figures who appeared to be       |
| observing him. The object followed him without making any noise, as   |
| he ran with his dog across the fields and to his home. The witness    |
| hid inside his house, and he last saw the object hovering over some   |
| nearby buildings. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, case # 838, citing Mrs  |

| 1962 - On this day X-15 pilot and future astronaut White was flying   |
| at 58 miles above the Earth from his desert takeoff point in          |
| California when he saw and took movie film of a grayish-white UFO. It |
| paced the X-15 for five seconds, and then darted above and behind the |
| plane. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, September 1962, p. 8).        |

| 1965 - On this night in Samarai, Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea a red    |
| glowing cylinder moved about in the sky, from left to right. During   |
| its oscillating behavior it emitted a sound like a diesel engine.     |

| 1965 - Colonia, Uruguay. A blindingly bright object, smaller than an  |
| airplane and having metallic legs, was seen on the bank of the Rio de |
| la Plata River by two workers and four young men. White smoke emerged |
| from the craft, which remained on the sand for two minutes, leaving   |
| X-shaped ground marks. It flew up to about 10 meters altitude,        |
| stopped, then went away. The craft showed a round central section     |
| with two oval ends and looked somewhat similar to an egg. (Sources:   |

| 1966 - Rebouillon, France. Rene Pebre and two others were driving     |
| back from Draguignan at 3:45 a.m. when they saw a gray oval-shaped    |
| metallic object, about five meters long, hovering at a low altitude   |
| about 300 meters away from them. It emitted a beam of light. They     |
| also noticed that there were several window-like openings on the      |
| craft. All the dogs in the vicinity were barking. (Source: Jacques    |

| 1967 - While driving home at 1:00 a.m. in Newville, Pennsylvania Mr.  |
| Stanley L. noticed a light that he first thought was the moon, but it |
| moved towards him and dropped into a position directly in front of    |
| his car. It paced him, keeping a distance of 15 to 20 yards, while he |
| drove along at 55 mph. It was a rounded object, 10-15 in diameter,    |
| and was glowing brightly with an orange light. Stanley thought he     |
| could see the shadowy silhouette of a man inside the object working   |
| controls. When he slowed down the UFO rose above the telephone wires  |
| but continued to pace him the rest of the way home. At home he called |
| out his sister Joanne, and her boyfriend Carl, and all three of them  |
| saw the object hovering over a field. When he drove away it followed  |
| his car again, and returned with him to the house where they could    |
| now make out the form of the occupant inside the object. The object   |
| made no sound. While they went inside the house the UFO disappeared.  |
| This encounter occurred during a continuing wave of UFO sighting      |
| reports in south central Pennsylvania. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted   |

| 1967 - At 3:15 in the afternoon in Arc-sous-Cicon, Doubs department,  |
| France four children saw three dark humanoids with protruding         |
| stomachs who spoke an unintelligible language that sounded like       |
| musical tones. They were dressed in black suits. Broken vegetation, a |
| circle of burnt grass four meters in diameter, and three small        |
| footprints were found at the site. Several hours later there were     |
| widespread reports of fireballs seen by hundreds of people throughout |
| Europe. Some believed these sightings were the result of a satellite  |
| re-entry or possibly a spectacular meteor. According to investigator  |
| Eric Zurcher, "We now know that the beings in question were already   |
| in the area three days earlier, since they were seen on the 14th and  |
| 15th by an agricultural worker." (Sources: France Soir, July 20,      |

| 1967 - Mr. E. Browne of Belfast, Northern Ireland was walking in the  |
| woods near his home on this evening when he came upon a "dish-like"   |
| object hovering eight feet above the ground. It was a dull blue-gray  |
| color with a rough and pitted outer surface, and about the size of a  |
| car. An opening appeared in the center of the underside and two       |
| silver suited, human-like figures dropped slowly to the ground and    |
| then walked away into the woods. Several minutes later they came back |
| and drifted back into the craft, which rose silently into the air and |
| vanished from sight. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:  |

| 1967 - At 11:25 p.m. Mrs. Emma Funk was driving down Route 22 north   |
| of Millertown, New York when a shiny black object about the size of a |
| baseball flew into the car's headlights. It came right up to her car, |
| seemed to brush against the windscreen, then veered off to the left.  |
| When it made contact the car lit up "like a giant electric light      |
| bulb." The engine and headlights failed and she lost consciousness.   |
| When she recovered the car was pointing in the opposite direction and |
| there was a cracked area the size of a man's fist in the windshield.  |
| In September she underwent hypnotic regression in which she spoke of  |
| the radio being filled with static and unspecified beings, which      |
| turned the car around and struck her across the chest with a rod.     |

| 1968 - Near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil at around eleven p.m. a civil      |
| servant named Pedro Dema Filho heard a loud humming noise and was     |
| blinded by a powerful beam of light accompanied by two green lamps.   |
| These vanished, and from a door in a UFO emerged four short greenish  |
| entities not much over 20 inches tall, wearing something like         |
| headphones. They quickly approached and paralyzed him, and he was     |
| unable to run away. They next seized him and dragged him into their   |
| craft, the interior of which “looked like a laboratory”. There they   |
| questioned him, apparently using telepathy, at length about human     |
| customs. They didn't seem to have mouths. After that, they undressed  |
| him and conducted a detailed physical examination. They put a         |
| luminous wire device into his mouth that made his body appear         |
| transparent. During this procedure his limbs felt cold, his head felt |
| like it was spinning, and his tongue felt like it had “turned to      |
| stone.” They finally released him, and he watched the craft fly off   |
| leaving a luminous trail. He felt no subsequent ill effects.          |

| 1969 - At 10:50 a.m. in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia a poor quality    |
| photograph of a gray domed disc was taken. The object was estimated   |
| to be 20 feet in diameter. It moved through the sky from the          |
| southwest to the northeast at moderate speed, flying at an estimated  |
| 2000 feet altitude. (Source: Joseph Erhardt, UFO Chronolog, June      |

| 1973 - In the Ramapo Mountains northwest of Oakland, New Jersey at    |
| 11:23 p.m. a UFO hovered, then zigzagged slowly about for ten minutes |
| before disappearing into the clouds. There were six calls to the      |
| police reporting the object. A balloon-shaped object was sighted in   |
| Pompton Lakes, New Jersey at about the same time as sightings over    |

| 1973 - At 10:00 p.m. on this night three witnesses in the northern    |
| Mojave Desert, California observed the descent of a torpedo-shaped    |
| UFO over an isolated area, close to a ranch owned by one of them. As  |
| the UFO hovered near the ground, three "animate objects" dropped from |
| it to the ground and "ambled" off in different directions. One        |
| witness described two glowing reddish lights in what would be the     |
| approximate placement of eyes in their heads. The next day tracks     |
| similar to those attributed to Bigfoot were made in the area.         |

| 1974 - Mrs. Jackie Booth of Avon Lake, Ohio--mother of three--had had |
| several UFO sightings earlier in this year in March and April, and at |
| the end of June a strange and totally unexplained condition affected  |
| her eyes when light emanated from them for a two hour period. In      |
| early July ground marks that could have come from a landed UFO were   |
| found on her lawn. On this night she awoke and went to the front door |
| where she found two strange figures standing. They were about five    |
| feet tall and had large heads that were flat on top, glowing eyes set |
| wide apart, slit-like mouths, and grayish-colored skin. Their arms    |
| were long, but she could not recall any details below the waist. They |
| entered the house and appeared interested in Mrs. Booth's electric    |
| organ. She tried to talk to them, but they communicated with her      |
| telepathically, and she could "feel my thoughts leave my head." They  |
| wanted her to play the organ, so she sat down and played scales, and  |
| when she looked up they had vanished. She went back to bed and tried  |
| to convince herself it had been a dream. Later, under hypnosis, she   |
| recalled additional details. None of her family had awakened during   |
| the incident. Other strange incidents subsequently occurred. (Source: |

| 1977 - At five o'clock in the morning a glowing sphere landed on the  |
| Nova Melia Ranch near Barra do Corda, Maranhao State, Brazil only 200 |
| meters from the ranch owner. After the brightness abated, the ranch   |
| owner, Joao Batista Souza, could see that the object was a domed      |
| disc-shaped craft, resembling a straw hat. The man hid behind a mound |
| and watched as a door in the craft opened, and a short being about    |
| one meter in height got out. The hairy humanoid was carrying some     |
| sort of torch emitting a red light in his left hand, and some other   |
| type of "tool" in his right hand. The being's face could not be seen  |
| because it was wearing a full helmet with "antennae," but the rest of |
| its body was completely covered in hair. At this point the rancher    |
| apparently lost consciousness, because members of his family later    |
| found him lying where he had hid and carried him into the ranch       |
| house, where he remained in bed for several days, too weak to get up. |

| steel". It made not sound and vanished mysteriously. That evening a   |
| woman in Langruth, Manitoba saw a disc-shaped object moving slowly    |
| and quietly through her farmyard. The disc was about 3-4 meters in    |

| at 50 feet altitude emitting four light beams, that were directed     |
| onto the street below. It made no sound. There were two witnesses and |
| the close encounter lasted an hour. (Sources: Peter Davenport,        |
