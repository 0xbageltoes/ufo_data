| 1950 - Flying over the Gulf of Mexico northwest of Cuba, a USAF B-29  |
| picked up three unidentified radar blips. The bogeys hovered for      |
| awhile, and then orbited the B-29 at 3,000 mph. The bomber's airborne |
| radar jammed for an additional ten minutes after the sighting.        |

| 1951 - At 10:05 p.m. two U.S. Air Force airmen at Stewart AFB in      |
| Orange County, New York saw a fireball drop from a high altitude, and |
| then zig-zag. It made clear cut maneuvers, and changed colors. At     |
| 11:01 p.m. a saucer-shaped object hovered near Fort Benning, Georgia  |
| for 20 minutes, then shot off to the south. U.S. Army 2nd Lt. A. C.   |
| Hale saw a light with a fan-shaped wake remain motionless like a star |
| then speed away. It was estimated to be the size of a matchhead held  |
| at arms length. There were nine other witnesses. A Project Blue Book  |
| unknown. (Sources: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. 1951 (volume 2),  |

| 1953 - In Santana dos Montes, Minas Gerais, Brazil Sr. M. Ramos Bessa |
| had a close encounter with a small domed disc-shaped UFO that landed  |
| in a field at 1:00 p.m. Two humanoids wearing "brilliant lead"        |

| sample.Physiological effect: severe headache. (Source: Peter          |

| 1965 - At one o'clock in the morning Mr. Don Flickinger, a U.S.       |
| Border Patrol officer, had his patrol car buzzed by a bright round    |
| flying object in Lynden, Washington not far from the Canadian border. |
| The UFO hovered, then acelerated away with the sound of rushing air.  |
| The object had been tracked on radar. That same night, a round,       |
| glowing 30 foot wide object with a dome on top landed on a nearby     |
| farm in Custer, Washington melting the snow in a 12 foot diameter     |
| circle. The object illuminated the yard, trees, and the side of the   |
| farmhouse. The circle was melted in snow 16 inches deep, and the      |
| ground beneath was also scorched. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator,   |

| 1968 - On this night while driving on a highway in Carlisle,          |
| Pennsylvania two female witnesses, Ms. Lehman and Ms. Little, saw a   |
| large round white object, at times reddish, that emitted smaller      |
| objects that maneuvered around independently. (Source: NICAP UFO      |

| 1969 - At eight o'clock in the morning two local UFO investigators    |
| had driven to an isolated area of Mount Misery on Long Island, New    |
| York in order to photograph the landscape. Walking on foot near a     |
| wooded hill, they caught sight of a tall human like figure that       |
| appeared to have a disfigured face and long wild black hair. He also  |
| wore a long black garment. Upon seeing the UFO investigators the      |
| being retreated silently into the woods. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,  |

| 1975 - At 2:30 a.m. ten 3.5-foot-tall humanoids gathered soil samples |
| for three minutes in Hudson Park in North Bergen, New Jersey only 100 |
| feet from the street. They wore coveralls with helmets and got back   |
| into a domed disc-shaped craft. The disc made a humming sound when it |
| took off, and CB radio interference was noted. Ground marks.          |

| 1979 - On this night in the farming community of Sorocaba, Sao Paolo  |
| State, Brazil three newspaper reporters watched a large luminous      |
| disc-shaped object descend and hover near the ground, while hundreds  |
| of other witnesses watched several luminous discs maneuver over the   |
| nearby village. Two small beings, about four and a half foot tall,    |
| emerged from the object. The beings were human in appearance and were |
| wearing one-piece outfits with fishbowl type helmets over their       |
| heads. The helmets emitted bright beacons of light. Suddenly          |
| everything became very dark and moments later the disc ascended and   |
| disappeared behind some nearby hills. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1980 - On this night in the town of Huayana, in the Potosi Valley,    |
| Bolivia a man saw a lenticular-shaped object over him. The UFO        |
| projected a beam of light and formed a dome shaped luminous form on   |
| the ground, not far from the witness. He then experienced strange     |
| sensations when he walked inside the light dome. He was met there by  |
| a tall, blond-haired humanoid that had tanned skin and slanted eyes   |
| with a very prominent chin. The man claimed he had sensations of love |
| and serenity projected to him by the tall humanoid. (Source: Albert   |

| 1988 - At 5:25 p.m. Ed Walters was driving in his pickup truck on US  |
| 98 in Gulf Breeze, Florida when an object appeared ahead of him       |
| shining a white beam of light through the windshield, partially       |
| paralyzing his forearms and hands. He stopped the truck and pulled    |
| over to the side of the road. He now felt numb and his arms were      |
| stinging. The object approached quickly and hovered three feet above  |
| the roadway. He was able to grab his shotgun and got out of the       |
| truck, attempting to crawl under it. At this point the object         |
| brightened and came closer. A beam of white light struck Walters on   |
| the back of his legs. The object next began rotating and a blue beam  |
| of light appeared under it. The beam deposited five small beings on   |
| the roadway, all of whom wore some type of shield like coverings.     |
| They had large black oval-shaped eyes and carried glowing rods. The   |
| beings approached Walters, who then managed to crawl back into his    |
| truck and was somehow able to start it; he then drove quickly away    |
| from the area at high speed. (Source: Edward Walters, Gulf Breeze     |

| 1989 - On this night a woman driving her car in Duclair,              |
| Seine-Maritime department, France observed within 30 meters of the    |
| top of a marsh an enormous cylindrical form with a cupola on top. The |
| UFO was emitting a yellow light, had a series of red luminescent      |
| portholes, and a white base. (Source: GEIPAN, case # 26).             |
|                                                                       |
| 1989 - Two men driving in Underwood, Indiana saw a diamond-shaped     |
| object for five minutes moving across the roadway in front of their   |
| car. They drove directly under the craft, 100' above them.            |
|                                                                       |
| 1990 - A man and his three daughters were driving on Five Points Road |
| in the suburbs of Indianapolis, Indiana at 8:30 p.m. when they saw a  |
| domed disc-shaped object and stopped the car. The object hovered and  |
| moved, titled at an angle. It had a little dark dome on top,          |
| multicolored lights (red, white, green and blue), and a beam of light |
| that shone toward the ground. It moved up and down, and approached    |
| and receded. It also made no sound. The witnesses were frightened and |
| resumed driving to get away. (Sources: Norma J. Croda, MUFON case     |

| 1993 - On this night, during a period of appallingly poor weather     |
| conditions and repeated UFO sightings in the area, several local      |
| residents of Langeness Fjord, Iceland reported seeing small           |
| gray-colored humanoids walking on the ice on a nearby glacier.        |

| 1993 - On this evening two men, Joseph Wiek and Harold Egeln, were    |
| having dinner at a coffee shop in Greenwich Village, New York when    |
| suddenly time seemed to slow down and everything became frozen in     |
| "time". Harold saw three humanoid figures enter the restaurant's      |
| front window in a blast of light. Joseph saw the three humanoids      |
| enter, but instead of a light blast he saw one carrying something     |
| that looked like a "trumpet". Later Harold had a bizarre dream where  |
| he saw a saucer-like object rimmed with what appeared to be trumpets, |
| descend over the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact   |

| 2000 - In Caboolture, Queensland, Australia a woman reported that a   |
| thick white cloud came through her screen door, across the kitchen,   |
| blocked her TV, and went up against a wall before it faded. Out in    |

| She reported that she has had strange visions since the event.        |

| 2000 - A family in rural northeastern Missouri chased a UFO in their  |
| car starting at 8:45 p.m., but it suddenly came closer and hovered    |
| over them, then followed them home. They witnessed more than 30       |
| lights that travelled at random through the sky, and they also        |
| claimed to have seen seven aircraft flying around the scene.          |
