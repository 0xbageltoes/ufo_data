| 1947 - A group of survey workers working northeast of Pitanga, Parana |
| State, Brazil ran away when they heard a hissing noise and saw a      |
| disc-shaped object land only 50 meters away from them. Jose C.        |
| Higgins saw two figures through a window inside the craft. Later      |
| three beings in shiny clothes and translucent suits, with oversized   |
| baldheads, huge round eyes, no eyelashes or eyebrows, and a metal box |
| on their back, emerged from the craft. They were over two meters (6.6 |
| feet) tall. They drew a sketch of the solar system and pointed to     |
| Uranus as if to suggest that was their point of origin. (Sources:     |

| 1947 - On this day a private pilot named Jenssen, flying at 6000 feet |
| over Morristown, New Jersey encountered a shaft of light from above.  |
| The aircraft's engine faltered, then died, but the plane maintained   |
| its altitude. He felt a prickling sensation and saw a metallic disc   |
| above and ahead of him. He was able to re-start the plane by putting  |
| the nose down when he got control back. (Sources: Harold T. Wilkins,  |

| 1952 - At two o'clock in the morning a witness in Springfield,        |
| Massachusetts reported a silent orange glowing ovoid object           |
| maneuvering in the sky in a T pattern for 40 minutes. At 2:15 a.m. a  |
| Ground Observer Corp volunteer in Nahant, Massachusetts named         |
| Armpriester sighting two disc-shaped objects that flew to the         |
| northwest at 1500 feet altitude, circled Bird Rock, then flew off to  |
| the southeast. (Sources: (1 & 2) Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History.     |

| 1952 - At three o'clock in the morning four fiery teardrop-shaped     |
| flames flew rapidly toward the east over Gordonsville, Virginia and   |
| then veered sharply upward. They then repeated this staircase         |
| maneuver. The sighting lasted two minutes. (Source: Larry Hatch, U    |

| 1952 - At 3:50 a.m. an F-94 interceptor obtained a radar lock-on      |
| while chasing a blue-green light, which circled Braintree,            |
| Massachusetts at high speed. (Sources: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence |

| 1952 - At 8:20 p.m. local time a blue green ball of light approached  |
| an F-94 jet flying over the ocean east of Misawa AFB in Japan. The    |
| jet gave pursuit, but the UFO suddently shot straight up. (Sources:   |

| 1952 - At 9:10 p.m. three prison guards in Norfolk, Virginia watched  |
| a silent, circular shadow overhead. It shot off at high speed in less |
| than a minute. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. 1952: July   |
| 21st-July 31st, p. 16).                                               |

| 1952 - At 9:15 p.m. a group of evening shift aircraft workers in      |
| Culver City, California watched a silvery elliptical object flying    |
| over their aircraft plant. It emitted two small discs, which later    |
| returned to the main object. The sighting lasted several minutes.     |

| 1956 - Springfield, Massachusetts - Ms. Virginia Maratea and her       |
| sister were sitting on the back porch of her sister's home in the     |
| evening, facing west, when suddenly a glowing red object came into    |
| view. The object was shaped like a barbell, with two bulbous spheres  |
| on each end connected by an amorphous bar. The ends scintillated and  |
| were a fiery red, while the part in the center was dimly visible. She |
| estimated the size as that of a large bomber at high altitude.        |

| 1959 - A silver metallic disc was seen flying in an elliptical orbit  |
| in the sky over Bellevue, Washington at noon. There was no wind at    |
| the time. It vanished in an instant. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U         |

| 1966 - At 2:30 a.m. four UFOs where seen near the Shilo Royal Canadian |
| AF airbase in Manitoba. One was at so low an altitude that it seemed  |
| about to land. (Source: Brad Steiger and Joan Whritenour, Flying      |

| 1968 - In Bauru, Sao Paulo state, Brazil a night watchman named       |
| Oliveira was on duty at the Central Electric Power Station at 1:00    |
| a.m. when he saw a helmeted figure. Suspecting it was a criminal      |
| intruder, he tried to strike him with a metal crowbar but the figure  |
| dodged the blows and was soon joined by two other accomplices. They   |
| quickly overpowered the guard. One of the men, who, unlike the        |
| others, was dressed in yellow coveralls, uttered some unintelligible  |
| words. The security guard called out for help, at which point the     |
| three men boarded a gray colored, unlighted vehicle the size of a     |
| Volkswagen station wagon, and flew off into the air. The men were     |
| about the same size as the witness, about five foot five inches in    |
| height. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, November-December 1968, p. 1; Jader  |

| 1968 - At 5:40 p.m. a metallic object dove into the sea at Playa      |
| Penuelas, Chile. It trailed flames and smoke as it plunged downward.  |
| At 7:30 p.m. a brilliant blue object zigzagged through the sky over   |
| Palquebudis, Chile emitting orange sparks. (Source: Roberto Enrique   |
| Banchs, Las Evidencias del Fenomeno OVNI; Larry Hatch, U computer     |

| 1969 - On this night a UFO stopped a truck and levitated a car with   |
| four occupants in Paulo Lopes, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. The car  |
| was set down a considerable distance far ahead in what seemed like an |
| instant. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, July-August 1969; Geoffrey Falla,   |

| 1971 - In Manicouagan, Quebec an electrical power outage was          |
| connected to UFO sightings that evening. (Source: Claude MacDuff, FSR |
| Case Histories, December 1973, p. 2).                                 |

| 1972 - At 4:10 a.m. in Umkomaas, Kwa-Zulu Natal province, South       |
| Africa Mr. and Mrs. Marco took two photographs of a of luminous       |
| object in the night sky. They also viewed the object through field    |
| glasses. In one of the photographs the object seems to be shaped like |
| a domed disc. The UFO flew out to sea fast, toward the southeast.     |
| (Sources: Phillipp J. Human, FSR, September-October 1972, p. 3; FSR,  |
| March 1973, p. 30).                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - A large cylindrical UFO with three smaller satellite discs was |
| sighted in Gstaad, Switzerland on this night. All UFOs suddenly       |
| vanished. (Source: J. Bernard Delair, UFO Register, volume 9 (1978)). |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - At 12:45 a.m. a 26-year old woman and her 13-year-old niece    |
| looked out their bedroom window in Lindley, New York before retiring  |
| and saw 11 or 12 white lights in a "dipper" shaped formation that     |
| were moving about in the sky. One bright light appeared on a hill 300 |
| yards away. They could hear a whooshing sound, then two lights rose   |
| in the air. Then next heard footsteps from the creek, about 100 yards |
| away, and saw two small figures floating up and down in front of a    |
| tree by the creek. After this they saw several more figures, at       |
| various spots, carrying what seemed to be flashlights. They wore      |
| tight-fitting, "skin diver" suits with glowing green belts.           |
|                                                                       |
| A luminous red rectangular object was seen by one of the witnesses. It |
| approached the creek, and then backed away. At this point both        |
| witnesses developed severe headaches. They then saw a figure on a     |
| distant hill shining a light on a tombstone there, and the stone      |
| seemed to rise up into the air and move back and forth. A figure      |
| taller than the others, who were less than four feet tall, stood near |
| the light on the hill and called out with an "ooh, ooh" signal. The   |
| others all approached him and, five minutes later, deployed back into |
| adjacent fields. One of them approached the house. He came under the  |
| second story window and dropped to the ground, as if to conceal       |
| himself, he then approached the door and rattled the handle. By this  |
| time, 3:45 a.m., the older witness had called her mother, who         |
| notified the state police. All of the lights and figures disappeared  |
| just prior to the arrival of the police, the lights in the sky being  |
| indistinguishable from stars. Both witnesses believed only an hour    |
| had passed but actually over three hours had elapsed. They complained |
| of burning eyes and headaches that lasted for two days. Footprints    |
| were found in the area. (Sources: International UFO Reporter, August  |
| 1977, p. 36; David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of       |
| Humanoid Reports, case 1977-37 (A1742), citing Ted Phillips, Douglas  |
| Dains, & Dr Gary Truce for CUFOS).                                    |

| 1982 - At two a.m. four 16 year olds--with the last names Lebeau,     |
| Cousineau, and Labre--saw an intense beam of white light from a       |
| multi-colored UFO in a field in Ste-Dorothee, near Laval, Quebec.     |
| Shortly later they heard beeping, and when they shone a spotlight in  |
| the direction of the noise it revealed a five to six foot tall being  |
| with a large brown head and orange eyes. They all suffered from       |
| intense stomach pain. (Sources: Richard F. Haines, CE5: Close         |
| Encounters of the Fifth Kind, p. 210; FSR, November 28, 1982).        |
|                                                                       |
| 1987 - In the middle of the day six spheres made 90 degree turns in   |
| the sky in broad daylight over West Pensacola, Florida. (Source:      |
| Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1990, p. 198).                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1990 - At 11:30 p.m. the witness had stepped out of his house in      |
| Rybnik, Poland and noticed that his dog had broken the chain that he  |
| had been tied up to. Looking up, he noticed a powerful beam of white  |
| light in the sky and a small red light moving underneath it. The      |
| white beam of light moved around erratically as if searching. The     |
| witness signaled the beam of light with his flashlight several times  |
| and it appeared to answer him by shining on the highway directly in   |
| front of him. He then became frightened and hid behind a light pole.  |
| The white beam of light approached and struck him in the leg. He ran  |
| to a nearby house but it was deserted and locked, so he then ran back |
| to the road. The object had now come closer to the ground, and a red  |
| light and a ladder were now visible. On the ladder stood a humanoid   |
| figure, but no details could be seen because of the glare from a      |
| nearby streetlight. The being entered the object, which he described  |
| as cigar shaped. The ladder was drawn up and the red light went out.  |
| The object then left the area. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue |
| #309; Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1990, case # 1652, |
| citing Bronislaw Rzepecki, Australian UFO Bulletin).                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1992 - At 7:30 a.m. Peter Khoury was in bed in Sydney, New South      |
| Wales, Australia as a result of a recent work injury and was on pain  |
| medication. Suddenly he was wide awake and sat up in bed, because     |
| there were two humanoid females sitting on the bed, both entirely     |
| naked. The two women looked very human in nearly every detail. They   |
| had well-proportioned adult bodies. One looked Asian, with straight   |
| dark shoulder length hair and dark eyes. The other looked perhaps     |
| Scandinavian, with light colored, possibly blue eyes and long blond   |
| hair that fell half way down her back. To Khoury, the hair looked     |
| very exotic. Their faces were somewhat odd--not unattractive, but too |
| chiseled--with high cheekbones and eyes that were two or three times  |
| larger than normal. Khoury especially noticed the blonde-haired       |
| woman. Her face was long, very long. The blonde, who was in a         |
| kneeling position on his bed, seemed to be in charge. Khoury thought  |
| that she was communicating telepathically with the dark-haired woman, |
| who was sitting with her legs partly folded under her. Their facial   |
| expressions were almost entirely blank.                               |
|                                                                       |
| Stunned by their surprise appearance, Peter was unable to react as    |
| the blond woman suddenly reached out with both her hands and cupped   |
| the back of his head, drawing his face toward her breasts. He         |
| resisted. Apparently very strong, she pulled harder. She pulled him   |
| forward and his mouth was placed on one of her nipples, and he bit    |
| it. A piece of her nipple came loose in his teeth, but the blond      |
| woman did not cry out. She seemed shocked or confused and looked at   |
| the Asian woman, then back at the witness. Involuntarily, Khoury      |
| swallowed the small fragment in his mouth. It caught in his throat    |
| and he went into a coughing fit. The two women suddenly simply        |
| disappeared. Feeling an urge to go to the bathroom, he realized his   |
| penis felt very painful. Pulling back the foreskin he found two thin  |
| blond strands of hair wrapped tightly around it. He kept the hair     |
| samples for genetic analysis. The DNA analysis showed that the hair   |
| was human, but the genome testing suggested that the closest match    |
| would be a cross breeding of someone from Iceland with someone from   |

| 1995 - At eleven p.m. a black, silent, manta ray shaped flying object |
| passed overhead in Snake River, Idaho. It had black wings that        |
| appeared to "ripple." There was no mention of lights on the UFO in    |
| the report. (Source: Curt Sutherly, UFO Mysteries: A Reporter Seeks   |

| 1997 - In Los Angeles, California a woman reported seeing a large     |
| metallic hat-shaped object with several portholes around the rim,     |
| hovering between two buildings at 1:30 p.m. She said it made no       |
| sound, and she also reported she received a telepathic message from   |
| it. Several nights later she remembered being in a round room with    |
| windows. She had a "guide" on board the craft, who was a handsome     |
| blond haired man with a bare chest. She remembered looking down on    |
| the San Bernardino Mountains, but that was all that she could recall  |
| of the possible abduction experience. (Sources: Peter Davenport,      |

| 1997 - During this afternoon several locals of Vegas de Diuca, Chile  |
| including Jose and Nicolasa Estrada witnessed a small robotic figure  |
| that moved in quick jerky jumps on a nearby hill. It was reddish      |
| yellow in color. It would take quick short flights over the fields    |
| then fall down and land. It seemed to have a round head with an       |
| eye-like hole in the center. It had a tail like protrusion on its     |
| rear and two antennas like protrusions on top. Two of the witnesses,  |
| one armed with a shotgun, approached to within ten meters of the      |
| figure. Around the same time other locals reported seeing slow moving |
| lights low over the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid        |

| 1999 - A craft that at first looked like a mobile home took off       |
| vertically from a field in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania at 11:30    |
| p.m., and then executed a turn. It made a humming sound, shook, and   |
| then went straight up. (Source: George Filer, Filers' Files, 1999,    |

| 2001 - At 9:30 p.m. young mother was breastfeeding her baby in her    |
| fourth floor apartment in Amasya, Turkey when she turned her head and |
| saw a strange looking humanoid standing in front of the balcony door  |
| and curtain. After a few seconds the humanoid disappeared. She        |
| described it as about 1.05 meters in height, with very big jet-black  |
| eyes, slanting up. His head was oval-shaped and bald. His color was   |
| gray like smoke. No other details were noted because of the witness   |
| state of panic and the short duration of the encounter. There were    |
| unconfirmed reports of UFO's seen in the area that night. (Source:    |
