| UFO at 9:10 p.m. in Lockbourne, Ohio. It was amber colored, circular  |
| object, somewhat smaller than the average airplane. It had a small    |
| flame coming from the rear of the craft that periodically increased   |
| in brightness, and its rim gave off an orange and green glow. It      |
| moved very fast for 90 seconds, giving off a resonant beat sound. It  |
| appeared several times over a four-hour period. (Sources: Project     |

| 1955 - At 3 o'clock in the morning at Plessiel Airfield, near          |
| Abbeville, France Mr. Maupin and five other witnesses on the field    |
| were blinded by the light from a disc-shaped object 150 m away. The   |
| disc left an orange glowing trail. It was silent, flew slowly, and    |
| hovered near the Metro station close to the ground, but did not       |
| actually land. It left toward the northwest. A woodsman from Mareul   |
| Caubert, Mr. Rolle, saw the object half an hour earlier. It came from |
| the direction of Amiens. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to         |

| 1959 - At 6:30 p.m. a flashing light streaked to the north over the   |
| Norman River in Corindie, Queensland, Australia. Twenty minutes later |
| a red glowing object landed on a hill on Prince of Wales Island,      |
| Queensland. Around 8:00 p.m. a UFO was seen moving over the mountains |
| at Didiwa, Papua New Guinea. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer        |

| 1962 - At 1:00 a.m. Doctor Gauza and his wife were traveling on their |
| way back to Crespo, Entre Rios, Argentina when they noticed a large   |
| metallic, cone-shaped object on the ground very close to the road. A  |
| very tall human looking figure stood next to an open door in the      |
| craft. It was looking around at the terrain. There was also a second  |
| figure looking out from a large porthole. The men were described as   |
| having long blond hair, and wore white coveralls with visors. When    |
| the two beings saw the witnesses, they used hand signals in an        |
| apparent attempt to get them to come closer, but the couple panicked  |
| and left at high speed. Eight other persons later came forward        |
| stating that they had also seen the craft and its occupants. (Source: |

| 1962 - At 8:00 p.m. Ms. F. Cummins in Stanley, Wisconsin saw two      |
| silver dumbbell-shaped flying objects, with thick crossbars, fly off  |
| toward the southwest. At nearly the same time a doctor saw two huge   |
| humanoid beings near a saucer by the side of the road in Crespo,      |
| Argentina (11:00 p.m. local time). (Sources: APRO Bulletin, May-June  |

| 1963 - At two o'clock in the afternoon, four boys in Fern Creek,      |
| Kentucky saw a cigar-shaped object that became a disc, then vanished  |
| behind some trees. A small being, 3.5 to 4 feet tall, wearing a       |
| tight-fitting white suit, goggles and a helmet emerged from the       |
| trees. The boys threw dirt clods at the entity, and the dwarf fired   |
| back using what looked like a black tube, burning two of them. There  |
| were landing imprints and footprints at the site. (Source: David F.   |

| 1965 - A 70-foot diameter black disc flew by a satellite tracking     |
| station in Bedford, England on this day. None of the witnesses        |
| outdoors at the time could hear anything. A metallic disc hung        |
| stationary high in the sky at an altitude above 100,000 feet. (Source: Donald |

| 1967 - At 1:20 a.m. Rev. Anthony De Polo, an Assembly of God          |
| minister, was lying in bed in Boardman, Ohio when he heard a very     |
| loud whining sound that rose and fell in pitch. Then he received a    |
| distinct mental message telling him to go to the window. He did so,   |
| and saw a five foot tall figure wearing a luminous tight-fitting      |
| "spacesuit." There was also a source of light coming from above the   |
| figure. At first he thought someone was playing a prank, but the      |
| apparition was well-defined and looked real. He stepped out onto his  |
| porch and mentally heard the words,"You have nothing to fear."        |
|                                                                       |
| He began to walk toward the being when the whining noise began again  |
| and he heard, "Danger; I must go." Then the figure dissolved into a   |
| blurred glow of light. Before it completely disappeared De Polo       |
| received another message of a personal nature. On the same night and  |
| not far from De Polo's home, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Dixon heard a loud    |
| noise outside, looked out, and saw an object hovering over their      |
| house. It moved off toward the south after about five minutes. De     |
| Polo has had a number of subsequent UFo sightings and "contacts."     |

| 1968 - At 7:30 a.m. three schoolteachers encountered a                |
| reddish-orange, oval-shaped object a few meters above the ground      |
| while driving to work in Lavalle, Argentina. It was about 20 meters   |
| in diameter and gave off the smell of wet paper. One witness felt     |
| drowsy from the smell. (Source: Oscar A. Uriondo, FSR Case Histories, |

| 1969 - At nine o'clock in the morning a photograph of a UFO was taken |
| at Flippin Airport in Arkansas. That afternoon in Sobral, Ceara       |
| State, Brazil Mr. Neusa Rodgriques saw a shiny flying disc stop and   |
| remain stationary for 30 seconds near a cement plant. An occupant     |
| could be seen inside the object through a window. It looked like "a   |
| little bluish colored man with eyes that gave off flashes." The UFO   |
| performed various maneuvers over the cement plant and drew the        |
| attention of many of its employees, who stopped work briefly to watch |
| it. Lt. Pedro Edvaldo De Souza took statements from the eyewitnesses, |
| on instructions from the Brazilian Air Force base at Fortaleza,       |
| Brazil. (Sources: Walter Buhler, FSR Case Histories, November 1971,   |

| 1973 - Three color photographs of a UFO were taken by a nuclear       |
| engineer and amateur astronomer at 8:45 p.m. in Jeannette,            |

| 1990 - A woman in New Hartford, Connecticut was lying awake in bed at |
| 2:00 a.m. when she noticed bright flashing lights over her backyard.  |
| She went to the window and witnessed a small domed disc hovering 100  |
| feet away and descending over the corner of the lawn. The object      |
| maneuvered a few seconds without actually touching down. She noted    |
| that it had flashing red, yellow, and white lights around its bottom  |
| rim. It then accelerated and was out of sight behind some trees in a  |
| second. Two days later a hired worker asked her about some strange    |
| material on the grass. She realized it was in the area of the         |
| sighting. After eliminating the lawn car company as responsible for   |
| an oily residue on the grass, she decided to report the incident.     |

| 1998 - A triangular object maneuvered near an airport west of         |
| Longmont, Colorado at 8:07 a.m. It was about 60 feet in width and     |
| wobbled at only 15 meters altitude. In flew off toward the west. On   |
| the same evening a light was observed moving up and down behind some  |

| 1999 - The main witness was a UFO investigator, staying with a known  |
| abductee and her child in San Antonio, Texas, in order to offer them  |
| some protection and company. He had fallen asleep, when he woke up    |
| suddenly when he detected some kind of movement behind him. Thinking  |
| it was the woman he did not turn around. Then he felt a “body” next   |
| to him, and he next felt a pleasant touch on his upper back, and      |
| the sensation as an “arm” passed over his ribcage. Concerned, he      |
| tried to move but was unable to. When he was finally able to turn his |
| head, he saw a round basketball shaped object under the covers. He    |
| jolted to his feet and heard a slight giggling sound at the same time |
| that the object under the covers appeared to deflate. He went and     |
| tried to wake up his friend but was unable to. Two nights later he    |
| saw a small white, grayish figure standing just inches away from him  |
| that suddenly disappeared. Other strange occurrences were later       |
| reported. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1999, |

| 2003 - In Vancouver, Washington a businessman and a retired Navy man  |
| observed three rectangular objects, the size of small planes, that    |
| appeared overhead as shadows in the sky at 10:40 p.m. They were       |
| slightly illuminated but not bright. The objects zig-zagged and       |
| criss-crossed into the distance.(Source: Peter Davenport, National    |

| 2007 - A triangular shaped object with solid white lights and a solid |

| 2008 - Exactly one year after a similar sighting in Columbia,         |
| Missouri and at the same hour, a black triangular object hung         |
| motionless in the sky in St. Charles, Missouri over the southside of  |
| Missouri Highway 370, just off of Discovery Bridge. It had three      |
| white and one red non-blinking lights. (Source: Peter Davenport,      |
