| 1949 - U.S. Air Force Captain W. Donnelly sighted a flight of four     |
| disc-shaped object north of Rosarita Beach, Baja California, Mexico.  |
| The objects had a cavorting flight formation. (Sources: Edward        |

| 1953 - A very large, 300-foot diameter disc-shaped object zoomed by a |
| RAF Vampire reconaisance jet from West Malling RAFB, Kent, England at |
| 10:00 a.m. The encounter lasted 30 seconds. Radar returns were picked |

| 1954 - Oued Beth, Morocco. Maroc Presse reported that one of its      |
| employees, Mr. E., the driver of a delivery truck and "a man of sane  |
| judgment and excellent eyesight," observed an object flying over the  |
| Beth River. "I am positive it was not an aircraft or any known        |
| machine but a circular, flat craft which had the appearance of        |
| copper. It flew normally for some time, and then it suddenly flipped  |
| over. Therefore, I was able to see the whole disc and was amazed when |
| it came down into a field where it landed on edge, very gently.       |
| Almost immediately it rose into the sky at great speed, resumed its   |
| horizontal position and was soon lost to sight." (Source: Jacques     |

| 1954 - At 6:00 a.m. a reportedly reliable witness encountered a thick |
| fog in Palavas, Herault, France. Inside was a hovering blue,          |
| disc-shaped UFO. It stayed stationary a short while, and then shot    |
| straight up at an extremely fast speed. (Source: Larry Hatch, U       |

| 1954 - Two dwarf humanoids wearing metallic suits with helmets were   |
| seen in a thick fog at 6:30 a.m. at a farm in Mareil-sur-Loir,        |

| 1954 - At 6:30 a.m. in Burleson, Texas a witness named McDowell saw a |
| 10-foot diameter disc-shaped object with a red-orange glow. It flew   |
| silently with trails of white sparks for more than two minutes. It    |
| was gone in a sudden burst of speed. (Sources: Project Blue Book      |

| 1957 - A large number of reports around Levelland, Texas which began  |
| the night before continued in the early morning hours. They described |
| a low-flying ovoid or cigar-shaped object, over 60 meters long,       |
| equipped with a bright light, and which interfered with car and truck |
| ignition and electrical systems. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Anatomy of  |

| 1957 - At 3:00 a.m. at the Stallion Missile Test Site on the White    |
| Sands, New Mexico proving grounds an Army patrol in a jeep saw an     |
| orange, "apparently controlled," luminous object on the ground near   |
| the site of the first A-bomb explosion. It was first seen as a        |
| sun-like source 50 meters above ground, and it then descended to      |
| ground level after three minutes, landing several kilometers away at  |
| the northern end of the testing grounds. Two U.S. Army witnesses.     |

| 1968 - Two 15-year-old boys in Houston, Texas sighted a domed         |
| disc-shaped object with black dots, possibly windows, at 4:15 p.m.    |
| "Angel hair" residue was found in the aftermatch of the sighting, the |
| "…substance is fibrous, elastic, relatively strong, somewhat sticky,  |
| and white in color." (Source: NICAP files, sighting a newspaper       |
| clipping December 19, 1968).                                          |

| 1971 - Trudy Van Riper was awakened at around four o'clock in the     |
| morning by her cats "growling and carrying on" on her ranch near      |
| Austin, Texas. When she opened the door they ran inside and hid under |
| the living room couch. When she looked out the window, she saw an     |
| "elliptical moon" object lighting up her backyard and part of the     |
| pasture beyond. Going to the front door, she discovered a strange     |
| little vehicle that had landed on her lawn, which resembled a         |
| Volkswagen without fenders or doors. From the top emerged three small |
| men dressed in dark garments, one of whom communicated with her       |
| telepathically, saying, "Are there any pigs in that field? They are   |
| hungry." Then she saw, near the men, two peculiar looking creatures   |
| covered with fuzzy hair, but standing erect. She retreated back       |
| inside her house, and when she looked out again the object was        |
| airborne, and the "moon" was gone. Later she learned that several     |
| pigs had been lost at a nearby farm. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted     |

| 1973 - Sr. Rincon Castillo received telepathic messages to go to a    |
| certain isolated area near a lagoon, 150 kilometers south of Santa Fe |
| de Bogota, Colombia; at 8:00 p.m. After arriving there he was then    |
| instructed to go to a clearing in the woods. There he was told he     |
| would find a metallic sphere, which he did. The sphere was small and  |
| covered with tiny holes. It suddenly started shooting bright beams of |
| light in different directions. The whole area was next illuminated by |
| a bright glow, and two huge, saucer-shaped objects appeared and flew  |
| directly overhead. Both were dripping water and were emitting a       |
| strong heat wave. They were silent and had three rotating white       |
| spheres on the bottom, and were emitting multicolored lights. The     |
| objects then descended out of sight and dimmed their lights. After    |
| that, two tall humanoid figures wearing uniforms and helmets with     |
| transparent visors approached Castillo from the woods and told him    |
| not to be afraid. The two figures took him to a nearby clearing,      |
| where a flying craft now appeared overhead, shooting down a beam of   |
| yellow light that surrounded both the witness and the humanoids. He   |
| was then transported inside the object where he saw two more tall,    |
| smiling entities. The beings removed their helmets; they had handsome |
| human features, and shoulder length, blond hair. Some of the men wore |
| tight fitting silvery outfits with orange boots and gloves, while     |
| others wore brown outfits. The witness was given information about    |
| upcoming Earth changing events, and was given an extensive tour       |
| onboard the craft. (Sources: BUFORA Journal, 1973, p. 60; David F.    |

| 1973 - Mr. N. Hearn reported a close encounter with a UFO while       |
| driving on the golf course in Lewisville, Texas at 9:10 p.m.          |

| 1973 - On this night witnesses in Industry, Pennsylvania reported to  |
| the local police the sighting of a large, dark, hairy creature with   |
| glowing green eyes. This occurred during heavy UFO activity in the    |
| area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1973 Humanoid Sighting Reports       |

| 1975 - Dick Jackson, age 56, awoke late at night around two o'clock   |
| in the morning in Bokoelia, Florida and stepped outside his trailer   |
| home. The next thing he recalls, he found himself standing beside a   |
| domed object, with steps leading up to a door. He climbed the steps   |
| and was invited in. The interior was a single round compartment, 24   |
| feet in diameter and 8 feet high, with a small control panel. There   |
| were eight crewmembers inside, but only one spoke to him. This man    |
| was five feet tall, stocky and of dark complexion, and elderly        |
| looking. He wore brown coveralls with no shirt. Speaking in English,  |
| he told Mr. Jackson that they came from the planet "Planteh." They    |
| have been preparing "a neighboring planet" for colonization by Earth  |
| people, and Jackson was asked to help then recruit colonists; perfect |
| health was offered to him in return for his assistance. After 90      |
| minutes of conversation Jackson left the craft, which took off with   |
| great speed. Then he found himself in his trailer. He told his        |
| 16-year old son of the experience. The case appears to have episodes  |
| of distorted reality or missing time. (Source: HUMCAT: Catalogue of   |

| 1975 - At 11:45 p.m. the two witnesses, Christian Talbot and Susan    |
| Mondor, were driving on an old dirt road in Saint-Dominique-de-Bagot, |
| Quebec, Canada on a very bright starry night. They heard a strange    |
| noise and their vehicle engine abruptly stalled. Out of nowhere a     |
| strange figure then approached the vehicle very quickly. Both witness |
| could only catch a glimpse of the stranger, described as somewhat     |
| "caveman" in appearance, with dark hair and a beard, pointy ears, and |
| "demonic" facial features. The top half of its body was greenish and  |
| the bottom half was pale white. This strange creature ran by the car  |
| and disappeared into the woods. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1975      |

| navigation channel. (Source: Bob Pratt, Operacao Prato, p. 26).       |
