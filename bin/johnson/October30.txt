| 1950 - At 11:00 p.m. in Paignton, Devonshire, England a cigar-shaped  |
| object dropped from the sky, then ejected two disc-shaped objects.    |
| All three craft flew off to the north. The witnesses were two men     |
| named Cove and Clark. The sighting lasted two minutes. (Sources:      |

| 1954 - Two UFOs were seen by hunters in Muro Lucano, Italy. One       |
| touched the ground 50 meters away. It was rhomboid in shape, and a    |
| cylinder was hanging from the bottom. A peculiar sound could also be  |
| heard. The object shifted its position and the cylinder hit trees,    |
| bouncing three times. The craft then gained altitude and flew away,   |
| leaving a bluish trail. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: |

| 1954 - Twenty eight kilometers north of Tapas, Rio Grande do Sul,     |
| Brazil at 11:35 p.m. four lights approached, then surrounded a car    |
| until the four witnesses drove away. The UFO changed color from white |
| to blue to violet to orange to red. When the round lights on the      |
| object changed color they saw the shape was that of either a dome or  |
| sphere. (Source: UNICAT, case # 558 citing Olavo T. Fontes).          |

| 1957 - A 19-year-old couple, Moyer and Pulju, were driving ten miles  |
| north of Casper, Wyoming at 9:00 p.m. when they encountered 50-foot   |
| wide, silvery sphere or disc just over the road that caused           |
| electromagnetic effects on their car. (Sources: Casper (WY)           |

| 1959 - A domed disc hovered over a queue of shoppers in the city of   |
| Aubagne, Bouches-Rhone, France at 6 p.m. Twenty                       |
| human-looking occupants were visible inside the transparent dome,     |
| and appeared to be laughing at them. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,  |

| 1966 - Two couples driving on Route 38 in Cherry Hill, New Jersey at  |
| 2:30 a.m. saw a carrot-shaped object 400 feet long, hovering 50 feet  |
| over the roof of the RCA industrial plant, 400 feet away from the     |
| highway. It was in a horizontal position, and had huge running lights |
| and windows. A ramp came down from the craft to the plant roof, and   |
| they could see figures moving about on the roof. They watched them    |
| for 10 minutes before leaving. A truck driver who also saw the object |
| drove his truck into a telephone pole he was so excited. (Sources:    |

| 1967 - At around nine o'clock in the evening a businessman was        |
| driving toward Boyup Brook, Australia when his car failed completely  |
| and stopped, although he did not recall feeling any deceleration. He  |
| found a strong light beam aimed at him from a mushroom-shaped craft,  |
| ten meters in diameter. He had no recollection of starting the car    |
| again after the departure of the object. (Source: Jacques Vallee,     |

| 1967 - Approaching his home in Melfort, Saskatchewan, Canada at 9:00  |
| p.m. Donald Marshall saw a light beyond it. When he got closer he saw |
| that it was an object with a large rectangular lighted panel that     |
| hovered 12 feet off the ground, 200 feet away. The rectangular        |
| lighted panel was about 4 feet high and 16 feet long. It appeared to  |
| be a large window in the object whose shape was not clearly seen, but |
| was perhaps 50 feet long. A bright spotlight came on, and he saw then |
| three small humanoid figures, the size of ten-year-old children,      |
| coming from the machine. They moved very fast, wore green uniforms,   |
| and some type of headgear. They disappeared into the darkness, and    |
| the craft took off slowly at about 5 mph. It moved at first into a    |
| gully, breaking some trees, where it remained for another 3 or 4      |
| minutes. The total time during which Marshall observed the object was |
| 18-19 minutes. Broken trees were found near the site. (Sources: Gene  |

| 1969 - At around 10 a.m. a man and a woman, Clinton and Chapin, saw   |
| an egg-shaped flying object with a flat bottom, the size of VW        |
| Beetle, in a mountainous area of Redding, California. It was seen as  |
| it landed in a steep, wooded canyon. The minimum distance to the      |
| object was only 60 feet. It took off fast, causing the trees to sway, |
| and zoomed up into the sky. Ground marks were found at the landing    |
| site: there was an 10 foot oval-shaped depression, 1-2 inches deep.   |

| 1975 - At about 10:10 p.m. a KC-135 U.S. Air Force tanker returning   |
| from a refueling mission, flying at a speed of 200 knots, and an      |
| altitude of 2000 feet, sighted at least two nocturnal lights and      |
| mystery 'choppers' around and over the Wurtsmith AFB in Oscoda,       |
| Michigan, a Strategic Air Command base. The objects breached security |
| areas, and hovered over the nuclear weapons site. Base personnel      |
| thought they saw the running lights of a low flying craft they        |
| thought was a helicopter, except that it hovered and moved            |
| up-and-down erratically near the base perimeter. One white light was  |
| pointed downward, and two red lights were visible near the trailing   |
| edge. Airman Michael J. Myers, an air policeman on duty near the main |
| gate, saw several unidentified lights near the western edge of the    |
| base. The object turned north and appeared to lose altitude. Between  |
| 10:15 and 10:25 p.m. base security police at the back gate of         |
| Wurtsmith reported to the command post that an unidentified           |
| "helicopter" with no lights had come over the back gate and hovered   |
| at a low altitude over the weapons storage area. Radar was also       |
| tracking low-flying objects intruding into the base, and the incoming |
| KC-135 confirmed seeing two UFOs that sped away each time it          |
| attempted to close for identification. The UFOs flew away at 1,200    |
| mph. One shot away to the west, the other went north. (Sources:       |

| 1976 - A married couple was driving with Maggy Carof and they were    |
| just turning onto the D-50 highway in Cernoy-en-Berry, Loiret, France |
| at noon when Ms. Carof saw a short being standing on the edge of the  |
| highway, about 200 yards away. It was about the stature of a          |
| 12-year-old child. The being was wearing a blue gray cape with a      |
| white collar, and a black cap like that of a Pierrot. This figure     |
| then disappeared “progressively,” beginning with the right side. An   |
| immediate search of the area showed nothing. The witness’s dog, which |
| was in the car, moaned at the moment of the observation, and was sick |
| for the rest of the day. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1976 - A PTA meeting was in progress at a school in El Abrojal,       |
| Uruguay at 10 p.m. when a yellow, illuminated rectangular flying      |
| object was seen on the ground. There was an immediate failure of the  |
| electrical system at the school, which was based on 12V batteries,    |
| and a sudden blast of hot air was felt by the several witnesses,      |
| including the main witness, Isabel Cardozo de Alvez. At the same time |
| a red sphere of light was seen by a man and a woman, Silva and        |
| Camargo, in a residential area of the city. Its close approach caused |
| a loss of consciousness for five minutes. Afterwards, their           |
| physiological effects were: sleepiness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting,   |
| and eye irritation (photopthalmia). (Source: UNICAT, cases # 514 &    |

| 1977 - Mrs. Pauline Coombs, her mother, and her four children were    |
| driving back to their Ripperston Farm home near Dyfed, Pembrokeshire, |
| Wales at around three o'clock in the afternoon when her mother called |
| their attention to a white disc-like object over their car. It flew   |
| in from the direction of the sea. Curious, the women drove in the     |
| direction of the shoreline and then crossed two fields to get to the  |
| ocean's edge. Several hundred yards offshore is a rock outcrop called |
| Stack Rocks, rising up 80 to 100 feet from the water. They could not  |
| see the UFO but they did see two humanoid figures walking about on    |
| the rocks. They were dressed in silvery outfits, similar to a         |
| frogman's wetsuit. Their heads or helmets were extremely large and    |
| rectangular in shape, rounded at the corners, and with no observable  |
| features. They appeared to be looking for something. A "door"         |
| appeared on the right hand face of the rocks, sliding alternately     |
| open and shut like the door of a dumbwaiter. One of the figures       |
| entered this doorway and appeared to descend a stairway, disappearing |
| in the darkened interior, and then reappearing once again. The        |
| stairway was not visible to the viewers. On his final descent the     |
| door closed and disappeared from view. To the left side of the rocks  |
| the second figure appeared to "walk" out over the water's surface,    |
| finally disappearing behind the left side of the rocks. The display   |
| had lasted for 15 minutes. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,     |

| 1977 - At around 7:00 p.m. Martha Throne was driving with her husband |
| to Sonora, California when suddenly a cloud of blue smoke engulfed    |
| their car. The car stopped and its lights went out. She lost          |
| consciousness and then woke up with several humanoids carrying her to |
| a landed oval-shaped craft standing on legs. The Grey humanoids had   |
| flat noses, and were wearing coverall type suits. A blanket was put   |
| over her head but she was reassured by means of mental telepathy that |
| she would be all right. She was then placed on a table in a shiny     |
| room, where she was examined by two humanoids while others nearby     |
| attended to other duties. Her watch as well as her husband's stopped  |
| just after 7 p.m. and never ran again. (Sources: Sonora Daily Union   |

| 1978 - At 9:30 p.m. Sebastiana Francelina de Jesus, his older         |
| brother, and a younger cousin were traveling by Jeep on their way to  |
| a local farm in Carmo Da Cachoeira, Minas Gerais, Brazil when         |
| suddenly an unknown force halted the vehicle in its tracks, then      |
| pulled it backwards into the mud on the side of the road. All this    |
| occurred while a torrential rain was falling. The Jeep was hopelessly |
| mired in the mud. As the three witnesses attempted to dislodge it a   |
| very large object emitting an intense rotating light suddenly         |
| appeared. The UFO flew over them at very low altitude and then        |
| descended to hover a few meters away from the witnesses. The light    |
| from the object was so bright that it temporarily blinded the three   |
| young people. The older man nearly fainted from fright.               |
|                                                                       |
| Two bright rotating beams of light illuminated the area around them   |
| and the interior of the Jeep. They could also hear a steady droning   |
| noise coming from the object. After awhile they began to hear what    |
| seemed to be human voices coming from the object, but the voices      |
| spoke in an unknown language. The terrified witnesses began screaming |
| for help because they began to feel a bizarre effect: all three felt  |
| as if they were "floating." They also described the feeling like      |
| "they were growing in size." Finally the UFO began to move away,      |
| throwing numerous rocks and debris up into the air. As it sped away   |
| from view a small spherical orange-yellow light followed the craft.   |
| The witnesses then felt their environment return to normal. (Source:  |

| 1981 - In a forested area in Worthing, West Sussex, England a large   |
| colored disc-shaped object, half red, half white, with the two colors |
| flashing alternately and transposing positions when flashing, passed  |
| over two witnesses in a car at 7:30 p.m. The craft had two exhaust    |
| ports emitting sparks; it rose in the air, came toward the car, and   |
| left toward the sea. (Source: Joe Graziano, APRO Bulletin, March      |

| 1989 - Observing stars with a telescope and binoculars at 9:15 p.m.,  |
| two witnesses in Fort Walton Beach, Florida saw a group of lights     |
| hovering. Insects were silent as the dark object with a "X" of lights |
| on the underside was seen hovering 100 meters away. After about five  |
| minutes, the object moved slowly away toward the swamp, going out of  |
| sight behind some trees. (Sources: Dan Wright, MUFON UFO Journal,     |
