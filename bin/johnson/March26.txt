| 1880 - Lamy, New Mexico - Four men walking near Galisteo Junction in   |
| the evening were surprised as they heard voices coming from a         |
| "strange balloon," which flew over them. It was shaped like a fish    |
| and seemed to be guided by a large fanlike device. There were eight   |
| to ten figures aboard. Their language was not understood. The object  |
| flew low over Galisteo Junction and rose rapidly toward the east.     |

| 1950 - Several discs were seen from a Lebanese airliner off the coast |
| of the ancient city of Acre (now Akko), Israel. They were travelling  |
| north and flying at a high altitude while emitting trails of smoke.   |
| At 11:15 a.m. five disc-shaped UFOs were seen, first three, then      |
| another two, flying over Bruswick, Georgia. They were silver in       |
| color, and flew at 30,000 feet altitude at a speed greater than 1,800 |
| mph. (Sources: Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p. 12).  |

| 1966 - Jean Voilquin, age 54, saw a strange looking "wheel" roll 15   |
| meters away from him in Attigneville, France. It moved at a speed of  |
| about 30 kilometers per hour. It was about 80 centimeters in          |
| diameter, 25 cm thick; it rolled away at 1:30 p.m. and then vanished. |

| he touched the antenna he received a strong electric shock, and burns |
| on the hand. Investigators rated his story as reliable. (Sources:     |

| 1966 - Two women were driving back from Amarillo, Texas at just       |
| before midnight when they saw a UFO approaching them from the north.  |
| Their car engine died and the headlights failed. The object flew over |
| the car and hovered 400 meters away. After 10 minutes the witnesses   |
| were able to start their car and leave. They reported the object had  |
| a waffle-like surface and glowed with an intense red light. (Source:  |

| 1967 - The Bailey and Lore families had observed UFOs in the area of  |
| their homes in Minitare, Nebraska on several occasions. On the        |
| evening of March 26 at around 7:30 p.m., Robert Lore and Cecil Bailey |
| drove north of their farms to look for lights that looked like they   |
| had landed on an isolated section of farmland. The two men drove past |
| a man in white coveralls standing alone by the side of the road.      |
| Their dog was riding in the car, and it "really kicked up a fuss" and |
| appeared to be terrified. When the men got home the lights were once  |
| more visible in the sky. One particular bright light was strong       |
| enough to light up the hill behind it. When they returned to the site |
| where they had seen the stranger the next day, they found numerous    |
| nearly rectangular footprints, some of them 9.75 inches long and      |
| others 8.5 incheslong. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: |

| 1967 - At 9:45 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. John Dick and Mrs. W. Buhr were      |
| driving toward Gretna, Manitoba, Canada. They saw a very bright       |
| object at ground level near three radio towers situated 3.5           |
| kilometers south of Altona, Manitoba, illuminating the countryside    |
| with a pink glow. The object itself was dark with a luminous band     |
| around it, was motionless, and pulsated. It disappeared very          |
| suddenly. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of  |
| Landings, case 829, citing the Altona Echo, April 19, 1967).          |

| 1972 - A car engine stalled at 5:30 a.m. when three red UFOs came     |
| down in a field between Dargies and Grandvilliers, Oise, France. It   |
| vanished when the car's headlights lit upon it. (Source: Michel       |

| 1974 - A truck driver was driving in Valdehijaderos, Spain at 2:00    |
| a.m. when he spotted a strange luminous object like a plate placed    |
| above another large, round object hovering motionless over the        |
| highway about 200 meters from the him. A similar object, also         |
| motionless, was seen 15-20 meters away. Two beings came out of the    |
| first vehicle, pointed to the observer's truck, then went inside      |
| again, and both vehicles flew away. At 11:30 p.m. the same witness    |
| witnessed "three silver ships parked on the highway with light        |
| similar to floodlight." The observer stopped the motor of his car and |
| some figures approached him. He ran, frightened, and they followed    |
| him. They were about two meters tall (6.5 feet). The next day the     |
| Guardia Civil made an investigation. They found a hole in the ground, |
| which the truck driver said he had not made. (Source: Richard H.      |

| 1974 - At 8:00 a.m. a witness driving near Pouldergat, Finistere,     |
| France saw a hemispheric dome-shaped following the road. Next a long, |
| half-cylinder shaped object was seen hovering over an intersection.   |
| At 9:00 p.m. another hemispheric dome-shaped object was sighted by    |
| three witnesses in Pleuville, Charente, France. It was luminous and   |
| had two rays of light coming from it. It flew at a low altitude of    |
| under 10 meters, and was estimated to be 4-5 meters in diameter.      |

| 1983 - On this evening two witnesses driving in Careme, Tarn-Garonne, |
| France encountered sudden fog, and then a huge disc-shaped UFO. Their |
| car turned unaccountably onto an unknown dirt road, and they had a    |
| possible missing time experience. The entire experience lasted 50     |
| minutes. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 317).                  |

| 1993 - A 20-year-old woman was standing on her back porch in Roslyn   |
| Estates, Nassau County, New York when a silent, multicolored domed    |
| disc "glided over the house" at an estimated 150 feet altitude. She   |
| first thought it was a low flying plane, but dismissed that idea      |
| because of the shape of the object. The dome on the disc was as tall  |
| as the width of the object. The object was covered in bright white    |
| flashing lights. Jets soon showed up, apparently to chase the object. |

| 2000 - Two witnesses observed a triangular object that crossed the    |
| sky over Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at steady pace and a high altitude  |
| at 10:45 p.m. Its shape was defined by a number of grayish-white,     |
| non-blinking lights. It flew to the northeast, and made no sound.     |
| According to one witness “the object had to be huge” since it was     |
| very high up, but could clearly be seen as it blocked out a portion   |
| of the clear sky as it moved. (Source: Stan Gordon, Pennsylvania      |

| 2001 - At 7:20 a.m. there was a UFO sighting of a flying disc in      |
| Cochabamba, Bolivia. The local TV stations had close up photos. At    |

| paced a T-33 trainer with a military pilot at a distance while in     |
| flight over La Paz, Bolivia. (Sources: Peter Davenport, National UFO  |

| 2001 - At 9:35 p.m. EDT a very large, multicolored triangular object  |
| with two very bright lights on the front and a reddish looking light  |
| on the bottom center was seen over Durham, North Carolina. An         |
| extremely large cigar-shaped craft with two flashing lights on each   |
| end, which the witness estimated to be at least 200 yards long, was   |
| sighted over Valentine, Nebraska at 9:00 p.m. CDT (Source: Peter      |
| Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, Seattle, report uploaded    |
| April 1, 2001).                                                       |

| 2002 - A pharmaceutical products salesman was returning along a       |
| desrted road around 3 p.m. in Cazalla de la Sierra, Spain when he     |
| noticed an object resembling a shiny pear ahead in the middle of the  |
| roadway. It was resting on three metallic legs. Somewhat perplexed,   |
| he continued to drive closer, and then notice two very tall humanoid  |
| beings standing in a nearby field. They were over two meters tall,    |
| and wore tight-fitting, white coveralls and helmets resembling those  |
| worn by the early astronauts.                                         |
|                                                                       |
| He parked his vehicle and approached the two strange figures on foot. |
| One of the men walked away and entered the pear-shaped craft, while   |
| the other remained behind. Knowing that these men were "not from this |
| Earth", he still asked the remaining humanoid if he needed any        |
| assistance. He felt when he approached the strange pair he had        |
| entered some kind of a trance, and he seemed to be floating over the  |
| road. The being replied and appeared to be genuinely pleased with his |
| offer of assistance, but said that everything was in order. He said   |
| that the area was very beautiful and also added, "Humans don't know   |
| what they have. Where we come from we don't have such beautiful       |
| scenes; they disappeared a long time ago."                            |
|                                                                       |
| The astounded witness next managed to ask the being where he came     |
| from. He was told that they hailed from another dimension, a concept  |
| that humans have not yet assimilated. The humanoid smiled when he     |
| answered the question. The being then bid goodbye and walked towards  |
| the nearby shiny pear-shaped object; he then disappeared inside of    |
| it. Then the craft emitted a loud whisting sound and disappeared at   |
| very high speed towards some nearby cliffs. The witness described the |
| humanoids as about 2.5 meters in height, with wide chests and heavy   |
| set, thin legs, generally human features, but with somewhat "refined" |
| or sharpened features. Their suits were very tight fitting, and made  |
| of an apparent synthetic material resembling plastic. They eyes were  |
| very light, almost white, and their speed was hesitant and accented.  |
| Also, their movements seemed kind of clumsy. (Source: Albert S.       |

| 2004 - An object like a "dinner plate" with a dome on the bottom was  |
| sighted in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada at 4:22 a.m. It flew      |

| turned sharply south. They moved very fast. (Sources: (1) Geoff       |
