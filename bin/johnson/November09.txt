| 1953 - At 11:45 p.m. a large red, cigar-shaped or cylindrical object  |
| hovered in the sky over Omaha, Nebraska. Several satellite objects    |
| orbited around it. (Source: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers            |

| 1954 - Phillip Molava, age 13, living at an orphanage in Shirley,     |
| Surrey, England at the time, had been mysteriously losing baby        |
| rabbits from his locked rabbit hutch, so he was keeping watch on it   |
| by night. At around 1:00 a.m. he noticed a small, white,              |
| discus-shaped object floating toward him at about five mph. It had no |
| lights and no markings, and was only as big as a large plate. As it   |
| flew low over him, he jumped up trying to grab it, but could not      |
| quite reach it and it flew away. The next day, or perhaps a day       |
| later, he felt almost paralyzed all day, and was in the infirmary.    |
| That night, he was awaked in his bed when he saw a misty mass, as     |
| wide as the bed, form at the foot of the bed. It passed up the bed    |
| toward his head, “freezing” his body with cold as it passed. Then it  |
| stopped, and three figures materialized from the mist at the foot of  |
| his bed. They next moved up to him, two on one side, one on the       |
| other, and bent over him. He had the feeling they were going to help  |
| him, to “make me at ease with myself.” They were dressed in black, or |
| dark, robes, like the habits worn by monks, so he could not see their |
| faces, and could not describe their hands. He tried to speak to them, |
| but they did not answer. He had no memory of their departure. The     |
| next day he felt well again. The rabbits were shortly afterwards      |
| taken from him by the orphanage. (Sources: Janet & Colin Bord, FSR,   |

| 1954 - At 6:00 a.m. a 25 meter in diameter disc-shaped object tilted, |
| 50 meters over a field in Inchy, Nord department, France. It then     |
| rose vertically and vanished as the witnesses approached. (Source:    |

| 1954 - A nine meter long, bullet-shaped cigar hovered at 30 meters    |
| altitude over a farm in Froberville, Seine-Maritime department,       |
| France. Two observers ran beneath it. The object then made a          |
| whistling sound, brightened, and shot up into the sky. (Source:       |

| 1954 - At 12:30 a.m. a house in Damascus, Ohio was shaken by some     |
| outside force. Next, the witness looked out and observed a 30 meter   |
| long, glowing metallic ovoid object hovering over a nearby school.    |
| When a jet circled the area, the UFO vanished. (Sources: Walter       |

| 1956 - A long, narrow, fuselage-shaped object with a series of bright |
| orange lights was sighted by an airman flying over Destin, Florida at |

| 1957 - At 1:00 a.m. a civilian driving his car home from work in Lake |
| City, Missouri observed a hovering object 16 meters long. It had an   |
| elongated shape, and hovered 50 feet above the ground. His car engine |
| died as he neared the object's position. When the object left the     |
| performance of the engine returned to normal. (Source: Jacques        |

| 1957 - In Bedford, Indiana a UFO was seen by a Mr. Merry at 9:10 p.m. |
| His car stalled, and his head was covered with burns following the    |
| close encounter. On the same night just south of the same town a      |
| woman named Baxter also had her car stopped by a domed saucer, which  |
| rose from the ground, hovered, and then flew off over the hills.      |

| 1967 - Miss Dianne Marable and Mrs. Pearl Robins, nurses, were        |
| driving home to Tennessee Ridge and had reached Erin, Tennessee at    |
| 11:40 p.m. when they noticed a luminous object in the sky, which they |
| first mistook for the moon. It approached and landed 50 feet in front |
| of them, covering the entire highway. It was dome shaped, in part a   |
| fiery orange- yellow color, and in part ash black. Inside the object  |
| they could see five dark greenish creatures, four feet tall, "milling |
| about some type of machinery." After five minutes of watching it,     |
| they began to approach more closely but the object then swiftly rose  |
| up. It traveled a short distance beside their car, then it landed     |
| again in a field. The two women again tried to approach it by driving |
| up a gravel road when its lights when out. They could no longer see   |
| it, though they could see a bright red light in the sky. The young    |
| women then drove home, where they discovered they had experienced 30  |
| minutes of missing time. (Sources: Budd Hopkins, field investigation  |

| 1968 - A homemaker saw a large disc-shaped object hovering over the   |
| house in Lakeland, Florida. Several human-like figures could be seen  |
| through some lighted portholes. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1968      |

| 1968 - A couple in Lorain, Ohio was awakened at 5:45 a.m. by a loud   |
| thump on the roof of their trailer. The bump was followed by the      |
| sound of something moving near their bedroom window. When they looked |
| out the window, they saw a huge face staring down at them. The        |
| creature’s two front paws or hands were resting on the windowsill.    |
| The husband lept out of bed and frantically searched for his gun, but |
| by the time he located it the creature was gone from the window.      |
| Running on two legs, it dashed around the east side of the house,     |
| weaving from side to side, and crossed two streets                    |
| before disappearing into the woods. The creature stood about six-feet |
| tall. Its front side was grayish brown, and the rest of the body was  |
| a darker shade of the same color. According to the couple, it         |
| resembled “a large bipedal lion of around 600 pounds.” (Source:       |

| 1968 - At 11:30 p.m. in El Salto, Santiago, Chile two young sisters,  |
| Afrodit and Eugenia Lovazzano El-Far, 12 and 9 years of age           |
| respectively, were playing on a Sunday night in front of their home   |
| when they saw a large ball of fire approaching from the nearby        |
| mountains. It came suddenly to a stop in front of the girls. Afrodit  |
| saw it first as she was on her bicycle, and noticed the red light     |
| suddenly appear from behind the mountain, resembling a brilliant      |
| star. The red light seemed “gelatinous” in nature and soon changed to |
| a sphere with a greenish tint. Both girls could now clearly see what  |
| appeared to be a small “woman” inside the luminous sphere. The        |
| strange entity had a large mouth, which seemed to be moving           |
| constantly, apparently calling the girls; it also had a pair of large |
| pointed ears. Moments later, the small woman exited the sphere and    |
| approached Afrodit, who tried to run but was unable to move due to a  |
| strong “pulling” force. It pulled her by her blouse and suspended her |
| in midair. When Eugenia reached the kitchen door the force seemed to  |
| release Afrodit, who suffered from earaches, hoarseness, and what     |
| appeared to have been scratches on her waist area. It was later       |
| determined that a third girl, 12-year-old Monica Patricia Lagos also  |
| saw the bizarre incident, which she described as a ball of fire that  |
| floated around over the ground and then disappeared in a flash.       |

| 1969 - In one of a series of incidents involving Stella Lansing, she  |
| produced the following account by a 9-year-old of an encounter on     |
| this night from Palmer, Massachusetts. “We went riding in the car and |
| I saw lights. We flashed to it and it flashed back. We clapped the    |
| light on it and it began to come closer. We saw a black man about     |
| eight feet tall and I saw something like a wolf, but it was not a     |
| wolf. It had a strange body, two and a half feet long. It had three   |
| fingers and a face.” (Source: Berthold Schwarz, FSR, 19720105; David  |

| 1973 - A fleet of discs, 9-11 objects in a V-formation, flew over the |
| western shore of Mobile Bay, Alabama. They moved at a speed higher    |
| than the speed of normal conventional aircraft, and had a pale yellow |
| (or gold) transparency. There were three witnesses; the main witness  |
| was a 29 year old repeater. (Sources: Robert D. Boyd, A Comparative   |

| 1978 - During a spate of other close encounters in the area,          |
| including a car pacing, a 24-year-old taxi driver named Wright        |
| spotted a bizarre humanoid shape crossing Sugarloaf Road in Risdon    |
| Vale, Tasmania, Australia at 3:15 a.m. A green shape drifted out into |
| road, shaped like a four-foot tall triangle, 2.5 feet wide at its     |
| base. The taxi's radio abruptly quit, accompanied by a high-pitched   |
| squeaking noise. The shape was described as green in color about one  |
| and a half meters tall and 3/4 meters wide at the base, it tapered to |
| a narrow top. The shape drifted out into the road and at the same     |
| time the taxi radio emitted a high-pitched squeal as the driver broke |
| hard stopping only 5 meters from the shape. At five feet away the     |
| triangle figure vanished into thin air. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,      |

| interference. The UFO first rose up from the surface of the seea at a |
| 45 degree angle, flew straight at them for 250-300 meters. The light  |
| then shot up into the sky, and then zoomed off to the east. The UFO   |

| 1979 - On this evening Robert Taylor, a forestry worker, was walking  |
| his dog in Dechmont Law, Scotland when he came across a large ovoid   |
| or spherical object on tripod landing gear in a woodland clearing.    |
| This UFO dropped two 1.5 foot naval mine-shaped objects with          |
| protruding spikes, which floated up to him and attached to his        |
| trousers leg. They began to drag him towards the landed craft. This   |
| was accompanied by a suction noise and a pungent odor,and at this     |
| point he passed out and remained unconscious for the next 40 minutes. |
| He came to face down on the ground, and experienced a choking odor in |
| the air, a blinding headache, a burning sensation on his chin,        |
| itching on his left thigh, and he felt extremely weak. After a few    |
| minutes he managed to crawl to his pickup truck and drive home.       |
| Ground traces were found at the landing site. He suffered lasting     |
| physiological effects including headaches, itching, thirst, and       |
| general weakness. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, 19800701; Allan Hendry,    |

| 1991 - A strange looking, cube-shaped object was observed by airport  |
| personnel at Dyce Airport, Aberdeen, Scotland at 12:15 p.m. It        |
| was viewed through binoculars, and was definitely not a conventional  |
| aircraft. (Source: Ron Halliday, UFO Scotland: The Secret History of  |

| 1991 - A man was riding around on some back roads in Daviston,        |
| Alabama on this night when he saw a bright light in the trees about   |
| 150 yards away. He next saw the light come out of the trees and then  |
| noticed a round but flattened "cloud" that emerged behind the light.  |
| The cloud was following the bright light and they both flew over the  |
| witness and his vehicle. The light and cloud lit up the road around   |
| him, and the vehicle's engine then went completely dead. The next     |
| thing he remembers was traveling further down the same road and       |
| noticing a white ball and two clouds behind him. Upon reaching home   |
| his family noticed that he smelled like "burnt cinnamon." He also     |
| found reddish purple stains on his hands that he could not explain.   |
| His vehicle had two splotches, 4-5 inches long and wide, on the front |
| driver's side. He soon developed health problems a few weeks after    |
| the incident, and he noted that he had experienced a time loss.       |
| Later, under hypnosis, he recalled that the bright light had really   |
| been a saucer-shaped vehicle. He had attempted to grab his shotgun    |
| during the abduction, but was prevented by a four-foot tall Grey      |
| humanoid who took him onboard the object. Inside the craft his eyes   |
| were examined and apparently an implant was removed from behind one   |
| of them. The being who was smaller and brown in color performed the   |
| surgery. Following that he was taken to an upper floor inside the     |
| craft, and there he encountered humans in military style coveralls.   |
| One was apparently a flag rank officer. There he lost                 |
| consciousness while he was being examined again. On waking up, he     |
| found himself being helped by an athletic looking young soldier with  |
| short cropped hair. The next thing he remembers was being escorted    |
| back to his vehicle by the Grey alien. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,    |

| 1992 -  Mrs. Melitta Walter was sitting in her living room in         |
| Magdeburg, Germany at 8:30 p.m. when she heard a very deep humming    |
| sound coming from outside her house. When she looked out the window   |
| she observed a bright shining, flat cylindrical craft slowly flying   |
| over the roof. It was only about 50 meters away and at about 20       |
| meters altitude. The witness could see several man-like occupants     |
| moving behind a large, wide illuminated window. She described the     |
| object as a flat cylinder with position lights on the left, right     |
| and back. Within a minute the object vanished behind the wall of her  |
| house. (Source: Illobrand von Ludwiger, Best UFO Cases - Europe, p.   |

| 1995 - At 7:00 p.m. Ada Arroyo, director of a local nursing home in   |
| Caguas, Puerto Rico, heard a scream similar to those made by a lamb   |
| being slaughtered, coming from outside. She went outside on the patio |
| and saw a strange hairy figure, grayish in color, covering its body   |
| with a pair of wings. It had a flattened, vulpine face, with enormous |
| red eyes. The creature held her gaze with its mesmerizing eyes before |
| taking off into the air, quickly vanishing from sight. (Sources:      |

| 1996 - Alessandro Boscolo and two friends were driving home near      |
| Isola Verde, Italy when Boscolo stopped his vehicle to relieve        |
| himself. He soon noticed that the whole area around him was           |
| completely illuminated, as if the full Moon was overhead. Having got  |
| back into the vehicle with his two friends, they saw that the light   |
| was coming from a very bright source in a nearby field, and they next |
| noticed movement coming from some nearby trees. Suddenly, three to    |
| four short Grey beings, with large oval-shaped heads, scampered with  |
| amazing speed towards the light source on the field. Frightened,      |
| Boscolo and his friends drove away from the scene at high speed.      |

| 2002 -  A family in Arkansas City, Kansas observed an immense         |
| boomerang-shaped craft at 9:30 p.m. It was silent, lightless, with a  |
| shape that blocked out the stars behind it as it flew by. They later  |
| saw the same object flying to the southeast, directly over their      |
| house. Their dogs barked frantically during the fly-over. (Source:    |

| 2005 - A diamond-shaped craft was seen over Sleights, North           |

| 2006 - At 4:30 p.m. a witness in Kosse, Limestone County, Texas       |
