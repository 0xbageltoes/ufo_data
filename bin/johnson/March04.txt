| 1952 - On this date in 1952, at 1:35 a.m. over the Sea of Japan, a bright    |
| orange, 75-foot long ovoid object passed by a US Army C-54 at a very  |
| high rate of speed. Project Blue Book explained it as a meteor.       |

| 1956 - In 1956 a 3-meter long metallic blimp with 3 or more windows was      |
| sighted in La Guaira, Venezuela at about 10 o'clock in the morning.   |
| It flew over the hills silently and slowly. (Source: APRO Bulletin).  |
|                                                                       |
| 1960 - Pilot Charles Morris filmed three silver discs with his motion |
| picture camera, flying over Dubuque, Iowa at 5:57 p.m. The Air Force  |
| claimed that no unusual objects appear on any of the frames. (Source: |
| Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence (Volume I), p. 40).                    |

| 1965 - At 6:30 p.m. a farmer and his hired hand in Corvallis, Oregon  |
| saw from their car three yellowish-orange spheres rising fast into    |
| the sky from a nearby field. They rose from the ground in sequence,   |
| several seconds apart. The next day three oily spots were found at    |
| the site. Project Blue Book lists this case as an "unknown."          |
| (Sources: US Air Force Project Blue Book files counted in official    |
| statistics, case 9301; Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century |
| of Landings, case # 639; Don Berliner, Australasian Ufologist, April  |
| 1999, p. 52).                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - Just before midnight the Sodestrom family observed two         |
| plate-shaped objects, one 30 meters in diameter, the other smaller    |
| and gray in color, in Vilhelmina, Sweden. They hovered at close range |
| for 15 minutes. The objects left with a hushed whistling sound,       |
| illuminating the forest with intense light. (Source: Jacques Vallee,  |
| Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 822).                |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - After midnight in Centre Sandwich, New Hampshire a clam-shaped |
| UFO followed a car at a low level for several minutes. A dog in the   |
| car at the time was highly agitated, and its hair bristled in         |
| reaction to the close approach of the UFO. Approximately two hours    |
| later in Vicco, Kentucky another UFO shaped like half an eggshell cut |
| lengthwise, hovered and maneuvered at a low level. A smaller object   |
| emerged from the underside of the object and flew away. The UFO       |
| varied in color from brown to red to orange to white. (Sources:       |
| Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A Thirty Year Report, p.   |
| 279; NICAP case files).                                               |

| 1968 - Several close encounter reports were recorded for this date. A |
| photograph of a UFO was taken in Tully, Queensland, Australia. At     |
| 2:00 a.m. a series of large luminous globes circled and swayed over   |
| the Ohio River for two hours near Ravenswood, West Virginia. At 6:00  |
| p.m. a magnetic UFO detector went off when a UFO passed over in Carol |
| Stream, Illinois. At 6:15 p.m. a cigar-shaped object approached a car |
| in West Seneca, New York from the left, then went over the road in    |
| front of the car. The object was 50-60 feet long with blinking        |
| lights.The witness tried to drive away but the car wouldn't respond   |
| to the accelerator. As the UFO came quite near, the witness could     |
| only see a bright yellow light. The driver of the car felt sluggish   |
| and immobilized until the UFO went away. The object disappeared       |
| instantly. (Sources: (1) FSR, May 1969, p. 3; (2) John Keel,          |

| 1968 - At 8:15 p.m. two young men saw a UFO hover over a car ahead of |
| them near Cochrane, Wisconsin. Its headlights suddenly went out. The  |
| object appeared metallic and glowed orange while standing still, but  |
| glowed redder and brighter when it was moving. The object then        |
| approached their car and their car's engine conked out. It hovered    |
| overhead for a moment, during which time the witnesses felt increased |
| heat and "weightless." The object left over a nearby field, emitting  |
| a cloudy haze all around its periphery. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO  |

| 1968 - In Lapoint, Utah a 20-foot in diameter round UFO was spotted   |
| on the ground at 7:30 p.m. The witness watched if for half an hour,   |
| when its light suddenly went out. (Source: Frank Salisbury, The Utah  |

| 1968 - Ricardo Castillo Trujillo, a janitor, saw a long, very bright  |
| UFO at 1:45 a.m. making a noise like an electric motor. It landed in  |
| an isolated section of Valparaiso, Chile and two crew members         |
| emerged. They were dressed in aluminum colored uniforms. Although he  |
| could tell they were light-skinned, he could not make out any facial  |
| details. Speaking in strange echo-like voices, they asked him about   |
| his nearsightedness, promising him that the condition would be cured. |
| "I didn't understand them too good," he said, "but the fact is that I |
| can see real good now, and without glasses." The humanoids promised   |
| to return for the witness. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,  |

| 1969 - In 1969 on this date the Canadian Parliament Buildings in Ottawa,     |
| Ontario were buzzed by a mysterious red light or craft, and reported  |
| by a number of RCMP officers at 7:45 p.m. Earlier that day at 6:40    |
| a.m., on a highway 4 miles west of Atlanta, Missouri a truck's engine |
| stalled and the CB radio failed to work when a 100' wide UFO hovered  |
| 50 feet above the highway and directed a strong beam of light onto    |
| the road. The driver felt a strong heat sensation coming from the     |
| object and described the light as brilliant. (Sources: (1) John       |

| 1974 - At 5:40 a.m. six police officers were confronted by a          |
| massively large dark humanoid figure or silhouette while they were    |
| investigating noises coming from a parking lot in Montmorency,        |
| France. It stood at the edge of the lot. When the officers            |
| approached, the figure disappeared quickly into a nearby acacia       |
| grove. No traces were found. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid     |
| Contact Database 1974, citing Denys Breysse, Project Becassine).      |

| 1977 - Three UFO reports are recorded on this day in 1977 from Great         |
| Britain. At 8:00 p.m. an elliptical UFO changed color from white to   |
| red to green in Oxenden, England. It moved slowly and silently in the |
| sky at an estimated altitude of 500 feet. Forty-five minutes later a  |
| cigar-shaped UFO w triangular fins on its upper and lower margins was |
| sighted at Blackpool, England. At 10:00 p.m. in Lytham St James, a    |
| 9-year-old girl watched a 3-pointed object hover, spin, and change    |
| directions abruptly. The triangular craft had a yellow light at each  |
| corner and three red lights clustered underneath, and pulsated.       |

| 1982 - In 1982 at 10:30 p.m. a car on the A65 highway in Hellifield, England |
| was surrounded by blue lights and levitated up into the air. The      |
| woman driver felt a strong sensation of cold, and experienced 30      |
| minutes of missing time. (Source: Paul Devereax, Earth Lights         |

| 1988 - In 1988 a well-reported, well-investigated case occurred for over an  |
| hour off the shore of Lake Erie near Eastlake, Ohio. At 8:35 p.m. a   |
| very large illuminated ellipse or cigar-shaped object with smaller    |
| satellite objects hovered over, then landed on the ice on Lake Erie,  |
| not far from a nuclear power plant. Among the many witnesses included |
| personnel from the local US Coast Guard station. (Source: MUFON UFO   |
| Journal, January 1989).                                               |

| 1990 - At 10:10 p.m. in 1990 two people in a car driving in New Albany,      |
| Indiana watched a huge, manta ray shaped UFO fly overhead at 150 mph. |
| It had rectangular panels on the underside. One hour and twenty       |
| minutes later fishermen off the shore of Provincetown, Massachusetts  |
| observed several objects and one large craft ascend vertically into   |
| the sky until gone from their sight. (Sources: MUFON Investigation    |
| files; Paul Ferrughelli, Computer Catalogue of UFO Reports, 1988-94). |
|                                                                       |
| 1992 - In Perth, Western Australia in 1992 a woman was jolted awake at 2:30  |
| a.m. by a bright blue, glaring light. Through the glare she was able  |
| to see a four-foot tall being guiding her son down the hallway.       |
| Paralyzed at first, when the being was out of sight she found that    |
| she could move again. She ran and grabbed her son, at which point the |
| figure vanished in a flash of white light. (Source: Albert Rosales,   |
| Humanoid Contact Database, case #2663).                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1993 - In 1993 a UFO hovered over Shanghai, China in the night sky. It       |
| appeared to change shape as it hovered, then shrink in size until it  |
| vanished. (Source: UFO Newsclipping Service, March 1993). Three other |
| unexplained UFO reports occurred on this date. At 12:45 a.m. a        |
| 35-year-old woman driving on US highway 23 north of Delaware, Ohio    |
| slowed for a lighted object, just off the highway at 50 feet          |
| altitude. When she stopped her car the UFO came down to 15 feet above |
| the ground, then its lights went out and the object either went away  |
| very fast or just vanished. At 11:45 a.m. a large ball-of-light       |
| buzzed a police helicopter and released three smaller fireballs east  |
| of Lynview, Kentucky. Finally, a UFO case rated as a high-reliability |
| unknown was recorded as occurring at 11:45 p.m. at Wilson Point, New  |
| Brunswick by the Canadian UFO Survey. (Sources: Franklin Reams, MUFON |
| Ohio investigation files; UFO Newsclipping Service, March 1993; 1993  |
