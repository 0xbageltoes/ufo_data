| was driving on Route N138 at 6:20 a.m. when he saw an intense, blue   |

| 1954 - Plozevet, France. Early in the day the crew of several fishing |
| boats at sea saw a luminous, orange-colored object over the coast,    |
| apparently surrounded by dense smoke. Villagers in Plozevet saw the   |
| same object and stated independently that it came within 10 meters of |
| the ground, then flew away to the southeast. (Sources: France-Soir,   |

| 1954 - Two red mushroom-shaped objects, six feet in diameter, landed  |
| this morning in Mendionde, France. Two little men, 2.5 feet tall      |
| stood beside it, speaking an unknown language and gesticulating to    |
| the witness to come closer. However, when he did they shut the door   |
| in his face, and the UFO took off straight up. The grass at the site  |
| was crushed and turned yellow. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted         |

| 1954 - Jettingen, France. A railroad employee, Rene Ott, saw a        |
| mushroom-shaped object three meters in diameter, in a field three     |
| meters away from Route N16 and one meter above the ground. A luminous |
| rectangle, like a door, was seen on the side. It took off and flew    |
| about five meters over the head of the witness, following him to the  |
| next village. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight  |

| 1954 - Marcel Guyot was coming home from work at 7:30 p.m. near the   |
| village of St.-Etienne-sous-Barbuise, France, and his son Jacques     |

| the ground at a railroad crossing that gave off a bright white light. |
| One was circular, the other two were cigar-shaped. (Sources: Aime     |

| 1959 - Eastern Airlines flight 541, flying over Virginia at 3:10      |
| a.m., was paced by a cigar-shaped object for ten minutes. The craft   |
| had illuminated portholes. At approximately the same time (8:00 p.m.  |
| New Zealand time) a large white, domed shaped mass flew quickly       |
| toward the west over Fairlie, New Zealand, and was gone from sight    |
| behind some hills. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, cases   |
| 5835 & 5836).                                                         |

| in the rear portion followed a C-119 "flying boxcar" transport plane  |
| over Waltham, Massachusetts. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:        |

| 1968 - A cigar-shaped object flew rapidly to the south over Lagoa     |
| Rodrigo, Brazil at 9:20 a.m. A jet aircraft attempted to follow it,   |
| but the UFO was much faster. On this same day a 42-foot diameter      |
| circle was found in Ngatea, New Zealand. The circle was somewhat      |
| radioactive and the plants inside the circle were bone-dry as if      |
| completely dehydrated. (Source: Irene Granchi, UFO Abductions and     |
| Reports from Brazil, p. 74; Data-Net Report, January 1970, p. 11).    |

| 1974 - In the predawn hours on this day in Plant City, Florida a      |
| motorcyclist had his engine and all its electrical system die. He had |
| been traveling at 70 mph when suddenly there appeared a UFO right     |
| behind him, moving at the same speed. After the ignition system       |
| failure he coasted to the roadside and the UFO shot off toward the    |
| northeast. (Source: Tampa (FL) Neighbor, October 16, 1974).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1974 - After being summoned telepathically to a remote desert spot    |
| near Chilca, Peru the witness saw a luminous, disc-shaped object land |
| this night. It touched down nearby on four legs like protrusions. A   |
| door opened and a very tall blond man wearing a silvery outfit came   |
| out. The being communicated via telepathy with the witness. (Source:  |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1974, case #282, citing  |
| Lisa Rome, UFO Universe, June-July 1991).                             |

| 1975 - Robert Suffern of Three Mile Lake reported that a UFO landed   |
| about 13 miles northwest of Bracebridge, Ontario on this night, and   |
| he almost ran over one of its occupants with his car. Mr. Suffern     |
| said the craft was about 12-14 feet across, nine feet high, and       |
| circular in shape. "There was a black strip running around the        |
| circumference, and what looked to be a small platform at the bottom   |
| of the vehicle." Mr. Suffern said he found the craft while driving    |
| around to investigate "a glow in the sky" seen by his sister, and who |
| telephoned him to say she thought his barn might be on fire.          |
| The UFO was parked on a road that led to the lake. A few seconds      |
| after he saw it, the ship lifted straight up from the road in front   |
| of his car. "There was no dust raised, no apparent thrust, nothing,"  |
| he said. "It went straight up and over the trees."                    |
|                                                                       |
| Mr. Suffern turned his car around and headed home. However, when he   |
| reached the top of the hill, he had to slam on his brakes to avoid    |
| hitting "some sort of creature." The being was the height of the car  |
| fender. It was humanoid in appearance and wore a globe-shaped helmet, |
| and walked like a midget. The helmet was slightly lighter in color    |
| and the "spacesuit" was like tin foil that had been crushed and       |
| flattened out. The creature turned, took three or four steps, vaulted |
| over a fence, and disappeared. Suffern raced back to his house and    |
| arrived in time to see the object hover near his home before crossing |
| the lake. He was badly shaken by the incident. "It's all right to     |
| think what you would do…but when it actually happens, you are scared  |
| because you are dealing with the unknown." (Source: Bob Gribble,      |
| "Looking Back October 1975", National UFO Reporting Center website).  |

| 1977 - Nine disc-shaped UFOs circled a Soviet Navy submarine tender   |
| on this day. The radio, electronics, and on-board communications were |
| all disrupted. (Source: Jacques Vallee, UFO Chronicles of the Soviet  |
| Union: A cosmic Samizdat, p. 29).                                     |

| 1979 - Four 15-year-old youngsters were playing in a field in Heiloo, |
| Netherlands at around seven p.m. when they encountered several        |
| strange luminous flashes and lights around them. They soon saw what   |
| appeared to be a luminous "mass" behind some nearby bushes. One of    |
| them approached and was confronted by a tall humanoid with a large    |
| human-like face. The being had white hair and large, red,             |
| almond-shaped protruding eyes. The figure wore a shiny white robe.    |
| One of the other boys then approached on a bicycle and saw three      |
| other similar figures standing immobile about 50 meters away.         |
| Apparently a total of seven humanoids were encountered at one time or |
| another for the next hour. They seemed to be able to move around from |
| one place to another in an instant. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,       |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1979, case # 1487, citing Hans Van Kampen). |
