| 1944 - At a few minutes after midnight a bright reddish-orange,       |
| pulsing, maneuvering ball of light paced a U.S. Army Air Force B-29   |
| bomber over the ocean between Palembang, Indonesia and Ceylon (Sri    |
| Lanka) at a location about 100 miles northwest of Palembang off the   |
| island of Sumatra. There were three witnesses on board the aircraft.  |
| The sighting lasted less than eight minutes. (Sources: Richard Hall,  |

| 1954 - At 9:30 p.m. 13-year-old Gabriel Coupal and his younger        |
| siblings said they saw a brightly lighted object follow them to their |
| farm in Hemmingford, Quebec, Canada. It landed and a figure wearing a |
| black diver suit and with round eyes exited, and appeared to engage   |
| in some repair activity. Mr. Coupal and his oldest son went to the    |
| field where the children had been playing and saw an orange object    |
| rise from the ground and speed off to the west. The grass was         |
| flattened down over a 15-meter area, with two tracks about five       |
| meters long. (Sources: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers Uncensored, p.  |

| bronze disc flew over the shore of Baniara, Milne Bay, Papua New      |
| Guinea at 3:50 a.m. local time. About twelve hours later that same    |

| maneuvered, and then sped head-on toward a truck windscreen in        |
| Warminster, Wiltshire, England. The driver swerved in order to avoid  |
| a collision. Later than day a private pilot attorney saw two discs    |
| flying below the clouds near Nashville, Tennessee on this day. They   |
| accelerated and sped away. At 8 p.m. an aerospace engineer in         |
| Seattle, Washington watched as two silver discs hovered, then shot up |
| out of sight. (Sources: (1) Arthur Shuttlewood, The Warminister       |

| 1970 - On this evening Titus Lamson saw a rainbow colored UFO moving  |
| over the village of Hotaville, New Mexico. It had "a dome, a round    |
| thing, and an aerial" on top. It was lit up and became translucent,   |
| so that he could see a man inside the dome wearing a gray uniform.    |
| The UFO then disappeared over a ridge. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted |

| 1973 - On this afternoon four grade-school students and a police      |
| officer in Ibague, Colombia saw four small, human-like beings,        |
| dressed in white uniforms, beneath a bridge. The beings were only 20  |
| centimeters tall and disappeared when the witnesses approached.       |
| Traces were left in the mud and later photographed. (Sources: David   |

| 1975 - In Gilroy, Santa Clara County, California four witnesses,      |
| including a 19-year-old woman, saw a 40 foot long, hazy blue metallic |
| ovoid with tripod landing gear hovering in the clear night sky        |
| shortly after 11:00 p.m. It made a humming sound.  The sighting       |
| lasted 10 minutes. (Sources: Paul Cerny, Skylook, September 1975,     |

| 1976 - Sr. Francisco Tejero, age 44, his wife Teresa Lacave, and      |
| their friends Jose Valles and wife Pilar Osborne Domecq were on       |
| holiday at the Hotel Da Balaia in Albufeira, Algarve, Portugal and    |
| had gone into the hotel bar for something to eat at around 5:00 p.m.  |
| They saw two men and a woman there who were engaged in a discussion,  |
| but at the same time seemed to be watching the witness’s party most   |
| intently. The two men were short in stature, “with European features  |
| but very dark.” They seemed to be between 40 and 50 years old, yet    |
| their hair was far too white in color for being middle aged. Suddenly |
| two strange flashes of light came from the direction of this          |
| mysterious trio, like the flashbulbs of a camera, and although they   |
| observed no camera, the two Spanish couples had the strong impression |
| that someone had just photographed them, perhaps with the aid of a    |
| minature, concealed camera. What's more, the two couples began to     |
| feel an indescribable malaise, so they quickly finished their drinks  |
| and left the bar to go have dinner. Later that night Teresa awoke     |
| with a start, and to her great astonishment she observed that on the  |
| curtains of the hotel window (which was open on this hot night) there |
| was a very vivid luminous rectangle, “like a TV screen.” She          |
| immediately thought of the strange “spies” in the bar, and her next   |
| thought was that maybe they had entered the bedroom and were going to |
| rob them or do them some kind of mischief. She turned and shook her   |
| husband vigorously. Her husband jumped out of bed and went to the     |
| window. In his account he said: “It was as though I was in some sort  |
| of trance, as if I had been hypnotized by someone. Outside, all was   |
| utterly, infinitely peaceful.” He was moving around like an           |
| automaton. He looked out the window and saw a rectangular thing, with |
| six reddish lights on it, resting on another wing of the hotel which  |
| made an angle with the main face on which their window lay. All was   |
| dark underneath the “thing”, and nothing else was to be seen. He      |
| remained there motionless for awhile, gazing at the structure or      |
| “attic” with a sense of irritation because one of the lights was      |
| directed right into their bedroom. He then turned around and went     |
| back to sleep. In the morning they were astonished to find out that   |
| there was no other wing of the hotel running out at an angle. There   |
| was no building, or structure of any kind whatsoever. There was       |
| simply no “attic.” Their rooms were on the top floor of the hotel.    |

| 1977 - A man named Bogea was chased by a delta-shaped flying object   |
| through the forest in Pinheiro, Maranhao State, Brazil in the early   |

| for hours. When he was returned in was located far from his original  |

| 1978 - A mushroom-shaped object was sighted at close range over a     |
| military base in General Belgrano, Santa Fe Province, Argentina on    |
| this night. The object was several meters in diameter, and had an     |
| array of flashing lights around its rim. It flew at a low altitude,   |
| and hovered for 10 minutes. (Source: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping    |

| 1981 - Russell Matson and another man were driving down a road in     |
| Apple Valley, Minnesota at 3:30 a.m. when they sighted a hexagonal    |
| object nearly overhead, at perhaps a distance of 500 feet. It had two |
| green, two red, and white lights on its corners. It was estimated to  |
| be between 60 and 90 feet across. The object pivoted, making a 90     |
| degree turn while stationary, then descended and approached the       |
| witnesses. It made a soft "whoosh" sound as the object passed, like   |
| gas escaping from a propane tank. (Sources: Northfield News, August   |

| 1982 - At 10:30 p.m. a married couple and their son were driving home |
| to Kent, Washington and were near Lake Sawyer when they noticed an    |
| illuminated object above the tree line, projecting a beam of light    |
| into the sky which moved back and forth like a searchlight. The       |
| object had four red body lights. When they stopped at a stop sign,    |
| they saw that the searchlight beam had disappeared and a new light    |
| beam had begun rotating in a downward direction. Moreoever, the UFO   |
| appeared to be moving in their direction. As they turned a corner, a  |
| bright beam of light shone down into their car "bathing the driver in |
| red light." The light and object then disappeared. (Source: Donald A. |

| 1983 - Two witnessed a domed disc-shaped object at low altitude       |

| 1986 - At 9:45 p.m. in Manteca, Contra Costa County, California a     |
| large disc-shaped object flew fast and silently from the southeast to |
| the northwest. A second disc was seen at 11:15 p.m., which  made      |
| a 90-degree turn straight up into the sky. (Source: Robert Gribble,   |

| 1989 - On this afternoon in the Kirov region of Russia a large hairy  |
| humanoid with long arms and small feet “scared the daylights” out of  |
| the local veterinarian, P. Saitov, as he was out walking with his     |
| children and a friend. “It was making huge jumps--not at all like a   |
| human being”, he said. Saitov and his companions rushed back to their |
| car and followed the creature for about a kilometer until it          |
| disappeared into some undergrowth. He described it as about two       |
| meters tall, with its body covered with dark brown hair, and it had   |
| shoulder length hair. Being a veterinary surgeon, he was able to      |
| determine that the creature was neither human nor an anthropoid ape.  |

| meter pace (Source: Mike Dash, Fortean Times, issue #53, citing       |

| 1989 - Mrs. Rayna was alone at home in Sedona, Arizona and taking an  |
| afternoon nap when she heard a loud cracking sound that woke her. She |
| felt paralyzed and a strong tingling sensation came over her entire   |
| body. She then noticed a small being standing at the head of her bed. |
| The being was 3.5 feet tall, whitish-gray in color, and wore a        |
| form-fitting jumpsuit. It had a large head, and large dark eyes. The  |
| being communicated with a second, unseen entity, using an             |
| unintelligible language with a digital, musical quality. The being    |
| suddenly vanished and she was able to move again. Her muscles were    |
| sore and she felt nauseous afterwards. (Source: Richard J. Boylan,    |

| 1989 - A Dutch psychologist vacationing in Spain videotaped an object |
| that changed shaped and divided into two parts. Dr. William Heijster, |
| a Dutch military psychologist, was vacationing in Spain with his      |
| family. At about 9:00 p.m. while driving southwest along the eastern  |
| coastal highway near Estepona, Spain, the family noticed an object    |
| northwest of them in the late evening sky. They stopped to watch, and |
| Dr. Heijster filmed it on and off for a period of about one hour,     |
| using a handheld camcorder.                                           |

| The object appeared to be rotating at high speed. The rotation was    |
| not visible on the film, however; instead, the object appeared to     |
| undergo a slow shape change, from looking like a "coolie hat" to      |
| circular. The upper surface was bright, while the lower surface was   |
| shadowed. The object hovered in one place. After about an hour the    |
| object split into two parts, which then separated and faded from      |
| view. Only part of the disappearance was recorded on the videotape.   |
| Palm fronds are visible in the foreground. There were reported to be  |
| several other witnesses.                                              |

| Dr. Heijster contacted the Fund for UFO Research and made a copy of   |
| the film available for analysis. The UFO image measures about 3.3 cm  |
| on the film, and it appears for 3 minutes and 53 seconds.             |
| Calculations of the object's size at various distances are: at 300    |
| meters the diameter would be 4 meters, at one mile it would be 21     |
| meters, and at 9,000 meters it would have been 120 meters in          |
| diameter. Although one hypothesis is that the image is that of a      |
| research balloon, the size seems excessive for a high-altitude        |
| balloon. (Source: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A     |

| 1989 - A man was walking near a housing project in Hartshead Moor,    |
| West Yorkshire, England at 9:15 p.m. when he suddenly had the         |
| impression that someone was watching him. In the dark he noticed a    |
| huge, eight-foot-tall figure with bright slanted eyes. The being      |
| appeared to be wearing a large pointed helmet and flared trousers     |
| with “something” pointing down between the legs. The creature’s eyes  |
| suddenly became red, frightening the witness. A second, green-colored |
| entity now appeared and was asked by the tall entity “Shall we get    |
| him”? The second entity replied in the negative. The green colored    |
| entity had black slanting eyes, a peanut shaped, helmeted head, and   |
| wore brown colored clothing. The man ran from the area. (Source:      |

| 1989 - A 20-year-old woman in Gulf Breeze, Florida saw two rows of    |
| six to eight round white lights in the sky at 10:40 p.m., as bright   |
| as stadium lights, that formed a rectangle twice the size of a Boeing |
| 747. The object moved very slowly from the west to the east, and      |
| descended to about an estimated 30 feet altitude before it            |
| disappeared. It made no sound, and the encounter lasted about half a  |
| minute. (Source: Carol & Rex Salisberry, MUFON Field Investigation    |

| 1992 - At 8:26 p.m. in Lansing, Michigan six observers, including the |
| main witness who was a 25-year-old woman, sighted a black 30 foot in  |
| diameter disc-shaped object, with two orbs on top, looking something  |
| like a Mickey Mouse cap, over a parking lot. There was also CB        |
| radio interference experienced. The sighting lasted 18 minutes.       |

| 1993 - In Norman, Oklahoma at 2:11 a.m. an animal reaction case       |
| occurred. Dogs barked as a huge, fat, battleship gray UFO passed near |
| the four witness's car. The object had two square patches of          |
| blue-gray fluorescent light in formation off it's diagonal corners. A |
| red dot of light with radial rays appeared between the square         |
| patches. (Sources: Seifried Richard D. Seifried,MUFON Field           |

| 1993 - On this evening Leah Haley was in the back room of an old      |
| house in Pensacola, Florida, talking with a male friend when suddenly |
| a force lifted her up towards the ceiling. Her friend tried to grab   |
| her but could not reach her in time. The higher she went the dizzier  |
| she became. Through some sort of white mist she saw her friend moving |
| about, as if in a trance. Moments later she was onboard a craft       |
| looking out a porthole. Her next memory found herself standing in a   |
| field, where a short stocky woman was apparently performing magic     |
| tricks in front of several other people. The witness was standing in  |
| the middle of the field, in front of a table that contained clothing. |
| A female "alien" with short brown hair, wearing a red-gold black      |
| trimmed blouse, was standing next to her. Another similar female      |
| stood on her right side. She asked one of the females where they was  |
| from, and her reply was "The Pleiades." She was told that they had    |
| bases on earth. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database |

| 1994 - (1) At 12:30 a.m. a witness observed for a few seconds a       |
| small luminous sphere that moved very quickly in the sky over         |
| Castanet Tolosan, Haute-Garonne Department, France. It made no noise, |
| and no trail accompanied it. (2) At 4:30 a.m. at Antibes,             |
| Alpes-Maritime Department, France three luminous balls stopped over   |
| the ocean, then vanished. Their apparent size was 1 cm at arms        |

| 1998 - "Cobwebs" fell from the clear blue sky while silver spheres    |
| performed aerobactic maneuvers and made right angle turns over        |
| Quirindi, New South Wales, Australia on this afternoon. The "angel    |

| 2000 - At 12:10 a.m. Scott Jarvie was walking home in Falkirk,        |
| Scotland after visiting his girlfriend when he suddenly became drowsy |
| and very sleepy. His next conscious memory was suddenly               |
| finding himself inside a very bright place, but someone "dark" at the |
| same time; it was hard to describe. Inside the enclosure he briefly   |
| met a short humanoid, with sunken green eyes, sandy colored skin, and |
| no mouth. It had short stubby fingers on one hand. A most             |
| unusual feature of the creature was that it had a hole where the neck |
| area joined the spine. Jarvie has no other memories. (Source: Albert  |
