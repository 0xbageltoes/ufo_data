| 1954 - North Bay, Ontario. At 5:25 a.m. Sgt. Durdle of the R.C.A.F.   |
| saw a brilliant, circular object fly across Lake Nipissing toward the |
| Royal Canadian Air Force base. An oblong canister was hung down from  |
| the central section, which supported a long cone with a spinning      |
| globe on top. When the object tilted he was able to see               |
| regulator-looking devices inside the machine through a vertical       |
| lighted slit. Six brilliant appendages that looked like necklaces     |
| hung from the craft. Sgt. Durdle woke up four other Air Force men,    |
| who observed the object spiraling away. (Sources: Harold Wilkins,     |

| 1962 - At 11:00 p.m. three men walking down a street in Itapirito,    |
| Minas Gerais State, Brazil saw a domed disc-shaped object 150 feet    |
| away. It was aluminum colored and ten feet in diameter. A little man  |
| or robot was next seen walking toward them. He was one meter tall,    |
| had a small head and short arms, and looked like the "Michelin" tire  |
| man. His upper body was luminous. After the being had walked to with  |
| 30 feet it vanished before their eyes. Two of the witnesses ran, one  |
| stayed behind; the UFO took off but came back and the third witness   |
| suffered from temporay paralysis. He reportedly suffered from         |
| headaches for the next month. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, |

| 1964 - At around 10 p.m. a man and a woman driving between Tipton and |
| Bennett, Iowa sighted an eighty-foot long cigar-shaped object         |
| that hovered at 500 feet altitude. When it climbed, their car radio   |

| 1965 - On this night two people driving on the Pan-American Highway   |
| near near Arequipa, Peru saw “a strange being, a Martian, who         |
| resembled a shrub,” who was only 31 inches tall, and had one golden   |
| colored eye in its head, but also had “other smaller eyes located     |
| along its body.” A few seconds later, they saw a flying saucer pass   |
| overhead. (Sources: Gordon Creighton, The Humanoids: FSR Special      |

| 1967  - Two newspaper delivery cyclists, Jones and Hollander, had     |
| come to a bridge in Crewe, Cheshire, England at 8:30 a.m. when they   |
| saw a hovering domed disc-shaped UFO. It had a transparent dome with  |
| an antenna, an elliptical body, and an undercarriage with three dark  |
| circles and many wires or tubes that were evident. A very well        |
| documented report.At 8:55 p.m. two witnesses in a residential         |
| neighborhood at Shrewbridge Crescent in Nantwich, Cheshire, England   |
| viewed in the sky what they described as a yellow elongated rugby     |
| ball with a dome through binoculars. It was as bright as the full     |
| moon, and estimated to be half a mile away, at 25 degrees elevation.  |
| It flew in an arc, hovered, and then went in front of a dark cloud,   |
| behind another low cloud. It made a sound like a turbojet.  A shiny   |
| white cigar-shaped object was seen by five witnesses in Sandbach,     |
| Cheshire, England at 9:00 p.m. It was brighter than the moon and had  |
| blurry edges, but appeared to be solid. It flew from south to         |
| northwest low in the sky, and went in front of a black cloud. It was  |
| viewed for 30 seconds and made no sound. (Source: Roger H. Stanway &  |

| 1970 - At 11:30 a.m. a seven-year-old girl in Vincennes, Indiana saw  |
| a metallic disc in the east-northeastern sky hovering over Wheatland  |
| Road and reported it to her parents. Her father went outside and also |
| saw the object. He re-entered the house to get his 7x50 binoculars,   |
| and when he emerged the object had moved closer. He described it as   |
| about a quarter of a mile away, looking like "a garbage can lid with  |
| a piece of watermelon on top" (more like a squared-off "coning        |
| tower") and about 30 feet in diameter. The man believes that          |
| others should have seen it, too, because it was so low. He, his wife, |
| and daughter observed it for a minute and a half before it left in a  |
| swooping dive to the north-northeast. (Sources: Francis Ridge,        |

| 1970 - On this date at 9:30 p.m. a shooting incident occurred in      |
| Itatainia, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil involving a patrol guard and a      |
| rectangular UFO, resulting in lasting physiological effects. The      |
| guard, 31-year-old Almiro de Freitas, was on guard duty at the Do     |
| Funil hydroelectric dam when he encountereda one meter long           |
| rectangular object with elliptical portholes at close range.          |
| Panicked, he shot several times at the UFO. He was blinded and        |
| paralyzed when struck by a beam of energy from the object. He was     |
| overcome by heat and a prickling sensation, and went blind. He did    |
| make a slow recovery. (Sources: O Globo, September 16, 1970; FSR,     |

| 1971 - In Southampton, England at 6:10 a.m. a man named R. Seaman     |
| sighted an object that first appeared as a halo, then narrowed into   |
| an ellipse. It tilted to the right, at which point the witness saw    |
| two bright points of light on its lower right edge. It sped away and  |
| was lost to view went it passed the morning Sun. (Source: BUFORA      |

| 1977 - At midnight two college students, Rocco Cerullo and Michael    |
| Giovanelli, were walking from Sturno, Avelino, Italy to Frigento when |
| they saw three red lights symmetrically arranged in the midst of some |
| shrubbery overhanging the road. They also heard an intermittent       |
| "beep-beep" sound. Continuing on foot to a nearby quarry, they saw a  |
| figure over two meters tall, wearing a silvery tight fitting coverall |
| and a helmet. Where the eyes should have been there were two blinking |
| orange lights. The young men fled back to Sturno, where they found    |
| three other friends, and all of them drove back to the area in a car. |
| When they got there, all five saw the strange being advancing and     |
| withdrawing, with mechanical movements, on a steep slope. Oddly, it   |
| seemed to stand at a slant, perpendicular to the slope. Frightened,   |
| they decided not to drive the car any further into the abandoned      |
| quarry, which appeared lit up as if by a halo. Instead, they sped     |
| back to Sturno, returning again with two more witnesses. The humanoid |
| was still there, coming and going with emissions of intermittent      |
| light from its helmet. When one of the parties flashed a light on the |
| figure, it emitted sounds like "radio signals." It then approached    |
| the car and the sounds ceased. It came to about 15 feet away and      |
| beckoned, as though indicating for the witnesses to follow. Finally,  |
| at about 3:30 a.m., it emitted a blinding light from its helmet and   |
| disappeared. The outline of an object with portholes had been seen    |
| further down the slope. After the flash, the men fled back to the     |
| village. When they again returned both the humanoid and the object    |
| were gone. That next morning trampled bushes were foundin the quarry, |
| along with three holes in the ground that were arranged in an         |
| isosceles triangle. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:    |

| 1977 - At 8:30 p.m a number of independent witnesses in Healdsburg,   |
| California watched a huge lighted object with multicolored lights     |
| maneuvering over the area. One of the lights appeared to detach       |
| itself from the larger craft, and then descended close to the         |
| witnesses' vehicle. The smaller object was described as having        |
| several lighted windows and two beams of light. One of the witnesses  |
| claimed to be able to see a humanoid figure with a frog-like head     |
| looking out from one of the windows. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,      |

| cone-shaped object with body lights that flew low overhead.           |
| Their truck stalled for one minute when the UFO was overhead. It      |
| could be restarted by turning the ignition key. The cone-shaped UFO   |
| was silent, and had two red lights and one white light. (Sources:     |

| 1981 - There were two dramatic abduction events which occurred in San |
| Diego County, California on this evening separated by just a few      |
| minutes. At 10:30 p.m. Mr. Santoro, a reserve police officer was      |
| driving near the town of Alpine, California when he encountered a     |
| huge dark, disc-shaped object hovering 15 feet above the roadway. The |
| witness's vehicle suddenly stopped on its own accord. There was a     |
| bright flash, then moments later two small Grey humanoid beings       |
| approached and took him from his vehicle. He found himself back in    |
| his vehicle 15 minutes later and saw the dark disc rising rapidly     |
| into the sky, shining a beam of white light towards the ground. The   |
| witness fired four shots at the object and then drove home at high    |
| speed. Magnetic cassette tapes in the witness's vehicle had been      |
| partially erased. In El Cajon, California a 27-year old computer      |
| engineer was abducted at 10:35 p.m. A luminous object illuminated the |
| interior of his car. The luminous object then circled his car, and    |
| the witness fired a pistol at the object and attempted to flee the    |
| scene. He was badly frightened by the experience, and discovered that |
| he had a memory loss and could not account for 30 minutes of his      |
| time. Red dots like puncture marks were found on his wrists,          |
| suggesting that he had been abducted as well. His digital watch was   |
| also damaged. (Sources: (1) San Diego Tribune, July 1,1987; Robert    |

| 1982 - At 11:55 p.m. a battleship gray, disc-shaped object estimated  |
| to be 200 feet in diameter chased a car in Derry, Pennsylvania with a |
| single male occupant. It kept moving in front of the vehicle, pacing  |

| door, and the UFO had amber lights around its perimeter. It made a    |
| high-pitched "whoop-whoop" sound. (Sources: Doris Graziano, APRO      |

| 1991 - Four children in Granum, Alberta, Canada at about 10 p.m.      |
| observed an oval object hovering over the town. Some of the time it   |
| moved very fast, and at other times it floated in place. It had blue, |
| red, and green lights that flashed intermittently. Later a "long      |
| black thing" streaked across the sky. (Source: Timorthy Good, Alien   |

| 1991 - On the same night as the Alberta sighting in Blairsville,      |
| Pennsylvania at 11:15 p.m. two women driving on Route 22 had an       |
| encounter with a triangular UFO hovering low to the ground along the  |
| roadside. It had solid white light beams along its outer structure    |
| and horizontal light beams inside the triangle; in between it         |
| appeared transparent. (Sources: Stan Gordon, PASU Data Exchange,      |

| 1993 - Outside of Mimet, Bouches-du-Rhone, France a 4.5 meter long    |
| ovoid object sitting on the highway rose and shot off rapidly to the  |
| south when a car approached. Nothing was seen on radar. (Source:      |

| 1995 - A thin silent cigar-shaped UFO passed over the witness's house |
| in Rio Claro, San Paulo State, Brazil at five o'clock in the morning. |
| It gave off multi-colored rays of lights in all directions and made   |
| no sound. (Source: Boletim CEPEX, issue 25).                          |

| 2000 - In Gull Lake, Ontario, Canada a sphere 40-70 feet in diameter  |
| was sighted at 11:05 p.m. It had 40 to 50 red lights and three blue   |
| lights, and flew at between 200 to 300 feet in altitude. It made no   |
| sound. There were reported blackouts in two nearby towns. The same or |
| a similar report was made to the UFO Reporting Center from Minden,    |
| Ontario. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 2000 Canadian UFO Survey, case #     |

| 2001 - At 8:30 p.m. in Calumet, Wisconsin witnesses saw three         |
| flashing lights flying in a row. The lights were flashing in          |
| sequence: first two flashes, then a pause, then three flashes,        |
| another pause, four flashes, pause, and then it repeated. The front   |
| light was amber, and the others were white. At first, it looked like  |
| the lights were all connected, but using binoculars it looked like    |
| only the front light was attached to the next segment, and the other  |
| segments were separate.The object was cigar-shaped and had some sort  |
| of windows in it. Suddenly the rear lights split apart, flying off in |
| different directions. (Sources: George Filer, MUFON UFO Journal,      |

| 2003 - At 12:15 a.m. four elliptical, illuminated objects each        |
| surrounded by haze or a halo were sighted in Merrick, Nassau County,  |
| New York. They proceeded to individually dive, climb, and zigzag. The |
| sighting lasted about 45 minutes. That night a very large, slow       |
| moving, wing-shaped craft flew over a campsite near McGregor in       |
| northern Minnesota with 10 witnesses gathered around a camp fire at   |
| 11:55 p.m. It was chased a few minutes later by three military        |
| F-15's. It reportedly had four white lights and four red lights.      |

| 2009 - A married couple had gone camping at Unicoi State Park,        |
| Georgia on this night and had gotten up at around 4:00 a.m. to use    |
| the restrooms at a facility on the campsite. It was very dark out,    |
| except for the light from her lantern and the lights from the         |
| building. After the wife started to walk back to her tent, she        |
| stopped because she sensed that their was someone close behind her.   |
| She turned around and saw three Grey humanoid beings standing there.  |
| At first she thought they were other campers, but when one of them    |
| turned to look at her she realized that they were not human. For one  |
| thing, their arms were too long and their bodies were too thin. Their |
| skin also had a pale, glossy look, and they had very large heads and  |
| lumps covering the tops of their scalps. They had huge black eyes     |
| that seemed to stare right through her. She estimated that they were  |
| about five feet tall. the one that saw her began to slowly approach,  |
| but she ran away, and got back to her tent and found her husband.     |
| When he asked her what was wrong, all she could say was, "There's     |
| some [expletive deleted] aliens back there!" After he had finally     |
| calmed her down, he told her to stay in the tent and he walked back   |
| to see, but he found nothing. Throughout the rest of the night they   |
| kept waking up and had a fitful night; the husband reported that he   |
| saw a shadowy figure moving about outside their tent, but he didn't   |
| hear any footsteps. He also looked up and saw the top cover of the    |
| tent move, and if someone had pulled it aside to look in at them from |
| above. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2009 Humanoid Sighting Reports     |

| 2010 - At 6:30 a.m. a black, oval-shaped object with visible heat     |
| waves radiating from it was sighted over the I-5 freeway in           |
| Silverlake, Los Angeles County, California. At 11:00 a.m. a           |
| disc-shaped object with a pulsing outer band and a transparent center |
| was sighted over Plant City, Florida. At 3:00 p.m. a shiny metallic,  |
