| 1948 - At 9:00 p.m. an aerial encounter occurred on this day over     |
| Fargo, North Dakota between an F-51 fighter plane and a somewhat      |
| flattened white circular unidentified object, blinking on and off.    |
| The UFO made a head-on approach toward the F-51, then veered off,     |
| next made a 180 degree turn, then out climbed the performance         |
| aircraft, rising straight up until out of sight. Its close turns      |
| were tighter than could be made by the fighter plane. The encounter   |
| lasted 27 minutes. (Sources: Edward J. Ruppelt, True Magazine, May    |

| 1954 - There are 26 UFO and humanoid reports recorded in UFOCAT for   |
| this day. There is one from the Assam region of India, two are from   |
| Italy, and the remainder are from France, which appears to have been  |
| at the center of a massive wave of UFO sightings. Notice how the humanoid cases   |
| tend to occur at intersections of the major great circle routes       |
| described by four or more points on a straight line. Below are some   |
| of the more interesting reports on this day:                          |

| 1954 - A woman in Dhubri, Assam, India reported to police that she    |
| had seen a luminous disc leaving a long trail in the sky. It landed   |
| in a field, and then took off again. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,        |

| 1954 - At 1:00 p.m. two bricklayers, Sebastiani and Buratto,          |
| approached a cigar-shaped object in Blanzy, Saone-Loire department,   |
| France that was sitting on the ground. It was three meters long, 80   |
| cm wide, and it took off from the ground with a whistling sound. The  |
| pointed section of the object was yellow, the rest brown. From the    |
| fore part, two appendages extended to the ground. (Source: Jacques    |

| 1954 - At 4:00 p.m. a man and his dog in Bry, Nord department, France |
| were "paralyzed" and frozen in place when a luminous white object     |
| dove toward them, then climbed back into the sky. (Source: Jacques    |

| 1954 - Two young men in Jussey, Haute-Saone department, France saw a  |
| luminous white disc moving in the sky at 7:00 p.m. It dove to the     |
| ground and two very tall beings, dressed in white, emerged from it    |
| and made gestures. The witnesses ran away in fear. (Sources: Jacques  |

| 1954 - Near St. Jean d'Angely, France two businessmen, Messrs. Estier |
| and Phelippeau, who were driving back from Royan at eight o'clock at  |
| night, saw a little man crossing the road in front of their car. When |
| they stopped the car the figure disappeared into the woods. (Sources: |

| 1954 - Mechanic Ernest Delattre, age 19, was riding home on his motor |
| scooter between Lormaison and St-Crepin-Ibouvillers, France at eight  |
| o'clock when a brilliantly illuminated egg-shaped object landed on    |
| the left side of the road 15 meters away. He saw short, dark shapes   |
| "like potato bags" moving about the object. He sped up, saw the       |
| object, the size of a small bus, taking off while its color changed   |
| from orange to blue and then to grayish-blue. The witness fainted     |
| while telling his story. Two persons in neighboring villages          |
| independently reported observing the object. (Note: Vallee lists the    |
| date as October 2nd but Figuet & Ruchon believe the correct date is   |
| October 1st.) (Sources: Jacques        |

| 1954 - In Branges, near Louhans in Saone-Loire department, France.    |
| While coming home at night around 10:00 p.m., Gilbert Prudent and one |
| other witness saw a lighted object on the side of the road. It had a  |
| flat section and a sort of large "mushroom" on top (domed disc). As   |
| he approached it, the object became dark and took off vertically with |
| a soft whistling sound. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to         |

| 1954 - Returning home from work in Bergerac, Dordogne department,     |
| France fireman Jean Dufix, age 26, saw an oval light in the sky at 10 |
| o'clock. He first took it to be a shooting star, but later he was     |
| alarmed when his yard looked to be ablaze. Rushing outside, he saw a  |
| disc rise from the ground with a whistling sound. It flew off, became |
| luminous again, and then shot off at a fantastic speed. His neighbor, |
| Jean Labonne, age 61, also saw the disc resting on three legs in the  |
| yard. They estimated the disc was three meters (10 feet) in diameter. |

| 1964 - At 12:50 p.m. a 24-foot diameter dark disc-shaped object       |
| passed over an industrial plant in Danvers, Massachusetts. It flew    |
| under a cloud at 2,500 altitude, at an estimated speed of 300 mph.    |

| 1965 - Three school students, Santos Vallejos, Antonia Aparti, and    |
| Adela Sanchez were walking to General San Martin School, Aguas        |
| Blancas, Salta province, Argentina when they were attacked by small   |
| creatures with greenish skin. The children ran away, and arrived at   |

| 1967 - Valeriano Ruiz Fontes, a 28-year-old radio technician,         |
| observed an illuminated object at 10:30 p.m. in Tibidabo, Barcelona,  |
| Spain which he first took to be a large Jeep. However, It was         |
| hovering just above the ground about 700-800 yards away. It was about |
| 14 feet long, with half a dozen oval illuminated windows, and had on  |
| top a square turret. Near the UFO were four people of normal stature  |
| wearing dark uniforms and bright helmets. Two of the beings climbed   |
| up the turret, manipulating or fixing some fittings there, while the  |
| other two were examined the underside of the object. After watching   |
| for about half an hour, the external lights were extinguished,        |
| showing only the illuminated portholes. The object then rose          |
| vertically with no noise to about 500 feet, showing yellow, red       |
| orange, and a triangle of blue-green lights, and took off at          |
| extremely high speed. (Sources: Antonio Ribera, FSR, May 1968, p. 26; |

| 1973 - On this night three teenagers in Anthony Hill, Tennessee saw a |
| huge, hairy, robot-like creature that walked mechanically with its    |
| hand upraised. It had a large round head. An egg-shaped UFO was also  |
| seen at the same time. This occurred during a thunderstorm, and       |
| imprints were later found at the site. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted |

| 1975 - At around 8:00 p.m. two teenagers, Michio Hikawa and Takashi   |
| Furuya, were parked in a car at a scenic spot in Japan's Southern     |
| Alps near Hakushu, Japan when Furuya became agitated about a group of |
| children resembling beggars near the car. Hikawa didn't see them.     |
| Among the figures Furuya saw were some resembling girls, about one    |
| meter tall, dressed in white. Pointing them out to his companion,     |
| Hikawa still was unable to see them, and turned on the car's          |
| headlights. When this happened the figures faded away, but their car  |
| was abruptly pulled backwards several times by an unseen force,       |
| eventhough the hand brake was on. Frightened, the two teenagers left  |
| the area. Hikawa suggested that the figures may have been "spacemen", |
| and the pair returned to the scene later, where the same mass         |
| displacement effects occurred to the car again. Again fearful, the    |
| pair drove home. The car subsequently malfunctioned and required      |
| repairs, the result of a broken piston. Peculiar "hoof like" marks    |
| were observed on a window in the car following the encounter. There   |
| were no reports of UFOs seen. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,  |

| 1977 - At 7:00 p.m. two brothers were hunting in an uninhabited area  |
| near a quarry west of Libau, Manitoba, Canada when they saw a UFO     |
| that looked like an inverted bowl with two long extensions. It        |
| was 75-100 feet wide, 25 feet high, and 1/2 a mile away at 500 feet   |
| altitude. It made a humming noise, and moved away slowly. (Sources:   |

| 1987 - Marysville, Indiana. At 7:50 p.m. a black rectangular object   |
| was witnessed by a lone witness for 10 minutes while driving in a     |
| rural area. The UFO flew silently to the southwest, then toward the   |
| northwest, and finally further to the southwest. (Source: Francis L.  |

| 1992 - Three men were in the backyard of a home in Clare, South       |
| Australia at 7:00 p.m. when they saw, at a low altitude in the        |
| northwestern sky, two lights travelling to the northeast. It resolved |
| into a cigar-shaped object that was thicker in the middle, with a     |
| hazy glow surrounding it. It continued to fly to the northeast and    |
| was lost from sight behind some trees.                                |

| 1993 - A large white ball of light flew from north to south over      |
| Nutter Fort, West Virginia at 7:00 p.m. It followed a car to          |

| 1995 - An orange disc-shaped object hovered over a house in           |
| Vacaville, California for a minute at 9:00 p.m., at only 100 feet     |
| altitude. At 10:30 p.m. an extremely bright disc-shaped object flew   |
| over a house in Austin, Texas heading north. It was the "size of a    |
| volleyball at arms length," and had a green tinge on top. (Source:    |

| 2000 - At 11:15 p.m. two objects were sighted over Jones Beach on     |
| Long Island in Nassau County, New York. A diamond-shaped UFO landed   |
| on the beach. It directed an intense red beam, then a blue-colored    |
| beam, at the witnesses' car, which caused the car with the three      |
| occupants to be lifted into the air. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U         |
