| 1950 - At 11:55 a.m. Fairchild Aircraft illustrator Don Patrick in    |
| Oak Ridge, Tennessee saw a translucent pear or bean-shaped object,    |
| light gray with a dark core, fly through the sky for 5-10 minutes     |
| with rapid, darting movements. (Sources: Project Blue Book files      |

| 1954 - La Coruna, Spain. Gonzalo Rubinos Ramos, whose car had broken  |
| down, saw a large, shining disc rise 150 meters away with a slight    |
| noise like an explosion. It flew away at fantastic speed. (Source:    |

| 1954 - In La Roche-en-Brenil, France at 10:10 a.m. Raymond R. saw a   |
| craft that made a noise like a large transformer and gave off an      |
| orange light, land in a pasture. Three men in dark coveralls were     |
| standing nearby. One was holding a sort of box, "which emitted a beam |
| of light three meters long." The other two were holding objects that  |
| looked like weapons. Another witness fled and felt pricklings on his  |
| face as he ran. Four photographs of the scene were taken. Traces      |
| included a whitish substance and a circle three meters in diameter    |
| where the ground had an ashlike appearance. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, |

| 1956 - A huge round object with sharply outlined edges passed         |
| overhead in Malvern, South Africa at 8:30 p.m. The flying object made |
| no sound as it flew into a cloud. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer    |

| 1957 - A brilliant white ovoid object moving at a high rate of speed  |
| was sighted by the crew of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Sebago, 200    |
| nautical miles south of New Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico. Three      |
| radar contacts were made with the UFO between 5:10 and 5:20 a.m. It   |
| was clocked moving at 1,020 mph. It was seen by four crew members as  |
| it moved horizontally through the sky from south to north and         |
| disappeared behind some clouds. (Sources: New Orleans Times-Picayune, |

| 1957 - New Castle, Indiana. An object looking like "a big meat        |
| platter" was seen at close range by Mrs. Jasper Barlow and her two    |
| children, who were inside their car. It had a flickering light on the |
| bottom. There was no ignition interference noted. (Source: Jacques    |

| 1957 - New York, New York. In Van Cortland Park in New York City at   |
| 4:30 a.m., Frank C. was talking with a bus driver when they both saw  |
| a metallic disc-shaped UFO in the park, about 400 m away. It was      |
| spinning and making a soft whirring sound. On top was a fixed dome    |
| with portholes. The object was hovering at tree height. A yellow      |
| light from the craft suddenly illuminated the area, and it flew off   |
| "like a shooting star. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia:  |

| 1957 - At 5:30 p.m. a man in Scotia, Nebraska heard a noise similar   |
| to that of a helicopter and perceived a "burning" odor. He saw a      |
| balloon-like, elongated object that came to ground level, did not     |
| touch the ground, but rose again and disappeared. The witness was     |
| "paralyzed" during the observation. The object appeared to have       |
| generated thick smoke. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia:  |
| A Century of Landings, p. 263).                                       |

| 1957 - At 6:20 p.m. an object variously described as silver or        |
| orange, and saucer or ovoid shaped, was seen over a wide area for a   |
| ten minute period around Dauphin, Manitoba. At 6:40 p.m. a shiny      |
| silver UFO hovered over Winnipeg, Manitoba and was seen shifting from |
| left to right and back again in the sky. It shot off toward the       |
| southwest when RCAF planes approached. (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO |
| Evidence (Volume I), p. 165).                                         |

| 1966 - On this night Mrs. Kathleen glanced out the kitchen door of    |
| her house in Arlington, Indiana and saw a lighted object, which moved |
| toward her and hovered 50 feet away, some 20-30 feet up in the air.   |
| It was as big as a house and Saturn-shaped. In the middle of the      |
| object were brightly lit windows. Mrs. Kathleen could see in these    |
| windows a man and two women, who appeared to be on different floors.  |
| The man, muscular in build, was manipulating something like a         |
| steering wheel and was staring directly at her, which frightened her. |
| One of the women who was on the lower level handed him a small object |
| "like a cup of coffee." After about three minutes the object began to |
| move westward, then rose steeply emitting a multicolored exhaust. It  |
| moved off at a speed greater then a jet. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1966-52         |

| 1967 - Truck driver Karl Farlow told police that at 11:30 p.m. his    |
| lights and radio blacked out, although his diesel engine continued to |
| work, when he saw a three-meter long egg-shaped object 15 meters away |
| at Fordingbridge, England. Moments later, a white Jaguar sports car   |
| came from the opposite direction and its engine stalled and           |
| headlights failed. The UFO, emitting a green light and showing a      |
| whitish dome under its lower surface, hovered between the two         |
| vehicles for two minutes and left at a high speed. (Source: Jacques   |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 896).        |

| 1968 - There was a report of a UFO that scorched the earth in Clare,  |
| South Australia on this day. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs Over the   |
| Southern Hemisphere, p. 182).                                         |

| 1969 - There were two cases of UFO reports involving animal reactions |
| and burnt landing traces from New Zealand on this day. In the first   |
| a horse was reported to be panicked on a farm in Kaharoa, Bay of      |
| Plenty, New Zealand. Later three circles of burnt grass were found,   |
| and the third circle straddled a paddock fence. In Puketutu, Waikato, |
| New Zealand some cattle and a dog were reported to be agitated, while |
| later a burnt circle was found on a small island in a pond. (Source:  |
| Data-Net Report, January 1970, p. 12).                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1971 - Two railroad men were dazed and incoherent in South Johnstone, |
| Queensland, Australia after their close encounter at ten p.m. with    |
| a ball of fire, which burnt a sugar cane field. (Sources: Ted R.      |

| 1990 - There are 92 UFO reports recorded for this day from Europe,    |
| all but seven occurring in France. Most occurred between 6:20 p.m.    |
| and 7:30 p.m. Ordinarily such a large number of reports would suggest |
| a meteor shower or a satellite re-entry as the cause, but many of the |
| descriptions do not fit such explanations. At 5:25 p.m. a triangular  |
| UFO with luminous jet streams coming out of one edge flew over        |
| Kelheim, Bavaria, Germany. Ninety minutes later a Russian space       |
| station re-entry occurred over France and Germany. There are two      |
| reports from that time period of objects making a buzzing or purring  |
| noise. At 7:00 p.m. in Chissay-en-Tourain, France a dark triangular   |
| UFO flew over making a buzzing noise. At the same time in Anguleme,   |
| France a surgeon saw a formation of lights that made a purring sound. |

| 1990 - At 7:00 p.m. in St. Germain, Aube, France during this intense  |
| regional wave of UFO reports that coincided with a Russian satellite  |
| re-entry, numerous witnesses watched a large delta-shaped object      |
| flying at a low altitude. It shone several beams of light towards the |
| ground. A man-like figure was seen moving around inside a cabin-like  |
| structure. It flew towards the northeast and vanished. Please bear in |
| mind that satellite re-entries are predictable in advance and could   |
| serve as the perfect cover for covert aerial activity. (Source:       |

| 1990 - Later this night Rudolph Bauer, a local artisan residing in    |
| Leipzig, Germany, reported seeing a short metallic robot-like entity  |
| equipped with antennas, who flew soundlessly over the area. It        |
| disappeared while moving at high speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,   |

| 1991 - Two MUFON investigators, Weatherford and                       |
| Morrison, photographed a structured UFO in Gulf Breeze, Florida with  |
| a curved shape above a blazing red light on the bottom. There were    |
| multiple witnesses, and the object was viewed through binoculars.     |

| 2000 - At 7:30 p.m. a red cylindrical UFO, the shape of a 44 gallon   |
| drum, with a white band around the middle, was sighted floating in    |
| water nearWoody Point, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia just 20 meters |
| away from the witness. It was steady in the water despite the fact    |
| that the ocean at the time was quite choppy. The object silently sped |
| off above the water, then shot up, and was gone from view in 5-10     |
| seconds. (Source: Sheryl Gottschall, UFO Research Queensland          |

| 2003 - At 8:35 p.m. an oval-shaped UFO came up from a pasture in      |
| Mabank, Texas and darted toward the witness' car. It had a yellow     |
| glow around it. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting      |
