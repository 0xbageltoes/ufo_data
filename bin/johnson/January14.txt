| heard a hum like an electrical whine, then saw a bright light         |
| 2,000-5,000 feet high. It was hovering, then moved away quickly on a  |
| straight trajectory. The lights and radio then came back on and the   |
| engine also started by itself. The whole sighting lasted only 15-20   |
| seconds. (Sources: Manchester Union Leader, January 16, 1965; Mark    |

| 1969 - George Vas and his wife and two daughters were asleep in their |
| trailer near Childers, Queensland, Australia when they were awakened  |
| at 4:30 a.m. by the barking of their dog. They also heard a loud      |
| buzzing noise like a swarm of wasps. It came from a UFO shaped like a |
| sombrero, about 25-30 yards in diameter, which gave off a brilliant   |
| violet luminosity. From the craft three beings descended. They were   |
| huge, "about 3 times as large as humans," and had "blocky arms and    |
| legs and shapeless bodies." They emitted a purple and yellow glow.    |
| For about ten minutes they gathered sugar cane and other plant        |
| specimens, without concern for the observers. Mrs. Olga Vas said that |
| the beings descended from the larger craft in a small object similar  |
| in shape. At one point one of the entities came close enough to the   |
| group for Mr. Vas to call out in alarm. The "spaceman" showed no      |
| concern and moved away only after picking up several rocks. The giant |
| creatures re-entered their craft and the UFO took off vertically.     |
| When it took off the hair on the witnesses' bodies stood on end, as   |
| if affected by a form of static electricity. (Sources: Bill Chalker   |

| altitude. The observers drove away frightened. (Source: UFO Research  |
