| 1927 - A man by the man of Sweed witnessed a hexagonal flying craft   |
| with rivets and a dome that was flying low over a road in             |
| Bakersfield, California. A human looking occupant was seen inside a   |
| window. The object shot away extremely fast. (Source: Coral & Jim     |

| 1954 – Mrs. Paquet was tending her cows in a field in                 |
| Moutier-Rozeille, Creuse, France at around ten o'clock in the morning |
| when she suddenly heard a peculiar sounding language which she        |
| could not understand. The conversation came from a nearby heather     |
| field. Then two men approached to within 50 meters of Mrs. Paquet.    |
| One of them turned towards the mill of Mr. Blanchon, emitting a yell  |
| and making gestures. Two more men next showed up, and walked in the   |
| direction of the Rozeille River, where they then joined the first two |
| and all four vanished. Fiteen minutes later Mrs. Paquet's dog began   |
| to bark furiously, and she see a silent dark cigar-shaped object rise |
| into the air and disappear towards the southwest. The men were        |
| approximately 1.80 meters in height and wore dark blue combinations   |
| suits. (Source: Michel Figuet & Jean-Louis Ruchon, OVNI: Le Premier   |

| 1954 - Cisternes-la-Foret, Puy-de-Dome, France. Messrs. J. Augard and |
| J. Chanzotte saw an oval object with a dome, emitting a bright white  |
| light and resting in a field. When they approached it the object rose |
| vertically, leaving a reddish trail, and flew off toward the          |
| northeast. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight     |

| Bachelard, age 42, was going around a bend in the road at 5:30 p.m.   |
| when he felt half paralyzed and his van's motor began missing         |
| and slowed to 20 mph. He then saw hovering in a nearby field a        |
| motionless, silent elongated or flattened object 30 feet long. A      |
| police investigation was conducted. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying      |

| 1954 - An anonymous schoolboy returning from his evening studies in   |
| Louvigne-Du-Desert, Ille-Et-Vilaine, France was approaching the       |
| hamlet of Salmoniere when he suddenly saw a small being with an odd   |
| face, which frightened him enormously. The creature entered a machine |
| that was lying in a ditch, and then the machine rose up in the air at |
| a tremendous rate of speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |

| 1954 – Fontenay-Torey, Oise, France. At 8:40 p.m. Mr. and Mrs.        |
| Lherminier saw a red, cigar-shaped object dive toward them with a     |
| reddish trail and land near the road. Upon reaching the top of the    |
| hill, they were confronted by a bulky human figure about one meter    |
| (3.3 feet) tall. The creature wore a helmet and his eyes were glowing |
| with an orange light. One witness fainted on the spot. Four others    |
| saw the object in flight from separate locations. The countryside was |
| illuminated over 2 or 3 kilometers. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport |

| 1954 - At 8:45 p.m. three witnesses observed a cylinder or rocket     |
| shaped device with several illuminated portholes following a complex  |
| trajectory along a river in Formerie, Oise department, France. The    |
| craft then landed close to the witnesses and several humanoids        |
| described as about 1.50 meters in height, with dark skin and wearing  |
| metallic helmets and metallic garments, exited the craft. As the      |
| witnesses watched stupefied, they suddenly experienced headaches and  |
| memory loss. Apparently they did not see the object and its occupants |
| depart. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1954,   |

| 1954 – In Royan, Charente-Maritime, France Mr. and Mrs. Labassiere    |
| and other witnesses saw two discs in the sky at 9:00 p.m, one orange  |
| and the other red, with a sort of luminous "bridge" between them.     |
| They landed, and one dwarf came out of each craft and went into the   |
| other without any sign. After this exchange of pilots both objects    |
| flew away with a tremendous flash. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying      |

| 1954 – At 10:45 p.m. Miss Marie Louise Bourriot saw a bright red      |
| light on Route N437 near an old factory in St.-Point Lake, Le         |
| Vezenay, Doubs, France. She was on a motorbike and saw that the       |
| luminous object was over the road. Next to it stood a man of normal   |
| stature in a trenchcoat. He was motionless, and he was joined by two  |
| dwarves who crossed the road ahead of her. She had to swerve to avoid |
| hitting them.The craft took off, flying over the lake at a high       |
| speed. Small footprints were later found at the site. Jean-Luc Rivera |
| thinks that woman was witnessing an abduction taking place, and that  |
| the man in trenchcoat was an abductee, and not one of the UFO         |
| occupants.  (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue no. 97; Aime       |

| 1954 - Sometime before midnight 15-year-old Albert Geraud was on his  |
| bicycle on route D216 between Andigne and Saint-Martin du Bois,       |
| France when he saw a light that turned from green to red. It          |
| descended in a jerky motion and landed on the road, revealing a       |
| saucer-shaped object giving off a red gleam on the ground. The        |
| panicked witness felt like his legs were paralyzed. Inside the object |
| he could see a small being covered with hair, that stared at him with |
| large eyes. Abruptly the object lifted off, emitting a strong gush of |
| wind toward the teenager, and it zipped away in the direction of      |
| Lyon. After the incident the witness had to lie prostrate in bed for  |
| several days. (Source: Michel Figuet & Jean-Louis Ruchon, OVNI: Le    |

|                                                                       |
| 1954 - At just before midnight salesman Renzo Pugina, age 37, was     |
| parking his car in Erba, Como, Italy after returning home from seeing |
| a movie. Pugina noticed a soft glow in the park of the villa, but he  |
| attributed this to the moon. After he had climbed a half-flight of    |
| stairs connecting the lane to the villa, he observed a strange figure |
| at the top of the steps, near to a tree. The creature was 1.3 meters  |
| tall, and facing to the right. The creature was surrounded by a soft, |
| warm light and appeared to be wearing armor. It wore a helmet with a  |
| transparent visor, and it seemed most of the light emitted by the     |
| creature was concentrated at the top of its head. Its upper body was  |
| covered in slightly luminous overalls comprised of metallic scales    |
| while the lower part was contained by a large “pipe” 50 cm high and   |
| 20 centimeters wide (no legs were visible). A much smaller pipe 1.5   |
| meters in length was attached horizontally to the first one, just     |
| centimeters above the ground. Near the end of this pipe was a         |
| luminous disc “as large as a bicycle wheel.” Its upper part was       |
| dome-shaped and orientated horizontally over the pipe, but there was  |
| no contact between the two elements. Pugina continued to climb the    |
| steps, but after a few seconds, the creature rotated his trunk        |
| towards him. He also slowly rotated his head, as if manipulated by a  |
| mechanism. The creature held a flashlight type device in its right    |
| hand, and it was directed at the witness, who instantly felt          |
| paralyzed when struck by a beam of light. He remained unable to       |
| move for some time. Pugina noticed that the outer features of the     |
| creature’s face were rather normal yet striking, featuring almost no  |
| forehead and eyes that were almond-shaped. Its face was olive in      |
| shade “as if it had been splashed with motor oil.” Once Pugina was    |
| able to grasp a bunch of keys in his hand he regained control of his  |
| body . Pugina took a few more steps forward, pronouncing in Italian   |
| the word “Marte!” (Mars!). He did this because he thought the being   |
| was a Martian, and in order to tell him not to leave. The creature    |
| appeared to grimace, and when Pugina advanced another step the        |
| creature alighted one meter off the ground and flew away along the    |
| villa lane, maintaining a flight path below the tree branches. The    |
| flight produced a soft buzzing noise. Pugina ran after him, but the   |
| creature disappeared around a curve. The entire sighting lasted but a |
| few minutes. His wife was at home asleep but she woke up when Pugina  |
| made a hasty entrance. She saw he was in shock and could not speak,   |
| and was shivering. Pugina’s wife said that her husband shivered the   |
| rest of the night. The press reported that Pugina remained in bed for |
| two days after his encounter. Some form of trace material was found   |
| on the gravel lane of the villa the following day. It was odorless,   |
| dry and greaseless. A couple of days later this trace area had        |
| greatly expanded. The local Carabinieri claimed that Pugina was a     |
| “normal” individual not known to drink or to suffer from              |
| psychological problems. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact  |

| 1965 - At 10:20 p.m. an oval-shaped object with a flashing red light  |
| on top and green, red and white lights around the perimeter was seen  |
| in Sharon, Massachusetts. It moved slowly 100 feet above ground, and  |
| only 500 yards away from the witnesses. (Source: Ray Fowler case      |

| 1973 - On this evening two youths were chased by a white "thing" 3-4  |
| feet tall on White Oak Mountain near Chatham, Virginia. The thing had |
| a shimmering body, large head with no eyes, and ran sideways. A green |
| hazy cloud was seen moving away. Several other reports of objects     |
| were made in the area. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: |

| 1997 - Near Huntsville, Texas 15-year-old Joanna Alice Stevenson was  |
| awoken around midnight to find several strange beings standing over   |
| her bed. They were humanoids with large craniums, small mouths, and   |
| two slits for a nose. She was terrified. She looked out her window    |
| and could see a UFO hovering right outside her bedroom window. The    |
| creatures that were examining her talked or communicated by using     |
| grunts that sounded like a foreign language. Her conscious memory     |
| suddenly stopped at this point, and she could only vaguely remember   |
| being poked and probed by the aliens. They took blood samples, then   |
| let her go by dropping her off in a large field, not far away from    |
| her rural home. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database |
