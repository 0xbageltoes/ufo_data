| 1908 - On this morning at 7:17 a.m. the Tunguska, Russia explosion    |
| occurred in a remote region of the Siberian taiga, which brightened   |
| the pre-dawn sky as far away as London and had the equivalent         |
| energy of a 15 to 40-megaton nuclear explosion. Detailed scientific   |
| analysis shows that the object that caused the devastation exploded   |
| above an altitude of three miles and left an area of destruction for  |
| more than 850 square miles, in a heart-shaped pattern. It is widely   |
| thought to have been either an asteroid or comet impact, but it has   |
| sometimes been interpreted as the crash or mid-air explosion of an    |
| alien spaceship. Several anomalies still remain to be explained if    |
| the explosion was caused by a celestial body entering Earth's         |
| atmosphere. For example, why was radioactive Cesium 137 found in 1908 |
| tree rings from the area. (Sources: William R. Corliss, Remarkable    |

| 1947 - A Navy Lieutenant named McGinty was flying in a P-80 fighter   |
| aircraft near Williams Field, Arizona at 9000 meters altitude when    |
| toward the south when he saw two circular objects diving at an        |
| "unconceivable" speed. They were gray, about three meters in          |
| diameter, and appeared to land 40 kilometers south of the Grand       |
| Canyon. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official         |

| 1954 - At 6:50 p.m. a silvery metallic fuselage-shaped UFO with       |
| stubby wings was tracked on radar and also observed from the tower by |
| two air traffic controllers at Brookley Air Force Base in Mobile,     |
| Alabama. The object came from the south and circled the city. There   |
| was no sound detected from the craft as it flew in what was described |
| as a highly maneuverable manner and at a high speed, shooting off to  |
| the northeast. (Sources: Donald E. Keyhoe, Flying Saucer Conspiracy,  |

| 1955 - A tanker crew in a vessel near Pantelleria Island off the      |
| coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea, at around ten o'clock in    |
| the morning, sighted a cigar-shaped object at 7,000 feet altitude,    |

| minutes. It made several passes, crossing above or under the          |
| airliner, and then in front and behind it. (Sources: Richard Hall,    |

| 1964 - In Wellford, South Carolina a disc-shaped object with an       |
| antenna followed a car for many miles beginning at one o'clock in the |
| morning. It departed when the car's driver turned the car             |
| headlights off. The duration of the close encounter was 50 minutes.   |

| 1967 - At two o'clock in the morning in Rapid City, South Dakota      |
| three police officers named Eisnach, Ferguson, and Sinner  had a      |
| close encounter with a huge multi-colored object with three windows   |
| and red, green, and white flashing lights. They witnessed it as it    |
| took off from the ground, hovered just above some nearby trees, made  |
| some jerky movements, and then landed again. It took off once again   |
| and went over hill. As it did so the white light on the object        |
| intensified. The entire incident lasted two and a half hours.         |

| 1967 - Mrs. Lemarquandsa was walking through her house around six     |
| o'clock in the evening in Thompson, Manitoba when she heard an odd    |
| beeping sound. It was repeated at regular intervals about once a      |
| second, and she wondered what was causing it. She looked out her      |
| kitchen window, and saw dirt and loose pieces of paper flying in a    |
| large circle around her house. Outside, she found her husband, who    |
| had just come home, and five children staring up into the sky. A      |
| young boy was holding her eight-year-old daughter down on the ground. |
| Up in the sky a box-shaped or rectangular object hung in the air,     |
| slowly rotating counter-clockwise and showing alternating silver      |
| metallic and black sides. It was black on its lower surface, and made |
| no noise. The object began moving off at an angle, stopped and        |
| hovered, and then continued towards the southeast. Until this time    |
| the circle of dirt and dust had persisted, but it now died down. The  |
| whirlwind was confined to the area immediately around their house and |
| did not affect any other houses on the street. When the object moved  |
| away, the dirt fell to the ground. Going to the children, the woman   |
| found they were calming down except her daughter, who seemed dazed.   |
| The boy explained that the five of them had been playing in the yard  |
| when the object first appeared overhead. As they watched, her         |
| daughter had been levitated into the air, and this levitation was     |
| apparently caused by the UFO in the sky. By the time the other        |
| children had come to her aid, she was about one meter off the ground  |
| and her clothes had edged up her body. Her daughter said she did not  |
| remember anything from the time she felt the wind until the time she  |
| recovered after being dragged back to the ground. (Sources: Gene      |

| 1968 - At 1:15 a.m. Jose Paulino Nunez, a distillery worker,          |
| encountered two people on the beach in Lujan, Mendoza, Argentina that |
| he first mistook to be guards. Their dress and actions were like      |
| normal people, but they showed him a spherical device some 30 cm in   |
| which he could see images of people walking about. Speaking in a      |
| strange, metallic voice, one of them asked him, "Do you know these    |
| people? They were like you. Many more will be like them. Many people  |
| in the world will see the same thing you have seen. We will talk      |
| about this again. If you speak of this, be sure it is with            |
| responsible people." At that point the witness experienced a lapse of |
| memory, for the next thing he recalls was being back in the           |
| laboratory, where it took him an hour to compose himself. The people  |
| he saw in the images were all tall and human like, with pale          |
| complexions, and long, light colored hair, who appeared to be walking |
| about in a trance. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:  |

| 1972 - In the afternoon at 4:30 p.m. a disc-shaped object with a      |
| tailfin like an airplane hovered over Marcq-en-Baroeul, Nord          |
| department, France. Many black dot-like objects could be seen         |
| orbiting around the larger craft. There were two witnesses, and the   |
| sighting lasted two minutes. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, March    |
| 1975).                                                                |

| 1983 - At their home in the suburbs near Indianapolis, Indiana a      |
| mother, "Kathy Davis" and her daughter separately witnessed a large   |
| light appear over their pool house after 10:45 p.m. They then had two |
| hours of missing time. Under hypnosis, both remembered that an        |
| egg-shaped object landed in the yard and burned the grass. An         |
| abduction by Grey aliens followed, involving a medical exam on board  |
| the craft. They were left with a mental warning not to remember the   |
| details of their abduction experience. The next day both felt         |
| nauseous. (Sources: Budd Hopkins, Intruders; Thomas E. Bullard, UFO   |

| 1990 - Three office workers in Wilmington, Delaware saw a four-sided  |
| pyramid (tetrahedron) at around 7:00 p.m. that was flat yellow in     |
| color with orange-red edges. It was slowly spinning and ascending,    |
| and made no sound. There was a black cylinder protruding from its     |
| base. They watched it for 20 minutes. (Source: Donald M. Ware, MUFON  |

| 1990 - Thirty minutes earlier, at 11:30 p.m. in Maubeuge, Nord        |
| department, France a large black triangular object with lights in the |
| three corners and the center, moved slowly and silently from north to |
| south over the city. There were four witnesses. (Source: Lumieres     |

| 1995 - At around three o'clock in the morning a security guard in the |
| town of Chalons-sur-Marne, Marne department, France saw               |
| a crescent-shaped flying object, the apparent size of the Moon, that  |

| 40 feet directly above the expressway, very close to and in front of  |
| the witnesses. Its speed appeared to be quite slow, moving at an      |
