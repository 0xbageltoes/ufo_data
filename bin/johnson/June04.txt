| 1943 - On this day in 1943, 12 brilliant star-like lights were seen          |
| maneuvering in all directions over Chauny, France. They flew at a     |
| high altitude, and were absolutely silent. (Source: Lumieres dans la  |

| 1952 - In 1952 at 6:45 p.m., two small and one very large disc were sighted  |
| flying at 15,000 feet altitude in Chartres, France. The three discs   |
| hovered, and then shot straight up and away. (Sources: Jacques        |

| 1955 - Over the Melville Sound in the Northwest Territories of        |
| Canada, a National Security Agency RB-47 jet bomber, newly re-fitted  |
| for aerial electronic surveillance, made radar and visual contact     |
| with a disc-shaped UFO for 9 minutes. This encounter occurred in 1955 |
| near the north magnetic pole. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer       |

| 1956 - There was a reported landing of a UFO near Hicksville, New York on    |
| Long Island at just after midnight in 1956. The unconfirmed report    |
| said there were landing traces, but the report couldn't be followed   |
| up. (Source: Civilian Saucer Intelligence of New York Newsletter,     |
| June 1956, p. 10).                                                    |

| 1963 - In 1963 a multicolored UFO, the size of a light truck, was reported   |
| to have landed in the vicinity of Lyle, Minnesota at 3:10 a.m. The    |
| multicolored object was seen ascending into the sky from a nearby     |
| town. Police searched the area for 3 miles on both sides of the       |
| Iowa-Minnesota border but found nothing. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,     |

| 1965 - The Gemini-4 mission with astronauts McDivitt and White        |
| sighted a "weird object" with "arms" while in orbit over the Pacific  |
| Ocean near Hawaii. Motion picture film was shot. (Sources: NICAP UFO  |

| 1968 - Artist Benjamin Solari Parravicini was walking home after      |
| midnight in Buenos Aires province, Argentina when he was confronted   |
| by a fair skinned man with eyes "so light in color that he looked as  |
| if blind." The man addressed him in an unintelligible guttural        |
| language. Looking upward, the witness saw only 50 meters away a       |
| hovering aerial craft with no lights. He became dizzy, and when he    |
| recovered, he found himself inside the machine, with three other      |
| people. One of these, a very handsome man, was questioning            |
| Parravicini in an alien language, which he was able to understand     |
| telepathically. The being told him that they would take him once      |
| around Earth, and he observed Japan, France, and Chile before being   |
| returned to the same street corner. Since this experience the alien   |
| beings have allegedly contacted Parravicini several times. (Source:   |

| 1969 - In 1969 numerous red lights were seen hovering in the sky over        |
| Penwortham, South Australia at 6:30 p.m. In Eden Valley five minutes  |
| later a UFO with two rows of red lights, connected by a white beam,   |
| buzzed a motorist. Afterwards three circular burn marks were found on |
| the hood of his car. At 7:30 p.m. a man driving between Brinkworth    |
| and Clare saw red lights flying parallel to his car, heading to the   |
| east. At 8 p.m. at Porter's Lagoon, 15 miles east of Clare, South     |
| Australia a red light pulsated is it hung stationary over the lagoon. |
| At about the same time a red light came down the valley from Camel    |
| Hump Ridge in Gum Creek, while a blue UFO hovered over the range and  |
| later went behind a mountain. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the  |
| Southern Hemisphere, p. 184-5).                                       |

| 1969 - On that same night in 1969 a fifteen-foot in diameter silver ovoid    |
| object flew 500 meters over the town of Sao Jose do Rio Preto,        |
| Brazil. It emitted blue and orange beams of light. At 8 p.m. a doctor |
| took a photograph of a 50-meter wide red-orange UFO while it hovered  |
| just off the ground and 150 meters away in Lavras, Brazil. Earlier    |
| that morning at dawn in Brasilia, a silent, dish-shaped UFO           |
| maneuvered up and down, to-and-fro, and shot up multi-colored beams   |
| of light. (Sources: O Dia, June 6, 1969; FSR Case Histories, October  |
| 1971, p. 15; Larry Hatch, U computer database, cases #8878 and        |
| #8879).                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1970 - In Evillers, Doubs department, France in 1970, six children reported  |
| seeing four three-and-a-half-foot tall humanoid beings. The bulky     |
| humanoids wore red tops with black straps, and carried large sacks on |
| their belts. They also saw a strange gray "dog" creature that jumped  |
| a distance of 40 feet. At around 2:45 p.m. Marie, age 10, was         |
| standing on the road opposite a house that was being used as a        |
| storehouse and stable, when she saw a figure at a windowpane-less     |
| second floor window. The being was the size of a child, but had a big |
| protruding stomach. She told other children and several of them, led  |
| by Noel, age 12, entered the building. Noel saw a small person about  |
| 3.5 feet tall in a red sweater with a black shoulder strap across it, |
| which he chased down the stairs and outdoors to the pasture.          |
|                                                                       |
| That evening at 6:30 p.m. Bertrand, age 10, was near the building     |
| when he noticed a "boy" about 3.5 feet tall standing beside it. He    |
| had a big belly and was wearing a red sweater crossed by a wide black |
| strap. This "boy" ran around behind the building. A short time later  |
| Noel, Simon, and Barthelemy all saw a long gray animal, which they    |
| called a "dog", make a giant leap from the second floor window (about |
| 12 feet high), and landed on the ground some 40 feet from the house.  |
| It left footprints "like a calf's." Then a small person like those    |
| seen earlier came out of the barn and called the "dog" to him with a  |
| snap of his fingers. He then passed a thick leash around its neck.    |
| Then three more such beings appeared, all alike except that one       |
| lacked a large stomach. They wore black hats with a peak behind. All  |
| four, with the "dog", then began to run very rapidly down the road    |
| away from the village. Two trucks passed and as they did the little   |
| men and their "dog" nimbly jumped off the road and hid. They ran out  |
| of sight. The next day the "dog's" paw prints were found. Six days    |
| later, the building mysteriously caught fire and burned to the        |
| ground. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue   |

| 1972 - In 1972 at dawn, a farmer watched a disc-shaped UFO hover on its edge |
| near Riverina, New South Wales. The object veered about in all        |
| directions in the sky for fifteen minutes, then shot straight up and  |
| away. Later that same day shortly after 6:00 p.m. in Bents Basin, New |
| South Wales, Australia a three-meter tall (ten foot!) robot           |
| mysteriously vanished, while a 25-foot diameter disc hovered very low |
| to the ground. The six witnesses reported having headaches as         |
| aftereffects of their encounter, and there were burn marks on one of  |
| their automobiles. (Sources: (1) APRO Bulletin, May-June 1972, p. 1;  |

| 1974 - A dark disc with a tail appendage hovered over New York City for five |
| minutes around 6:30 p.m. in 1974. It was sharply outlined in the sky, |
| and at an estimated altitude of 900 meters. (Source: NICAP UFO        |
| Investigator, December 1974.)                                         |

| 1978 - Four years later a UFO again appeared over New York City. In   |
| the afternoon, at a medical center on the Eastside of the city near   |
| the FDR parkway, a medical student took a photograph of a three-foot  |
| tall egg-in-cup saucer. The episode had many independent witnesses    |
| with accompanying television coverage and newspaper reports.          |
| Approximately five hours earlier that day a private pilot and his     |
| passenger reported a near collision with a hovering saucer-shaped UFO |
| over Pasadena, California. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, September 1978,   |

| 1980 - In 1980 two brothers commuting to work in Abasto, Argentina saw a     |
| strange luminous object in the pre-dawn sky at around 5:30 a.m. It    |
| made no noise, was 12 meters in diameter, and emitted white and       |
| reddish flashes of light. The UFO flew over fast, halted above the    |
| two men, then shot off to the north. (Source: UFO Newsclipping        |
| Service, July 1980, p. 9, citing La Razon, June 5, 1980).             |

| 1984 - In 1984 a very luminous object shone a bright light into the window   |
| of a mobile home in Staunton, Virginia. The UFO was football-shaped,  |
| about the size of a car, and made a faint buzzing noise. (Source:     |
| APRO Bulletin, February 1985, p. 7).                                  |

| 1989 - In 1989, according to a report in the MUFON UFO Journal, a security   |
| guard and an air traffic controller at Air Force Facility 42 in       |
| Palmdale, California witnessed a silver flying object and three       |
| orb-shaped UFOs at 7:45 p.m. during testing of the B1-B bomber. There |
| was also a rumor of an abduction occurring on this date at the same   |
| facility. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, November 1990).                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1989 - At 10:30 p.m. a disc-shaped object that emitted beams of light |
| was observed from directly underneath in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico.       |
| (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, Seattle,     |

| 1992 - In 1992 a 28-year-old man in Londonderry, New Hampshire was watching  |
| star-like lights move around outside his window, and was hoping to    |
| get a good photograph of what was going on when a structured          |
| unidentified craft came flying over the trees and flew slowly down    |
| his street, twice. Strangely, he made no attempt during this close    |
| encounter to take a photograph. (Source: Ken Foster, MUFON            |
| investigation files # 930406Eb; MUFON UFO Journal, June 1993).        |
|                                                                       |
| 1996 - Several people were staying at a country home in rural Apache  |
| County, Arizona. They were sitting around the kitchen table at 10:30  |
| p.m. when two of them saw a bright UFO streak by, apparently crashing |
| in the distance. They all lept into a jeep and raced off in search    |
| for the crashed object. They crossed State Highway 61, drove along an |
| old cattle trail, and soon came upon an elderly couple standing next  |
| to their parked van on the road side; both were staring off into the  |
| countryside. They asked them if they had seen a UFO crash, and were   |
| told by them that they were also trying to find it. The elderly       |
| couple had been driving west on Highway 61 toward Show Low when they  |
| saw the object streak by and appear to crash. They all then drove on  |
| to the apparent crash site. This area had only a few trees, scattered |
| cedar and junipers, and a lot of rocks and canyons. After driving for |
| about an hour they came to a very deep canyon and could drive no      |
| further. Deep in the canyon was the crashed UFO. It was an oblong,    |
| egg shaped object, about the size of a barn. Its color was            |
| strange--it was described as the color of skin with a fading tan, and |
| it faintly glowed. The glow was sufficiently bright enough to         |
| illuminate the bottom of the canyon. There were two "pillars" at the  |
| front of the object. These pillars may have been posted on either     |
| side of a door, although a doorway was not visible. The witnesses     |
| also claimed they saw a helicopter at the scene, and a black pick-up  |
| truck. They were baffled as to how the truck could have gotten down   |
| into the remote canyon so quickly, unless there was some road they    |
| did not know about. They watched the scene for awhile, then left.     |

| 1997 - In 1997 three people witnessed a fluorescent flying object as it flew |
| over White Plains, New York. It made no sound. (Source: Peter         |

| 1999 - A somewhat round but irregularly shaped object, with a surface        |
| texture "like a sponge", flew near a mountain in Trail, British       |
| Columbia at 10:30 p.m. in 1999. (Source: Peter Davenport, National    |

| 2004 - Around 7:00 p.m. a rounded "A"-shaped object was seen moving   |
