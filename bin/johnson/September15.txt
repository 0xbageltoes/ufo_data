| 1954 - At 3:20 a.m. a red disc-shaped object surrounded by a green    |
| halo was sighted by a married couple in Roubaix, Nord department,     |
| France for 35 seconds. It rose vertically until a point of light, and |
| disappeared when at the zenith. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers  |

| 1954 - At 8:45 p.m. a red cigar-shaped shaped object reappeared over  |
| the town of Bois-en-Ardres, Pas-de-Calais, France and circled the     |
| area, giving off a red and white glow. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying   |

| 1954 - Driving on a secondary road at around 11:00 p.m. in Feurs, St. |
| Etienne, Loire department, France the witness's car engine quit. Soon |
| a bright saucer-shaped object descended and landed very close to the  |
| car. A small being, described as wearing a Hitler-like uniform, ran   |
| by the car and was seen by several observers. It ran away from the    |
| group of witnesses when they attempted to approach and communicate    |
| with him. The craft soon took off. A dog was supposedly excited       |
| during the encounter. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case |

| 1954 - A white light suddenly swept the road in front of Roland M.,   |
| age 19, who was driving in Feyzin, Rhone department, France at 11:30  |
| p.m. He observed that it came from a large, dark object shaped like   |
| an ellipse about ten meters above the ground, 50 meters away. It flew |
| away, making a noise like wet fireworks, and throwing magnesium-like  |
| sparks. (Sources: Le Parisien, September 29, 1954; Aime Michel,       |

| 1962 - Two bright discs were first seen at 5:00 p.m., then again at   |
| 6:00 p.m., at the state line near Oradell, New Jersey. Two witnesses  |
| saw one round object with a fin on top, and another under it at 7:50  |
| p.m., and reported that it was going down toward the Oradell          |
| Reservoir. Three young men next saw and heard the object as it        |
| touched the water. Another witness called the police. The luminous    |
| object took off a few minutes later. The official investigation       |
| described it as bright, surrounded with a glow, and the apparent size |
| of a small plane one kilometer away. It left flying toward the south. |

| 1963 - At six o'clock in the evening Mrs. F. E. Roush of Vandalia,    |
| Ohio reported seeing two very bright gold objects in the sky, one     |
| shaped like a banana and the other like an ear of corn. One UFO       |
| remained stationary while the other moved from west to north. The     |
| sighting lasted 10 minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook   |

| 1965 - Two policemen, John Lockem and Koos de Klerk, were on patrol   |
| on the Pretoria-Bronkhorstspruit Road in Silverton, South Africa just |
| before midnight when their headlights illuminated a disc-shaped       |
| object resting on the road. It was 10 meters in diameter              |
| and copper-colored. Ten seconds later it took off in a pool of flames |
| at high speed. The tar on the road kept burning for some time after   |
| the UFO left, leaving behind a large hole in the bitumen. (Sources:   |

| 1965 - At 11:45 p.m. in Sudbury, Massachusetts Mr. R. Schofield's car |
| engine skipped and the lights dimmed, and he stopped to check engine  |
| in midst of rainstorm. When the driver got out of the car, he saw a   |

| 1967 - The carcass of a horse named "Lady", but misnamed in press     |
| reports as "Snippy", was discovered mutilated on a ranch outside of   |
| Alamosa, Colorado. Unusual radioactivity and strange traces were      |
| claimed to have been found at the spot. This was the first highly     |
| publicized case of many more such animal and cattle mutilations to    |
| occur in the San Luis Valley. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to    |

| 1967 - In Winsted, Connecticut at 8:45 p.m. two teenage girls         |
| observed a large, glowing object, and three small figures, about 1.25 |
| meters tall, with oversized heads, running across a road near a barn. |
| From the object came a noise similar to that of "a power mower when   |
| it fires but fails to start." The object blacked out, and the figures |
| hid while a car passed, afterwards the object pulsated between very   |
| bright white and dull red, and moved diagonally several times.        |

| 1968 - Near Ocala, Florida. 9:30 p.m. Missionary pilot Jay Cole,      |
| flying a Beech C-45 twin-engine utility plane, observed an            |
| unidentified light performing aerobatics in the night sky. He watched |
| it for 15 minutes before it vanished. A second light appeared,        |
| heading toward Cole's plane on a collision course. It made a          |
| 90-degree turn and disappeared. Later, ground radar told them a       |
| target had been following them. The two sightings lasted a total of   |
| 15 minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).    |

| 1973 - At 7:30 p.m. a 13-year-old boy and some other younger children |
| watched a lighted disc-shaped UFO slowly descend over a neighborhood  |
| in North Royalton, Ohio. It then hovered silently overhead. They      |
| could see three lighted windows and behind them several occupants     |
| were inside and they appeared to be looking down. They were described |
| as having large oblong shaped heads that seemed too big for their     |
| thin necks. They appeared to be leaning on something, and their long  |
| skinny arms were crossing each other. The craft suddenly turned off   |
| its lights and ascended quickly out of sight. (Source: Albert S.      |

| 1975 - In August 1975 about 20 people in and around Gilroy,           |
| California saw unexplained red and white lights in the sky on         |
| successive nights. On August 10, a lighted object followed and badly  |
| frightened 12-year-old Imelda Victor and another woman as they were   |
| driving to the girl's house. The girl's mother also saw the object,   |
| which had "four large landing gear like arms coming out of it." On    |
| this night Mrs. Victor (a doctor by profession), woke up to find two  |
| beings in silvery suits standing near her in her bedroom. They had    |
| small slits for eyes, the nose and the mouth. She felt very calm.     |
| They asked her telepathically to go with them, and she found herself  |
| floating up into a hovering UFO. As she floated up she clearly saw    |
| the roof of the house and the stars. Inside, she had a sensation of   |
| intense beauty, with emerald colored floors. The walls were silvery,  |
| smooth, and with large round instruments. She was then blinded by a   |
| white light, and the next thing she remembers she woke up in bed.     |

| 1976 - On this night in Los Teques, Venezuela a man ran to the gate   |
| of the textile plant were he works, in a state of shock and terror.   |
| He collapsed and was sent to the local hospital. He later claimed     |
| that he had seen a disc-shaped object land, and had a confrontation   |
| with several undescribed occupants from the object. For two months    |
| there were nightsly UFO sightings in the area. (Source: FSR, November |

| 1977 - Paciencia, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. At 2:20 a.m. Antonio  |
| La Rubia, age 33, a bus driver, was en route to work when he saw a    |
| flying saucer in a field that looked like an enormous hat.            |
| Frightened, he started to run when a blue light beam lit up the area, |
| and he found that he could not move. At the same time, three very odd |
| figures materialized nearby him. The figures were about four feet     |
| tall, with football-shaped heads or helmets and a tall antenna on     |
| top. The only features he could make out of the heads were a row of   |
| shiny, small, mirror-like sections around the center of the head,     |
| from which blue flashes were being emitted. The beings had stocky     |
| bodies and long, elephant trunk-like arms ending in a single digit.   |
| Their robot-like bodies were covered by a rough metallic surface he   |
| believed could have been the body surface, or skin. Their bodies were |
| rounded at the bottom and surmounted a single leg, like a pedestal,   |
| with a rounded base.                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| The three creatures surrounded La Rubia, and he was captured inside   |
| an invisible glass or "bell jar." The robots floated above the ground |
| and one pointed a syringe like device at him and he began to move     |
| toward the object. The next thing he knew he was inside the craft     |
| with no recollection of how he entered it. He was in a white          |
| "aluminum" corridor, with one transparent wall, through which he      |
| could see the field from which he had just come. Two figures went one |
| way, the third another. He could see through the transparent wall     |
| that the object was airborne. A bright blue light came on, and he     |
| found himself in a large circular hall. There were a dozen similar    |
| entities on either side of the hall; they reminded him of children    |
| sitting in a schoolroom on single legged chairs. Up until now he had  |
| been unable to speak, but suddenly he found his voice and began       |
| screaming, "Who are you? What do you want from me?" The figures fell  |
| back at the sound and tumbled all over the floor. They lifted their   |
| single digits to the antennae on their heads and held them. These     |
| tips rotated so rapidly that only when they held them could he see    |
| them clearly.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| He noticed a small box-like device standing on two poles that raised  |
| it to about the height of his chest. An antennae jutted up from each  |
| end of the box, and a receptacle stood atop it. The robot-like        |
| entities removed small devices from the belts around their waists,    |
| and placed them in this container, pushing a key on the box.          |
| When this happened, a scene would appear on the wall in moving color. |
| The first showed Antonio, lying naked, on an unseen table, while he   |
| was being examined by a being with a small bluish light, while        |
| another being examined his head. Another "slide" was projected and    |
| showed Antonio, still naked, standing alone. Other images included a  |
| view of him dressed and carrying a shopping bag, with his teeth       |
| chattering; another showed a horse and cart on a dirt road, with a    |
| barefoot peasant wearing a straw hat. Another picture of him showed   |
| him next to an orange ball, and then next to a blue ball beside which |
| stood another entity. The next slide showed an image of a big dog     |
| attacking one of the entities, and the being began melting from top   |
| to bottom, until it was nothing but a porridge like substance. Then   |
| in the "film" one of the entities moved toward the dog and pointed a  |
| syringe like device at the animal and it too began melting, after     |
| turning blue. A UFO "factory" was displayed in another image; then a  |
| train entering a tunnel; and a view of a busy Rio thoroughfare. One   |
| scene showed La Rubia vomiting and defecating into his clothes.       |
|                                                                       |
| During this display, an entity approached and pointed a syringe at    |
| him; his arm was raised against his will and the syringe was stuck    |
| into his middle finger, taking a blood sample, but leaving no mark.   |
| The entity then pointed it at a wall and drew three red circles       |
| intersected with an "L". The next thing he remembered was being       |
| thrown overboard, where he found himself once again in the street,    |
| with all his belongings, as well as one of the beings. His watch had  |
| stopped at 2:20 a.m. The being then vanished, and the object ascended |
| out of view. His head was spinning and he was burning. The            |
| time was 3:55 a.m. Anotonio was eventually taken to a hospital, where |
| he suffered from sporadically high fevers and insatiable thirst.      |

| 1978 - At four o'clock in the morning a 26-year-old woman in          |
| Carpentersville, Illinois was awakened by a whirring sound and she    |
| went to her bedroom window to look outside. The noise stopped, but    |
| then she saw the figure of a six-foot tall man. He was dressed in a   |
| silvery suit. Several feet away from him she saw a small, silver,     |
| domed disc sitting on the edge of the grass. It was opaque and smooth |
| and was the source of the whirring sound. The witness then screamed   |
| at her husband to wake up, and her dog started barking furiously.     |
| They both tried to phone the police but the phone was not working.    |
| When the police eventually arrived both the mysterious visitor and    |
| the UFO were gone. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| 1978 - The principal witness and her family had seen a shiny          |
| disc-shaped flying object hovering near their farmhouse in Edmunston, |
| New Brunswick, Canada late this night. The witness could only recall  |
| vague memories after this, but she remembers the police were called.  |
| Years later her mother told her that she had seen the disc land and   |
| saw figures come out of it. The next night she woke up thirsty and    |
| asked her father to bring her a glass of water. As she followed her   |
| dad to the kitchen she noticed an odd smell, which was at the same    |
| time smokey and sweet. She then noticed a small being walking behind  |
| her. It was about four feet tall, grayish green in color, and had no  |

| 1996 - A young backpacker, Ricardo Machado Oliveira, was exploring a  |
| remote mountain cave near Cabeca da Penha Mountain, Portugal and      |
| while in it apparently passed out. When he came to, he found himself  |
| in a vast underground hangar surrounded by "three distinct species of |
| aliens". Nearby were several silvery ovoid craft. The aliens told     |
| Ricardo that they were part of an alliance of interstellar worlds     |
| engaged in observing Earth. Their base under the Serra da Guardunha   |
| Mountains was one of four such bases. Immediately after hearing this  |
| Ricardo blacked out again. When he opened his eyes, he was lying on   |
| the ground right outside the cave. In the 14th century, at the same   |
| cave, a little girl from a nearby village vanished for three days.    |
| When she was finally found, she told the search party that she had    |
| been cared for by "a lady in white", who had offered her water to     |
| drink from a bell. Some have attributed this to a visitation by the   |
| Blessed Virgin Mary. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1996 Humanoid        |

| 1996 - St Seurin D'Uzet, Charente Maritime department, France. At     |
| around 8:00 p.m. a witness was standing in his garden when he saw a   |
| bizarre object, which descended until it touched down of the surface  |
| of the Gironde River. Using a pair of binoculars, from about 200-300  |
| meters away, he saw a figure suddenly appears, along with what        |
| resembled an inflatable orange raft at the being's feet. The being    |
| then began to float against the current on the orange "raft". At the  |
| same time there was a reported power blackout in the area. (Sources:  |

| 2002 - At 2:45 a.m. Denny Unger decided to step outside on a clear    |
| and windless night in Leduc, Alberta, Canada. He saw three points of  |
| light forming a flying triangle. "My first thought was that I was     |
| having a dizing spell, so I refocused, and the lights were there."    |
| Thirty seconds later the flying triangle of lights changed direction  |
| from north to east, and appeared to blot out stars as it passed them  |
| without making any sound. The lights on each tip were solid white,    |
| but of low intensity. He had the distinct impression that the corner  |
| lights were used to camouflage the object, and it was doing its best  |
| not to be seen. It was completely silent. He grabbed his video camera |
| inside the house and began filming the object, but soon lost sight of |
| it as it flew behind a neighbor's house. A triangle formation of      |
| lights was all that was captured on video. (Source: George A. Filer & |

| 2002 - At 8:00 p.m. a husband and wife and their two children were    |
| driving home to Mercier, Quebec from their country place near         |
| Huntington when the wife sighted what appeared to be really bright    |
| stars. After five minutes, as they got closer the two lights ahead    |
| changed position, and what she saw gave her shivers. It was a         |
| distinct flying triangular shape, with lights at all three corners,   |
| unlike any aircraft and larger than a Boeing 747. Her husband said he |
| could "see through it". They all watched the low flying object for 10 |
| minutes as it flew overhead. (Sources: George A. Filer &David E.      |

| 2002 - At about 9:35 p.m. a witness driving a van in                  |
| Poquoson, Virginia saw a bright light streaking across the sky.       |
| Stopped van, watched it travel across sky at an extremely high rate   |

| no aircraft up that night. He also contacted the local TV station but |
| they had had no other calls. (Source: George A. Filer & David E.      |
