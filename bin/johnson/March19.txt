| 1950 - In 1950 in Sonderborg, Denmark at 2:30 a.m., mechanic J. Matiszewski  |
| heard a whistling sound that drew him outside. He then watched a UFO  |
| land in a meadow. When he approached to within 50 meters he suddenly  |
| felt paralyzed, and he observed that birds and cows in the vicinity   |
| were also unable to move. He stood motionless as four handsome men    |
| with brown complexions, wearing shiny black suits and translucent     |
| helmets, emerged from the craft and engaged in repair activities.     |

| 1953 - In 1953 US Army spotter planes saw a round white UFO flying 25 miles  |
| northeast of Panmunjon, Korea. It was described as 10 feet in         |
| diameter, and moving with a vibrating motion. (Source: Dominique      |

| 1958 - A large, disc-shaped object was seen on the ground near        |
| Moscow, Russia. It rose in a spiral motion, then took off and was     |
| lost from sight. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A      |

| 1959 - At 8:45 p.m. on this day in 1959 a metallic disc, six meters in       |
| diameter, paced a car on highway 124 southeast of Kyger, Ohio.        |
| Electromagnetic effects noted at the time of this close encounter     |
| were a buzzing on the car radio and the dimming of the headlights and |
| dashboard lights. (Source: Gallipolis (Ohio) Daily Tribune, March 20, |

| 1959 - Fifteen minutes later, at 9:00 p.m., two seminary roommates    |
| were outdoors on the grounds of the Lady of Grace Monastery in        |
| Colebrook, New Hampshire when they saw a silvery colored,             |
| Saturn-shaped, ovoid UFO descend over them. The craft had lighted     |
| windows around its lower portion and blinking red, yellow, and green  |
| lights around its outer rim. It also emitted a loud humming sound.    |
| The craft flew towards and then retreated from the witnesses several  |
| times. They apparently suffered a period of amnesia. Years later      |
| under hypnosis one of the witnesses recalled that the craft landed    |
| nearby on three legs and all normal noises ceased. They both were     |
| paralyzed and were both then floated up a ramp and taken onboard the  |
| craft, where they communicated by telepathy with four humanoids of    |
| differing heights, including a taller six-foot tall being that        |
| appeared to be the leader. Both were given physical exams and several |
| experiments were conducted on them. They were able to see a "mother   |
| ship" and other craft through a window in the UFO on which they flew, |
| and were taken onboard the larger craft where they saw other human    |
| abductees. (Sources: Morton Schaffer, MUFON field investigations      |

| 1966 - In the pre-dawn hours of 1966, police and others in La Porte, Indiana |
| saw a 40-foot-long luminous football shaped object surrounded by      |
| misty white rings. It emitted a brilliant white light as it paced a   |
| police car. It was described as having horn-shaped antenna-like       |
| projections on the underside that were 13-14 feet long. (Source: Fred |
| V. Sacksteder, Flying Saucers, October 1966, p. 15). At 5:20 a.m. an  |
| elliptical UFO with a row of lights along the bottom was seen over    |
| Big Rapids, Michigan. The lights flickered on-and-off one at a time.  |

| 1966 - At 6 p.m. a flat-topped cone-shaped UFO w oval-shaped windows  |
| hovered over Niteroi, Brazil. It was viewed through binoculars as it  |
| flew slowly to the west, then shot off towards the east as jet        |
| aircraft pursued it. (Source: Irene Granchi, UFO Abductions and       |
| Reports from Brazil, p. 44). That night at 11:10 p.m. three crewman   |
| aboard the Coast Guard Cutter "Legare" had a close encounter with an  |
| oval-shaped UFO near Freeport, Texas. There was a power failure in    |
| the city at the time. (Source: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence      |

| 1968 - At 8:30 p.m. ten-year-old Gregory L. Wells was returning from  |
| his grandmother's house to his own home next door, when he saw a red  |
| oval-shaped UFO hovering just over some trees. The large red object   |
| was so bright that it illuminated the road. It had a band of dimmer   |
| red lights flashing around its center. "I stopped," Gregory recalled. |
| "I wanted to run or scream but suddenly a big tube came out of the    |
| bottom, which moved from side to side until it came to me, and a beam |
| of light shot out." Gregory turned away as the light beam hit the     |
| upper part of his arm, knocking him to the ground. His jacket caught  |
| fire and the boy rolled around on the ground screaming with fright.   |
| Both his mother and grandmother responded. Mrs. James Wells, the      |
| boy's mother, also reported seeing the UFO, which "just faded away."  |
| During the sighting a large street light on a nearby pole went out    |
| and the dog barked uncontrollably. The burning jacket resulted in     |
| second-degree burns that required medical attention. (Sources: Coral  |

| 1969 - Near Gladstone, Queensland, Australia a saucer-shaped object   |
| approached two cars, hovered near one car, and began pulsating. As it |
| got brighter, the cars' headlights spread wider than usual; as it     |
| dimmed, the headlights went back to normal. The two cars kept driving |
| together, but the craft again came to hover over one of the cars. The |
| drivers stopped again, but this time nothing happened to the          |
| headlights. The object rocked gently while keeping its position.      |
| After a few minutes of hovering it flew quickly into the distance.    |

| 1969 - In 1969 Renato Bifarella of Caltanissetta, Italy on the island of     |
| Sicily was looking at the sky with binoculars on a night of a full    |
| moon, when at 1:35 a.m. he saw what resembled a “tortoise” hovering   |
| in the sky. It was green in color with pale brown spots, and had      |
| “legs” underneath. It was 5-6 meters wide and four meters high, with  |
| a brilliantly lit turret in which he could see at least two figures   |
| moving about. It approached him, and emitted a beam of pink light     |
| that struck him and caused him to faint. When he regained             |
| consciousness, he could see that the UFO had led down two thick       |
| “ropes” that were one meter in thickness. Through binoculars he was   |
| able to see that two humanoid figures—one in red overalls and the     |
| other in white, with blue helmets---were climbing toward the object.  |
| The witness fainted again, and when he came to, the object was gone.  |

| 1972 - In 1972 at 10 p.m. in Acuescoma, Mexico at least four people saw a    |
| glowing blue sphere land. It rose giving off blue sparks and making a |
| humming sound. It also left four imprints in the ground forming a     |
| square 2.5 meters wide, and a central burn mark. (Source: Skylook,    |
| July 1972, p. 9). There was an electromagnetic effects case that      |
| evening in Chard, England. (Source: Harold Watkins, FSR Case          |

| 1974 - In 1974 a witness in Gerena, Spain looked out the window of his home  |
| and saw a two meter diameter disc only four meters away from the      |
| house. Two helmeted heads of little men were visible inside the       |
| craft. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, volume 141).                   |

| 1975 - In 1975 two police officers in Stockton, California saw an object     |
| hovering over parts of the city on four separate occasions, beginning |
| at 1:20 a.m. The UFO was seen changing shape from a cigar to round in |
| appearance. The Stockton city desk sergeant vouched for the veracity  |
| of the two police officers. (Source: KLOK radio transcript, CUFOS     |
| files).                                                               |

| 1976 - In 1976 a flying disc paced a car with three people inside very       |
| closely in Big Run, Pennsylvania. White beams of light were directed  |
| into the car from the UFO. It flew away when the car reached a        |
| highway intersection. An independent observer witnessed the incident. |

| 1980 - In the evening in 1980 a 29-year-old man on a motorcycle was chased   |
| for over an hour by a small, oval-shaped UFO. The UFO was about two   |
| feet in diameter and had sparks shooting out of it in all directions. |
| It flew low above the ground. That same evening a golden colored UFO  |
| hovered over the Mississippi River for 50 minutes near Keithsberg,    |
| Illinois. It moved back and forth, descending and ascending over the  |
| trees along the riverbank. (Sources: UFO Newsclipping Service, May    |

| 1992 - In 1992 at 3:52 a.m. in Haines City, Florida police officer Delgado   |
| had a close encounter of the second kind with a 15-foot-wide green,   |
| domed disc that paced his patrol car. The engine, lights, and two-way |
| radio of his car failed when the UFO passed less than 20 feet         |
| overhead, and he felt the interior of his vehicle become cold.        |

| 1993 - In 1993 a huge flying saucer loomed over a water tank in the state    |
| forest near Guanica, Puerto Rico at 9:40 p.m. It was silent and lit   |
| up the area. (Source: Larry Hatch, U database, case 15994).           |

| 1995 - In 1995 anomalous radar echoes were recorded in the Central European  |
| surveillance area by the region's air traffic controllers. That night |
| in Franklin, Georgia a young woman's bedroom was invaded by short,    |
| gremlin-like creatures with yellowish-brown skin, large pointed ears, |
| and large round eyes. They stood about 3.5 feet tall, and she         |
| believed she received telepathic messages from them. She had a strong |
| sense that her actions were being controlled by them, and she was     |
| forced to go back to sleep despite the alarm that she felt. That same |
| evening a UFO landed on a lawn in Mobile, Alabama. The object was     |
| dark and its features could not be discerned, but it flashed bright   |
| lights into the home on the property. (Sources: Illobrand von         |

| 1997 - In 1997 at 4:05 a.m. police in La Escala, Spain saw a yellow light    |
| near the ground change color to orange. There was a 4-meter tall      |
| shadowy human figure in the center of the light. One witness          |
| attempted to photograph it, but the light dimmed, became oval shaped, |
| and vanished. Flattened grass was discovered at the site. Seven hours |
| later, at 5:05 EST, a driver in Nottingham, New Hampshire watched     |
| several golf ball sized balls-of-light zig-zag only a meter away from |
| near his driver's side outside car mirror. He heard a voice in his    |
| head that told him to drive west. He refused and drove north instead. |
| He then lost control of the car and saw a cylindrical UFO approach,   |
| the approximate size of a small 12-passenger bus. The telepathic      |
| messages he received included warnings about future events. (Source:  |
