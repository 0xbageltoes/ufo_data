| the airport on Terciera Island in the Azores sighted a UFO shaped     |
| like a stovepipe. It had a central bulge and short wings; they        |
| estimated it was 10 in length, three feet in diameter, and had wings  |
| three feet long. The wings of the object had concave wingtips, and it |
| was gray in color. The UFO made a gargling sound when hovering, then  |
| disappeared into the glare of the airplane's landing lights. The      |
| sighting lasted 4-5 minutes. (Sources: Project Blue Book files        |

| 1966 - A cigar-shaped object with satellite objects was seen in       |
| Rushville, Indiana for over an hour by a group of women, beginning at |
| 6:35 p.m. There were other UFO sightings by other witnesses at 7:30   |
| p.m. and 8 p.m. (Source: APRO Bulletin, November-December 1966, p.    |
| 5).                                                                   |

| 1967 - In Santa Adelita, Sao Paolo State, Brazil Mr. P, age 51, was   |
| driving home at around 11:00 p.m. when he came to the top of a ridge  |
| he saw an aluminum colored object hovering 200 feet away, just four   |
| feet above the ground.  It was plate shaped with a convex bottom      |
| side, and about 30 feet in diameter. When he got to within 50 feet of |
| it his car motor stopped. He described the object as "full of         |
| lights", red and other colors, which alternately blinked on and off.  |
| Standing near the saucer was a robustly built man about 5-1/2 feet    |
| tall, dressed in a light colored garment (the witness could not       |
| specify the color because he was color blind). This being walked in   |
| front of the witness and turned on a very bright white beam of light  |
| from a flashlight like object. The witness thought he would be        |
| assaulted, so he half opened the car door, steadied his .22 revolver  |
| on it, and fired 6 shots at the UFO occupant. He reported that he was |
| a good shot with this revolver, and after shooting he could no longer |
| see him. Then the saucer-shaped craft began to oscillate, and he      |
| heard a sound like a cowbell. At last, the UFO flew away on an        |
| oblique course. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:        |

| 1970 - At 4:40 p.m. while driving three kilometers east of Helleland, |
| Norway Mr. Salvesen had just come to a transformer station on his     |
| right when he was temporarily blinded by a blue-white light that hurt |
| his eyes. A ball of light 20 feet in diameter came down on a slope.   |
| Inside was a shiny, domed disc-shaped object. Its rim was a steel     |
| blue color. He had some lasting eye injury as the result of his       |
| encounter. (Source: Andre Liljegren, FSR Case Histories, April 1971,  |

| 1972 - A metallic gray, domed disc was seen on a clear day by a young |
| woman in Ghlin, Hainaut, Belgium at 10:40 a.m. It had a well-defined  |
| outline, and moved slower than a plane. It moved in a straight        |
| trajectory, from northwest to southwest. (Source: Vertongen Jean-Luc  |

| 1973 - At 5:20 p.m. Carlos Argue Balvidares, age 43, the manager of a |
| country estate located 25 kilometers northeast of General Pinto, in   |
| Buenos Aires province, Argentina was drinking tea when his            |
| 13-year-old son Manuel called his attention to the presence of three  |
| people floating in the air over the surface of a pond 100 yards away. |
| Balvidares went to the pond and called out to them. They "disappeared |
| immediately, only to return to show themselves at the opposite shore  |
| of the pond, 300 yards away."                                         |
|                                                                       |
| (Continued.) There were two men and a woman. The woman was about 5' 3" tall and    |
| had long black hair, black clothing, and white boots. The two men     |
| were both of the same height and somewhat shorter. The men appeared   |
| to be naked and of a "sunburned" color; they may have been wearing    |
| tight fitting one-piece suits. They were blond, and their hair        |
| appeared "glued on." All three had white complexions, wide foreheads, |
| and small noses. They floated about with their arms held close to     |
| their bodies.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| (Continued) On the far side of the pond rested a luminous rectangular object      |
| approximately 35 feet in diameter and 7-10 feet high. It emitted a    |
| beam of light 15 inches in diameter that struck Balvidares. He felt   |
| dazzled and he could feel heat from it. Balvidares took his horse and |
| rode to the pond, but when he had got halfway there he encountered an |
| "invisible barrier" and could not proceed. Meanwhile the beings       |
| continued to maneuver over the surface of the pond, communicating by  |
| "a kind of shriek, like the sound made by a radio which is poorly     |
| tuned."                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| After an hour and a half Balvidares again mounted his horse to ride   |
| around the pond, but this time the beings returned to the UFO. The    |
| images of the men changed in color to dark green and orange" as they  |
| approached the craft. Then the witness smelled "an odor of sulphur"   |
| and became drowsy for a few moments. When he recovered the UFO and    |
| its entities had gone. On later investigation many triangular         |
| footprints four to five inches long, showing four claw marks at the   |
| front of the triangle, were found in the vicinity of the UFO's        |
| resting place. The object itself left four triangular impressions 15  |
| inches on a side, arranged in a square 13 feet on a side. The horse   |
| "exhibited nervousness" after the event, and its hair began to fall   |
| out. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of      |

| 1975 - A 15-year-old teenager in Mount Healthy, Ohio had a close      |
| encounter with a cylindrical UFO at around 8:00 p.m. He reported that |
| it was only 25 feet overhead, and completely silent. Red lights       |
| rotated on the bottom of the object. When it left it shot straight    |
| up. (Source: Leonard H. Stringfield, Situation Red: The UFO Siege, p. |

| 1975 - Beginning at 10 p.m. an unknown object maneuved over the town  |
| of Sao Goncalo do Amarante, Ceara State, Brazil at low altitude for   |
| two hours, causing panic. It shot beams of blue and orange toward the |
| ground; it stopped for a few minutes over a filling station, causing  |
| a power outage. (Source: Claude Bourtembourg, SOBEPS News, March      |

| 1976 - At 8:25 p.m. six young men were out playing near a walled      |
| playing field next to a local cemetery in Baracaldo, Spain when       |
| they heard a loud crackling sound. Two of the boys next noticed an    |
| object resembling a telephone booth and emitting a red and white      |
| light descend towards the walled in field, so they ran to the field   |
| and saw it land behind some bushes on three legs. An oval-shaped      |
| opening became visible from which a red light shone. Then two very    |
| tall human like figures emerged. The figures wore tight-fitting black |
| diving suits and wide bright belts. The figures walked slowly towards |
| the wall, and the two boys could now see bright shiny eyes but no     |
| other facial features. One of the humanoids banged on the wall        |
| several times, and then both walked to the center of the yard. One of |
| them then pulled out a long thin object from a sack he was wearing on |
| his side and pointed it at the wall, and a long thin beam of light    |
| came from the device and hit the wall several times; at one point the |
| beam turned white. Moments later both figures walked back to their    |
| craft. At this point the teens ran to tell their families and so did  |
| not see the object depart. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |

| 1976 - A man was walking his dog in a local park in Toronto, Ontario  |
| at around 10 p.m. when a fluorescent bluish green light descended     |
| from the sky and enveloped him. He then saw something resembling a    |
| television screen in front of him. Soon images of apparently          |
| extraterrestrial figures appeared and communicated with the witness.  |
| His dog was terrified during the encounter and the witness suffered   |
| from general malaise afterwards. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid |

| 1977 - On this evening on Mosqueiro Island, near Colares, Para State, |
| Brazil Benedito Campos and his 17-year-old wife Silvia Mara were at   |
| home when they spotted an oval-shaped, silvery object emitting a      |
| greenish beam, like a searchlight, towards the room where they were   |
| lying in bed. Curious, they approached a small window and as they     |
| did, the beam shot in through the window and made straight for        |
| Silvia, throwing her into some sort of benumbed, trance-like state.   |
| Silvia, who was pregnant at the time, then fainted. Two humanoid      |
| entities then entered the house, carrying something resembling a gold |
| flashlight; again the beam struck Silvia, this time hitting her in    |
| the left arm at wrist level. Benedito ran to a neighbor's house and   |
| was also briefly paralyzed by a light beam. Both husband and wife     |
| were later taken to a local hospital, were they both recovered.       |
| However, Benedito suffered from depression after the incident.        |

| 2000 - A powerful-sounding, mystery triangle-shaped craft hovered low |

| 2002 - A witness named Ed reported that on the evening of October 29, |
| at about 5:20 p.m., he sighted two triangle-shaped object flying over |
| his home, located 15 miles southeast of Spokane, Washington. Ov the   |
| hills to the east he first noticed a very bright light on an object   |
| heading WSW. It had a bright white headlight, and what looked like    |
| normal red and green navigation lights on the wing tips, a white      |
| strobe light on the bottom, and dim white lights on the underside     |
| corners. He also heard what sounded like a muted jet aircraft engine  |
| sound. However, what seemed out of place was the extremely bright,    |
| single headlight on the nose, not the normal landing lights. Within a |
| minute he saw a second similar craft with three dim lights in the     |
| corners, and no discernable fuselage. He contacted Fairchild AFB and  |
| talked with the Public Affairs officer, who basically said that       |
| unless an unidentified aircraft appeared on their radar, "we don't    |
| care!" He added, "I just want to emphasize that the B-2 and the F-117 |
| fighter have a distinctive 'saw-tooth' pattern to the trailing edge   |
| of their wings. The craft which I observed appeared to have a         |
| perfectly straight trailing edge--just like a triangle and was at     |
| least as large as the B-2." (Source: George A. Filer & David E.       |
