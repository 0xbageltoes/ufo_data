| 1947 - Harold A. Dahl, his son, and others on board a boat allegedly  |
| saw six donut-shaped objects, 30 meters in diameter, metallic with    |
| dark openings, over a bay next to Maury Island on Puget Sound,        |
| Washington. One of the UFOs exploded, showered the witnesses with a   |
| slag-like metal. This case has been widely regarded as a hoax because |
| of some deliberate deception of UFO investigator Kenneth Arnold by a  |
| shadowy con man named Chrisman who claimed to have been involved, but |
| there are still unexplained elements to this case. (Source: Jacques   |

| 1947 - Eight disc-shaped objects the size of a house were seen flying |
| at 1,000 kph at 11:55 a.m. in Spokane, Washington. A woman stated     |

| 1952 - Near Kelly AFB, Texas. At 12:30 p.m. Sgt. Howard Davis, the    |
| flight engineer of a B-29 bomber flying at 8,000' altitude, witnessed |
| a flat object with a sharply pointed front and rounded rear. It was   |
| white with a dark blue center and red rim. It trailed sparks as it    |
| dove past the B-29 at a distance of 500 feet for a very brief time.   |

| 1952 - At 11:00 p.m. that night at the Oak Ridge, Tennessee nuclear   |
| facility a radar target was picked up and later sighted as a          |
| featureless nocturnal light over the AEC site by a member of the      |

| 1954 - Mr. and Mrs. Guy Baker saw a hovering, domed disc-shaped       |
| object in Ridgeway, Ontario. It was about 14 meters in diameter (40   |
| feet) and had several rotating, flashing lights around the rim. They  |
| drove their car to get a closer look. The object crossed the road in  |
| front of the car and landed in a field. The car stalled and they had  |
| to push it because it would not re-start, although it had never given |
| them trouble before the incident or since. They watched as the lights |
| moved around in the area. They found a large, brown, circular spot in |
| the pasture where the disk had been resting. (Sources: Gregory Falla, |

| 1965 - An unidentified submarine object (USO) was sighted by a pilot  |
| flying east of Fraser Island, off Maryborough, Queensland, Australia  |

| 1967 - Cordoba, Argentina - Four days prior of a massive wave of UFO   |
| sightings in the region, a man dressed in black showed up at the      |
| newsroom of Cordoba's Los Principios daily newspaper, where he        |
| dropped off a letter addressed to the editor stating that before the  |
| week was out the Southern Cone would experience a massive flyover     |
| involving hundreds of extraterrestrial craft. The day before the      |
| sightings began, the newspaper received a phone call stating,         |

| 1968 - A man riding his bicycle in Miramar, Argentina encountered a   |
| large object moving only 50 centimeters above the ground. At 1:30     |
| a.m. the domed, disc-shaped object flew extremely low, nearly hugging |
| the ground, and traveled from north to south while illuminating the   |
| ground with a vertical beam of red light. The top of the object       |
| appeared to be spinning. It suddenly increased in speed and           |
| left. Calcination traces were found by police. (Sources: Jacques      |

| 1970 - Paul Foster, in the St. Helliers section of Auckland, New      |
| Zealand, saw a figure about 20 yards away from him while working on a |
| car. It was facing in the opposite direction. Viewed from the rear,   |
| the humanoid was about 5'9" tall and wore a one-piece blue coverall,  |
| the legs of which were tucked into mud covered boots. The man carried |
| a leather case on his left hip attached to a strap over his right     |
| shoulder, and was holding a box-like object to his face with a        |
| periscope like extender sticking out and up to the right side. This   |
| periscope device was pointed away from the observer to the north,     |
| toward the sun. The figure was blond with short-cropped hair. He      |
| walked dragging his feet, as if fatigued. Foster glanced away         |
| thinking it was perhaps a mailman, but when he realized it was        |
| Sunday, he knew this could not be. When he again looked up the figure |
| had gone. Foster rushed out in search of him but could find no trace. |

| 1971 - A 50-foot diameter disc was seen hovering overhead on this     |
| night in Pinehurst, Idaho. It directed a beam of light down upon two  |

| light in a nearby field. He stopped his car and got out to            |
| investigate. As he approached he saw a large object on the ground     |
| next to some trees. Suddenly he became paralyzed and unable to move.  |
| Beside the object were two short beings with large heads and long     |
| arms. They wore helmets and tight fitting silvery uniforms. The two   |
| humanoids appeared to be collecting soil samples from the ground.     |
| After a few moments, they conversed among themselves in an unknown    |
| language, then boarded the object, which quickly took off at high     |
| speed. Cesar was unable to move for the next five minutes. Afterwards |
| he felt very tired and sleepy for 2 to 3 days. (Source: Albert S.     |

| in Ulldemolins, Terragona, Spain alongside an isolated field when he  |
| noticed a bright light to his left. A bright white rotating light     |
| approached and disappeared towards the nearby road, apparently coming |
| down to land. The witness heard a moderate humming sound. Suddenly    |
| the light went dark and two humanoids became visible. They were both  |
| walking on the road toward him. The beings wore fluorescent helmets   |
| and boots and tight-fitting silvery outfits, but no other details     |
| were visible. His dogs began barking in an agitated manner.           |
| Terrified, the witness and his dogs ran in the opposite direction,    |
| not looking back at the humanoids. The night before this close        |
| encounter another local witness had seen a white light hovering over  |
| a house. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1998,  |
