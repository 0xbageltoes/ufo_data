| 1954 - Three gray discs performed acrobatics over farmland in         |
| Campinas, Sao Paulo state, Brazil at dusk. One peeled off from the    |
| others, diving low over the roof of a woman's house, where it dropped |
| a liquid substance "like silver rain." Chemical analysis revealed     |
| that the metallic material collected at the site was 90% tin with     |
| some other alloys. Jacques Vallee believes this case may provide      |
| clues to the propulsion system employed by the vehicles. (Source:     |

| 1959 - A brilliant cone giving off flares descended into the ocean    |
| near La Orchila Island in the Dependencias Federales chain of islands |
| belonging to Venezuela. The witnesses were three crewmen aboard the   |
| ship SS Dorthemaersk. After the object submerged the sea became       |
| brilliant with many bright colors and very turbulent at that spot.    |

| 1961 - At 5:05 p.m. over Washington, D.C. three people witnessed a    |
| sharply defined diamond-shaped object that had a brownish-orange glow |
| centered beneath it in a diamond shape, one-third the total size of   |
| the object. It pulsated rapidly and made no sound. The sighting       |
| lasted three minutes. A Project Blue Book unexplained case. (Sources: |

| 1965 - On this night Sr. Jaime, the police commissioner's son in      |
| Estacion Palavecino, Entre Rios province, Argentina was blinded for a |
| while and unable to speak as result of the close encounter he had     |
| with a spherical UFO that changed colors in front of him. (Source:    |

| 1966 - At around one o'clock at night In a rural area of Rowley,      |

| 1966 - At 3:53 p.m. Mrs. Elsie Vargo and her daughter were out        |
| driving the delivery of newspapers in rural Strongsville, Ohio when   |
| they saw a low flying "batwing" shaped object cross the road at 100   |
| feet altitude and about 100 feet away. It then turned toward them,    |
| terrifying the girl. It was about the size of an automobile and       |
| bright silver in color, with a bubble cupola or dome on top. It       |
| carried an antenna bearing a flashing red light. Inside the dome was  |
| a small human form dressed in black and wearing a helmet. Mrs Vargo   |
| did not see where the object went. It made no sound and there was no  |
| interference with the car's radio. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted       |

| 1967 - At 2:00 a.m. near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the lights of a   |
| car dimmed and the motor sputtered. The driver pulled to the side of  |
| the road and opened the hood. He then noticed a dome-shaped object    |
| hovering 150 yards away. It was metallic, had lights around the edge, |
| and was about 50 feet high. He felt the battery of the car — it was   |
| warm. He got back in and watched the object, which rocked back and    |
| forth 10-15 feet but stayed over the road. During the next hour the   |
| car body began to heat up and even his hair got hot. His flashlight   |
| also wouldn't work. Finally the object shot straight up and           |
| disappeared from view in two to three seconds. The headlights came    |
| back on, but the motor could only be started with difficulty.         |

| 1971 - A young man, T. McClintock, was walking home from a late       |
| evening piano lesson when he saw three red pulsating lights over the  |
| shore in Muchalls, Scotland. One of the lights seem to follow him.    |
| The light swooped very low, almost at ground level, and he then saw a |
| figure dressed in a long robe in the middle of the road. It seemed to |
| be glowing and blocking the road. When he stepped one yard towards    |
| the figure it suddenly vanished. He then ran the rest of the way      |
| home, frightened and totally confused. (Sources: Ron Halliday, UFO    |

| 1973 - At 7:30 p.m. a tall cone-shaped object with lights hovered at  |
| 30 meters altitude over a road in Haisnes-lez-la-Bassee,              |
| Pas-de-Calais, France. It shot away very fast toward the west, making |
| no sound. (Source: Ted Phillips, Physical Traces Associated with UFO  |

| 1973 - Three 16-year-old boys saw a silver disc hovering 20 feet over |
| the Braden River in Florida. It extended a tube into water. They took |
| two photographs of the UFO. The UFO then retracted its tube while     |
| making a clanking sound, buzzed their car, and changed colors from    |
| bluish-green to reddish-orange. Three odd rocks, about a half inch in |
| diameter, of iron pyrite were found near the site. Later that night   |
| in Cabana Colony, Florida Mr. & Mrs. McGhee saw a flying object as    |
| big as a 4-5 houses, that dipped down behind a neighborhood gas       |
| station, changing colors from yellow to orange to red. It stayed      |
| around for awhile, according to the couple. (Sources: (1) St.         |

| 1977 - At 11:00 p.m. an orange-red, disc-shaped object descended over |
| a paddock in Leitchville, Victoria, Australia. It then emitted three  |
| smaller objects that operated independently. One of these zigzagged,  |
| abruptly shot up to higher elevation, then descended again. The UFOs  |
| appeared to signal back and forth. Soil and grass samples collected   |
| from a circle of burnt grass found on the ground reveal the burn      |
| marks were caused by an electrical discharge. No electrical power     |
| lines are located near the paddock where the ground traces were       |
| discovered. The sighting lasted 30 minutes. (Sources: MUFON UFO       |

| 1978 - Shortly after two people saw a luminous mass descend close to  |
| the ground and then take off at high speed towards Puglia, Italy two  |
| soldiers on guard duty at the Brindisi Air Force Base saw a UFO with  |
| pulsating lights maneuver and hover near them. As the object was      |
| leaving a strange being shot up from the ground skywards, quickly     |
| disappearing from sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |

| 1978 - UFOs were seen for thirty minutes over several cities in Chaco |
| province, Argentina on this evening. In Resistencia a newspaper       |
| photographer took a nighttime photograph of a UFO that changed color  |
| several times as it flew toward the south-southwest. (Source: Jane    |

| 1979 - Two helmeted humanoids in silver suits were seen near a        |
| factory located between Lan Xi and the Xim An River in Zhejiang       |
| province, China. They were 200 meters away, and stood beside a        |
| highway. They had square objects like boxes and "thermos bottles"     |
| slung over shoulders. (Source: Shu Jia Lin, APRO Bulletin, January    |

| Piedras, Puerto Rico Mrs. Carmen Vazquez, accompanied by her          |
| 5-year-old daughter, was on her way home when the little girl pointed |
| out something in the sky. Looking up she saw a shiny metallic oval    |
| shaped craft flying slowly overhead and head off towards nearby El    |
| Yunque Mountain. According to the little girl, the object had         |
| numerous windows and inside she was able to see several gray-colored  |
| figures with huge black eyes looking down from the windows at their   |
| car. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1995, case |

| 2000 - At 9:45 p.m. a man driving on the Mount Lindsey highway in     |
| MacLean, Queensland, Australia saw eight lights about 200 meters away |
| pacing his car. He stopped, and when he did the lights also stopped   |
| moveing. Each light was 10-20 meters across and round in shape. They  |
| followed him silently for eight kilometers, and when he arrived home  |
| he was quite scared. (Source: Sheryl Gottschall, UFO Research         |

| 2000 - The witness awoke at 3:55 a.m. in Lake LaBerge, Yukon, Canada  |
