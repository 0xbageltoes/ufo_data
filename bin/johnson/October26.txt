| 1951 - Australia. At around four o'clock in the morning the driver   |
| of a transcontinental train on the east-west line saw a flying object |
| that illuminated the countryside like the full moon. It flew very     |
| fast, came close to the train, and appeared ready to land in the      |
| desert, then it took off and disappeared. (Source: Jacques Vallee,    |

| 47-year-old farmer, was suddenly confronted by an unusual individual  |
| of normal height (1.60 m) wearing a sort of diving suit with a pale   |

| Antimachia, Kos Island, Greece. The UFO had the shape of a basket,    |
| and for a while it headed toward Antimachia, but changed course       |
| suddenly and went away. That same night Mr. George Cacamoundis saw a  |
| "winged man" crossing the sky over the village, at approximately the  |
| same time as the luminous UFO. The witness, terrified, ran to hide in |
| the nearby church, where he stayed for a long time refusing to come   |
| out. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1954,      |

| 100-foot-long ovoid object with an irridescent moon glow as they      |
| drove near Loch Raven Dam in Baltimore County, Maryland. The object   |
| flew at 150 feet altitude, and when it approached their car at the    |
| bridge over the reservoir the car engine, dashboard lights, and       |
| headlights all died at a distance of 200 to 300 feet. The witnesses   |
| felt heat coming from the object and later discovered that they had   |
| sunburns  on their exposed skin. (Sources: Project Blue Book files    |

| 1967 - A businessman driving in the pre-dawn hours north between Hook |
| and Reading, England was momentarily puzzled when the electrical      |
| system of his car broke down at 4:30 a.m. He then observed a low      |
| hovering, dull-colored object about 100 meters away from him. It was  |
| 20 meters in diameter and at an altitude of about 15 meters. He was   |
| able to restart the car, but made the rest of his journey in a        |
| trancelike state. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A    |

| 1973 - The Kingwood, West Virginia police chief and two fire tower    |
| observers watched a light cavort over Caddell Mountain on this night  |
| for hours. Willard Zinn, a police officer from Terra Alta, West       |
| Virginia was driving home via a mountain road at two o'clock at night |
| when he encountered a four-foot tall, brown, or green creature with   |
| long, fuzzy hair that darted across the road in front of his car.     |
| Zinn skidded into a ditch. The two fire observers joined him and all  |
| three saw a very bright, silent, reddish white light whiz overhead at |
| tree top level. (Sources: Ted Bloecher, MUFON Conference Proceedings: |

| 1975 - Mrs. L. E. Dison, age 43, and her daughter were driving home   |
| at one o'clock in the morning in Cahaba Heights, Alabama when they    |
| saw on the dark side of the road two 8 foot tall beings wearing       |
| wearing silvery boots and tight fitting clothing of a dull silver     |
| color, and helmets. The front of helmets were luminous or light       |
| reflecting. The one nearest them had an arm up,  pointing at the sky. |
| The second was looking up at the sky.(Source: Ed Planz, CUFOS files,  |

| 1975 - In Happy Camp, Siskiyou County, California just after          |
| midnight Steve Harris, San Gayer, and Carl Jackson returned to the    |
| spot of their "creature" sighting earlier that evening, accompanied   |
| by Helen White and Rick Pool. They shone spotlights around, but saw   |
| nothing. Then Steve fired his rifle several times. Immediately they   |
| heard a loud "wow-wow-wow" sound, and turned around to see in their   |
| spotlights the dark, non-reflecting forms about 5 feet tall. They     |
| were vaguely human shaped, with a glow around the edges, and about    |
| 30-35 ft away. These forms were moving about slowly, but staying at   |
| the same distance. They seemed to absorb the light from the           |
| flashlights without reflecting it, but occasionally an entire shape   |
| would start glowing slightly. No details could be made out. After     |
| several seconds, during which Helen failed to use her Polaroid        |
| camera, Helen and then the others began to feel a choking sensation,  |
| "as if the oxygen was being depleted from the air." After another     |
| three or four minutes of this, all five of them piled into their Ford |
| Bronco and drove away. Looking back, they saw a glowing               |
| orange disc-shaped object rise up from near where they had been. It   |
| was about 40 feet in diameter, and it followed them at a distance of  |
| 150 feet and right above the treetops, until they reached the         |
| highway. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of  |

| Italy at 9:00 p.m. when she spotted a strange humanoid figure         |
| standing by a nearby tree. The figure began walking very slowly and   |
| seemed to stagger like if intoxicated. The figure was short and very  |
| pale and had only two digits on each hand. It was dressed in black    |
| and wore some sort of helmet. The witness became frightened and ran   |
| home. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1977,     |

| 1977 - Three hours later a bright red sphere hovered in front of a    |
| USAF T-38 aircraft flying from Abilene to Dallas, Texas. It departed  |
| in a rapid vertical climb and changed color to white after effecting  |
| the navigation instruments and producing a large amount of static on  |

| It moved smoothly from a hovering position, and had two steady white  |
| lights with a flashing light in the back. When it moved further away  |
| it looked like a bright orange light in the southwestern sky.         |

| 1983 - At 10:00 p.m. in a rural area of Slaterville, New York a round |
| UFO with 2-3 horizontal rows of windows was sighted on a cloudy       |
| night. It had a single revolving light on top, and was the size of a  |
| very large room. The minimum distance to the object was only 200      |
| meters, and it was viewed through binoculars. The UFO hovered, and    |
| then went behind the hills. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, February      |

| 1988 - On this evening there were several reports of sightings of     |
| boomerang and V-shaped objects in Porterville, California. Beginning  |
| at 8:00 p.m. witnesses spotted 2 or 3 objects, V-shaped with red and  |
| white lights, which flew in front of the moon. The witnesses          |
| speculated that they could have been stealth bombers, but Northrup    |
| denied any of their stealth aircraft were flying that night.          |
| Futhermore, additional sightings included objects that were engaged   |
| in zigzag maneuvers after 9:45 p.m. In Antelope Valley, California    |
| two witnesses reported that a 600 foot wide boomerang flew over at 25 |
| mph; it was joined by a second object, while 15-20 smaller            |
| disc-shaped objects trailed behind. (Sources: Imbrogno Philip J.      |

| Dumas and Nickerson spotted a solid, unblinking orange light low in   |
| the sky moving from the southeast to the northwest at a speed of      |
| about 200 mph. The craft did a loop, moved to the east, then headed   |
| back displaying FAA lighting. Several minutes later, two more craft   |
| came from the east. (Source: Christopher O'Brien, Enter the Valley,   |

| 1999 - At 2:36 a.m. CDT two airline pilots in separate commercial     |
| airliners, both former military pilots, flying near Dallas-Forth      |
| Worth International Airport, Texas saw three gigantic lights approach |
| their aircraft at cruising altitude (37,000 feet). The lights were    |
| part of a large triangular-shaped craft, described as "the size of a  |
| fist at arms length." It executed a sudden turn to the east           |
| and streaked off. An FAA report on the incident was filed. The planes |
| were about 100 miles apart at the time. (Source: UFO Magazine (USA),  |

| 1999 - At 2:14 a.m. PDT a woman in California (exact location not     |
| disclosed) suddenly awoke feeling a presence in her room. Her body    |
| began to get a familiar vibrating feeling, and then she became very   |
| lethargic. In the dark she saw a figure in the room; she could see it |
| standing by the bedroom door. The witness became enraged and by using |
| her thoughts cursed at the entity several times. The being looked     |
| scared, and it crouched in the corner with its head down. She then    |
| tried to turn the light on, but it would not work, and she also tried |
| to use the phone by her bed, but it was also out of commission. By    |
| this point she had calmed down somewhat, and asked the being why they |
| were not going anywhere (presuming she would be abducted). She        |
| received the reply, “I just don’t like women.” The being              |
| now approached her bed, and she recognized her as being female, and   |
| sat on the bed. The woman then took her hand, which felt very cold.   |
| The being was about four feet tall, and was wearing a blackish,       |
| hooded cape. The being next told the witness she was going to take    |
| her to the ship now. Her next recollection was of waking up around an |
| hour later, again feeling a vibration in her body. The female         |
| humanoid was gone. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1999 Humanoid Sighting |

| 2005 - At 9:30 p.m. a young man in Vaudreuil-Dordon, Quebec,          |
| Canada was taking out the trash when he encountered a bizarre         |
| looking, eight foot tall creature. He came back inside running        |
| and out of breath, reporting to his family that he had seen the       |
| creature in front of the neighbor’s driveway. No specific details     |
| were provided about the appearance of the humanoid, but the witness's |
| brother saw two similar creatures back in the summer of 2004.         |

| 2006 - At three o'clock in the morning many residents of the cities   |
| of Colon, Argentina and Paysandu, Uruguay witnessed a huge triangular |
| craft fly over the two cities. It made no sound, but flew at a low    |
| altitude. It flew from south to north at a very slow speed. Witnesses |
| were able to see multicolored lights beneath it that were blue,       |
| white, and yellow. Again at 11:05 p.m. that night two loud sky        |
| explosions rocked both cities. They broke windows. Some witnesses in  |
| Colon said a powerful light could be seen toward the southeastern     |
| area of the city. (Source: Julio Degeneve, www.ufoinfo.com, reported  |
