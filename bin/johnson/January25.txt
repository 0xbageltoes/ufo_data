| 1967 - Harold Lenz was driving to work in Winsted, Minnesota at 4:30  |
| a.m. when the engine of his pickup truck stalled near Howard Lake. He |
| got out to check under the hood and saw a bright luminous object, 75  |
| feet long by 30 feet wide, approach and land on three legs on the     |
| highway. It made a loud whirring noise. Something like an elevator    |
| descended from the bottom and a man walked out. He was dressed in a   |
| silver-blue, tight-fitting coverall uniform with a "fish-bowl" helmet |
| over his head. He was about average height and appeared to be human.  |
| The UFO occupant seemed to examine something on the object. He then   |
| got back into the UFO and it took off. The total event lasted between |
| 3-4 minutes. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:          |

| 1967 - At around two a.m. three teenage girls--Susan, Tanya and       |
| Marianne--were enjoying a typical teenage pajama party in Pittsfield, |
| Pennsylvania and were doing anything but sleeping when all three      |
| simultaneously spotted a peculiar light shimmering through the closed |
| curtains of Susan's bedroom. Without warning the drapes parted of     |
| their own accord and a midget-sized triangular object was revealed,   |
| hovering a few feet from the house. It began beaming a pinkish light  |
| of a painfully brilliant intensity into the bedroom. When the         |
| triangle moved to the second window, the curtains repeated their      |
| opening act, and the light intensity increased several fold. At this  |
| point the girls became quite frightened and tried to flee, but all    |
| three girls quickly became weak and paralyzed, unable to cry out or   |
| do more than whimper helplessly. After a few more torturous moments   |
| the light effect dissipated and their mobility was restored, although |
| a dizzy sensation continued to haunt the girls for nearly an hour.    |

| 1967 - Shortly after sunset, Betty Andreasson, her parents and her    |
| seven children were frightened by a pulsating reddish-orange light    |
| outside their backyard in South Ashburnham, Massachusetts. This was   |
| accompanied by a "silent vacuum" and failure of all the lights in the |
| house. Four entities appeared before Betty in the kitchen after       |
| passing through a closed door. The beings were nearly identical in    |
| appearance, with large baldheads, gray skin, large wrap-around eyes   |
| with hazy, light gray interiors. They had "scar like" mouths and      |
| holes for noses and ears. They wore sparkly, dark blue uniforms with  |
| a lighter blue "Sam Browne" strap. They had bulky hands, possibly     |
| gloved, and wore boots.                                               |
|                                                                       |
| Their leader, named Quazgaa, was slightly taller and his suit was     |
| darker that the others. The reported height of the entities was       |
| between 3 1/2 and five feet. Quazgaa began telepathic communication   |
| with Betty in the kitchen. He asked her for some food and was offered |
| some left over meat. The beings declined, asking that it be cooked    |
| again and she cooked it on the stove. They followed her into the      |
| living room where she handed the leader a Bible. He created several   |
| copies and handed them to the crew. He in turn handed her a thin,     |
| blue book containing their form of knowledge, which remained in her   |
| possession for nine days. During these proceedings the other family   |
| members were sitting in the living room in a trance state. However,   |
| Betty's daughter remembered and confirmed part of the above           |
| testimony. Betty was then "talked into" going onboard the entities'   |
| craft. She was on board for an estimated two hours. During this time  |
| she was led through several rooms, was given a physical exam, and had |
| a needle inserted in her nostril and another in her navel, and had a  |
| body scan by a device that looked like a giant eye. She was then      |
| placed in an enclosed seat that was filled with a soothing liquid, in |
| which she was "prepared" for an unusual journey.                      |
|                                                                       |
| Accompanied by two guides she visited an alien realm where she saw    |
| cities, strange bug-eyed creatures, and a vast ocean. She had a       |
| traumatic religious experience, which led her to believe that the     |
| beings were some form of "angels." Returning from the journey she was |
| led back to her home by two of the entities, one named Joohop. Her    |
| family was still in a state of suspended animation. Her daughter      |
| later recalled being "baby sat" by the one remaining entity. The      |
| beings, holding spheres of light in their hands, proceeded to put the |
| family to bed, Betty the abductee being the last. The incident        |
| included automatic writing, speaking in strange tongues, visions,     |
| message transfer and telephone "contact," some of these occurring     |
| under hypnosis and others during the investigation. Betty was found   |
| to have several previous contacts and numerous post-1967 abduction    |
| experiences as well. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |

| 1968 - At eleven o'clock at night, Dr. Axel Aberg Cobo, a Professor   |
| of Human Relations and Journalism, was walking along the beach in the |
| town of Torres, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil when a silver         |
| colored, luminous object emerged from the ocean only 25 yards away    |
| from him. He felt as though he was paralyzed. Shortly, two men over   |
| six feet tall, "who looked as though they were made of crystal,"      |
| walked up to him stiffly, without bending their knees. He felt as if  |
| they were communicating with him telepathically. They greeted him by  |
| touching shoulders, and one of the beings, which had introduced       |
| himself as "Rubinako," said to him, "Krebs, Navis, Karsicujo and      |
| Krero." Only partially paralyzed, Cobo noted these words, writing     |
| them down with a ballpoint pen on his bare arms. They next told him   |
| they would meet him again in Mar Del Plata, Argentina. He had a vague |
| recollection that the craft took off vertically. (Sources: David F.   |

| 1987 - At eleven p.m. the witness was alone in her apartment in       |
| Yalta, Crimea, Ukraine and had just gone to bed when seven to nine    |
| human-like figures suddenly appeared in her bedroom, standing in      |
| front of her closed French windows. The entities were of medium       |
| height. Some were male while the others were female. The men were     |
| bearded and the woman had straight hair down to their shoulders. All  |
| had beautiful faces with clear penetrating eyes. The witness          |
| attempted to move but could not. She then received a telepathic       |
| message telling her to remain still. She felt no fear but instead had |
| an overwhelming sensation of joy. The beings gathered around her bed  |
| and bent over her. She noticed one of the women place a device on her |
| nearby piano and bend over it. At one point she saw a light-colored   |
| disk and was told that it was her ovum. Later the entities informed   |
| her that it was their time to leave and they gradually faded away.    |
| The witness suffered from gynecological problems as a result of the   |
| encounter and has never been able to subsequently become pregnant.    |

| 1998 - A man was walking his dog in a wooded area of Nursery Woods,   |
| Cumbria, England at 4:45 p.m. when he heard some snapping branches.   |
| Thinking it was a deer he stopped and looked around. Looking through  |
| the trees he noticed a large creature covered in a sort of ginger     |
| brown hair that seemed to be drinking from a pond about 150 meters    |
| into the woods. The creature appeared to stare at the witness, when   |
| it stood upright, the witness estimated to be about 6 feet 6 inches   |
| in height. The witness quickly left the area. There was no reaction   |
| by the dog reported. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact     |
