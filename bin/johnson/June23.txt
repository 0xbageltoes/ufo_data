| 1952 - Grid area CV 4, Korea. Information came via Japan H.Q. "CV     |
| 4359". At 6:08 a.m. a USAF pilot of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group     |
| sighted a black coin-shaped object about seven times wider than it    |
| was thick, with an estimated diameter of 15-20 feet, that made an     |
| irregular descent. It flew at a fixed altitude for 6-7 seconds,       |
| approached the pilot's plane, then disappeared into a cloud.          |

| 1952 - McChord AFB, Washington. At around 9 p.m. Lt. K. Thompson      |
| watched a very large light that flew straight and level for 10        |
| minutes. Four miles west of the Air Base several yellow-whitish       |
| nocturnal lights in a V formation made precise maneuvers in sky.      |

| 1964 - Fifteen or more flying discs paced a car on Highway 60 in Vero |
| Beach, Florida. The object tipped back and forth as they did so. They |
| first formed a V-formation, then reformed into a circular formation,  |
| then split the formation and flew on either side of a grove of trees. |

| 1966 - Four adults in Menindee, New South Wales, Australia heard a    |
| splash at noon from a nearby lake. No object was visible on the lake  |
| surface, but a UFO was seen climbing from the lake diagonally, then   |
| "disappeared in seconds." (Source: Ivan T. Sanderson, Invisible       |
| Residents, p. 228, citing Broken Hill, (N.S.W.) Barrier Truth, June   |
| 23, 1966).                                                            |

| 1966 - One of the earliest reported cases of "missing time" began on  |
| this day in a bedroom in West Chelmsford, Massachusetts. The incident |
| took place in the pre-dawn hours, beginning at around 3:15 a.m.       |
| (Source: David Webb, Analysis of Humanoid/Abduction Reports, Proceedings of   |
| the 1976 CUFOS Conference, pg. 267).                                  |

| 1966 - At 3:42 a.m. an Apollo Space Project engineer, Julian          |
| Sandoval, saw a fast moving 300 foot long tetrahedron shaped UFO with |
| four blue-green tail lights maneuvering in the sky while driving on   |
| Highway 85 in Corrales, New Mexico. His sighting was confirmed by     |
| Police Patrolman Gallegos and Dorothy Lovato of Bernalillo. The       |
| sighting lasted a total of 51 minutes. (Sources: Christian Science    |
| Monitor, July 11, 1966; NICAP UFO Investigator, August 3, 1966;       |
| UNICAT database, case 690, citing James E. McDonald, Frank Edwards,   |

|                                                                       |
| 1966 - At 9:30 p.m. a 61-year-old woman was at home reading in        |
| Hamburg, New York when an intense red light illuminated the ground    |
| near her house. She went outside and saw a lighted object 20 meters   |
| away, just one meter in diameter, which backed up and flew away "like |
| a bullet." Three other people saw it from the next house. (Source:    |
| Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case      |
| 777).                                                                 |

| 1968 - At five minutes past midnight in Monte Banderas de Bilbao, in  |
| the Basque region of Spain, a four-meter wide circular-shaped flying  |
| object landed on a hilltop, 300 meters away from the three witnesses. |
| (Source: Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Catalogue of 200 Type-I Events |
| in Spain and Portugal, case 59).                                      |

| 1968 - The witness was driving from Las Vegas, Nevada at around 8     |
| p.m. when he saw a round, saucer-shaped object land on a dirt road    |
| not to far away from the road. The witness drove up the dirt road to  |
| the craft, which had landed on three leg-like protrusions. Soon three |
| bearded men, very human in appearance, disembarked from the craft.    |
| They approached the witness who had by now left his vehicle. They     |
| expressed curiosity as to his long hair. He explained that he just    |
| wanted to wear it that way and was not into drugs or anything. They   |
| seemed to appreciate that. They then told him that they came from a   |
| world with no cities where its inhabitants were born in the           |
| wilderness. They told him that cities were a danger to society. They  |
| called themselves "Dodonians." The witness shook hands with the men   |
| and they boarded the craft, which quickly left the area. (Source:     |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1968, citing National    |
| UFO Reporting Center).                                                |

| 1969 - At 1:36 a.m. a couple named Werth and one of their children    |
| had a close encounter with a cone shaped object that maneuvered only  |
| 60 meters from the porch of their farmhouse, located 15 miles south   |
| of Hays, Kansas. The object was over 100 feet in length, made no      |
| sound, and flew about at a low altitude, then flew away to the        |
| northeast. Their sighting lasted 15 minutes. (Source: NICAP UFO       |
| Investigator, October 1969, p. 3).                                    |

| 1972 - At 3:00 a.m. police and a light plane chased an elusive        |
| zigzagging nocturnal light through the skies over Menominee County,   |
| Wisconsin. It made a high pitched sound. (Source: Larry Hatch, U      |
| computer database, case 9546, citing NICAP UFO Investigator, August   |
| 1972).                                                                |

| 1973 - At midnight Roberta T. sighted from her Phoenix, Arizona patio |
| what first appeared to be a star. It descended from the sky until it  |
| came much closer and appeared to be a large, illuminated spherical    |
| object, hovering in a spot just above some trees beyond her patio. As |
| it hovered, a square opening appeared on the side facing her, like a  |
| "garage doors opening." Illuminated brightly from within, she         |
| observed a human-like figure approach the opening from one side,      |
| cross over, and then bend down to do something. When she uttered an   |
| exclamation he abruptly looked up and out at her and peered directly  |
| at her, leaning out of the opening. He was visible from the knees up  |
| and wore a tight-fitting garment. When he dropped his head down to    |
| look at her she could see that he was tall, with a large head and     |
| with hands that appeared to be busy working instruments. She next     |
| heard a humming sound, and saw a second, smaller object approaching   |
| to her left. It passed a post on the patio and abruptly disappeared.  |
| She then looked back toward the first object and found it too had     |
| vanished. She then fell asleep and when she came to later, found      |
| herself lying in a different position.                                |
|                                                                       |
| Under hypnotic regression, she described seeing the same figure       |
| appear before her on the patio. She then describes in vague uncertain |
| terms how she was told not to be afraid, and then "taken somewhere"   |
| by being floated upwards. She recalled seeing a dog that had been     |
| constantly barking also floating in the air. She was in some dark     |
| "enclosed" place where she couldn't see and an instrument of some     |
| sort was placed on her head, which made her uncomfortable. There were |
| others around her but she "felt" them rather than saw them. She had   |
| the impression they were "talking" to each other in a language she    |
| could not understand. She also had the impression there were two      |
| people present. When she awoke on the patio, it was some 4 or 5 hours |
| later. (Sources: David F. Webb, 1973: The Year of the Humanoids, case |

| 1973 - From a cabin on the Rothwell Ranch in Piedmont, Missouri two   |
| men watched as a bright light that had a ring around it rose from low |
| on the ESE horizon, moved up-down, then left-right, for a distance of |
| 15 degrees over a 30 minute period beginning at 10:30 p.m. The object |
| silently radiated lines of concentric circles like heat waves. At one |
| point a small light joined the first object. (Source: MUFON database  |

| 1976 - An abduction experience occurred this night in Sao Paulo,      |
| Brazil. A bright nocturnal light approached a man causing him to      |
| become frozen in place with paralysis. It stopped some 20 to 25 feet  |
| away and the light went out. A short, bald-headed being with a big    |
| head, large eyes, and pointed ears, no eyebrows, and wearing a        |
| bluish-gray coverall bearing an emblem on the chest approached. The   |
| man was levitated aboard a cigar-shaped UFO. He reported having       |
| telepathic communication with the Ufonaut. (Source: David F. Webb and |
| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case A1507).     |

| 1977 - A driver of a newspaper delivery van driving between Noupoort  |
| and Middelburg, South Africa saw a dull glow at a quarry beside the   |
| road at 5:15 a.m. A glowing phosporescent UFO then came out of the    |
| quarry and hovered in front of the delivery van, causing the van's    |
| engine and headlights to fail. After a few moments the UFO departed,  |
| making a buzzing sound when it left. The engine of the van started by |
| itself, then stopped, then started again when the driver pressed the  |
| pedal. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle         |

| 1990 - At 12:30 a.m. an orange disc-shaped object with portholes on   |
| the bottom portion, very bright, followed the course of a creek in    |
| Williams Lake, British Columbia at a low altitude. The witness's arm  |
| became numb during this close encounter. (Source: Timothy Good, The   |

| 1992 - Three silent disc-shaped objects were sighted from US Highway  |
| 22 in Washington County, Pennsylvania near the West Virginia State    |
| border at around 11 p.m. The discs were at treetop level and blinked  |
| in unison. They formed a triangle in the sky, then vanished. (Source: |

| 1994 - A woman in Miami, Florida was unable to sleep and got up at 4  |
| o'clock in the morning to sit at her kitchen table. She saw out her   |
| kitchen window, by a large fruit tree, a tall, dark winged man-like   |
| figure. It stepped from behind the tree and glided toward the side of |
| her house. She believed she had seen a demon. (Source: Albert S.      |
