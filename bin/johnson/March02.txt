| 1955 - At 3:00 p.m. MST a hovering, rectangular-shaped object was     |
| seen rocking in the sky over Tucson, Arizona. One hour later, at      |
| about 5:00 p.m. CST, a car driving ten miles north of Huntley,        |
| Illinois was followed for ten minutes by three elongated "balloons."  |
| The objects were each about seven meters long and showed eight red    |
| lights. (Sources: Project Blue Book; Jacques Vallee, Passport to      |

| 1958 - At 7:45 p.m. a man observed a balloon-shaped object land on    |
| the airfield in Tampa, Florida and then take off slowly and hover at  |
| 250 meters altitude before disappearing. It had a bright light source |

| 1959 - A six-meter in diameter disc hovered 60 meters over a quarry   |
| in Mount Airy, North Carolina at 7:30 p.m. It had body lights and was |

| 1960 - Mr. Schedelbauer, a 36-year-old newsman, was driving his car   |
| near Labuttendorf, Austria at 1:30 a.m. when he had a close encounter |
| with a round, glowing aerial object. He was able to take a photograph |
| of the luminous UFO, but he also received burns on his face and hands |
| from the encounter. (Sources: Waveney Girvan, Flying Saucer Review,   |

| 1964 - An elongated, silver object was seen hovering in the sky for   |
| two minutes over Grassmere, South Australia. (Source: Flying Saucers, |

| 1965 - At 1:55 p.m. John F. Reeves, a retired 65 year old, was        |
| hunting for snakes in the woods in Brooksville, Florida when he       |
| observed a reddish-purple saucer-shaped object on the ground. It was  |
| 30 feet in diameter and 6-7 feet thick, and stood on four legs, with  |
| a clear dome on top and a row of vanes like an outer rim around the   |
| circumference. It also had a set of stairs. He crept to within 100    |
| feet, and after watching it for 10 minutes he saw a robot-like being, |
| about five feet tall, wearing a silver one-piece uniform with a       |
| transparent "fishbowl" helmet. His hands were gloved and he wore      |
| metallic looking boots. His eyes were set far apart and he had a      |
| pointed chin. The being walked walked to the craft, then returned     |
| with a box that emitted two bright flashes when pointed at the        |
| witness; Reeves took it to be somekind of camera. The humanoid then   |
| re-entered the craft by walking up a small retractable stairway, and  |
| the object rose vertically with a whistling noise. Reeves found at    |
| the site many dumbbell-shaped footprints, and four roughly            |
| equidistant 6 inch holes, left by the landing gear. There were also   |
| two folded sheets of thin tissue like paper that bore messages        |
| written in an unknown alphabet. Reeves subsequently had further       |
| sightings and contacts. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, March-April 1965,    |

| 1966 - Two years later two silver metallic objects chased an airplane |
| near an aerodrome in Harlin, Queensland, Australia at 10:30 p.m. The  |
| UFOs then moved back and forth in the sky, vanished and reappeared,   |
| cruised around the sky lazily, and then vanished. (Source: Michael    |

| 1966 - A woman watched a flashing light the sky two miles east of     |
| Roosevelt, Utah on this evening at 7 p.m. It stood still for 15       |

| 1967 - Two to four silver lights or disc-shaped objects flew over     |
| White Sands, New Mexico at 10:25 a.m. and were detected on radar at   |
| an altitude of seven kilometers. They circled the White Sands missile |
| base and flew away toward the east. They flew at an estimated speed   |
| of 2,000 mph. Several silver discs with green glowing bottoms were    |
| sighted by a separate observer in Las Cruces, New Mexico at 11:30     |
| a.m. (Source: APRO Bulletin, Volume 15, No. 5; El Paso Times, March   |

| 1967 - That night in Patterson, Arkansas at 9:30 p.m. a man witnessed |
| a UFO with red lights hovering over some homes, and then move away.   |
| Dogs were barking at the time. Two hours later in Piggot, Arkansas,   |
| which is five miles to the northwest of Patterson, two high school    |
| teachers witnessed four lights in the sky. The first hovered at       |
| treetop level, then was joined by the second light, followed by two   |
| more. The four objects maneuvered about in different directions,      |
| hovered, and then flew away. (Source: NICAP files, citing Memphis     |

| 1968 - A huge saucer moved up and down in the sky over Kampung        |
| Kermat, Malaysia at three o'clock in the afternoon, flashing a bright |

| 1968 - At noon two people took a photograph of a UFO in Neenah,       |
| Wisconsin. That same day three women in Randlett, Utah watched a      |
| round, shiny silver objects maneuvering in the sky through            |
| binoculars. (Sources: Allen Utke investigation files, case 47; Frank  |

| 1970 - On this night a domed disc UFO looking like the "scoutship"    |
| described by UFO contactee George Adamski (and widely believed to be  |
| a hoaxed photograph by him) descended in a back-and-forth motion in   |
| Falkenberg, Sweden and was seen by several witnesses. The object had  |
| two antennae, and TV interference was noted in the area at the time.  |
| The sighting lasted 25 minutes. (Source: Sven-Olof Fredrickson, FSR,  |

| 1971 - At 7:45 p.m. a disc-shaped UFO, illuminated green from the     |
| inside, flew low and fast over the town of Vannes, France shooting    |
| off toward the north. One hour later a large bluish-green top-shaped  |
| UFO, surrounded by a glowing aura, was seen in Dorking, England.      |
| Inside the object was a red ball, which twisted and turned, shooting  |
| off sparks. It flew in a straight path to the west, but at one point  |
| completely vanished. There were five witnesses total, including       |
| independent witnesses. (Sources: Jean-F Boedec, Les OVNI en Bretagne: |

| 1971 - In Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont, Belgium at 7:40 p.m. several       |
| people witnessed a silent, delta-shaped object fly low over Route E41 |
| toward the southwest. Five minutes later in Nivelles, Belgium a long  |
| cigar-shaped UFO with two tail fins and red lights front and aft,     |
| with white lights on top of each of the two fins, was seen for 30     |
| minutes. In La Louviere, Belgium at 7:50 p.m. a dark rectangular UFO  |
| with a triangle of lights moved slowly and silently through the sky.  |
| It turned in flew toward the north-northwest. In Nivelles, Belgium    |
| again at 8:05 p.m. a nocturnal light swung in a pendulum motion over  |
| a major highway intersection. (Source: Michel Bougard, Inforespace,   |

| 1975 - In the Golfo San Matias, Argentina north of the Valdez         |
| Peninsula, a group of men on a fishing boat saw a bright light with a |
| definite form behind it moved horizontally through the evening sky at |
| a low altitude. It came from the Patagonian mesa flying out to sea    |
| and made a loud buzzing sound. It stopped in the air, and dived under |
| the sea. (Source: Wendelle C. Stevens, Saga UFO Report, March 1977,   |

| 1975 - At eight p.m. that same evening in Elmwood, Wisconsin a UFO    |
| attempted to land in front of a car with the Forster family inside,   |
| while the children in the car screamed. The UFO was a disc the size   |
| of a car, white in color with lights all around it, and sticklike     |
| legs or landing gear. In their panic they repeatedly honked their car |
| horn, which alerted farmer Roger Weber, who came out of his farmhouse |
| and guided the family home. The UFO flew off. (Source: Jay Rath, The  |
| W-Files: True Reports of Wisconsin's Unexplained Phenomena, p. 67).   |

| holes on each side. It flew off toward the northwest. (Source:        |

| evening in Pelotas, Brazil in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Jose    |
| Alvaro, age 20, was abducted aboard a UFO and had a forced sexual     |
| encounter with a tall female UFO crew member. As in the famous        |
| Antonio Villas Boas abduction, he was rubbed down with a sponge and   |
| an apparent disinfectant liquid before sex. The woman was described   |
| as a tall, human-like female with protuberant eyes, who made groaning |
| noises during sex. He described the UFO as spherical and blue in      |
| color. (Sources: Xenolog, March 1978, p. 19; Thomas E. Bullard, UFO   |

| in Highland, Illinois a married couple in their mid-fifties were      |
| driving down a rural road when they sighted a vertical, oval-shaped   |
| UFO that moved over the road. They drove to within 30 feet of it in   |
| their truck when the object jumped over their truck and bathed it in  |
| a white beam of light. After two minutes the couple drove away.       |
