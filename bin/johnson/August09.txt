| 1952 - At 10:50 a.m. a military witness named Raley at Chennault Air  |
| Force Base, Louisiana saw a disc-shaped object that flew very fast    |
| for five minutes, and hovered for two seconds. A Project Blue Book    |

| 1955 - A bright object, the apparent size of the Moon, hovered low    |
| near the horizon near Moon Lake, Nebraska for two hours. Nocturnal    |
| lights exited from it and flew off to the north. There were several   |
| witnesses from three families. (Source: APRO Bulletin, August 1955;   |

| 1959 - Mr. Uribe, a petroleum engineer, and two other witnesses had   |
| to stop when they ran out of fuel at Sombrero, Magallanes, Chile. At  |
| 7:54 p.m. they observed a light swinging in the sky like a pendulum,  |
| and coming closer to the ground. It appeared to be a large, vertical, |
| ovoid object that made a "whooshing" sound. Its closest approach was  |
| 120 meters. They estimated its dimensions at two meters in height and |
| 1.5 meters in width. When Uribe aimed his rifle at the object it went |
| out of sight within seconds. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to    |

| 1963 - Harry Bishop, the former major of Mount Vernon, Illinois,      |
| watched a large, bright red oval-shaped light making a "whirring      |
| sound" follow a car along Centralia road. When the car stopped, the   |
| UFO stopped; it hovered for awhile, then moved away at right angles   |
| to its original course. There were a number of other witnesses.       |
| Duration: 10 minutes. (Sources: Jeffrey G. Liss, Fate magazine,       |

| 1965 - At around 6:00 p.m. an astronomer and his family were driving  |
| in Suffolk County, Long Island, New York when a silvery disc-shaped   |
| object with a "ring of bluish white lights" moved overhead slowly to  |
| the south. The object then turned and accelerated to the              |
| east-northeast. He drove up to 80 mph in pursuit, but it dwindled in  |
| size until it resembled a star high in the sky. It moved up and down  |
| several times, then finally darted to the south out over the Atlantic |
| Ocean. (Source: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience, p. 66).           |

| 1965 - An anonymous music teacher, a "high level public employee",    |
| was driving on the outskirts of Lima, Peru around 10:00 p.m. when his |
| car's engine started to miss, and then stop. At that moment, a beam   |
| of light  enveloped the car from above, then levitated it from the    |
| road and carried it through the sky for an unknown distance, at such  |
| an altitude that the witness could see the coastline and a peninsula, |
| La Punta, west of the city. He was paralyzed and unable to move       |
| during this process. The car was brought to the ground near the shore |
| and he could hear waves breaking. Then, a voice spoke to him in       |
| perfect Spanish, and asked him to get out of the car. He did so and   |
| "could barely make out" little men with big ears. No UFO was seen,    |
| but there was a luminous screen nearby, on which was displayed, "We   |
| are using calming rays on you to remove your fear." He then asked     |
| several questions, in response to which a spokesperson told him that  |
| they came from a place more distant than Mars, that they had visited  |
| Earth on various occasions in the past, and that they did not appear  |
| in public because that would cause panic. Asked if they knew about    |
| music, he heard they had "something that might be considered as       |
| music, but that it had the power of raising the feelings to the       |
| highest exaltation." After that, his car was transported back through |
| the air to the spot from which it had been picked up. He told his     |
| story to an uncle, an official in the Peruvian police, who informed   |
| reporters. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue   |

| 1965 - At around midnight the K. Denver family of three saw a UFO on  |
| the ground at South Myton Bench, Duchesne County, Utah that stood up  |
| like a rocket. The top was flat, with a row of windows below, and a   |
| room inside with bright lights. Rotating flashing lights on top,      |
| orange-red flames on bottom. It rose vertically without a sound,      |
| hovered, then shot up quickly. (Source: Frank B. Salisbury, The Utah  |
| UFO Display, p. 17).                                                  |

| 1967 - A disc-shaped object about the size of a rugby ball was        |
| sighted by a married couple in Grey Friars, Stattordshire, England at |
| 2:30 a.m. It flashed blue lights all around its rim, and seemed to be |
| spinning in time with sound coming from it. It caused their dog to    |
| begin barking. The witnesses reported that they were too frightened   |
| to sleep after their encounter. Later that evening another close      |
| encounter occurred in Weston-on-Trent, England. The witness reported  |
| a "dull penetrating sound," then sighting a red light that moved up,  |
| down, and "all over the place." This witness's dog also whimpered,    |
| barked, and scratched at the door in response to the UFO. The noise   |
| persisted throughout the night, even after the UFO had gone. (Source: |

| 1967 - At 11:30 p.m. a bright, cage-like UFO shaped like an inverted  |
| bowl, with a row of yellow lights on its surface, flew over Grand     |
| Rapids, Michigan very fast at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet.    |
| (Source: Grand Rapids Press, August 11, 1967).                        |

| 1968 - A beam of energy from a disc-shaped object caused the death of |
| someone on a farm in Jaboticatubas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil at     |
| 8:10 p.m. On the same night a round flying object emitting blue and   |
| red lights was sighted in the suburbs of Cerro de la Gloria, Mendoza  |
| province, Argentina. Two dwarves wearing helmets with bright glowing  |
| antennae on their heads exited the landed craft. When a police office |
| named A. Romero pointed his gun at them, a luminous ray immobilized   |
| him. He was later hospitalized. (Sources: (1) Bob Pratt, UFO Danger   |

| 1971 - Starting at around 9:00 a.m. a glowing orange disc-shaped UFO, |
| shaped like two basins placed edge to edge, paced a plane flying from |
| Belo Horizonte to Uberaba, Minas Gerais State, Brazil for 20 minutes, |
| and then suddenly sped away. The private pilot was a 24-year-old man  |
| named Vicente Buono. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, November-December 1972, |

| 1972 - A woman teacher was camping out in the yard of a friend's      |
| house in Saint Jean Du Gard, France and had gone out for a walk at    |
| 2:30 a.m. when she noticed a white spherical light that appeared to   |
| be in a nearby field. As she stood there watching, she heard          |
| footsteps behind her that sounded like someone walking on the dry     |
| grass. When she turned around, she was confronted by a five-foot      |
| tall, robot-like being that was completely black. Its head was        |
| egg-shaped and it had two round white discs for eyes. The witness     |
| felt an unbelievable level of fear and had the feeling that the being |
| possessed extraordinary powers; it could in fact control "nature      |
| itself." She blacked out and when she recovered found herself back in |
| her tent with her husband. That same morning a truck driver named     |
| Marcilio was forced to stop his vehicle in the pre-dawn hours on the  |
| Amaral Peixoto Highway in Brazil when the road was blocked by a UFO   |
| sitting on the road with yellow and blue flashing lights. It took off |
| rapidly. (Sources: (1) Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database   |

| 1973 - A father and his son were driving along the main highway in    |
| the Exeter, New Hampshire during the day when they saw a landed UFO   |
| along the side of the highway. A tall humanoid figure stood next to   |
| the object. The witnesses kept driving without stopping. (Source:     |

| 1977 - At around 1:30 a.m. Police Constable David Swift was           |
| investigating an unusual fog in a nearby fog located in East Hull,    |
| Yorkshire, England. As he crossed the field, he saw three figures who |
| seemed to be dancing around a non-existent Maypole. Each had an arm   |
| raised. "One figure was a man in a sleveless jerkin and tight-fitting |
| trousers...the other two were women in bonnets, shawls, and white     |
| colored dresses." Thinking they were drunks, he approached them. At   |
| about 50 feet away the entire scene vanished. "No one was there." He  |
| drove about the area in his car, but found nothing more. He then      |
| reported the incident to his sergeant. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,    |

| 1979 - Two white, 30-foot diameter lenticular discs were seen flying  |
| together below an aircraft being flown by the state police southeast  |
| of Hayfork, California at around ten o'clock in the morning. The      |
| discs were hugging the terrain, following the contour of the land and |
| flying in and out of the canyons below, nearly grazing the ground.    |
| Their speed, when first sighted, was estimated to be 600 miles per    |
| hour, but they accelerated and sped away to the north at 1,500 mph.   |
| There were four witnesses who watched the craft for 20 seconds.       |

| 1980 - A few minutes after midnight a Sandia Security detail of three |
| men, Ferenz, Rist, and Frazier, reported that a disc-shaped object    |
| landed behind the "HQ CR 44" nuclear storage building at Sandia       |
| Laboratories, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. One of the         |
| security guards drove his jeep into Coyote Canyon and approached on   |
| foot. He had a clear view of the round disc-shaped object at the      |
| Manzano Weapons Storage Area. His radio would not work when he tried  |
| to radio for backup. The UFO shot straight up and away at high speed  |
| at the end of the 30 minute encounter. (Sources: Lawrence Fawcett &   |

| 1983 - A 34-year-old man named Platner saw a UFO in Winifreda, La     |
| Pampa province, Argentina at 7:30 p.m. and followed it in his van.    |
| When he stepped out of his van he was paralyzed by a beam of light.   |
| Four small humanoids wearing diver suits with large round eyes, one   |
| of them a female, emerged from the craft and communicated with him    |
