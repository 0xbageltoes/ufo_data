| 1952 - Dallas, Texas. Jack Rossen, an ex-artillery observer, saw     |
| three blue-white lights hover and then descend at 11:54 p.m. Ninety   |
| seconds later one of the lights descended further. (Source: Don       |

| 1955 - Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The Sutton family saw a light land     |
| near their farmhouse. Shortly after several goblin-like entities      |
| about one meter tall, with glowing silver clothing, oversized round   |
| heads, big eyes and huge pointed ears harassed them for several       |
| hours. They got out their hunting rifles and started shooting at      |
| them. At one point one of the entities was struck by gunfire and was  |
| knocked off their roof, but inside of falling normally it "floated    |
| down" Close to running out of ammunition, the Suttons fled their      |
| farmhouse and got the police, who observed a lighted object in the    |
| sky, flying away very fast. (Sources: Project Blue Book; Isabel       |

| 1956 - A reddish orange elongated object jerked up and down over Los  |
| Angeles and the San Fernando Valley in California on this evening for |
| several minutes around 9:30 p.m. A later report at 11:30 p.m. was     |
| made in El Monte, California. (Sources: Los Angeles Times, August     |

| 1965 - On this day at a school outside of Mexico City, Mexico two     |
| groups of students had separate but identical meetings with aliens.   |
| The students were in two groups of three, and encountered a landed    |
| metallic disc 150 feet wide. The occupants were blond, blue-eyed      |
| human-looking beings who were seven feet tall and wore metallic       |
| coveralls. They were taken on a three hour long space journey and     |
| telepathic messages. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: |

| 1972 - Mr. Faltersack, age 18, was driving along County Road JF in    |
| Waukesha County, Wisconsin at 2:30 a.m. when he saw an orange,        |
| circular object approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter hovering at a |
| low altitude and making a beeping sound. It moved over his car for a  |
| few seconds and his car engine and headlights died. The orange object |
| moved off and hovered over some treetops, while his car radiator      |
| boiled over. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, November-December 1972, p. 7;   |

| 1973 - At 2:30 a.m. a woman was alone in her bedroom in Derry,        |
| Pennsylvania and had her bedroom window open with the drapes closed.  |
| She awoke with the feeling that someone was watching her. She turned  |
| her head and was horrified to see a hideous face staring at her from  |
| the window. The creature was over nine feet tall and had dark oval    |
| eyes with no whites nor eyelashes. Apparently it had pushed the       |
| drapes aside to look inside. The creature moved back awkwardly as the |
| witness moved. Her daughter also saw a huge shadow on the wall from a |
| figure outside. A strong odor like rotten meat persisted after the    |
| creature had gone. (Source: Stan Gordon, MUFON UFO Symposium          |
| Proceedings 1974, p. 136).                                            |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - Evelyn Clayton's family and friends were out on the front      |
| porch of her home near Minerva, Ohio at 10:30 p.m. when they heard    |
| noises coming from the direction of an old chicken coop just to the   |
| right of the house. They then saw two pairs of yellow lights that     |
| seemed to be reflecting a porch light. Scott Patterson went to his    |
| car and turned the headlights on in hopes of getting a better look.   |
| They could now see that the lights were eyes on what appeared to be   |
| two cougar-like animals. Then the group saw what looked like a large  |
| hairy bipedal creature step in front of the large cats as if to       |
| protect them. This humanoid then lurched towards the Patterson's car. |
| The witnesses fled inside the house and called the sheriff's office.  |
| The hairy bipedal creature appeared at the kitchen window while they  |
| were waiting for the deputy sheriffs to arrive. Patterson pointed a   |
| 22-caliber pistol at it, while Evelyn Clayton loaded a .22 caliber    |
| rifle. The creature stood outside the window for close to ten         |
| minutes. They decided they would not shoot it unless the creature     |
| made advances toward them. It left quickly without harming anyone. A  |
| strong stench resembling "ammonia sulfur" remained in the area long   |
| after the creature was gone. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid     |
| Contact Database 1978, case # 3061, citing Ron Schaffner).            |
|                                                                       |
| 1998 - On this afternoon on the outskirts of Citta Di Castello, Italy |
| some city residents spotted a small humanoid in a field. It was       |
| crouched down like an old woman gathering weeds. When it failed to    |
| respond to shouts from the witnesses they approached to about 200     |
| meters. Suddenly a silvery cylinder-shaped object appeared and        |
| hovered about two meters above the small figure. The small humanoid   |
| then levitated into the craft, which took off quickly, accelerating   |
| out of sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database   |
| 1998, case # 3133, citing Joseph Trainor, UFO Roundup, September 16,  |
| 1998).                                                                |
