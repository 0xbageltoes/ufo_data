| 1922 - William C. Lamb was following strange tracks near Hubbell,     |
| Nebraska at 5:00 a.m. when he heard a high-pitched sound and saw a    |
| circular flying object. It became brilliantly lighted and landed in a |
| hollow. Soon afterward, a creature over eight feet tall was seen      |
| flying from the direction where the object had landed. It left tracks |
| in the snow, which Lamb followed without results. (Source: Jacques    |

| 1959 - Two witnesses saw three white discs pass into a cloud over the |
| city of Warsop, England from which they never reappeared. (Source: J. |
| Bernard Delair, Awareness, October 1977, p. 12).                      |

| 1963 - A domed disc-shaped object landed on the frozen surface of     |
| Crystal Lake in Fergus County, Montana at 2 a.m. A door on the craft  |
| opened for 10 minutes, then shut. Half an hour later a fiery ball     |
| flew over Belgrade, Montana causing electrical power failures.        |

| 1966 - At 9:05 p.m. a domed disc-shaped flying object with portholes  |
| approached a woman's parked car next to a lake in South Kingston, New |
| Hampshire. It backed away, landed, then rose in a rocking,            |
| reverse-falling leaf motion, and finally started to fly away. The     |
| witness gave chase, following it in her car. Her car's headlights     |
| shone on two objects. One departed, while the other danced around in  |
| the sky for 35 minutes. (Sources: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr., UFOs: A New |
| Look, p. 44; Kathleen Marden, MUFON field investigations database,    |
| case 980205SE).                                                       |

| 1967 - On this morning at 6:30 a.m. a flying disc was seen at low     |
| level over a farm in Milton, Ohio by Mrs. Clevenger. Her dogs reacted |
| strongly to the presence of the UFO. The encounter lasted several     |
| minutes. (Sources: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr., Strange Effects from UFOs, |
| p. 34; Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A Thirty-Year    |
| Report, p. 279).                                                      |

| 1967 - On this night Mr. G. Grammond of Chippenham, England saw an    |
| object with flashing red and green lights glide, circle, and then     |
| land in a field. He saw it again spinning in the northeast when he    |
| came out with two other witnesses five minutes later. (Source:        |
| Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case      |
| 818).                                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1969 - Nathan Brown, a 46-year-old Maori, was walking home in Awanui, |
| New Zealand at one a.m. when he saw a light. He came upon two men     |
| sitting with their backs to the road and their feet in a ditch, while |
| a pale young woman with white, shoulder length hair lay across the    |
| ditch. She wore a long white gown that covered her feet. The men sat  |
| in a relaxed attitude looking down at the woman. They were about 5.5  |
| feet in height, had dark brown skin and closely cropped hair, and     |
| wore brown pants and jackets. He questioned the men but got no        |
| response. When he stepped closer to see what was wrong with the woman |
| he ran into an invisible barrier that he likened to a bar across the  |
| stomach. He tried to grab one of the men but was again prevented by a |
| force that repelled him. This frightened him and he ran off, "shaking |
| like a leaf." The light he first saw was a luminous haze that had no  |
| visible source. Mr. Brown found some marks on the ground at the site  |
| the following day. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |
| Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1969-12, citing Don Jackson and   |
| the Auckland University UFO Group).                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1971 - On this evening five residents of Turun Sanomat, Finland saw a |
| UFO, while another saw an entity dressed "like a vagabond." The being |
| told him to follow him, and then experienced one hour of missing      |
| time. He found himself standing in same spot in intense cold, one     |
| hour later. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |
| of Humanoid Reports, case A1106, citing Lumieres dans la Nuit, August |
| 1972, p. 10).                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - On the night prior to this experience, Mrs Maureen Puddy       |
| "heard a voice" calling her name. The next morning she perceived a    |
| message telling her to return to the site of her 1972 vechicle UFO    |
| close encounter. She contacted two investigators of the Victorian UFO |
| Research group and drove with them to the site at Mooraduc Crossing,  |
| Victoria, Australia. On route she briefly saw a man sitting in the    |
| front seat of the car whom her passengers did not see. As she         |
| approached the spot of her earlier encounter, she saw the same figure |
| standing outside the car, but the others again saw nothing. She       |
| reported that the figure was normal sized, wearing a white ski suit   |
| style coverall tucked in at the wrists and covering the feet. He had  |
| long blond hair. He beckoned to Mrs Puddy, but she did not respond;   |
| instead, she appeared to lose consciousness.                          |
|                                                                       |
| She experienced some kind of altered state of consciousness, in which |
| she was able to describe to the two passengers in the car what she    |
| was seeing at the moment. She felt she was in a round room lit by an  |
| unknown source. The figure appeared in the room with her, and the     |
| room was shaped like a large mushroom with a stem at the bottom and a |
| hemispherical dome on top. It appeared to have an inner hemisphere    |
| that appeared to be wobbling, and had what looked like hieroglyphics  |
| on it. She saw no doors or windows in the room, and became            |
| frightened; she started to cry and "woke up" with tears in her eyes,  |
| but she could recall nothing of what had just happened in her         |
| trance-like state. About a week later she was driving with her son,   |
| and was seated in the front passenger seat. The same "man" again      |
| appeared, sitting between them, but her son did not see him. His      |
| presence was accompanied by an abrupt change in the weather, which    |
| had been rainy. It suddenly cleared, and Mrs Puddy could see for      |
| miles. When the figure vanished abruptly the rainy conditions again   |
| prevailed. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of        |
| Humanoid Reports, case 1973-09, citing Harry Little and Bill          |
| Stapleton).                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - A very low flying disc-shaped object was seen by two in        |
| Copnor, near Portsmouth, England at between 6:30-6:45 a.m. (Source:   |
| BUFORA Journal, April 1973, p. 33).                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1976 - Leonard Hegele, a 29-year old student, spotted a seven-foot    |
| tall humanoid with three-foot wide shoulders walking through a field  |
| about a mile from Interstate I-15 south of Great Falls, Montana at    |
| around 10 a.m. It walked with a non-human gait. Mr. Hegele stopped    |
| his car and attempted to chase the being, but when he got to within   |
| 700-800 feet, the creature turned around to face him and Hegele lost  |
| his courage and ran back to his car. While he was chasing the         |
| creature Hegele saw a gray, oval shaped object hovering in the air    |
| nearby. It hovered only 10 feet above the ground, but periodically    |
| rose and fell back down another 15 feet. (Sources: David F. Webb &    |
| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1976-41     |
| (A1463), citing Jerome Clark; Great Falls Tribune, February 23,       |
| 1976).                                                                |

| 1979 - In Meanwood, near Leeds, England at around 4:00 p.m. a         |
| eight-foot long ovoid object landed for three minutes. It left behind |
| landing traces. (Source: Timmothy Good, Above Top Secret, p. 72).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1988 - In suburban Irwin, Pennsylvania a silent, orange disc-shaped   |
| object flew close by to three witnesses. It had a colorful aura, and  |
| shot two beams of light down before zig-zagging away. (Source: Stan   |
| Gordon, MUFON UFO Journal, May 1989; MUFON field investigations       |
| database, case 880302).                                               |

| 1990 - A 17-year-old woman felt a gust of wind around 10 p.m. on her  |
| family farm in Henryville, Indiana and then saw a bright silver       |
| disc-shaped object with lights over some nearby trees, which were     |
| swaying. He dog howled, and later became sick. The disc flew away by  |
| making a vertical ascent. (Sources: James Delehanty, MUFON UFO        |
| Journal, May 1990; MUFON field investigations database, case 900402;  |

| 1997 - In Templeton, Massachusetts a 50-foot in diameter disc-shaped  |
| object with many lights around the rim made a droning sound as it     |
| flew over at 5:30 p.m. (Source: Francis L. Ridge, UFO Intelligence    |

| 2000 - A disc hovered low over a soccer field in Mexico City, Mexico  |
| at 2:00 a.m. It flashed multi-colored lights, then departed. (Source: |
