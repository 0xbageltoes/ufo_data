| empty balloon at ground level near the Isonzo River in Gorizia,       |
| Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. Near it, a ten-meter wide disc-shaped   |
| object was resting on a strange frame. The upper part of the disc was |
| white with a black dome, around which was a series of portholes. Some |
| of the portholes gave off a very bright, bluish-white light that      |
| suddenly went out as the object took off. The disc rose vertically    |
| while spinning and pulling the balloon with it. (Source: Jacques      |

| 1954 - Also at 8:45 p.m. near St. Samson-La-Poterie,                  |
| France 25-year-old Andre Vasseur and his wife were returning home on  |
| their tandem bicycle and were approaching the descent that precedes   |
| Hericourt-St. Samson when their attention was drawn to a hovering red |
| cigar shape gleaming in the sky. The shiny cigar-shaped object        |
| plunged abruptly towards the ground at a terrific clip, leaving       |
| behind a red trail and disappearing behind a hedge a few hundred      |
| meters from the road. When the young couple arrived at the top of the |
| hill, Mrs. Vasseur cried about when she was confronted by a strange   |
| being on the edge of the road, just inches from her handlebars. The   |
| figure was of human shape, but squat, and his head was capped with a  |
| helmet that came down to the shoulders. The strange being stood       |
| staring fixedly at her, and a pencil beam of orange light came from   |
| his eyes, which followed the woman. His wife lost consciousness and   |
| fell into her husband's arms, but Andre continued on with his wife.   |
| When he turned around to look back the being had still not moved.     |
| They both suffered from insomnia after the incident. Police           |
| reportedly found mysterious footprints at the site. (Source: Albert   |

| 1954 - At 10:30 p.m. in Fabriano, Marche, Italy two men, satirist     |
| Paolo Cutizi and writer Guilio Emery, were in a local park when they  |
| saw a disc-shaped object, six meters in diameter, hovering and        |
| emitting small violet flashes. On top of the object was a very tall   |
| antenna. Two small robot-like beings, 1.2 meters or four feet tall,   |
| descended from it on a long ladder. Their eyes were dark red and      |
| "sharp." They spoke something that sounded like "Dbanoda skigyay o    |
| dbano," then went back aboard their craft and flew away. (Source:     |

| 1959 - Two teenagers were in Poquoson, Virginia at 6:15 in the        |
| evening when they saw a four foot wide black disc with a silver ring  |
| around it, hovering at eighty feet altitude and making a whirring     |
| noise. One of them took a shot at it with a rifle, and they heard a   |
| clank suggesting that the bullet hit a solid object, then the UFO     |
| disappeared. (Sources: Flying Saucer Review, November 1961, p.27; C.  |

| 1973 - In West Melbourne, Florida a youth called the sheriff's        |
| department and said he had been watching television at 4:30 p.m. he   |
| looked out the window of his house and saw a UFO in his front yard.   |
| Apparently the craft just materialized on the ground and did not fly  |
| in. He told the department a creature got out that had silvery skin,  |
| crab-like claws, antennas, and looked into his living room window     |
| with "scary eyes." The sheriff's department quotes him as saying the  |
| creature got back into the saucer-shaped object and flew off. It      |
| notes that during the same time there were other reports. (Source:    |

| 1973 - On this evening in Draguignan, France four youths in two cars  |
| drove up a small mountain called Le Malmont to investigate the        |
| sighting of an orangish yellow UFO seen earlier in the day by a       |
| friend and his girlfriend. No UFO was seen, but a being was seen      |
| approaching the group silhouetted by a diffuse white glow. Later two  |
| of the witnesses saw three entities chasing their car. The entities   |
| were wearing one-piece suits with red lights at the waist level. They |
| wore square helmets with luminous, rectangular eye slots. One of the  |
| beings wore something resembling a gas mask with a veil covering the  |
| face. Their gait was slow and mechanical. Meanwhile, the two          |
| witnesses in the other car twice saw two sets of "red legs" cross the |
| road. A short while later their car was swung sideways across the     |
| road and then back again by some unseen force. Other effects included |
| EM interference with the engines of both cars, a sensation of heat,   |
| an odor like burnt insulating tape, and one of the cars was shaken    |
| while parked. The beings made modulated whistling sounds. A powerful  |
| white light beam was also seen. No physical traces were found at any  |
| of the sites. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:       |

| the early evening when they began to bark. Further ahead he saw a     |
| landed, round UFO, 40-45 feet in diameter, with white and blue lights |
| around it. From the object's illumination he could see a ladder and   |
| two beings standing beside it. They were human like, about six feet   |
| tall. When they saw the farmer and his dogs they got into the UFO,    |
| which rose slowly with a low humming noise and then took off at high  |

| 1973 - A woman was alone traveling by car in Iowa when she noticed a  |
| bright light over the next approaching hill. She dimmed her lights    |
| and when she crested the hill she noticed a landed disc-shaped object |
| in a nearby cornfield. She slowed her vehicle and saw that the UFO    |
| had a slight dome on top and was glowing with a blue light. She       |
| called her husband on her CB radio and described the object but soon  |
| static made it impossible to communicate by radio. She stopped the    |
| vehicle and the next thing she remembered was watching the object     |
| take off at high speed. Later under hypnosis the witness remembered   |
| seeing five figures standing around her car looking at her. They were |
| about five feet tall with pasty white faces and huge elongated eyes.  |
| They had two holes for a nose and slit like mouths. Moments later she |
| found herself inside the object where she saw walls, lots of          |
| machinery, and also a very bright light. She next found herself in a  |
| room with several monitor-like screens and two humanoids standing     |
| near her. These creatures seemed to have claw-like hands. One of the  |
| beings was described as more human looking, a female with long hair,  |
| a skirt, and a band around her head. The male beings wore one-piece   |
| silver metallic jump suits, with gloves, boots, and belts across the  |
| chest area. She remembers lying on a table and being forced to remove |
| her clothing. After a physical examination she is led outside by two  |
| of the beings and floated to her vehicle. (Sources: Albert S.         |

| when her engine, power brakes and steering quit. No UFO was seen, but |
| a small, metallic man appeared after she had pulled her car to the    |
| side of the road. The being had a bubble-dome head or helment with    |
| rectangular eye openings. The head moved like a robot's. From the     |
| elbows down the arms were narrow and wrinkled, like a chicken's legs. |
| It moved around the car, then was gone. Afterwards she found the      |
| engine billowing smoke and the hood intensely hot. (Source: David F.  |

| They then saw a three-foot tall humanoid in a gold metallic coverall  |
| standing directly below the object. Their dog fled the area, and      |
| didn't return until the next day. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted       |

| 1997 - The witness heard a strange noise in her kitchen in Crofton,   |
| Maryland at 2:00 a.m. Thinking it was her cat she went to             |
| investigate. At the entrance to her kitchen she encountered several   |
| humanoids, which she described as about five feet tall, with pale     |
| grayish skin and large black eyes. The humanoids seemed to be         |
| inspecting a silverware tray, sliding it back and forth. Suddenly one |
| of the humanoids turned and saw the witness, who promptly fainted.    |
| After a few moments she came to lying on the floor of the kitchen.    |
| She looked up and saw three humanoids huddled together. Feeling a     |
| surge of terror she fainted again, but not before seeing a silvery    |
| flashing sphere hovering over her. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,        |

| 1998 - Several men were out elk hunting in an isolated area near      |
| Vernal, Utah when they saw what appeared to be a plane crashing. They |
| left their truck and proceeded over a nearby ridge to investigate. As |
| they got closer to the area they saw two more craft hovering over the |
| area. On the ground they saw what appeared to be some "people"        |
| gathered around. They reported their sighting to the National UFO     |
| Reporting Center. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact        |

| 1998 - A witness at 9:30 p.m. in Defiance, Ohio was just pulling out  |
| of a driveway when he noticed a triangular craft with a light at each |
| corner, two white and one blue. He pulled over to get a better look,  |
| and watched as it flew silently close to the ground and behind some   |
| trees. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center,       |

| 2000 - At ten o'clock in the evening a white object hovered low over  |
| a school in Chiu-Chiu, Atacama, Chile. Fresia Berlina Vega, a young   |
| woman, was playing with 10-year-old Valentina, daughter of a local    |
| schoolteacher, on the school grounds when they both saw a bright      |
| star-like light suddenly appear in the sky. The light quickly         |
| descended towards the witnesses, emitting bright blue, red and        |
| yellow flashes of light. They could see a huge round object, the size |
| of a soccer field, that hovered just outside the school perimeter at  |
| 40 feet above the ground. Next, a noise like a thunder clap was       |
| heard, and a panel opened on the object and a bright beam of light    |
| shone down from the object illuminating both of them. Fresia felt a   |
| cold wave envelope her body. The beam of light then retreated back    |
| into the object and another thunderclap was heard. The                |
| object remained above the witnesses for a few more moments in which   |
| Fresia again felt a definite change of temperature, and she felt her  |
| head was swelling up. Momentarily, she was overcome with a state of   |
| complete relaxation, and she felt a prickling sensation invade her    |
| entire body. Meanwhile, Valentina felt the same presence and          |
| complained of a headache and discomfort in her nose; she was later to |
| suffer from insomnia. They may have experienced missing time and had  |
| a brief abduction experience at this time, because they were both     |
| found dazed and shivering. As the object moved away towards a nearby  |
| cemetery both witnesses felt a slight tremor in the earth. Fresia     |
| reported some beneficial aftereffects from the encounter, because a   |
| persistent back pain went away, but she also experienced              |
| irregularities with her menstrual cycle. She felt also more relaxed   |
| and at ease. She would have peculiar "dreams" in which several short  |
| dark human-like figures with large heads would approach her and ask   |
| her how she was feeling. They reassured her that things were going to |
| improve in her life. She further described the beings as about 1.50   |
| meters in height, wearing thick soled boots. She is convinced that    |
| she will see them again some day. (Sources: UFO Magazine (USA),       |
