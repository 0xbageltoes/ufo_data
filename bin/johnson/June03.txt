| 1920 - At 10:30 a.m. a small metallic blue, vertical cylinder, shaped |
| like a "milk-can," landed only 15 feet away from the witness, sat on  |
| the ground for 15 minutes northeast of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, then     |
| took off and flew away to the west. It made no noise. (Sources: MUFON |

| 1959 - On this day in Bloomington, Indiana a torpedo-shaped object    |
| first hovered, then dove out of sight. (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO |

| 1961 - In the sea off the town of Savona, Italy four people who were  |
| taking a ride in a small motorboat were suddenly rocked by growing    |
| waves. They stood up and noticed the sea swell up like an enormous    |
| bubble a kilometer away, with large waves widening into a circle. A   |
| few seconds later an object emerged and hovered at 10 meters altitude |
| above the waves for a brief time. Its lower part was similar to an    |
| upside down plate and the upper part was shaped like a cone. As it    |
| was emerging from the water the object seemed to push it as if there  |
| was an air pillow. After it had emerged completely, the object        |
| stopped for a few seconds in the air at about 10 meters above the     |
| surface. After a few sways, a mark around the base formed and the     |
| object rapidly departed following a trajectory oblique to the sea     |
| surface and disappeared towards the northeast. (Sources: Passport to  |

| 1962 - A doctor and his wife, Sr. & Sra. Gazua were driving to        |
| Parana, Entre Rios province, Argentina and were near the town of      |
| Crespo at 1:15 a.m. when they saw a luminous truncated cone, 3-4      |
| meters high, on the ground 100 meters away. Through a doorway in the  |
| object they saw a being of normal height, wearing a diver suit with a |
| hood. Inside was seated a second man. They drove on. (Source: David   |

| 1964 - At 8:45 p.m. three people at the Coppermine trading post,      |
| south-southwest of Page, Arizona saw an ovoid object fly in the       |
| southern sky for 15 minutes. It had a red misty glow. A second ovoid  |
| flew off to the northwest. There were a total of 10 separate          |
| observers. At 10:00 a luminous blue blimp-shaped object hovered low   |
| over New River, Arizona. It ascended and flew off to the              |
| south-southwest when it was illuminated by car headlights. (Sources:  |

| 1965 - A vertical cigar-shaped object hovered for 20 minutes over     |
| Heytesbury, Wiltshire, England starting at 8:30 p.m. It then turned   |

| 1965 - On this night a large luminous object encased in a bright      |
| green glow hovered low over a field in Monte Negro, Rio Grande do     |
| Sul, Brazil. Through an opening two humanoids wearing brown suits and |
| with dark round eyes were seen looking out. (Source: Albert S.        |

| 1966 - Cape Canaveral, Florida - Three boys were playing behind their  |
| apartment about 7:30 p.m. when they saw a "rocket or jet" zip across  |
| the sky and disappear behind the building, apparently dropping into   |
| the water. They ran to the beach and saw, about 30 yards ahead, two   |
| men, talking, with their backs to them. The boys said the two men     |
| wore "glass helmets and gray suits with something that looked like    |
| scuba tanks on their backs." One of the youngsters was so surprised   |
| that he made a sound, startling the men. They scrambled quickly       |
| aboard a "round white thing" which sped to a strange floating device  |
| about 300 feet offshore. There were windows in the floating object,   |
| they said, and they could see people moving inside. On one side,      |
| there was a gray star with some type of identifying letters. The boys |
| ran back at the same time the men raced for the object, and when they |
| paused to look back, they were expecting the craft to take to the     |
| air. Instead, it submerged and vanished. (Sources: Lucius Farish &    |

| 1966 - Two witnesses in West Point City, Pennsylvania observed a      |
| stationary object three meters above the ground at 9:45 p.m. It had a |
| diameter of seven meters, with lights on top and bottom and smaller   |
| lights on the rim. It flew away very fast to the east. (Source:       |

| 1967 - At 12:30 a.m. a secretary in Moorestown, New Jersey saw two    |
| disc-shaped UFOs, one with a bright white light, the second           |
| with white, red and green lights. The UFOs hovered over a huge radar  |
| antenna. The second disc "pulsed" first. (Source: NICAP case file,    |

| 1967 - Shortly after 10 p.m., on Lake Nipissing, Ontario a buoy       |
| tender named Arcand observed green and white lights between two small |
| islands. Thinking another boatman might be in trouble, the buoy       |
| tender headed toward the lights. He was about 100 feet away when the  |
| lights rose from the water "with a whoosh" and sped off into the      |
| night. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, March 1968, p. 5; Ivan T.    |

| 1969 - Four observers driving in a truck in Vicuna, Chile at 5:05     |
| a.m. saw an orange oval-shaped object that flew fast, stopped,        |
| reversed its direction of flight, did some general maneuvering, and   |
| then made an abrupt change in elevation. They saw two luminous        |
| figures hide from view. A beam of energy paralyzed the exposed arms   |
| of two of the witnesses. (Sources: CICA Boletin, December             |

| 1969 - Starting at around 6:00 p.m. many townspeople watched three    |
| disc-shaped UFOs maneuver over the town of Angra dos Reis, Rio de     |
| Janeiro state, Brazil for hours. Two of the objects flew off very     |
| fast to the south toward the sea, while one stayed behind and         |
| continued to play around in sky. (Source: Walter Buhler, FSR Case     |

| 1973 - A circular indentation five meters across was found as a       |
| possible UFO landing site in Old Junee, New South Wales, Australia.   |
| Close by were six pod marks about 1 meter in diameter, spaced at a    |
| regular distance apart. (Source: Bill Chalker, Australasian           |

| 1974 - Maubeuge, Nord department, France. A domed disc with a thin    |
| base and blinkers, blinked in response to flashlight signals, but     |
| flew away when a car attempted to approach it. (Source: Lumieres dans |
| la Nuit, issue #141).                                                 |

| 1975 - A ten-meter diameter disc-shaped object zig-zagged across a    |
| road on Palmer Island, New South Wales, Australia. It is possible     |
| there had been a landing because the object had been so close to the  |
| ground, and animals were upset. There were 5 witnesses, and the       |
| sighting lasted two minutes. (Source: Bill Chalker, The Oz Files, p.  |
| 207)                                                                  |

| 1976 - Two people saw a disc-shaped object the color of silver or     |
| chrome moving nearby in the sky over Troy, Michigan at 9:55 p.m. They |
| followed it in their car for some time as it changed directions and   |
| moved erratically about. They also heard unusual static on the car    |
| radio during the sighting. Eventually the object suddenly left very   |
| quickly and they could not keep pace with it. (Sources: Mark          |
| Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, case 398,      |

| 1977 - At eight o'clock in the evening two people driving in a car in |
| Hanover, Northern Cape province, South Africa experienced radio       |
| static on their car radio as a three meter wide nocturnal             |
| light paced their car. The color of the object was blinding white,    |
| but they were unable to determine its shape. Their close encounter    |
| lasted 20 minutes in total. (Source: Cynthia Hind, UFOs--African      |

| 1982 - At around 4:00 a.m. a young woman in Brooklyn, New York was    |
| awakened by a voice slowly calling her name. When she got up from bed |
| she saw a large glowing object outside her window. She saw two        |
| man-like figures staring at her from inside the craft, and a small    |
| table inside the object. The two men began moving back and forth very |
| quickly. The UFO then changed into a bright fiery flame and           |
| disappeared. The woman received a telepathic message before it        |
| departed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1982, |

| 1986 - On this night Paulo Pereira Campos was returning to his home   |
| accompanied by his two daughters in a rural part of Nego, Minas       |
| Gerais state, Brazil. He noticed a luminous yellow, oval-shaped       |
| object approaching them. They all ran and hid in a bamboo grove,      |
| where they watched the object land about 200 meters away. Two short   |
| figures emerged from the UFO and walked around the area for 15        |
| minutes. They then entered the craft and it took off and left.        |
| Footprints were found at the site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,        |

| 1989 - At 10:46 p.m. a couple driving in Long Beach, Washington       |
| observed four glowing footballs, which they estimated were twenty to  |
| thirty feet long and at an altitude of 700 feet above them. (Source:  |

| 1992 - At 11:30 p.m. a witness driving on highway D28 west of         |
| Melesse, France sighted a seven-foot long transparent ovoid           |
| object over a pasture. It approached and the witness was able to see  |
| a tall, thin humanoid behind a control panel inside the object.       |
| A nearby tree was scorched, apparently by heat coming from thce UFO.  |

| 1995 - A white cigar-shaped object zig-zagged through the sky at      |
| araound 8:00 p.m. on Harwood Island, New South Wales, Australia. Then |
| a huge ovoid object rose from the ground, leaving behind traces. A    |
| dog became sick. (Sources: Bill Chalker, Australasian Ufologist,      |

| 2000 - In Manzanita, Oregon there were two independent reports of     |
| orange colored lights coming from the northwest, traveling in a line  |
| at a fast speed. The most seen at any one time were three. The first  |
| report was at 9:45 p.m. and the second at 10:00 p.m. The first report |
| commented that the three bright orange/yellow lights appeared to meet |
| up over the ocean, and then travel inland. (Source: Peter Davenport,  |
