| 1897 - A telegraph operator between Girard, Illinois and Carlinville  |
| got a message from Carlinville, Illinois that an airship was headed   |
| his way. He went out and saw a 100 foot long object that landed near  |
| the railroad track. It had what looked like a large "M" on its side,  |
| and several occupants in the cupola. The craft rose vertically, and   |
| then flew off quickly toward the north. (Source: Philip L. Rife, It   |

| 1897 - At 11:15 p.m. two men, Chamberlain and Jones, saw a very large |
| figure walking around in a clearing looking for something near Lake   |
| Elmo, Minnesota. Nearby was a grayish white cylindrical object with   |
| two rows of lights, red and green. It took off with a rushing sound.  |
| Fourteen giant footprints, two feet long by six inches wide, were     |
| found at the site. (Sources: Philip L. Rife, It Didn't Start with     |

| 1952 - In Torpo, Norway at 10:35 p.m. a fireball came down in some    |
| nearby woods. It lit up the area, hovered, maneuvered, then shot away |
| to the south at great speed. (Source: newspaper clipping, June 7,     |

| 1952 - At 4:45 p.m. a disc-shaped object with an erratic flight path  |
| moved very fast through the sky east of Moriarty, New Mexico. It      |
| tilted and vanished, then reappeared. There were four military        |
| witnesses. (Sources: NICAP Projects Grudge and Blue Book Report, p.   |

| 1967 - Two young boys saw a dark gray object overhead at sunset in    |
| Sjaellands, Denmark. One ran home while the other hid in a ditch. The |
| UFO descended and put out three legs as if to land, but then retraced |
| them and moved out over the Kattegat. As it passed over the shore it  |
| threw out some "boxes." Hovering low over the water, the object       |
| lowered a box on an arm-thick cable, and eight small humanoid figures |
| emerged from the large object and descended on the cable. They were   |
| the same size as the boy and all but one wore striped suits and had   |
| scuba like packs on their backs. The eighth UFOnaut wore a blue       |
| uniform and had no pack. They all had on striped caps and lights on   |
| their shoulders, and carried objects that looked like binoculars or   |
| cameras. They waved to the boy before the object disappeared. A lump  |
| of strange material was later found on the shore. When it was         |
| analyzed it was found to be an unprecedented mixture of substances.   |

| 1998 - Minot, North Dakota. Thirty-nine-year old Antonio McCoy found  |
| himself inside a round, whitish-blue room, lying down on some kind of |
| table. A figure wearing a bluish shiny suit approached him. The being |
| was carrying something resembling a "tine tuning fork" and was        |
| attempting to place it over the witness torso. The witness attempted  |
| to resist but some invisible force or paralysis kept him still. He    |
| experienced severe headaches after the incident and reported seeing   |
| strange black helicopters flying around his neighborhood. (Source:    |
