| 1905 - A large luminous cylindrical object hung in the sky in a       |
| vertical orientation over Cardiff, Wales, U.K. on this day at 10:00   |
| o'clock in the evening. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Computer Catalog,    |

| 1959 - At eight o'clock in the evening 26-year-old Horst Raps of      |
| Lampertheim, Germany had gone out for a walk as recommended by his    |
| doctor after being diagnosed with lung disease. As he walked along he |
| sighted a light coming down from the sky. The light approached and he |
| saw an object hovering just one meter above the ground. The craft was |
| saucer-shaped and surrounded by a blue-violet light. It had a cupola  |
| on top that emitted bright beams of light. Fascinated, he watched as  |
| a stairway descended to the ground and a tall, heavy-set man emerged. |
| The figure wore a tight-fitting, multicolored uniform. He approached  |
| Raps and spoke to him in perfect German.. He warned the witness of    |
| approaching future dangers and asked him to return to the same place  |
| three days later. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact        |

| 1966 - There are sixteen unexplained UFO reports recorded for this    |
| day in UFOCAT. All occurred in either the late afternoon or evening,  |
| between 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. local time. One occurred in Australia and  |
| one in Brazil. The rest were in the Northeastern United States and    |
| Canada. |

| 1966 - At 4:15 p.m. in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire a witness saw a   |
| brown, box-shaped object with silvery tripod legs on the ground, from |
| a distance of only 24 feet. It maneuvered out from under trees before |
| accelerating straight up and out of sight. It made a humming sound    |
| and then a higher-pitched whining sound when it accelerated. The      |
| witness felt a blast of air from the object, which left landing       |
| imprints in the soil.                                                 |

| 1966 - At 4:20 p.m. a L-shaped box was seen sitting on the ground on  |
| four legs in Henniker, New Hampshire. It too maneuvered through trees |
| and then ascended. Landing traces were also found at this site.       |
|                                                                       |
| 1966 - Five hours later, at 9:15 p.m. in Hamilton, Ontario Mr.       |
| Cozens saw two white oval-shaped UFOs land in a field. When the       |
| witness walked up and touched the four-foot long antenna on one of    |
| the objects his hand was burned. There was a flash and a buzzing      |
| sound when the injury occurred. The objects had red, blue and green   |
| flashing lights in a circle around their centers. (Sources: Raymond   |

| 1968 - At 1:15 a.m. a 22-year-old mechanic riding a motorbike between |
| Fos-sur-Mer and Port Saint Louis in Arles, France observed a UFO      |
| descend and land near a power transformer. An opening appeared in the |
| base of the object and a bright white light shone out from it. Then a |
| human-looking entity emerged and descended to the ground on a kind of |
| ramp. He wore something resembling a security guard's uniform with a  |
| "rolled collar." The suit was light colored and brilliant, and        |
| appeared woven with heavy stitches. The man's hair was in a crew-cut  |
| and was very light blond or white in color. The UFOnaut examined the  |
| ground around him and then noticed the witness, whom he watched for a |
| moment before re-entering the object. The UFO took off gently with a  |
| gust of cool air. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |

| Jean Marie Bigorne; Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database      |

| 1973 - Armando Silva and his wife, of La Salina, were at their        |
| country home at the seashore near Caracaya, Venezuela. On the evening |
| of March 28th they had seen two elongated bluish objects high         |
| overhead. At about one o'clock at night they awoke to stifling heat   |
| inside their house. Mr. Silva went to the balcony and saw the two     |
| blue, capsule shaped objects they had seen earlier now flying near    |
| the shore. One of them dropped into the sea and re-emerged on the     |
| surface. It was then joined by the second, which bobbed on the        |
| surface nearby. Silva went down to the beach to get a better view.    |
|                                                                       |
| At one of the small windows of the first little object that came down |
| from the sky he saw a tiny figure like a five-year-old child. The     |
| craft was floating only a few meters from shore. "I was terrified     |
| when...I saw a tiny figure...wearing on its head what looked like a   |
| great gourd. I cannot say for sure that it was an intelligent being,  |
| since I only saw half of its body and its head, which, as I say,      |
| looked like a gourd. Nor did I see any arms. And I didn't wait to see |
| if it made any movements." Sr. Silva turned on his heels and ran back |
| into the house, where his wife was watching from the balcony. The two |
| UFOs that had come down from the sky were still bobbing up and down   |
| in the water when he rejoined her. The incident lasted about 15       |
| minutes. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue   |
