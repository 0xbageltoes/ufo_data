| 1950 - The crew of Northwest Air Lines flight 802 sighted two white   |
| flashes, followed by a dark cloud that rose higher in the sky, and    |
| then split in two. The sighting occurred ten miles northwest of       |
| Gulcana, Alaska at 10:13 p.m. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook |

| 1953 - At around 1 p.m. a huge white disc-shaped UFO with brilliant   |
| beams of light was seen over Marcillat-en-Combraille, Allier          |
| department, France. It shot up and away, leaving behind a red         |
| crescent-shaped object. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History.     |

| 1954 - On this morning a young girl, Miss Frassinetti, saw a luminous |
| barrel hovering vertically over a nearby field in Predale, Casina,    |
| Italy. She said that a "man" was watching her through a window in the |
| object. (Sources: Maurizio Verga, ITACAT: Italian UFO Catalogue;      |

| 1954 - At 5:00 p.m. farmer Pedro Morais of Linha Bela Vista, Rio      |
| Grande do Sul, Brazil first noticed a disturbance among his chickens  |
| in the farmyard. He then saw a UFO shaped like an "enormous polished  |
| brass kettle" with a rectangular structure on top, making a sound     |
| like a sewing machine, hovering in the air with an oscillating        |
| motion. Two small humanoids "enveloped in a kind of yellow sack from  |
| head to toe" were standing in a nearby field. As he approached, one   |
| ran toward him, the other raised its arm. The first one knelt down    |
| and plucked a tobacco plant from the field, then both jumped into the |
| craft, which vanished within a few seconds. (Sources: Donald Hanlon,  |

| 1957 - An orange circular or crescent-shaped object moved erratically |
| through the sky over Lockbourne AFB, Ohio. It was sighted by the crew |
| of a U.S. Air Force F-86 from the 87th FIS and tracked by ground      |
| radar moving at a speed of Mach 1.5. (Source: Dominique Weinstein,    |

| 1958 - On this day a fuselage-shaped object had landed on the sea ice |
| on McMurdo Sound near Mount Erebus, Antarctica. It was supported by   |
| girder-like structures. A thirty-year-old U.S. Navy man named R.      |
| Benson saw two thin Grey beings, who were walking in slow circles     |
| near the craft, their long arms dangling to the ice. They had very    |
| long faces. His radio quit working. He did not file an official Navy  |
| report of his encounter. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1963 - At 7:00 a.m. in McMinnville, Oregon Dr. W. W. Dolan, a         |
| professor of mathematics and astronomy, and dean of the faculty of    |
| Linnfield College watched a bright, star-like light slow, hover, dim  |
| and flash for one minute. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO |

| 1965 - Charles Jones, who claims to be psychic and has frequently     |
| reported UFO sightings ever since 1947, was driving home between      |
| Sheridan and Lamong, Indiana at 1:05 p.m. when he saw a lighted       |
| object come down through the low clouds. It was shaped like a cigar,  |
| but with the rear end cut off on a bevel, and it bore a red and white |
| blinking light. The front had a transparent surface and through it    |
| Jones could see a very stockily built, six-foot tall occupant. The    |
| being appeared to be hiding his face from the witness. He wore a      |
| tight-fitting headpiece, continuous with the coveralls, that obscured |
| the hair and ears. Jones did however observe one eye, which he said   |
| was larger than normal sized and set more toward the side of the      |
| head. The face also had a wide nose and jowls. The complexion of the  |
| face was dark bronze, and the entity was wearing a one-piece brown    |
| coverall. The object was less than 60 feet off the ground and         |
| approximately 150 feef from the left side of the road, traveling      |
| north. (Sources: Janet Bord, FSR, May-June 1972, p. 20; David F. Webb |
| & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1965-68). |

| 1973 - A 54-year-old woman spotted an eleven-meter wide yellow        |
| dome-shaped object with striped dark bars from her residential        |
| neighborhood of Frameries, Hainaut, Belgium at 5:45 a.m. The object   |
| flew in front of the witnessat 12 meters altitude. It had 4 or 5 bars |
| and small red and blue lights slowly flashing underneath every two    |
| seconds, plus two headlights. At 6:30 p.m. a luminous white           |
| disc-shaped object hovered in place over Dilbeek, Brabant, Belgium    |
| for a few minutes. It then swung silently around to show its edge, at |
| the end of which flashed two red lights. The UFO climbed into the     |
| sky, leaving toward the northeast. There were three adult witnesses.  |

| 1973 - At 6:30 p.m. an oval-shaped object with a tower or antenna on  |
| top, pulsated red over a pasture, a quarter of a mile north of        |
| Calvert, Texas. It was sighted by a mother and daughter named         |
| Smitherman, who reported it made a whooshing sound, took off fast,    |
| then landed again behind some trees. It left behind some landing      |
| traces on the ground. (Source: Calvert (TX) Tribune, December 20,     |
| 1973).                                                                |

| 1975 - At 11:30 p.m. Bud Le Duc was driving home from Toppenish,      |
| Washington when his headlights fell on three very tall men standing   |
| beside the road. One of them jumped--in one bound--to the middle of   |
| the roadway, a distance of about 15 feet, and the leap appeared to    |
| happen in slow motion. The man then slowly raised both his arms above |
| his head. Le Duc swerved his car and passed within two or three feet  |
| of him. The man was between seven and eight feet tall and very thin,  |
| with long arms and matted reddish, shoulder-length hair. His very     |
| long face had a long pointed nose and pallid white skin. The upper    |
| lip was pulled back to show teeth, while the lower lip was very thin. |
| He wore a black one-piece garment with white bands at the wrists and  |
| ankles and a patch of white at the neck. He also had on black boots.  |
| The other two men were dressed in a similar manner. The man in the    |
| road held something reddish purple in his left hand, "with a wire on  |
| it." Le Duc kept driving, but shortly afterwards saw an elongated     |
| luminous object behind his truck, which blinked on and off several    |
| times. Soon a bright light illuminated his truck's cab and            |
| surroundings, and stayed with the truck until Le Duc reached his      |
| home. Another source, UFO investigator Greg Long, reported that at    |
| the same time that Le Duc had this encounter with the strange men on  |
| the road, the apparition of a very close friend who had been recently |
| killed in a car accident appeared to be sitting in the passenger      |
| seat. (Sources: David W. Akers and William Vogel for CUFOS, report    |

| 1978 - On this afternoon a police trooper in Avellino, Italy took a   |
| photograph of a round, possibly disc-shaped object that was directing |
| an intense beam of energy at the ground. The photograph, taken from a |
| highway patrol car, shows a black dot on white background. (Source:   |

| 1978 - A taxi driving on a road near the town of Navelli, Abruzzi,    |
| Italy was forced to brake at 10 p.m. when two luminous globes were    |
| blocking the road ahead. The engine of the vehicle then died. Two     |
| humanoids glided across the surface without touching the ground.      |

| 1978 - On this night in Arembepe, Brazil a tall human-like figure     |
| with light colored skin, dark hair, and wearing a tight fitting       |
| silvery suit and boots was seen coming out of a metallic basin-shaped |
| object about 12 meters in diameter that had landed in a field.        |

| 1979 - At 2:00 in the afternoon a 64-year-old husband and wife,       |
| "Melvin" and "Naomi", were at their mountain home near Lake Isabella, |
| 35 miles from Bakersfield, California watching television when both   |
| suddenly passed out. Their memories returned only partially, but they |
| seemed to have had 48 hours of missing time with an abduction aboard  |
| a UFO. The wife remembered being in some kind of operating room,      |
| lying naked on top of the examination table and unable to move. She   |
| saw her husband trying to enter the room but was prevented by a panel |
| that rose from the floor and blocked him. The husband recalled being  |
| in a room with a Grey, faceless woman, five-foot ten inches tall who  |
| communicated with him via telepathy and refused to release him. Both  |
| remembered feeling cold and hearing the sound of an engine. Other     |
| partial memories included a man and a woman entering their house, and |
| the feeling of being watched and threatened by an unseen presence.    |
| The couple was found incoherent and suffering various burns and other |
| injuries that they never fully recovered from. (Sources: Howard Ford, |

| 1994 - Two observers in Tiete, Sao Paolo State, Brazil watched a      |
| luminous greenish sphere land nearby them at 11:00 p.m.. Two humanoid |
| figures appeared next to the object. They were described as 1.20      |
| meters tall, with very pale skin and four-fingered hands, large       |
| staring eyes, and two small holes for a nose. One of the witnesses    |
| directed a flashlight at the figures, and a beam of light from the    |
| object immediately disabled it. The beings and the object then left.  |
| Crushed grass was found at the scene. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 2000 - Three formations of UFOs, 25-30 in each, flew slowly at high   |
| altitude over Zurish, Switzerland on this evening. They had various   |
| golden-yellow and green lights. The formations were in an irregular   |
| pattern something like an elongated egg shape. (Source: UFO Magazine  |
