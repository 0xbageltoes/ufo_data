| 1953 - At 9:00 a.m. an object shaped like an airplane "wing tank"     |
| fell from the sky over Ontario, California. It stopped in midair,     |
| turned into a circular shape, then shot off toward the north at an    |

| 1954 - At 8:00 p.m. red luminous cloud-cigar was seen by three people |
| emitting disc-shaped UFOs in Fontainebleu, France. The object was     |
| surrounded by a luminous vapor. The cigar-shaped UFO flew in a manner |
| to avoid a passing airplane. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer         |

| private pilot J. N. Williams and his friend E. J. Ash observed a      |
| thin, translucent tan asymmetrical boomerang-shaped object as it came |
| down behind some trees. The object appeared to be revolving, and it   |
| then tumbled down behind the trees. Marks were found in the dirt at   |
| the supposed landing site. The ground was "pulverized" with dirt torn |
| up and small rocks disturbed. Their sighting lasted 15 minutes.       |

| 1956 - At 7:50 p.m. Mr. Borrud, an amateur astronomer, sighted a dull |
| metallic elliptical object over Williston, North Dakota. It was the   |
| size of a small airplane, and it oscillated in a side-to-side motion  |
| as it moved above the Missouri River. The estimated speed of the      |
| craft was 150 miles per hour, and the sighting lasted five minutes.   |

| 1967 - In Caracas, Venezuela a horse trainer was awakened on this     |
| night by the presence of an intruder who first tugged at the          |
| trainer's pillow, then grasped his arm tightly. As the man tried to   |
| sit up, the attacker encircled his neck with its arm trying to choke  |
| him. A horse in the nearby stables began neighing and the attacker    |
| let go and fled. The man screamed for help and was found to have      |
| several cuts and abrasions where he had been scratched by claws or    |
| sharp fingernails. A short while later another stable worker heard a  |
| horse acting up again, and as he approached the stall a small figure  |
| about the size of a boy, 3.5 feet tall, "zoomed" out of the stall and |
| was gone in seconds. The figure was described as a hairy dwarf, and   |
| looking like a chimpanzee or monkey. The horse was skitish for        |
| several days following the incident. (Sources: Jim & Coral Lorenzen,  |

| 1967 - At 8:30 p.m. a priest named O'Sullivan saw a luminous ball of  |
| light in the sky while driving three miles outside of Gravois Mills,  |
| Missouri with two other men. The UFO swung around to the northwest,   |
| then to the north, and flew off toward the northeast. It was flat     |
| with a dome shape on top. The sighting lasted 15 minutes. (Source:    |

| 1969 - On this evening a woman was walking with her son along a       |
| footpath in a wooded area in Montreal, Quebec when they noticed a     |
| bright circular object on the ground at the edge of the woods. There  |
| were three men standing outside of the object and two men inside. The |
| men were described as very tall, over seven-foot tall, thin, and      |
| wearing tight-fitting one-piece garments. The witness left to get     |
| other witnesses but upon returning the object and the humanoids were  |
| already gone. A circular flattened area of grass was found at the     |
| site. That same evening in Saratoga, New York at 7 p.m. a large       |
| circle of white light was seen by three witnesses. It was flashing    |
| red, green and orange lights. It made no sound as it moved very       |
| slowly off at a low altitude. (Sources: (1) Jean Claude Bourret, The  |

| 1971 - An 18-year-old apprentice was riding his motorcycle near the   |
| beach in Semaphore Park Beach, South Australia at 8:40 p.m. when he   |
| saw a dull form in the sky with lighted sections. It descended to     |
| fifty feet over the sea, as close as 150 feet away. When he shone his |
| motorcycle's high beam headlight on the object the light dimmed. When |
| he did it a second time it did not respond again. (Source: Keith      |

| 1971 - At 11:45 p.m. a silent ovoid-shaped UFO flew at 500 to 1000    |
| meters altitude over the city of Marseille, France illuminating the   |
| area below it yellow in color. It made a sudden 70 degree turn and    |
| shot off toward the north. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue #    |

| 1971 - Sr. Paulo Caetano Silveira, age 27, a typewriter technician,   |
| found his car being followed by a red luminous disc while driving to  |
| his home in Itaperuna, Brazil. At Tombos he reported the matter to    |
| the local police, but they did not take him seriously. After he       |
| calmed down he started off again. This time, at about 7 p.m. and at a |
| small village named Serraria, he encountered a black object on the    |
| road that turned a luminous red and then blinding white in color, and |
| his car engine died. The object, slightly larger than a Volkswagen,   |
| had small windows and an open door. Next to it were standing three    |
| short, chubby beings approximately 20 inchestall, with fair           |
| complexions and slanted eyes. They wore one-piece, sky-blue coveralls |
| with high collars, and "Roman helmets" with spikes. They carried      |
| vivid red and blue lights and moved in a stiff, mechanical way.       |
|                                                                       |
| Two bright beams of light were focused on the witness's car and its   |
| doors popped open. These beams pulled the witness from the car and    |
| into the machine, whose interior was brilliantly illuminated by white |
| light. There was little in the way of furnishings inside, but inside  |
| were five more similar dwarfs. "An infernal din" commenced and        |
| believes the object flew some distance with him, but he shortly lost  |
| consciousness. The next thing he was remembered was being carried out |
| and laid on the road beside his car. The UFO then rose vertically,    |
| hovered a moment, then shot off laterally at a staggering speed. The  |
| witness was left in a state of shock and nearly blind. For five days  |
| he still could not see well and was extremely nervous. His watch had  |
| lost 15 minutes. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:     |

| 1971 - That same night in Twin Falls, Idaho two young boys reported   |
| that their farm animals were frantic when an orange UFO flashed and   |
| circled overhead. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, September 1971, p. |

| 1972 - At 9:00 a.m. Virgilio Gomez was driving along a lonely road    |
| near the University's experimental farm in Palenque, San Cristobal,   |
| Dominican Republic when a man wearing a light green coverall that     |
| covered even his feet waved him down. The man wore no gloves, and had |
| a sort of watch on his wrist. The man identified himself as Freddy    |
| Miller, a well-known Dominican baseball player who had disappeared    |
| mysteriously more than 13 years ago on May 5, 1959. He said that a    |
| UFO had rescued him from drowning in a boating accident, when two of  |
| his companions drowned, "because of my knowledge of radio technology  |
| and my intelligence." Nearby were two slender men seven feet tall.    |
| They were dressed like Miller. They had complexions like Orientals    |
| and short, chestnut colored hair. Miller pointed out to Gomez the     |
| craft in which they had arrived: it was football shaped, the size of  |
| an automobile, with a bright "nickel plated" surface. The             |
| conversation continued for about five minutes, during which Miller    |
| told Gomez that the humanoids were "supposedly from Venus." Then      |
| Gomez was told to leave, because theywere departing, and not to worry |
| if his car wouldn't function, because it would return to normal       |
| spontaneously. As he drove away Gomez saw the three men approach and  |
| get into the UFO. (Sources: Leonte N. Objio, APRO Bulletin, January   |

| 1973 - At around 6:00 a.m. Isobel Nielson saw an object that at first |
| seemed oval shaped, then assumed a domed disc perspective, as she was |
| travelling on the train near London, England from Glasgow, Scotland.  |
| She could not recall the exact location. (Source: J. Bernard Delair,  |

| 1974 - In Tayene, Tasmania, Australia a married woman was driving her |
| car along a mountain road with the radio on when the whole area lit   |
| up and a high-pitched whistle came over the radio. A glowing          |
| orange-silver disc dropped toward the road and approached to within   |
| 20 meters. It hovered 25 meters in front of the car just three meters |
| above the road as the woman backed up the car to escape. It then shot |
| straight up. The witness felt sick after incident. (Sources: W. K.    |

| unidentified bluish-green cigar-shaped object. The UFO had a          |
| horizontal row of 5-6 steady lights, which the flight crew presumed   |
| were windows. The distance between the Pan Am flight and the UFO at   |
| its closest approach was less than a mile. The estimated length of    |

| 1992 - On this day a group of children flying kites in Sentul, West   |
| Persekutuan, Malaysia saw a tiny being, which they described as       |
| human-like in appearance but measuring only 15 cm tall. The body was  |
| reported to be greenish in color and shiny. They said that the hands  |
| had only three fingers. On seeing the witnesses, the tiny creature    |
| scurried away into the housing project that was still under           |
| construction. On the same day a 13-year-old student, Law Wai Chow,    |
| claimed to have encountered a strange tiny entity in the same area.   |
| He described it as having eyes like those of humans but red in color  |
| and with no eyebrows. The creature had pointed ears. That afternoon   |
| another boy, Mohd Najib Rasli, age 12, went to the site where the     |
| creatures were reported earlier in the day. He spent nearly an hour   |
| searching for the creatures. Finally at 3 p.m. he spotted the tiny    |
| being near a hole in the ground. He tried to catch it but it          |
| immediately ran away and was lost from view. (Source: Albert S.       |

| 1992 - About 15 members of an international UFO group had gone to the |
| scene of previous encounters in Huaika Tabio, Colombia and were       |
| waiting for any unusual phenomena. At 8:05 p.m. they saw a large      |
| orange-colored sphere descend from the mountain and land about 300    |
| meters away from them. Five from the group approached and watched a   |
| beam of white light strike the ground ahead of them. From the ground  |
| it became a crescent shaped light, blue in color. Smoke then rose     |
| around the object and a tall blond-haired, Nordic-looking individual  |
| emerged from the smoke. He walked around briefly, then entered the    |

| over a farmhouse in Sornay, Saone-Loire department, France. The       |
| farm's dog barked furiously, and the UFO shot away at an incredible   |
| speed. The sighting lasted 3 minutes. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, |
| issue # 329).                                                         |

| 1995 - On hearing a humming sound at 8:45 p.m., four people in Navaho |
| Estates, Colorado went outside to see a 100 meter long rectangular    |
| object move slowly to the west at 60-80 feet altitude. It was yellow  |
| and had white lights oscillating on a rounded front, and red lights   |
| in the rear. After it went over a ridge eight or more blinking        |
| nocturnal lights crisscrossed in the same direction. Livestock in the |
| area panicked. The entire sighting lasted about two minutes.          |

| 1997 - A 67-year-old married couple named Becker heard a loud noise   |
| outside their rural home in Frazee, Minnesota at 11:30 p.m. Then they |
| saw five brilliant lights on a lenticular-shaped object the size of a |
| house. No structure could be discerned, but the UFO radiated bluish   |
| beams of light. Three more lights, round in shape, formed a triangle  |
| in the sky. (Source: Craig R. Lang, MUFON Minnesota).                 |
