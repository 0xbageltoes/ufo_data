| 1886 - On this night a loud humming noise awakened a family of nine   |
| in a hut in a village in Maracaibo, Venezuela. A vivid, dazzling      |
| light illuminated the inside of the hut. The family suffered symptoms |
| of apparent radiation exposure, including vomiting, hair loss,        |
| swelling, black blotches, and sores. Trees in the area withered and   |
| died nine days later. (Sources: Scientific American, December 1886,   |

| 1948 - Mr. and Mrs. Sanders were driving northwest on Highway 52      |
| towards Moorhead, Minnesota (46.88° N, 96.78° W) when they saw a      |
| brilliant golden-white round object suddenly appear as if a light had |
| been switched on. It was about three miles away to the northeast at   |
| 1,000 feet altitude in a gradual climb traveling at an estimated      |
| 600-1,000 mph and heading west towards Moorhead. It made no sound,    |
| and was about half the size of a full moon in angular size. When they |
| reached the northern outskirts of Moorhead the object suddenly made a |
| right turn and one second later disappeared by suddenly switching     |
| off. The Air Force said they had seen a meteor. (Source: Project Blue |

| 1952 - At 8:26 p.m. flying over Elberton, Alabama at 5,000 feet in a  |
| Beech T-11 trainer, USAF Lt. Rau and Capt. Marcinko sighted a deep    |
| orange, plate-shaped flying object with a brilliant front and vague   |
| trail. It flew with its concave surface forward and was in sight for  |
| five seconds. It moved much faster than F-80, and showed constant     |
| acceleration. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns;  |

| 1954 - At around six o'clock in the morning Ulderico Cardinali, a     |
| farmworker, was walking down a path in a marshy meadow in Castiglion  |
| Della Pescaia, Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy. He entered a patch of fog    |
| and started hearing a buzzing noise. When the fog became less dense,  |
| he could see a strange object on the ground which he first thought    |
| was a downed airplane. It resembled a large "plate" resting on the    |
| ground; it was two meters wide and made of some sort of highly        |
| polished material. There was a very peculiar looking creature         |
| standing beside the craft, who appeared to be no taller than 1.40     |
| meters and was dressed in a yellowish-brown uniform. It seemed that   |
| the being was performing some sort of task, moving about the craft.   |
| Once it had stopped moving about it went inside the object, entering  |
| a sort of cabin, and disappeared from sight. Then the object took off |
| from the location, emitting a slight buzzing noise and flying at very |
| low altitude, nearly brushing the tops of the trees in the meadow.    |

| 1954 - At 10:30 a.m. a three-meter in diameter disc-shaped object     |
| landed in the woods near Lalizolle, Allier, France. Dogs refused to   |
| go near it. It left behind a three-meter wide area of flattened       |
| grass. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case # 4048, citing |

| 1954 - In Saint Etienne de Baigorry, Pyrenees-Atlantiques, France at  |
| around 3:00 p.m. a shepherd watching his flock on a mountain peak     |
| called “Moumboa”, located at about 800 meters, reported seeing two    |
| “men” standing on the slope opposite him, looking around. At first he |
| thought they were excursionists, but he soon noticed a brown craft    |
| shaped like a large shell between them, so he did not                 |
| dare approach. It was three to four meters in diameter and a little   |
| more than a meter in height. In the center there was a small cabin,   |
| and at the two ends he could distinguish a number of small            |
| propellers. He said he did not notice any portholes. At the broad     |
| back end there was a bent tripod. After awhile the two men approached |
| the machine, which they then placed upright on the tripod. The        |
| witness supposed that the machine must have been made out of some     |
| very light weight material. One of the men then opened a narrow door  |
| and both individuals disappeared into the cabin. Without any noise    |
| the two groups of propellers started to turn, but in opposite         |
| directions. The machine took off vertically to an altitude of about   |
| 100 meters, and then flew off quickly to the north. The two men were  |
| similar to humans, Caucasian in appearance, and between 1.70-1.75     |
| meters tall. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, computerized catalog (N=3073), |

| 1954 - At 5:30 p.m. in Les Egots, Rhone, France near Sainte           |
| Catherine, a child saw a man emerge from a strange craft. He was      |
| "dressed in red, his clothes looked like iron." He walked             |
| stiff-legged, and had long hair and a hairy face. His eyes were       |
| large, "like those of the cows." (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to |

| 1954 - Between Biozat and Effiat, Puy-de-Dome, France at nine o'clock |
| in the evening, on the road from Clermont to Vichy, the engine of a   |
| motor scooter died when an egg-shaped object took off from the side   |
| of the road and rose without a noise, leaving a bright trail behind.  |

| 1954 - At 9:00 p.m. a doctor driving his car in Pancole, Tuscany,     |
| Italy saw a luminous globe stop at 20 meters altitude, just 50 meters |
| away. It took off when he stopped his car. (Source: Larry Hatch, U    |

| 1954 - At first, a dull white aluminum colored UFO was                |
| seen zig-zagging in the sky, starting at one o'clock in the           |
| afternoon, over Gravatai Air Force Base in Porto Alegre, Brazil.  It  |
| began making fast, tight circular turns through the clear blue sky,   |
| and kept up this behavior for over two hours. There was a misty halo  |
| around the object when it moved. A second UFO arrived sometime after  |
| two hours had elapsed, and circled the first one. (Sources: Donald E. |

| 1967 -  At 4:10 a.m. two police officers chased a pulsating bright    |
| flying cross-shaped UFO across farmland between Okehampton            |
| and Holsworthy in Devon, England. It maneuvered at low altitude over  |
| the treetops, and a second cross appeared after the first had gone.   |

| 1967 - At 10:15 p.m. a 30 foot in diameter round or disc-shaped       |
| object was seen in Buston, Derby, England. There was a yellow glow    |
| from the rear of the object that "caused treetops to bend." (Source:  |

| 1967 - A huge disc-shaped object was seen by four teenagers southeast |
| of Lumsden, Saskatchewan, Canada at 9:10 p.m. It hovered and then     |
| landed remotely. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, January-February 1968,      |

| 1967 - At 9:30 p.m. Donald Chiszar, age 13, and Pat Crosier, age 10,  |
| reported seeing a large light that came closer and hovered over a     |
| house in Newfield, New York only 50 yards away. It was a round object |
| with a cupola and antenna on top, and it had an oblong box on the     |
| bottom with red, green, and white lights. It was of a dull silver     |
| color, about 30 feet in diameter and 6-8 feet high. Around the rim    |
| were square shaped red and white lights. It tilted toward them, and   |
| they could see two big, square windows separated by a bar  in the     |
| dome. Through these windows two humanoid beings were visible, each    |
| less than 5'7" tall, with "rocky or bumpy" skin of a chocolate brown  |
| color. They stood motionless, peering out, while several additional   |
| shadows shadows were seen moving behind them. Knobs and electronic    |
| equipment were visible inside the lighted section. The domed disc     |
| hovered in the same spot for about two minutes, tilted upward in the  |
| rear. Then the rim lights became very bright, it assumed a horizontal |
| attitude, and shot away at great speed "like a puff of wind." The     |
| following night, Chiszar told investigators he saw two more of the    |
| same flying objects. The boys claimed their walkie-talkies            |
| malfunctioned during the observation, and a nearby dog was barking.   |

| 1967 - On this evening George W. Ritter and three other soldiers were |
| on guard duty at the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation in           |
| California when they all observed an orange fluorescent oval-shaped   |
| craft slowly approach, leaving a trail behind it. A hatch opened in   |
| the bottom of the craft and five small drones dropped out of it.      |
| These formed into a V formation and began hovering above the          |
| witnesses. As the men looked up they became mesmerized, and Ritter    |
| began hearing a "blip-blip" sound like sonar. All four felt paralyzed |
| at this point. Ritter's next recollection was of being abruptly       |
| lifted up into one of the objects. He then found himself lying on the |
| floor of the craft with a Grey humanoid looking down on him. The      |
| other three soldiers were nowhere in sight. The being had large black |
| oval-shaped eyes, grayish skin, and did not appear to be wearing any  |
| clothing. He saw three other similar smaller creatures that appeared  |
| to be assistants. He next heard a voice in his head telling him that  |
| he was not going to be hurt. Inside the object there was a misty      |
| weird light, resembling a black light. He was then given a shot in    |
| his thigh near the groin, and then one of the beings came up to his   |
| left side and somehow put his whole hand inside the upper left side   |
| of his chest. After some time he was taken into another room where he |
| saw a bright ball of light; it communicated telepathically with       |
| Ritter and emanated a sensation of energy and love. Ritter was        |
| told that "something wonderful was going to happen" in the near       |
| future  His next recollection was of standing back on the ground,     |
| looking up, but the objects had gone. He and the other men reported   |
| the incident to the military authorities, and as a result Ritter      |
| spent two months in a military mental hospital. (Source: Albert S.    |

| 1970 - Two people were driving between farms on this evening outside  |
| MacGregor, Manitoba when they sighted a glowing yellowish-white       |
| football-shaped object resting on a nearby field. One of the          |
| witnesses approached the object on foot but became frightened and ran |
| back to the car. As they drove away they noticed a silver-suited      |
| figure walking towards them. They accelerated the vehicle and sped    |
| away. Later one of them returned and saw the object hovering over the |
| area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1970,     |

| 1973 - An woman in Frederickstown, Ohio was turning into the driveway |
| of her home at nine o'clock when the car lights fell on an object. It |
| was hovering approximately 20 feet over an open area of her backyard. |
| Something "lit up" and the light became too bright to be merely the   |
| reflection of her car's headlights. The UFO was about 30 feet long    |
| and resembled an airplane's fuselage without wings, with an "open     |
| cockpit" at one end. Inside she was able to see three "hooded         |
| figures." She hurried into her house and when she looked out through  |
| a window, the object had vanished. (Source: Columbus Dispatch,        |

| night at 9:00 p.m. near Dobson, Surry County, North Carolina. It was  |
| 12 feet wide by 8 feet high. A humanoid with eyes "like balls of      |

| 1976 - At 10:30 p.m. Romeo Lucarelli was driving home from Hestroff   |
| to Hobling, Moselle, France with his little daughter when he saw two  |
| lights ahead, which he first took to be a car parked on a hilltop. As |
| he approached, he realized that it was a dumbbell or cigar-shaped UFO |
| about 15 meters long, hovering in the air about 100 meters altitude.  |
| After he had passed it by it began to follow him, and the UFO passed  |
| over his car so as to be in front of him. He signalled with           |
| his headlights, and then saw in the middle of the dumbbell a          |
| rectangular “screen” or window feebly lit by an orange light, in      |
| which the silhouettes of two occupants appeared, as if looking at     |
| him. He came to the village of Hobling and drove to his house,        |
| and the UFO was now hoveriong above his garage, so he pointed it out  |
| to his wife who was home at the time. She went and brought him the    |
| binoculars, but just as soon as he was about to use them the UFO      |
| “turned out its lights.” They next heard a dull humming sound. At the |
| spot at which he had first sighted the UFO three circular landing     |
| marks were found; each consisted of two tangential double circles of  |
| crushed grass, the outer ones about three feet larger in radius than  |
| the inner ones, and the entire area was about 50 feet wide. (Sources: |

| 1978 - Between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. two fishermen in a boat in    |
| Grottammare, Marche, Italy saw a 20 meter long, dark object emerge    |
| from the Adriatic Sea and hover for 30 seconds. It then dove back     |
| down to a depth of 20 meters. (Sources: Allen Hendry, International   |

| 1978 - At 7:45 p.m. a witness driving in a car had a close encounter  |
| with physiological effects with a four-meter in diameter orb that was |
| hovering low by some telephone lines in Compigny, Yonne, France. The  |
| driver felt an intense cold in the presence of the UFO, which shot up |

| 1981 - Two men were fishing close to the mouth of the River Salso     |
| near the city of Licata, Sicilia, Italy around 7:45 p.m. when they    |
| noticed some lights emerging from the sea. Five minutes later they    |
| noticed emerging from the surface three bright lights or forms that   |
| approached their position. One of the men grabbed a flashlight and    |
| pointed it towards the source of the lights. He was now able to see a |
| two-meter tall humanoid standing in water up to its knees. The        |
| creature appeared hairy and was apparently only seen by one of the    |
| men, who felt a mysterious attraction towards the creature and the    |
| lights. Frightened, he fled the scene along with the other man who    |
| had only seen the lights. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid        |

| 1981 - Two young men traveling on an isolated stretch of road near    |
| Port Lincoln, South Australia stopped their vehicle at 9:30 p.m.      |
| after one of them reported seeing what appeared to be a "flare" in    |
| the sky to his left, southeast towards Spencer Gulf. They stopped and |
| both saw a second light that moved around and flew up and down the    |
| hills and gullies, before stopping in one particular gully. They      |
| continued to watch for a while before setting off again. The two      |
| talked about what they had seen, and shortly one of them felt like    |
| stopping again. What happened next was a missing time and abduction   |
| experience that was hard for them to explain. He recalls "drifting    |
| off" into a white endless space. He knew he was there but he couldn't |
| move. A figure 1.2 meters tall walked up the road and stopped in      |
| front of him. It looked like it was wearing a toga like the Romans    |
| wore. It stood there for a while before vanishing. The other man woke |
| up and sat for a while before his friend asked, "What happened"? He   |
| recalled walking into a big white room and also had vague             |
| recollections of an entity, seen as an outline standing some 15       |
| meters away from the car. They had several hours of unaccounted for   |
| time. (Sources:  Keith Basterfield, UFO Research Australia, July      |

| 1982 - At 6:20 a.m. an unidentified object shaped like two globes     |
| connected by a nozzle with four tubes, buzzed a light aircraft being  |
| flown by a student pilot and a flight instructor southeast of Lowell, |
| Indiana. The two men reported that they felt heavy turbulence from    |
| the object, and their altimeter malfunctioned. The craft made complex |
| maneuvers for several minutes, and climbed at a speed of 6000 feet    |
| per second. (Sources: Mark Remaley, International UFO Reporter, May   |

| 1988 - An abduction by aliens with a physical exam occurred on this   |
| night in Adelaide, South Australia. A man awoke and became aware of a |
| a group of short humanoid beings at the foot of his bed. Three or     |
| four of them stood back, but one approached him. The being who        |
| approached was one meter in height, with a large head and big eyes,   |
| and appeared to be surrounded by what looked like a glowing white     |
| light. He suddently felt overwhelmed with fatigue, and passed out or  |
| fell back asleep. He awoke in a sterile type room, and was given a    |
| medical exam. The light in the room was so bright he could not see    |
| his surroundings. This was followed by a period of missing time, and  |
| he recovered consciousness back in his bed two hours later; his arm   |
| was paralyzed. (Sources: Keith Basterfield, citing Golden Age,        |

| 1988 - At 9:00 p.m. CDT in Skene, Mississippi a 20-year-old man was   |
| at home studying when he heard a low hum. He went outside to check on |
| the source of the noise, and he saw a 32 meter in diameter            |
| cone-shaped object with colored lights, flying over his home at only  |
| 150 feet altitude. He watched it move across sky until it went behind |
| some trees. (Sources: James A. Scarborough, MUFON field investigation |

| window. She looked out and saw a silent rectangular object hovering   |
| outside. It had a dull gray surface and was about 100 feet long,      |
| three feet high, and three to four feet deep. It had three white      |
| lights side-by-side at one end. Surprisingly, her dog and car wanted  |

| nautical miles south of Ord, Indiana from a commercial aircraft,      |
| CONNAIR flight 440, flying at 9,000 feet as it passed the plane. A    |

| turn. A faint hum was heard coming from the object. The encounter     |
| lasted 30 seconds. (Source: Barbara Thompson, MUFON field             |

| 1998 - At 8:30 p.m. a woman in Grand Mere, Quebec, Canada saw two     |
| entities that were wearing white astronaut outfits with helmets on    |
| their heads. One of the beings was leaned over and looked to be       |
| picking something up from the ground. The other stood nearby. When    |
| the beings walked they seemed to float just above the ground. Their   |
| size and appearance were similar to humans. About 75 feet behind them |
| there was a thick brown fog made up of different bright colors with a |
| bright glow about 27 feet in diameter. She watched them for five      |
| minutes before leaving the window. When she returned the entities had |
| gone and the strange fog was moving away. Investigators found ground  |
| traces and footprints. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact   |
