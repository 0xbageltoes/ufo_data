| 1949 - A 23-year-old man named Restier was driving home from Barra    |
| Mansa to Volta Redonda, Brazil at around 5:00 a.m. when he saw a      |
| 15-meter diameter disc land near the highway. Two beings came out,    |
| who looked human and were 1.65 meters tall but acted robotic in many  |
| ways. He claimed he went with them on an otherworld journey, during   |
| which he was put into a tub of liquid for the duration. After what    |
| seemed like three days he was returned, but the elapsed time had      |
| actually been four months (the return date was April 14th, 1950).     |

| 1952 - At 8:48 p.m. an F-51 pilot, Lt. Robert O. Arnold, flying out   |
| of the Laredo, Texas Air Force Base chased a glowing bluish-white     |
| object that made extremely tight turns. He had a near collision with  |
| the lighted object when it made a head-on pass at his plane. The UFO  |
| flew at extreme speeds, and there was a possible crash and subsequent |
| retrieval of the UFO. The incident lasted seven minutes. (Sources:    |

| 1954 - On this night a waiter saw a circular object in a pasture in   |
| Caselle di Nogara, Italy. It remained stationary for several minutes, |
| and was about 50 meters away. It was blue with symmetrical openings   |
| which emitted a bright red light. The witness got a rifle and fired   |
| twice at a very tall figure that emerged from the turret on the       |
| craft. Immediately, a very strong wind was felt and the craft took    |
| off amidst a reddish glow. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to       |

| 1954 - At six o'clock in the morning in the city of Coronel Pringles, |
| Argentina Sr. E. Aguirre Zavala, an employee of a commercial firm,    |
| observed a very bright disc come down to just 20 inches above the     |

| moved about a strange looking figure, which seemed to be a dwarf with |
| an enormous head. The UFO rose up shortly afterward after emitting a  |
| very bright light. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:     |

| 1966 - At the Gallipolis, Ohio airport in the middle of the afternoon |
| five pilots saw what at first appeared to be an airplane. Instead it  |
| was a flying humanoid. It was a winged figure about 300 feet up in    |
| the sky, and flying at 70 mph without flapping its wide wings. The    |
| creature had a long neck and was turning its head from side to side   |
| as it flew. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |

| 1970 - In the middle of the afternoon a lens-shaped cloud quickly     |
| encircled a private plane flying from the islands of Bimini to Andros |
| in the Bahamas. Inside the cloud was a glowing circular tunnel that   |
| extended vertically upward. Both of the passengers experienced a      |
| sensation of weightlessness during the experience. A green mist       |
| surrounded the plane when it finally broke free, and the plane had    |
| been moved much closer to Palm Beach, Florida. (Sources: Center for   |

| 1971 - At 10:30 p.m. an extremely bright, luminous disc hovered and   |
| spun over the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. It was seen  |
| by hundreds as it passed over the town at low altitude. (Source:      |

| 1972 - A pilot and his friend saw a white light hover over Waltham,   |
| Massachusetts, and then make rapid V-shaped descents and ascents.     |
| When it approached the witnesses, they were able to see that it was   |
| pancake shaped, covered with lights, and had a central dome on top.   |
| They also heard a humming sound. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:    |

| 1975 - On this evening a man was alone in his leather shop in Arizona |
| when two human looking beings entered. One was male and the other     |
| female. He had seen the male before. They were both nearly human in   |
| appearance, except they had yellow colored eyes, high cheeks, flat    |
| noses, and wide thin mouths. The man was also bald, and the woman     |
| appeared to be wearing a wig. While the man was over 6 feet tall, the |
| woman was somewhat shorter. Their skin seemed translucent it was so   |
| pale, and their fingers were exceptionally long, especially the       |
| middle one, but their legs were unusually short. Feeling strangely    |
| unable to resist them, he went with them into his back room and       |
| undressed. The woman went over his body with a small metallic device, |
| then undressed and had sexual intercourse with the witness, making    |
| animal sounds during the process. At one point he was told by the     |
| beings that they had lost the will to resist evil, so they needed to  |
| interbreed with humans. (Source: letter in CUFOS dated March 11,      |

| 1978 - On this night a woman named Isabel D. saw a brightly           |
| illuminated blue-greenish rail in her backyard in Mendoza, Argentina. |
| When she stepped on it she felt intense cold, but at the same time it |
| was like she was in an intense energetic state. She then saw two      |
| figures of milky white color. She fell into her swimming pool, and    |
| bruised her left ear, eye, and waist. When she recovered she found    |
| her left eye bruised and violet rectangular marks behind her left ear |
| and on her waist. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:     |

| 1979 - Lilli Karlsson, a young woman, was taking a walk about an hour |
| after midnight in the Brevik Hills of Vastervik, Sweden when she      |
| suddenly became paralyzed and unable to move. Nearby, she could see a |
| luminous object hovering close to the ground. Two five-foot tall thin |
| humanoids appeared from behind the object. She heard them talking in  |
| an unintelligible language, and she believed that they were           |
| discussing her. She also heard a voice that told her not to be        |
| afraid. One of the beings approached and stretched out its hand to    |
| her, but she remained paralyzed. They continued to talk between       |
| themselves as they walked back to their craft. A thin cloud of smoke  |
| came from under the object and enveloped the object, causing it to    |
| disappear. When the craft was gone the paralysis went away. (Sources: |

| 1988 - A man was stopped at a traffic light at 2:00 a.m. in Carmel,   |
| Indiana in suburban Indianapolis when he saw a silent bright light    |
| approach, zig-zag, move away, return, then go out of sight. The fuses |
| in his car were blown during the incident. (Source: MUFON UFO Field   |

| 1988 - At 5:25 a.m. in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania a 23-year-old         |
| corrections officer was driving, then saw a 75-foot diameter silvery  |
| oval disc with blinding white lights near some power lines. The       |
| object manuevered, hovered, and made a humming sound. The UFO emitted |
| a silvery white trail when it flew away, departing by shooting        |
| straight up into the sky. The officer saw another automobile nearby;  |
| inside was another witness who appeared terrified and disoriented,    |
| and a possible abductee. Potassium cloride dust was found on the      |
| cars, and the two witnessed experienced burns on their faces and      |
| blurred vision. (Sources: Leslie, Varnicle, MUFON UFO Journal, May    |

| 1990 -  In Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil a silent reddish orange ball   |
| of light three meters in diameter was watched by three men in a truck |
| at 7:30 p.m. It zig-zagged as it rose, then changed shape to an oval  |
| only one meter in diameter. (Sources: Bob Pratt, UFO Danger Zone:     |

| 1991 - After experiencing persistent trouble with his farm vehicle, a |
| 65-year-old farmer living in Bekes, Hungary was doing chores on the   |
| farm around noon when he heard noises coming from the pig sty. He     |
| went to check and suddenly felt a powerful odor and suffocating heat, |
| and he passed out. When he recovered 45 minutes later he was sitting  |
| inside in his work chair. He left the room and heard a buzzing sound  |
| in his head and then began seeing black rings in front of his eyes.   |
| The rings turned into a red sphere. He felt forced to follow it. He   |
| began doing odd chores around the house and as he did so everything   |
| felt lightheaded and every time he touched something he received an   |
| electric shock. The red sphere followed him where ever he went. At    |
| four p.m. he went back to feed the pigs and when he was finished he   |
| turned around and saw a human-shaped, greenish figure standing in     |
| front of a door. The figure was of normal height and bright green in  |
| color. The farmer walked back to his house, noticing that all the     |
| farm animals were acting agitated. He went to bed, but moments later  |
| the black rings and the red sphere returned. Later that night he went |
| back out into the yard and again came face to face with the greenish  |
| figure. After a few minutes the being rose into the air, leaving      |
| behind a V-shaped trail that became fog-like and disappeared. He      |
| heard a booming voice say, three times, "I will come back!" (Source:  |

| 1992 - In the suburbs of Winston Salem, North Carolina an adult       |
| watched a child walk to the school bus stop at 8:05 a.m. Beyond the   |
| woods and above some houses she saw a multi-colored domed disc-shaped |
| object, perhaps 16-20 feet in diameter, moving in the sky. It made a  |
| humming noise. It appeared to hide beyond the furthest house, then    |
| hover over the house, and approached to within 75 feet of the child.  |
| The indicent lasted about five minutes. (Source: MUFON field          |

| 1995 - A husband and wife in Manchester, England woke up late in the  |
| night to the sound of their young daughter crying hysterically. They  |
| tried to move but found themselves paralyzed. At that moment the      |
| bedroom curtains lit up brightly and there was a whooshing sound from |
| outside. The husband was eventually able to move and got up to look   |
| out the bedroom window. He saw a glowing object on the road,          |
| surrounded by a number of men wearing boiler suit coveralls who       |
| appeared to be digging up the garden. When they were both able to     |
| move they went to check on their daughter and found that she was      |
| alright. They then went back to sleep. The next morning there was no  |
| evidence of any digging having occurred in their garden. (Source:     |

| 2004 -  Orange flashes in the sky in Burlington, Indiana were         |
| followed by the appearance of several objects at 8:30 p.m. One object |
| that flew over the witness was triangular in shape with three red     |
| illuminated areas like tips. The outer points were brightest, fading  |
| into black at the center. The color was like a piece of red hot       |
| metal. (Source: UFO Magazine (USA), February 2005, p. 72, citing      |
