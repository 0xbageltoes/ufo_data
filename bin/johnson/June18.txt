| 1974 - At 3:30 p.m. on a sunny afternoon a strange metallic flying    |
| object flew around over the sea off the State of Santa Catarina,      |
| Brazil. It was at a distance of some thousand metres or so from the   |
| shore at Navegantes. After hovering for some six minutes above the    |
| sea, it veered at a 90 degree angle towards the beach and then        |
| dropped into the sea. Fisherman Avelino Severiano Generosa, age 46,   |
| his parents, his wife, and his nine children were all on the beach    |
| when they saw the silent, bright shiny object flying very low along   |
| the shore. It remaining stationary for six minutes, then it dropped   |
| into the sea. He at once put out in his motor-launch to the area, but |
| found only foam on the sea where the object had disappeared. There    |
| were twenty other people on the beach who also saw the object, but    |
| none of the others had the courage to go out in the boat to see what  |
| was happening. Days later Celso Lemkuni, a diver, tried to make a     |
| dive to locate the object, but had no success owing to the strong     |
| winds lashing the coast. (Source: Gordon Creighton, "Alleged          |

| 1979 - Sr. A. Ferreira was returning home from his job as a security  |
| guard in Mirassol, Sao Paolo State, Brazil at 3:00 a.m. when a        |
| metallic oval-shaped craft landed on three legs near his home. Three  |
| humanoids came out of the craft and paralyzed him with red beams of   |
| light, from boxes that they carried on their chests. These humanoid   |
| beings also carried boxes on their backs and had an insignia on their |
| chests. He was floated onboard the craft alongside and once inside he |
| believed he passed out. However, under hypnosis he remembered         |
| traveling to a larger craft where he found himself in a dark room     |
| with small lights and what looked like star maps. Ten to twelve       |
| humanoids were in the room with him. They were of two different       |
| types. Some had skin with a greenish tinge, with black smooth hair,   |
| thin lips, thin noses, pointed ears, and large eyes. The others were  |
| similar in appearance except that they had brown skin, kinky hair,    |
| dark eyes, and thick lips. All were between four and five feet tall   |
| and wore white uniforms and gloves. He was taken to another room and  |
| laid on a couch, a naked woman the entered the room. She was human    |
| like with black almond-shaped eyes, brown skin, a large head, red     |
| kinky hair, and very foul smelling breath. He resisted her sexual     |
| advances but was forcibly restrained. They spread an oily substance   |
| on his body, and forced him to have sexual intercourse with the       |
| female. The beings spoke in an unknown language among themselves but  |
| by telepathy with him. He was given the impression that they were     |
| conducting genetic experiments and were interested in reproduction.   |

| 1980 - A schoolgirl saw what looked like a big monkey-like creature   |
| shrink to something only a few inches tall outside her house in       |
| Lumut, Perak State, Malaysia at 7:00 a.m. She screamed and then       |
| fainted. At 10:30 a.m. that morning two more schoolgirls went to the  |
| local school and saw two minature figures less than 7 feet away from  |
| them. One was dressed in a white spacesuit, the other in black. They  |
| were very hairy and only about two inches tall. Both carried          |
| backpacks and some sort of weapons. Their feet did not touch the      |
| ground. That evening at around 8 p.m. two teachers and several        |
| students searched a field and saw three more of the tiny entities,    |
| dressed in white. They also found a U-shaped mark on the ground.      |

| 1982 - Five Chinese Air Force jet pilots flying over Heilongjiang     |
| Province, China at 9:57 p.m. encountered a huge odd looking aerial    |
| object.  for two hours. Their gyro-compass gave a wrong directional   |
| reading, 30 degrees on right, and they experienced radio jamming      |
| during their three hour encounter. The yellowish-green UFO            |
| was stationary at first, then climbed rapidly and increased speed. At |
| about the same time at the Bishui Forestry Center, also               |
| inHeilongjiang Province, China a beam shot up from behind a hill, 300 |
| meters away, that turned into a creamy-yellow spiral. At the top of   |
| this beam was a white disc, 30-40 cm in diameter, that was dazzling   |
| and revolved counter-clockwise. It made a buzzing sound, then shot up |
| straight up and away. (Sources: (1) Timothy Green, Above Top Secret,  |

| 1992 - In California a woman named Connie awoke to discover a scab in |
| her navel and a 2" x 6" bruise on her leg. During a later hypnosis    |
| session she recalled being on an exam table in an abduction           |
| experience during this night. Her abductors used telepathy to         |
| communicate with her. There was also a deer screen memory, in which   |
| she was led to believe at first that she was looking at deer, and not |
| humanoids. This has been commonly reported in other alien abduction   |
| experiences. (Source: Richard J. Boylan, Close Extraterrestrial       |

| didnot appear to be human in nature. No further details are given.    |
