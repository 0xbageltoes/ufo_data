| door. The observation lasted over three minutes, at which point the   |
| object released some smoke as it departed straight up. (Sources: Le   |

| 1959 - At 2:30 a.m. while driving along highway 559 in Wallingford,   |
| Kentucky a postman saw an elliptical shape hovering just over the     |
| ground. It rose vertically emitting a blast of flame, and then sped   |
| away horizontally. There was a 30 cm wide stained ring on the ground  |
| enclosing a 4-meter diameter circle. At 9:05 p.m. north of Lexington, |
| Kentucky five glowing ovoid objects dived and maneuvered toward the   |
| east and west, making extremely fast, sharp turns. (Sources: NICAP    |

| 1966 - A bright light zigzagged over the city of Beja, Portugal at    |
| midnight. At 8:00 p.m. Mrs. E. Bruns and her two children observed an |
| elongated object about 15 km east of Durand, Wisconsin. It was about  |
| 10 meters long with revolving lights and hovered one meter above      |
| theground, making a deafening noise. After 30 seconds it tilted at an |
| angle and took off. At 9:25 p.m. a UFO with red, blue and white       |
| lights bobbed, hovered, darted, and went away and came back several   |
| times over a 45 minute period in the city of Eau Claire, Wisconsin.   |
| It was observed by police and a newspaper reporter. At 11:25 a UFO    |
| the size of a house landed 1.5 miles away from the witness northwest  |
| of Vernal, Utah. It had a bluish-white light in the dome and          |
| pulsating red and yellow lights. (Sources: (1) Vicente-Juan Ballester |

| meeting a man wearing an "astronaut suit." He gave her a stone with a |
| high nickel content. At 10:45 p.m. a taxi cab driver four kilometers  |
| outside of Arriondas, Spain saw a phosphorescent tube-like object     |
| land nearly 30 meters away. It had a rectangular tube structure       |
| approximately 4.5 meters in width, and made a sound like a            |
| refrigerator. (Sources: (1) Roberto Banchs, Las evidencias del        |

| 1968 - A woman in Toronto, Ontario reported meeting a being wearing   |
| an "astronaut suit" who gave her a stone of a very high nickel        |
| content and a unique alloy composition. It was hinted that the        |
| extraterrestrial also had sex with the witness. (Source: Albert S.    |

| 1970 - After an argument with her mother in Sao Joa da Boa Vista, Sao |
| Paulo, Brazil 17-year-old Valeria was upset and drove away from her   |
| house with her brother. They parked the car in an isolated area at    |
| 7:30 p.m. to smoke cigarettes and relax. They soon heard a loud       |
| buzzing sound similar to those emitted by crickets. The sound rose in |
| intensity until it became unbearable. At that moment Valeria's mind   |
| seemed to go blank and she did not come to until 10:15 p.m. After the |
| incident Valeria suffered from strange dreams of lights.              |
|                                                                       |
| During a hypnotic regression session she remembered being in the car  |
| and hearing the loud humming sound. Moments later she found herself   |
| inside a room illuminated by an orange light. The room was very cold  |
| and she felt a tingling sensation on her hands. She was lying on top  |
| of a "bed" and she could not move her head. At first she could only   |
| see what appeared to be luminous spheres floating around her.         |
| Suddenly she felt someone holding down her hands. A figure then stood |
| in front of her. She described the figure as short, with a large      |
| hairless head and dark eyes. Soon a sort of cable with what appeared  |
| to be a needle on its tip was introduced into her nose. The needle    |
| emitted a greenish liquid. A small implant was also apparently        |
| inserted between her eyes. Moments later a small cut was made on one  |
| of her big toes, but she did not bleed or felt any pain. A voice in   |
| her head told her that she was being implanted in order to facilitate |
| future contacts. Soon one of the short humanoids approached her and   |
| took her on an "astral" journey. Both traveled through the solar      |
| system, around Saturn and the Sun and even inside the earth's         |
| interior. Soon awoke back in the car. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1971 - On this night at Colwyn Bay, Wales, United Kingdom an          |
| oval-shaped light, partially obscured by haze, was seen moving toward |
| the northwest over the Irish Sea. Two witnesses watched it for 20-30  |
| minutes. Several schoolboys also saw it. (Source: BUFORA Journal,     |

| 1972 - Two men, Gerard Petit and F. Tantot, in Taize, Saone-Loire     |
| department, France first sighted a phosphorescent green light in the  |
| sky just before midnight. As it came closer it became a disc-shaped   |
| platform three meters in diameter, with four lime green, solid        |
| looking luminous pylons or legs, giving the object the appearance of  |
| a stool. It hovered just 10 meters in the air. Mr. Tantot would go on |
| to have two more UFO sightings on 11 and 13 September 1972.           |

| 1972 - At 9:45 p.m. a bright ovoid shaped UFO followed a car with two |
| people home along Highway 203 near Beausejour, Manitoba. It paced the |
| car at a low altitude and flew quite close, and then hovered over     |
| their house, spinning. It left by shooting off toward the east.       |

| 1974 - At 11:30 p.m. in Hergies, Nord department, France a flashlight |
| stopped working when a farmer approached his cowshed. His dogs        |
| started howling, and the area became lit up, revealing a circular     |
| dark mass hovering 15 meters up in the air. A white beam of light     |
| came down to the ground, and the main witness felt an electric shock. |
| Three disc-shaped objects flew off to the east, making no sound. The  |
| flashlight functioned normally after the close encounter. There was a |
| total of six witnesses from three families and the incident lasted 15 |
| minutes. (Sources:Michel Figuet & Jean-Louis Ruchon, OVNI: Le Premier |
