|                                                                       |
| 1950 - On this day in 1950, several sightings of daylight discs occurred     |
| over the United States, Europe, and South America.                    |
|                                                                       |
| 1950 - At the Atlanta Municipal Airport, Georgia six airline pilots   |
| on the tarmac reported sighting an aluminum colored disc that flew    |
| silently toward the southwest at between 6000 and 7000 feet altitude. |
| It then made an "impossible climb." (Source: Michael Hitt, Georgia    |
| UFO Phenomenon, 1947-1987, p. 9).                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1950 - A large number of saucers, performing aerobatics, appeared     |
| over Farmington, New Mexico around noon, and then flew away at an     |
| estimated 1000 mph. A luminous, metallic appearing disc was sighted   |
| five miles northeast of Bradford, Illinois at 8:40 a.m. (Source:      |
| unnamed newspaper clippings, March 18 and 19, 1950).                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1950 - At a ranch in Lago Argentino, Argentina, Mr. Wilfredo H.       |
| Arevalo, a rancher, saw two objects, one of which landed at 6:30 p.m. |
| He walked within 150 meters of the aluminum looking craft that gave   |
| off a blue-green vapor with "an intense smell of burning benzene." A  |
| large, flat section on top was revolving above a glass cabin in which |
| could be seen four tall men with pallid faces, dressed in something   |
| like cellophane, working at various instruments. When they saw him    |
| they shone a light in his direction while a blue light illuminated    |
| the craft. The vapor increased and flames, alternately red and green, |
| shot out of the base while the object rose with a faint hum. Both     |
| craft flew away toward Chile, leaving bluish trails. (Sources: Coral  |

| 1963 - In 1963 a UFO was seen from Cape Canaveral, Florida as a Minuteman    |
| missile malfunctioned and veered off course. On that same night, at   |
| 8:30 p.m., the crew of a Greek ship, the "Hellenic Laurel", watched a |
| bright white fireball shoot to the east for one minute. It was        |
| described as the apparent size of the Moon, and it left a bright      |
| white contrail. (Sources: NICAP Investigator, March-April 1963, p. 4; |
| APRO Bulletin, September-October 1963, p. 6).                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1965 - At 7:00 p.m. on this day, while flying between Himeji and      |
| Matsuyama, Japan the crew of a Japanese airliner Convair 240 sighted  |
| three elongated objects and one circular UFO at the same time that    |
| the plane's automatic direction finder malfunctioned. The circular    |
| UFO was described as 15 meters in diameter. The UFOs were also        |
| sighted by a private pilot in a Piper Apache flying over Dishima      |
| Island. (Sources: Japan Times, March 21, 1965; Brad Steiger,          |
| Strangers from the Skies, p. 72; Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence,   |

| 1966 - One year later (1966), at 4:00 p.m., a shiny metallic cigar-shaped    |
| UFO, approximately 60 feet long, and completely smooth and            |
| featureless, was sighted off the coast, 10 miles north of Puerto      |
| Deseado, Argentina. The UFO emitted a gray vapor from its rear. It    |
| then vibrated; made a louder rumbling noise, and a black smoke        |
| emerged from the rear. The nose of the object tilted up as the object |
| flew erratically to the northeast, then hit the water and disappeared |
| beneath the surface. (Source: Phenomenes Spatiaux, March 1970, p.     |
| 17).                                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - In 1967 at 7:50 p.m. a domed oval or domed disc was seen surrounded   |
| by a ring of vapor in Stow, Massachusetts. The UFO glowed violet when |
| it was stationary, but changed to a reddish orange color when it      |
| danced around in the sky. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:           |
| Interplanetary Visitors, p. 346).                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - That same night in Lebanon, Ohio a 50-foot diameter, round object     |
| hovered over the treetops near a highway. It was glowing white,       |
| sometimes red, with a "halo effect" and appeared to be rotating. The  |
| headlights of a car passing nearby went out. The object emitted a     |
| high-pitched sound, and after its departure, the car's headlights     |
| functioned normally. (Sources: FSR, March-April 1971; Mark Rodeghier, |
| UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, case 193).                |
|                                                                       |
| 1969 - In 1969 a luminous, football-shaped flying object landed 3 meters     |
| from a stranded truck that was stuck in some mud, on a road between   |
| Ollague and San Martin, Chile. The driver and two passengers watched  |
| the UFO for ten minutes until it took off. (Source: CICA Botetin      |
| Informative, December 1969).                                          |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - The next close encounter occurred in 1972 over the mountains of Upper |
| Austria, at 11:35 p.m. Flying between Krems and Linz, Austria an      |
| Austrian DC-9 airliner had a near collision with a huge funnel of     |
| white light, which changed color to red. The aircraft's electronic    |
| instruments all went haywire during this close approach. (Source:     |
| Alexander Keul, APRO Bulletin, March 1972, p. 1).                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1975 - In 1975, four photographs of a sombrero-shaped UFO were taken by a    |
| 19-year-old student named McCarthy at a quarry off of highway 5 near  |
| Waterdown, Ontario, Canada shortly after 1:00 p.m. The UFO was        |
| described as being the size of a DC-8 airliner. The UFO had many      |
| unblinking lights, and flew from east to west, while maneuvering, at  |
| a low altitude. (Source: APRO Bulletin, October 1975, p. 1).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - In 1997 several men in cars from Canaan, New Hampshire chased a       |
| silent, elongated nocturnal light through three towns at 8:45 p.m.    |
| EST. At 8:30 p.m. MST a V formation of fast moving lights, most       |
| likely from a single, very large craft, were seen heading toward      |
| Prescott, Arizona. (Sources: Francis Ridge, UFO Info News; Michael    |
| Hall, UFOs: A Century of Sightings, p. 333).                          |

| 1978 - On the evening of this date an auto mechanic observing a UFO  |
| through binoculars in North Charleston, South Carolina was rendered   |
| unconscious and levitated by a tubular, aquamarine beam of light.     |
| Amnesia followed and he found himself alone in a field miles away     |
| from where he had encountered the disc-shaped UFO. Through hypnosis   |
| he recalled an abduction sequence by four-and-a-half-foot tall beings |
| with spongy white skin, big eyes and head, that wore rust colored     |
| jump suits. Among the features of the abduction included a physical   |
| exam on a table inside the UFO, being given messages and an artifact. |

| 1982 - Mr. J. Duty, an Army reservist, watched a domed disc-shaped UFO hover |
| off to the left side of a highway in Flatwoods, Kentucky around 10:40 |
| p.m. in 1982. The disc had red, green, blue, and white lights around  |
| its base, which blinked in rotation. It made a humming noise, circled |
| the witness's car, then flew away. (Source: George Parsons, field     |
| investigator, CUFOS investigation files; Richard Hall, MUFON UFO      |
| Journal, November 1982, p. 13).                                       |

| 1995 - In 1995 two bright white UFOs paced a car southwest of Falkirk,       |
| Scotland at 8:30 p.m. then zoomed away in opposite directions.        |
| (Source: UFO Newsclipping Service, May 1995).                         |

| 2003 - A married couple outside gardening in Buckhaven, Fife,        |
| Scotland at 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon saw a black, oval-shaped UFO   |
| 8-12 feet wide fly out from behind a rood only 100-130 feet away. The |
| lower part of the object was revolving, and it had a pinkish-red      |
| flashing light on it. The ends of the objects looked like manta-ray   |
| fins, and it floated oddly through the sky for four minutes. They     |
| claim to have taken photographs. (Source: Peter Davenport, National   |
