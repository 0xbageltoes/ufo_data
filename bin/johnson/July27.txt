| 1909 - At around ten o'clock in the morning a flying object shaped    |
| like a boat flew overhead toward the mountains in Lambourne, New      |
| Zealand. It dipped, swerved in the sky, and turned back. (Sources:    |

| 1948 - At 8:35 a.m. a University of New Mexico scientist in           |
| Albuquerque, New Mexico saw a flat metallic disc-shaped object that   |
| hung motionless in the sky for ten minutes. (Source: Jacques Vallee,  |

| 1949 - A cropduster in Puyallup, Washington named Sagmiller saw a     |
| disc pass overhead at 9:40 a.m. It reflected the sunlight             |
| brilliantly. (Source: Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 28, 1949).     |

| 1952 - At 12:15 a.m. seven "good, solid targets" appeared on radar at |
| National Airport near Washington, D.C. F-94 interceptors were sent    |
| from Deleware, but they made no visual contact as the UFOs were gone  |
| by the time they arrived. It was noted that there were only minor     |
| temperature inversions at the time, and these were not the likely     |
| cause of the radar blips. Five minutes later an F-94 pilot made vsual |
| contact with a round UFO. Both the UFO and the F-94 jet were seen on  |
| radar flying at the same speed. But when the jet tried to overtake    |
| the UFO it disappeared visually and on radar. "Incredible speed of    |
| the object," said the pilot. (Source: Richard Hall, Radar-Visual UFO  |

| 1952 - In Nevada at four o'clock in the morning highway worker Truman |
| Bethurum had finished working the night shift and decided to visit a  |
| nearby hilltop called Mormon Mesa because he heard it was a good      |
| place to look for seashell fossils. After he parked his truck he used |
| a flashlight to hunt for seashells, but he had no luck finding any,   |
| and after searching for an hour or so he returned to the truck and    |
| napped awhile. A “mumbling around the truck” awakened him. The        |
| mumbling came from eight to ten olive-skinned beings speaking an      |
| unintelligible language. All were about 4 feet 8 inches to 5 feet     |
| tall. They were not dwarfs but fully developed men. The strange men   |
| made no effort to disturb him, although Bethurum said he was afraid   |
| to attempt a getaway.                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| He was still in the truck cab when one man spoke to him in a foreign  |
| tongue. Bethurum shook his head, indicating he could not understand.  |
| Then the small man said: “You name it.” It was perfect English,       |
| recalled Bethurum, who answered: “My God, you can speak English,      |
| too?” “We have no trouble with any language,” replied the man.        |
| Bethurum then climbed out of the truck and stopped, awestruck. He saw |
| a flying saucer parked about 75 yards away from his truck. It looked  |
| like burnished stainless steel. Bethurum shook hands with all the     |
| “friendly” men and asked if their captain was around. The spokesman   |
| for the group volunteered to escort Bethurum to the captain, and led  |
| him toward the parked craft. Meanwhile, Bethurum looked around and    |
| saw that the short men were “Latin types,” with complexions           |
| “something like Italians.” All were neatly dressed in uniforms        |
| similar to those “worn by Greyhound bus drivers.” All had coal black  |
| hair and dark eyes. Their skin complexion was perfect and had no      |
| wrinkles or blemishes. The spokesman for the group took hold of       |
| Bethurum’s right elbow. While holding the arm the man seemed to “have |
| me in his power completely. He gave the impression of great           |
| strength.” Soon the group arrived at the ship. Bethurum described it  |
| as being metallic. He learned that it measured 300 feet in diameter   |
| and was “six yards deep in the center.” A three-foot metal rim with   |
| beveled edges surrounded the saucer-shaped craft, and the rim was     |
| about two feet thick. The ship had no rudder or stacks. They entered  |
| the ship through a large door that Bethurum estimated was 4 ½ feet    |
| wide and about 10 to 12 feet long. It was located atop the ship close |
| to the metal rim around the edge. Inside he met the woman captain,    |
| Aura Rhanes. He described her as having a “slender” Latin-type face.  |
| She wore a “radiant red skirt, black velvet short sleeved blouse and  |
| a black beret with red trim.” He went into her lounge and they        |
| talked. The woman captain said she was from the planet Clarion, which |
| could not be seen from earth. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, |

| 1952 - At 10:05 a.m. a procession of white saucer-shaped objects was  |
| sighted at Selfridge AFB, Michigan. They flew very fast and made no   |
| sound. Each passage of UFOs took 30 seconds. First two objects flew   |
| over, then one, then another, and then a last one. A Project Blue     |
| Book unidentified case. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in  |

| 1952 - At 7:30 p.m. a dark disc-shaped object moved slowly toward the |
| northeast with an "oscillating rolling motion" seen from Andrews AFB, |
| Maryland. Clouds at the time were moving toward the southeast, and    |
| the UFO entered the base of the clouds. (Sources: Richard Hall, The   |

| 1962 - One hundred eighty school students and their teachers in Villa |
| Tunuyuan, Mendoza province, Argentina saw three discs pass over their |
| school at 7:45 a.m. heading from the north to the south. The UFOs     |
| gave off a bluish light. The teachers said they also emitted blinding |
| silvery flashes. (Source: Gordon Creighton, Flying Saucer Review,     |

| 1964 - At 8:20 p.m. a witness named Borsa in Denver, Colorado sighted |
| a white fireball, estimated to be the size of a car, that climbed     |
| slowly in the sky then sped up. The sighting lasted 2-3 minutes.      |

| 1967 - An elongated oval-shaped UFO, carrying bright white lights     |
| fore and aft and a central red light, with a string of smaller white  |
| lights flashing in sequence along the side, was sighted by three      |
| amateur astronomers at 1:00 a.m. over Newton, New Hampshire. The UFO  |
| flashed in exact response to flashlight signals, and evaded a jet     |
| that flew over the area. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:            |

| 1967 - At around 1:00 a.m. a distress call came from a private pilot  |
| flying between Alexandria and Leesville, Louisiana that a UFO had     |
| approached the side and then the tail of his airplane, forcing the    |
| plane to crash. The pilot, badly injured, kept transmitting until he  |

| 1971 - The witness was at home in Valcourt, Quebec watching           |
| television at 8:30 p.m. when his attention was drawn to the sound of  |
| his cows bellowing in a nearby field. The witness and his wife went   |
| outside and saw the cows running from the field. They also saw a dark |
| spherical object hovering above the field, with a reddish light       |
| shining out of what appeared to be an open door in the object. Three  |
| small men who glowed a pale green color were moving around the        |
| object. They seem to glide just above the ground in rapid, darting    |
| movements. At times the beings seemed to pick something up from the   |
| ground. The little men went back inside the object, closing the door  |
| behind them. The UFO then rose slowly and disappeared over some       |
| nearby trees. The next day a circular spiral was found on the ground, |
| plus a silvery lump of unknown material that was later tested at      |
| Laval University. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact        |

| 1973 - In Lago D'Idro Brescia, Italy a 16-year-old boy found and      |
| photographed some strange traces he found in the area. He seemed to   |
| have experienced a period of missing time. Under hypnosis he recalled |
| being approached and touched by a human looking figure. He then       |
| became confused and felt he had been sucked up inside a hovering      |
| object from below. He found himself in a round room where four beings |
| stood. A woman entered the room and the beings began talking and      |
| touching the witness. He could not move the entire time. He was then  |
| sat in a chair next to a window, and watched as the object descended  |
| and landed. He was then released. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |

| 1978 - Three people driving in Sheffield Village, Ohio observed a     |
| silver, banana-shaped object with red and blue flashing lights at     |
| 10:45 p.m. The engine and headlights of their car went out as the     |
| object came close to the ground about 600 feet away. It made a        |
| wavering, humming sound and moved up and down near the ground for     |
| about 15 minutes, then flew away. The car could not be restarted for  |
| an hour and a half after the sighting. (Sources: Mark Rodeghier, UFO  |

| 1984 - At 3:45 a.m. a spark-tailed fireball splashed down 1000 yards  |
| south of Lummi Island in Washington State. The impact sent a plume of |
| water 100 feet into the air before the object sank and the water as   |
| the surface of the sea rolled and bubbled. (Source: Doris Graziano,   |

| 1993 - At 9:00 p.m. a dozen witnesses at Calabona Beach, Sardinia,    |
| Italy sighted a strange object resembling a "balloon" flying over the |
| beach. At first it resembled a round black object that hovered, then  |
| it changed to an oblong, irregular shape. The witnesses ran closer    |
| and saw the object enlarging as it flew away from the area. It now    |
| looked like a helicopter with a red pulsating light. (Source: Italian |

| 1994 - A young boy ran into his mother's bedroom at 4:00 a.m. in      |
| Surrey, British Columbia, Canada and reported seeing a large object   |
| with blue lights hovering under the electrical wires outside his      |
| bedroom window. He also saw "little people on the poles." He was told |
| by his mother to go back to bed and sleep. (Source: Albert S.         |

| 2001 - On this night several witnesses at different locations in      |
| Acquappesa, Italy reported seeing a dog rise up into the air from     |
| near the ocean and enter a hovering, lighted spherical object. The    |
| object had a large lighted window and a tall man-like figure could be |
| seen looking out. It then flew away. The dog was apparently taken.    |

| 2004 - A truck driver driving south on Interstate 25 in New Mexico    |
| reported the night sky was pitch black with no moon nor even cloud    |
| cover visible. At 1:30 a.m., driving at 63 mph, he noticed a bright   |
| blue light about a half-mile ahead on the exit ramp for south-bound   |
| Exit 138. It appeared to be like a blue laser, similar to the light   |
| some people use on the hoods of their cars. When he got closer to the |
| ramp he saw two figures approximately 3-4 feet tall. Each was either  |
| holding a blue light, or was wearing a blue head lamp. He couldn't    |
| tell for sure. The figures appeared to be looking to the north and    |
| south, and they looked at his truck as he drove by. They appeared to  |
| be wearing loose-fitting bright silver outfits, similar to HAZMAT     |
| suits. He couldn't tell if they were wearing helmets. The terrain was |
| very flat and he did not see any vehicles in the area. He was sure    |
| that he would have seen any vehicle that they could have come from.   |
| He slowed to turn around but the nearest exit was another 30 miles    |
| down the highway so he decided not to go back. (Source: Peter         |

| 2004 - While driving home from a dinner party at two o'clock in the   |
| morning a married couple in Asland, Massachusetts observed a round    |
| silver disc-shaped object about 30 feet in diameter that had landed   |
| in an open field off of Chestnut Street. They both got out of their   |
| car and approached the disc and when they got close enough they both  |
| touched the craft. It was very cold to the touch and it was glowing   |
| red to blue. They were able to see inside the craft through a small   |
| window and saw three small beings. All appeared to be sleeping or     |
| meditating, they did not respond to the witnesses voices. As the      |
| couple began to walk around the craft it began to rise up into the    |
| air and eventually flew off without making any sound at all. (Source: |
