| 1897 - On this evening a mystery airship flew over Winnipeg,          |
| Manitoba, Canada. It followed the river to the east, then made a      |
| sharp turn over a hospital. Also on the same night a well-lighted     |
| flying object with a clear outline flew over Shiloh, Ohio and was     |
| reported by a Mr. Chamberlain. It was supported by a narrow, 70 foot  |
| long cylindrical vessel that looked to be inflated. (Sources: (1)     |

| 1952 - At 5:32 a.m. two men who worked for the Atomic Energy          |
| Commission, Eggan and Shipley, sighted a silver, wingless object at   |
| Moses Lake, Washington for 90 seconds. (Sources: Project Blue Book    |

| 1952 - At 10:50 a.m. several Air Force officers and enlisted men at   |
| George AFB in San Bernardino County, California watched five flat,    |
| white discs make a sudden 90 degree turn, then disappear. The         |
| sighting lasted half a minute. (Sources: Project Blue Book files      |

| 1957 - On or about this day a motorcyclist was traveling down a road  |
| near the Pajas Blancas Airport in Cordoba province, Argentina shortly |
| after 7 a.m. when his motorcycle stalled. The driver then saw a       |
| disc-shaped object 20 meters in diameter, hovering 15 meters above    |
| the ground. An elevator descended from the base, and a human-like     |
| being of average height, around five foot eight inches tall, was seen |
| in the elevator. The witness was offered the choice of whether he     |
| wanted to enter the craft or not, and he decided to go inside the     |
| craft. Inside there were another five or six men dressed in something |
| similar to diving suits working some instrument panels. He was taken  |
| for a 30 minute ride. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia:  |

| green and white lights flew over the Watertown Arsenal in Middlesex   |
| County, Massachusetts at 10:00 p.m. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, case  |

| 1967 - At 10 p.m. nine witnesses in Simoca, Tucuman province,         |
| Argentina, returning from a hunting expedition, were riding on a      |
| trailer being pulled by a tractor when they observed a very bright    |
| object in the sky that they first thought was the moon. The object    |
| emitted an intense orange-reddish light and approached rapidly at     |
| high speed. It briefly moved away, but returned when one of the men   |
| signaled at it with a flashlight. It then hovered over the tractor,   |
| swinging back and forth like a pendulum. It was a domed disc, shaped  |
| like to plates put together with a crystal-like dome on top. Around   |
| its edge they could see several square window-like openings, from     |
| which a bluish light emanated. They also saw the figure of a man come |
| out of one of the windows, who then moved up to the dome and then     |
| climbed back down to the window and entered. Finally the UFO moved    |
| away, gaining altitude and disappearing at high speed. (Source:       |

| 1971 - Motion picture film was shot of a blazing saucer-shaped object |
| over Mar del Plata, Argentina between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. Many         |
| witnesses of this seaside city watched as the object hovered for      |
| several minutes, maneuvered in the sky, and then arched away to the   |
| west. The photographer's name was Lenzi. (Sources: Phenomenes         |

| 1974 - Samuel Faria, age 27, was returning home from the center of    |
| Vila Velha, Espirito Santo, Brazil at 11:30 p.m. when he saw on the   |
| street corner a little manno more than a meter tall, clad in clothing |
| like an "astronaut." Faria approached to within 30 feet of him,       |
| whereupon the little man pointed a flashlight kind of instrument at   |
| him and him in the eyes with a beam of light, temporarily blinding    |
| him. Sr. Faria ran for his uncle's house, only 20 meters away, and    |
| succeeded in reaching it. The little man wore no helmet, and had      |
| muscular arms. In February 1973 Faria had seen a luminous, ring       |
| shaped UFO hovering low over his uncle's garden, and on March 11 of   |
| that same year had been seized by a creature while returning from the |
| bathhouse in the garden, and encounter that left claw markson his     |
| upper arms. These marks remained for eight months. (Source: David F.  |

| 1975 - A bright yellow-orange ball of light was seen at low altitude  |
| over the village of Lezay, Deux Sevres, France at 11:10 p.m. It       |
| hovered 3-4 meters from the ground and made a flapping sound. It was  |
| estimated to be 3.1 meters in diameter, and played cat-and-mouse with |
| the police through the trees for 35 minutes. It's possible that the   |
| object made a brief landing. (Sources: Michel Figuet & Jean-Louis     |

| 1979 - At around 4:00 a.m. some goats in Las Vizcacheras, Mendoza,    |
| Argentina fled their pen in panic. The noise from the goats woke the  |
| three witnesses, a group of petroleum engineers and technicians. A    |
| rectangular UFO was then seen hovering 20 meters above the ground,    |
| just 70 meters from the witnesses. It gave off colored streams of     |
| light as it took off. There was a circle found at the landing site of |
| hardened ground. (Sources: UNICAT database, case 602, citing Victorio |

| 1981 - A 26-year-old woman reported a large white glowing disc-shaped |
| object just 150 feet from her home in Clark County, Washington at     |
| around 4:00 a.m. It made a humming sound and flew off to the south    |
| toward Oregon. The incident lasted slightly less than a minute.       |

| 1988 - Ed Walters reported another abduction experience that began at |
| 1:20 a.m. in Gulf Breeze, Florida. He found himself walking along a   |
| dirt path in a dark wooded area near his hom. He soon saw a hovering  |
| lighted object overhead and attempted to photograph it, but was soon  |
| surrounded by several figures that grabbed him from behind. The       |
| beings seemed to move in short bursts of speed. He remembers falling  |
| down and then being surrounded by at least 20 of the creatures. Each  |
| one was equipped with a silver rod and covered in a box like suit. He |
| was then unable to move. They picked him up and carried him, and it   |
| was then that he noticed that their hands felt rough. He experienced  |
| a burning pain that twisted down his spinal cord like an electrical   |
| shock, and he was able to move again. The creatures then scattered    |
| about him. He felt a voice in his head that constantly talked to him, |
| calling him by the name of "Zehaas." He rolled on the sand and tried  |
| to grab the nearest being but missed. He then rushed the creatures,   |
| who had now formed a circle around him. One of the creatures rushed   |
| forward and touched him on the shoulder with one of the silver rods,  |
| causing a white flash. He was then hit repeatedly with the silver     |
| rods, at times causing pain. He continued to struggle and fell        |
| backwards on top of one of the creatures. He noticed at this point    |
| that the creature wore a helmet. The being began to struggle and a    |
| sour smell, like mildew filled Walters nostrils. Finally the struggle |
| ended when Walters became unconscious. Upon recovering consciousness  |
| he found himself in a hazy pie-shaped hazy room, where he presumes he |
| was given a medical examination. The missing time experience lasted   |
| 75 minutes. (Sources: Ed Walters, UFO Abductions in Gulf Breeze;      |

| 1989 - At 2:30 a.m., in Metcalf, Illinois the mother of the principal |
| witness had gotten up to go to the bathroom when she noticed that the |
| electricity was off. She then saw a strange being with large eyes     |
| peering at her through the window and screamed. At this point her     |
| adult son, a repeat UFO abductee, got up and fired a gun four times   |
| at the being through the window. Four other tall humanoids with       |
| dangling arms were observed standing near a power pole. The           |
| electrical power came back on. (Source: Francis L. Ridge, Regional    |

| 1989 - At 5:00 a.m a woman in Hollywood, California was on her way to |
| work when she experienced a long period of missing time. Later she    |
| was able to recall that she had been taken onboard a craft and had    |
| been greeted by a man in a blue coverall. She was then taken to a     |
| room with a large screen. She could see outside the object through    |
| the screen. She was told they were going to visit a planet called     |
| “Erra.” She was then taken to a place with numerous forests and       |
| trails and very rich in oxygen. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |

| 1992 - Two men, Lycett and Hazelgrove, were driving down the A22      |
| Highway in Polegate, East Sussex, England at 10:20 p.m. when they     |
| sighted a silent flying object with red flashing lights. They thought |
| its outline looked like a DC-9 airplane about to crash, but the nose  |
| of the object pulled up and turned toward the witnesses' car, who     |
| then thought it was going to crash into them. They sped up, and when  |
| they looked behind the object was gone. (Source: Timothy Good, Alien  |
| Update, p. 266; UFO Newsclipping Service, July 1992, citing the       |

| 2001 - A bizarre hairy creature was sighted in the village of Anand   |
| Vihar, India on this night. Hundreds of villagers armed with farm     |
| tools as weapons searched for hours in an attempt to hunt it down and |
| kill it, but the search failed to find anything. On the same night    |
| three workers claimed they were woken up and attacked by a"masked     |
| man", who reportedly threatened to kill them in the Bhojpuri          |
| language. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2001 Humanoid Contact Database, |

| 2003 - A married couple driving in West Seattle, Washington sighted a |
| silent triangular object moving across the sky at 10:00 p.m. It had a |
| dim orange light at each apex, and the lights seemed striped rather   |
| than solid. It flew off to the northwest. When they got home they     |
| noticed that their dog was trembling, and acting very lethargic.      |
