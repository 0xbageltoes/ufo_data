| 1909 - At 1:15 a.m. several witnesses on the docks in Cardiff, Wales  |
| observed a cigar-shaped airship that curved up and down the coast,    |
| making a whirring sound. It was described at fast, with two lights.   |

| cigar with a quivering light make a 90 degree turn to the             |
| north.(Source: Carl Grove, FSR, November 1970, pp. 18, 21).           |

| 1963 - A 17-year-old teen named Bushbridge encountered an ovoid       |
| object by the side of road as he was driving near Mount Gambier,      |
| South Australia. When he got to within six meters of it a bright      |
| light dazzled him. The five-meter long object rose vertically, then   |
| moved across the road over his car, making a roaring noise. (Sources: |

| 1967 - In Grove City, Ohio between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. EDT four men,   |
| including the main witness named Schmidhammer, saw a cigar-shaped     |
| object for 20 minutes that maneuvered in the sky and descended to     |
| within 150 feet of the ground. It then made a 90-degree turn and flew |
| off to the west. The object made an odd noise "that made your ears    |
| ring." (Sources: Grove City Record, May 25, 1967; NICAP files).       |

| 1969 - At 3:10 a.m. a bright glowing ovoid object chased a car down a |
| road southeast of St. John, New Brunswick, Canada. The car's radio    |
| and lights were effected by the UFO during the pursuit. The UFO flew  |
| off to the south over some woods, according to the report filed with  |
| the RCMP. (Source: Don Ledger, Maritime UFO Files, p. 70).            |

| 1969 - On this evening at 7:30 p.m. two women, Dona Aurora and Clair  |
| Mefessoli, were walking to a neighbor's house in Fernandes, Santa     |
| Catarina, Brazil to borrow some milk when they saw an elongated       |
| yellowish luminous object descend behind them, not quite touching the |
| ground. Two little three-foot tall beings, with features like humans, |
| got out of the UFO. The terrified women fled the scene. (Source:      |

| 1969 - Two hours later, at 7:30 p.m. CDT in Rising Sun, Indiana       |
| George Kaiser noticed a strange figure 25 feet away. The being was    |
| the size of a man and covered with black fur. The head sat directly   |
| on its shoulders and the face was black, with close-set eyes and a    |
| very low forehead. When Kaiser made a move to get into his car, the   |
| creature grunted, jumped over a ditch, and ran down the road at high  |
| speed. Footprints were found that showed only four toes. On the       |
| following night a UFO was observed over the same area by neighbors.   |

| 1974 - At 9:00 p.m. a mother, daughter and son watched a bright       |
| object in the sky that was a quarter of a mile away from them in      |
| Hillsborough, New Hampshire. It hovered for awhile, then moved into a |
| nearby forest. No evidence of a landing was found. Three hours later  |
| and 38 miles to the southwest an occupant report and UFO landing was  |
| made at Hampton Beach, New Hampshire. (Source: David F. Webb,         |

| 1978 - Cars stopped on US highway 29 in Greenville, South Carolina to |
| watch a huge, silver colored cigar hovering in the sky around 4 p.m.  |
| It caused a two mile long traffic backup, and there were over 75      |
| witnesses to the event, which lasted over two hours. (Sources: D. N.  |

| 1979 - In Bukit Mertajam on the island of Pinang, Malaysia six school |
| children reported sighting a landed object and four tiny humanoid     |
| figures near it in the middle of the afternoon. The creatures were    |
| only about 4 inches tall. One of the students attempted to catch one  |
| of the creatures but was shot in the hand. The creature then shot at  |
| a brick, breaking it into pieces. Afterwards the creatures ran back   |
| into their tiny craft. Another student reportedly grabbed the small   |
| object and was shocked by an electric current. The object then took   |
| off, and an adult witness watched the object taking off. (Source:     |

| 1984 - In rural Williams, Indiana at 11:50 p.m. the witness was       |
| working on equipment outside behind his house on a warm, clear        |
| Saturday night. His wife was sleeping inside, and two of this         |
| neighbors had just left after stopping by to visit him. Suddenly,     |
| everything around him became brightly lit, and the witness felt a     |
| tingling sensation. He looked up to see that the light source was a   |
| brilliant orange light, low in the northwest sky. It was totally      |
| silent and he could only see the light, no craft could be seen. He    |
| went inside to call his two neighbors to come back and see the        |
| strange light, but he did not wake his wife who is a sound sleeper.   |
| He went back outside and the UFO was there as before. After 10-15     |
| minutes had passed, the object began to drift away to the northwest   |
| where he lost sight of it. Shortly after this his neighbors arrived.  |
| They had not seen the UFO and teased him and seeing things. The       |
| object was reportedly 400-500 feet away. (Source: Francis L. Ridge,   |

|                                                                       |
| 1986 - Starting at 9:10 p.m. multiple radar-visual trackings by       |
| civilian and military pilots occurred in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao     |
| Paulo, Brazil and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For nearly three hours, air |
| traffic control and military radar tracked up to 21 unidentified      |
| objects, and jet interceptors pursued them, making visual contact in  |
| some cases. The night was clear with good visibility. The objects     |
| appeared to be red-orange balls of light (BOL), but changed           |
| frequently to white or green. Col. Ospires Silva, oil company         |
| president and former president of EMBRAER Airlines, with his pilot,   |
| Commander Alcir Pereira da Silva, was descending through 2,000 feet   |
| (600 meters) on their landing approach to Sao Jose de Campos, near    |
| Sao Paulo, at 9:10 p.m. Sao Paulo radar notified them that an unknown |
| object was in the area, so they broke off the pattern and turned to   |
| follow a bright red-orange light that seemed to dance around in the   |
| sky. Meanwhile, radar at Brasilia confirmed the presence of an        |
| unknown ojbect. As they pursued the object in the twin-engine Xingu   |
| aircraft, the light blinked off every 10-15 seconds, only to reappear |
| in a new location, as if jumping from point to point. Their low       |
| performance airplane could not gain on the object, which they         |
| estimated was traveling at 1,500 km/hour (900 mph), so they abandoned |
| the chase after about 30 minutes.                                     |
|                                                                       |
| By that time the Brazilian Defense Center, which operates an          |
| integrated civil-military radar ATC system, was on full alert due to  |
| numberous UFOs cluttering their radar screens in the vicinity of Sao  |
| Jose dos Campos and nearby Sao Paulo. All civilian air traffic was    |
| put on hold, as jet interceptors were scrambled from Santa Cruz AFB,  |
| Sao Paulo State, and Anapolis AFB, near Brasilia. Three F-5E jets     |
| were scrambled from Santa Cruz AFB, followed by three Mirage III jets |
| from Anapolis AFB. The first visual contact was made about 10:550     |
| p.m. Lt. Kleber Caldas Marinho, age 25, an F-5E pilot, was vectored   |
| toward a target indicated by radar to be 35 miles (56 km) distant,    |
| but he was unable to catch up. At one point ground radar showed the   |
| UFO rapidly approaching his jet, but he saw nothing at that time.     |
| Later, he did see a very intense reddish light that changed color to  |
| white, then to green, then to red again. Another F-5E pilot, Capt.    |
| Marcio Jordao, age 29, managed to close in to within 12 miles and saw |
| a very strong, intensely bright light, continuously changing color    |
| from white to green. When the object moved off shore and out to sea   |
| he broke off contact and returned to base.                            |
|                                                                       |
| Ten to thirteen white and green UFOs (BOLs) were chased by the three  |
| Mirage III fighters. Only one of the jets was able to make visual     |
| contact. The jets closed to within two miles, then the UFOs outflew   |
| the jets and climbed vertically up to 33,000 feet. The radar          |
| controller at Anapolis AFB testified that there were several targets  |
| behind one of the Mirage jets, six to one side and seven to the       |
| other. Radar had tracked the UFOs at speeds of up to 800 knots (920   |
| mph). At time the objects made 80 degree turns. "No plane I know can  |
| make turns like that at 1,000 km/h," Capt. Viriato de Freitas said.   |
| The unexplained nature of the UFOs was openly acknowledged by the     |
| authorities. The decision to release the news to the public was made  |
| personally by the president of Brazil, and carried out by the Air     |
| Force Minister, Brig. Gen. Octavio Moreira Lima. (Sources: Richard H. |

| 10:30 p.m. when she noticed a strong glare of light streaming through |
| the kitchen window. She stepped out onto the back porch and noticed a |
| disc-shaped object hovering over her house. As the started walking    |
| back into the house to call additional witnesses, she was confronted  |
| by a strange humanoid being with huge round eyes. She apparently      |
| suffered a loss of consciousness and does not know what happened for  |
| two hours. She vaguely recalls being in some type of an otherworldly  |
| environment. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1996 Humanoid Sighting       |

| 1997 - At 12:15 a.m. local UFO investigator John Tosti and two other  |
| men in Bloomington, Indiana saw several bright objects hovering over  |
| a local power plant. Mr. Tosti decided to drive to Snoddy Road at an  |
| isolated location to signal to the objects with a flashlight. Two of  |
| the UFOs descended to his location. When one object approached his    |
| vehicle, the engine and electrical system sputtered. Tosti was able   |
| to discern a metallic, disc-shaped object, with a small round dome    |
| and an even smaller dome on top. A blue glow emanated from the bottom |
| of the craft. Around the middle of the object was a row of square     |
| windows, showing a yellow to amber colored light within. Inside the   |
| craft he could see the silhouettes of several individuals with large  |
| heads. He attempted to communicate with them by waving his arms, but  |
| he was apparently ignored. Two smaller bright spherical objects       |
| emerged from the disc, which then shot up at very high speed, joining |
| the other objects in the sky. After a short while, the UFOs left the  |
| area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1997 Humanoid Sighting Reports      |

| as it was moving at a very high speed," reported the witness. It was  |
| an elongated oval, looking somewhat like a missile. The sighting      |
| lasted from 2-3 minutes. (Source: George A. Filer & David E.          |

| 2003 - Following a series of early UFO sightings on May 17, at 9:50   |
| p.m. on this evening a bright shining nocturnal light was observed by |
| local residents in Simferopol', Crimea, Ukraine. The UFO looked like  |
| a white star, as bright as Sirius. It was moving 2-3 times faster     |
| than a satellite. Mr. Viktor Zdorov, while waking his dog, saw a      |
| satellite passing near the UFO in the very same part of the sky. The  |
| satellite was dimmer and moving much slower. (Source:George A. Filer  |
