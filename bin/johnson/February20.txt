| 1948 - Six surveyors working in Emmett, Idaho saw a small flat,       |
| heart-shaped UFO flying in the sky at 1:15 p.m. It was fuzzy across   |
| its back edge as if "dipped in cream", and was flying point first     |
| below the cloud level at between 2,000 and 4,000 feet. (Sources:      |

| 1959 - Wave of fireballs were seen flying over Oklahoma City,         |
| Oklahoma starting at 7:30 p.m. One made a 180 degree turn. A compass  |
| was reported to have begun spinning during the sightings. (Source:    |

| 1967 - At 3:10 a.m. an orange-red dome-shaped object descended from   |
| the sky in Oxford, Wisconsin and flew parallel to a truck for two     |
| minutes, finally going behind some trees. The truck was driven by a   |
| US Air Force veteran. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in    |

| 1969 - Near Norseman, Western Australia a luminous cigar-shaped       |
| object was seen following a car at 7:30 p.m. When the UFO first       |
| appeared, the car's engine began to stop but then ran normally. The   |
| object paced the car for some distance quite low to the ground. It    |
| then rose quickly into the sky, raising a cloud of dust and dead      |
| leafs from the ground under the point where it began its departure.   |

| 1969 - On this night in Pirassununga, Sao Paulo, Brazil the manager   |
| of the Bela Alianca Fazenda or ranch heard his pigs grunting and went |
| outside to investigate. He saw a UFO land about 60 feet away. The     |
| object was 12 feet wide and 15 feet high, and it rested on tripod     |
| landing gear. Three crew members emerged onto a small catwalk around  |
| the machine. Each carried a different kind of tool with which they    |
| busied themselves, apparently repairing the craft, for a period of    |
| two to three minutes. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,        |

| 1973 - At 8:00 p.m. a glowing sphere followed a car near              |
| Draytonville, South Carolina for some distance. The car radio went    |
| dead while the sphere was nearby, then functioned normally after the  |
| two witnesses lost sight of the object. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO  |
| Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, case 330, citing UFO Register |

| 1976 - At 7:00 p.m. a young man and woman saw some odd red lights in  |
| the sky in Essex County, Massachusetts. Then two flattened            |
| disc-shaped objects with three triangular lights descended close to   |
| their car and maneuvered nearby for about 10 minutes. The car's radio |
| had heavy static during a portion of the sighting. The two objects    |
| finally flew out of view. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports        |

| 1977 - On this night in Gallarta, Vizcaya province, Spain a local     |
| farmer, Sr. Juan Sillero, was awakened by the sound of his dogs       |
| barking and by a loud humming sound. When he went outside he saw a    |
| hovering metallic object with numerous lights and what appeared to be |
| three-legged landing gear dangling down. The craft had a              |
| semi-transparent dome on top and was surrounded by rectangular        |
| windows. Behind the windows several moving figures moved slowly back  |
| and forth. At one point he was approached by two tall, human-looking  |
| beings wearing dark diver suit, who explained to the witness that     |
| they had to leave the area since they had been "detected." On another |
| occasion the witness saw a robot-like creature exploring the area     |
| after it came out of a landed craft. There were other independent     |
| witnesses of UFOs descending over the area. The witness saw a craft   |
| land in the same area a week later. Landing traces were found at the  |
| site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1977,     |

| 1997 - Local farmer Heliodoro Nunez was tending his sheep at around   |
| four o'clock in the afternoon in an isolated pasture near Paradeseca, |
| Orense, Spain when his dog began barking. Looking back, he saw three  |
| ten-foot-tall entities wearing strange conical helmets. The beings    |
| appeared shiny and seemed to change colors at all times. When he saw  |
| them he closed his eyes and began to pray fervently, and he did not   |
| see the entities depart. Others saw strange red lights over the       |
| pasture. (Sources: Joseph Trainor, UFO Roundup, Volume 2, Number 18;  |

| 1999 - Several people in a car in Alicante, Spain have their cellular |
| mobile phones and the car's electrical system die when they heard a   |
| humming sound and witnessed a huge delta-shaped UFO 30 meters         |
| overhead. (Source: Joseph Trainor, UFO Roundup, Volume 4 (March 8,    |
