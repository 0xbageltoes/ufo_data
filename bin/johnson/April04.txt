| 1949 - William Parrott, former Air Force pilot and Major, sighted a   |
| round object with a curved bottom and dull coloring at 10:20 p.m. in  |
| Merced, California. The object gave off a clicking sound until        |
| overhead. Parrott's dog reacted by barking and running around while   |
| the UFO was in sight, about 35 seconds. (Source: Don Berliner,        |

| 1952 - At 7:30 p.m. two radar operators of the 147th AC&W Squadron in |
| Duncanville, Texas tracked a UFO for one minute by radar moving at an |
| estimated speed of 2,160 mph. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook |

| 1956 - At 3:15 p.m. retired US Army Captain Roy Hall, Charles         |
| Anderson and others in McKinney, Texas observed through telescopes a  |
| stationary oblong object. One telescope was a 6" diameter model and   |
| the other was a 55-200x telescope. The fat, oblong object had two     |
| lines around its middle. It remained stationary for six hours.        |

| 1965 - Keesler AFB, Mississippi. At 4:05 a.m. USAF Airman Corum, a    |
| weather observer, sighted a 40 foot long back, oval-shaped object     |
| with four lights along the bottom (see sketch below). It flew in and  |
| out of a cloud bank for 15 seconds. It had four protruding lights     |
| evenly spaced on the bottom, and looked dark against the clouds. A    |
| college student named R. Pittman also sighted the object. (Sources:   |

| 1965 - On the same day at 10:15 a.m. in Valley Falls, New York a      |
| white egg-shaped or rectangular object (see sketch below) was         |
| observed directly in front of two jet fighters. The UFO ascended      |
| rapidly to avoid collision and moved rapidly away in the opposite     |
| direction. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors, |

| 1966 - A famous UFO close encounter case involving the bending of a   |
| car's headlights occurred on this night in Bourke's Flat, Victoria,   |
| Australia on the road between Bendigo and Saint Arnaud. Mr. R.        |
| Sullivan, age 38, was driving home when he encountered a heavy mist   |
| and a shining white, oval-shaped UFO that appeared above him with a   |
| cone of light descending from beneath it. Rainbow colored rays of     |
| light ran down the sides of the cone. His car's headlight beams were  |
| bent toward the object "as if they were pieces of pipe." Mr. Sullivan |
| overcompensated in his driving and nearly crashed, but was able to    |
| stop the car. He then saw brilliant lights flashing in a field,       |
| followed by the abrupt departure of the UFO. The car headlights were  |
| OK after the incident. (Sources: Victorian UFO Research Society,      |

| 1966 - Two UFOs were seen over the Trenton, Ontario airport on this   |
| night, and one landed on runway 113. It was about 20 feet in          |
| diameter. Two small men were seen near it. When the service police    |
| approached, the beings got back in the craft and it took off.         |

| 1977 - Tucson, Arizona - A 52-year-old woman was watching jackrabbits  |
| by moonlight on the Veterans Administration Hospital grounds at 1:30  |
| a.m. when she heard a whirring noise and looked up to see a luminous  |
| white UFO coming down for a landing. It was ellipsoidal in shape with |
| fuzzy contours, and landed approximately 30 to 40 feet away. The top  |
| of the object was a soft luminous pink, and something like a          |
| horizontal periscope or boom protruded form the right side. The       |
| object was about 40 to 50 feet in diameter and about 20 feet high.    |
| The whirring ceased when it landed, but she saw no landing gear. Then |
| a human like figure, well over six-foot tall with very broad          |
| shoulders, walked toward her from the UFO. She had not seen him       |
| emerge through a door in the craft. He wore a silvery one-piece       |
| uniform that was tight-fitting, like a frogman's wetsuit, and he had  |
| on mitten-like gloves. He spoke to her, saying "I am Onleel, I want   |
| to talk with you, come with me." She saw only his eyes and no other   |
| facial features. The eyes were large and dark. The voice was probably |
| telepathic and it seemed to come from his eyes. She felt compelled to |
| obey. The next thing she remembers she is inside the ship, with no    |
| recollection of how she got onboard.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| She followed Onleel through a main central room and through a doorway |
| to a smaller room. In the room are three or four other beings, in     |
| general similar to Onleel but smaller in size, between four to five   |
| feet tall. They wore brown one-piece suits with boots. Two were       |
| seated at a control panel, while the third stood before a screen.     |
| They paid no attention to her. She had the impression that might have |
| been female, but there was nothing about their shape to suggest this  |
| except their smaller size. The fittings and furniture were all of     |
| "spun aluminum" and there was a bright light that illuminated the     |
| interior that came from no visible source.                            |
|                                                                       |
| Continued: In the smaller adjacent room Onleel sat the witness down and offered  |
| her an aluminum cup with liquid resembling milk. She declined the     |
| drink. Then Onleel asked her a number of questions, some of which     |
| were of a highly personal nature, indicating that he must already     |
| know a great deal about her. He asked her what she would do in        |
| various hypothetical situations, and he discussed with her aspects of |
| reincarnation. When asked how she would react to the prospect of      |
| facing death, she responded by saying she would accept it. He told    |
| her that she was "one of the developing ones---there are many of you  |
| scattered all over the planet," and he said they "would be coming     |
| back for her." The witness asked when and why, and he answered, "it   |
| is not for you to know."                                              |
|                                                                       |
| His voice came out in a metallic monotone, like it was computer       |
| generated. After the quiz, which lasted perhaps 20 to 30 minutes, she |
| found herself outside the object with no recollection of how she got  |
| there, dazed and upset. She was on the street outside the VA Hospital |
| grounds near her own apartment. She got home at about 2:30 a.m. There |
| were many things about her experience she is unable to remember. She  |
| had been wearing a new pair of shoes, and that morning she noticed    |
| that they were covered with what looked like desert dust and burrs.   |
| In a way this confirmed for her the reality of her experience, that   |
| it had not been a dream. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1977 - Gorham, Coos County, New Hampshire - Mrs. Susanne Fortier was   |
| walking on the lawn behind her house with her collie dog at 8:15 p.m. |
| Whe heard a sound like a "wind or whistle" and she then observed a    |
| small object land in the vicinity of the children's playhouse. It was |
| about five feet in diameter, with eight "pods or legs", windows or    |
| doors all around it, and an antenna on top. The interior was a bright |
| red, and it contained six three-foot-tall occupants who had long      |
| slit-like eyes, ape like noses, and no hair. The skin of their faces  |
| seemed very wrinkled. They wore gloves. Mrs Fortier could hear "a     |
| garble of voices" talking, like a bunch of CB voices, and felt a      |
| great deal of heat come from the craft. She watched it for about 15   |
| minutes, after which it rose straight up and flew off to the south.   |
| When she got back in the house she found her face and legs red from   |
| the heat. Her dog, which reacted noticeably to the object, would      |
| still not let her go near the area a month later. No traces were      |
| found at the landing site, which had been muddy. (Source: David F.    |

| 2003 - At 11:38 p.m. in Coral Springs, Florida a man saw a dark       |
| figure outside his window, and at first thought it was a man. It      |
| slightly resembled a naked man standing in the middle of the road,    |
| but after about 30 seconds the figure walked away. As it went behind  |
| some trees the witness thought he would go out to see who it was, but |
| then a triangular UFO appeared, encased in an eerie glow with three   |
| lights, one in each corner. The craft then zoomed up into the sky,    |
| leaving a trail of white fog behind. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,      |
