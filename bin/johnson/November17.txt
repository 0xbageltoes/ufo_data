| 1955 - At 6:10 a.m. in St. Louis, Missouri Mr. J. A. Mapes sighted    |
| twelve round, flat objects flying in a four-deep formation. They were |
| silver on top and dark on the bottom. They tipped in pitched and      |
| rolled as they flew by. They were in sight for 45 seconds. (Source:   |

| 1962 - At nine o'clock in the evening Mr. F. L. Swindale, a college   |
| graduate and ex-USMC Captain, saw three bright star-like lights       |
| approach, hover and bounce in the sky over Tampa, Florida. After      |
| 11-15 minutes they faded away. (Source: Don Berliner, Project         |

| 1966 - At 1:30 a.m. Margaret Marchute saw on the ground in            |
| Collegeville, Pennsylvania a luminous object that seemed to be made   |
| of polished metal. After about half an hour a red flame shot upward   |
| from the object, then two very bright lights approached it from the   |
| distance. When these were near it something like a luminous balloon   |
| sprang up from it and hovered in the air. At this point she could see |
| 3 or 4 figures moving about the large object on the ground, which was |
| pulsating from dim to bright. They were dressed in a "gold shiny      |
| material." She watched them for about two hours before going to bed.  |

| 1966 - In Gaffney, South Carolina police patrolmen A. G. Huskey and   |
| C. Hutchins rounded a corner and saw a dark, spherical machine with a |
| flat rim land in front of their patrol car at four o'clock in the     |
| morning. They estimated it was seven meters in diameter and about     |
| twenty feet above the ground. Hutchins described it as being          |
| spherical, like a ball, with a wide, flat rim around it. There were   |
| no lights or portholes visible on it. It was completely dark,         |
| reflecting a dull gold color in the headlights of the police car. A   |
| small doorway opened noiselessly on the underside of the sphere and a |
| short ladder dropped down. A small man dressed in a shiny gold suit   |
| emerged. White light poured out of the opening, but neither man could |
| see anything in the interior. The small being descended the ladder    |
| and walked slowly and deliberately toward the two police officers.    |
| When the figure reached a point about fifteen to twenty feet from the |
| two men, it stopped.                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| "He didn't move stiffly," officer Hutchins said. "He moved just like  |
| anybody else, but kind of slow...like he was taking his time. He      |
| wasn't scared of us or anything like that." In appearance, the        |
| humanoid was about the size of a twelve-year-old boy, maybe four feet |
| tall. He wore no helmet or headgear and was dressed in a gold suit    |
| with no buttons or zippers. His costume was shiny, like metal, in the |
| reflection of the headlights, but it was not self-luminous. The       |
| humanoid asked numerous questions and ignored the witnesses when they |
| asked any questions. Hutchins could not remember seeing the feet of   |
| the creature. It was standing on high grass and the feet must have    |
| been hidden. Both men could not really remember the full context of   |
| the "conversation". Hutchins claimed the alien spoke perfect English. |
| "Didn't have any accent or anything. He acted like he knew exactly    |
| what he was saying and doing...didn't make any quick moves or false   |
| moves. He just stood there and talked to the witnesses." He wanted to |
| know why both men were dressed alike. His speech was very precise. He |
| pronounced each work very carefully. When asked where he was from, he |
| just laughed. The meeting was brief, perhaps only two or three        |
| minutes. Then, Hutchins say, the creature announced,                  |
| "I...will...return...in...two...days." He turned, walked slowly back  |
| to the ladder and climbed into the object. The door closed quietly    |
| and the craft began to make a soft whirring sound like an engine with |
| a muffler on it. The object rose slowly and vanished into the sky. A  |
| local councilman found numerous footprints at the site where the      |
| little man had stood. There was no return visit by the alien.         |
