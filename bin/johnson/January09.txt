| 1963 -  On this day in Trail, Oregon a large, bright UFO emitted a    |
| cone-shaped tail and humming sound. A dog reacted to the UFO's        |
| presence by howling. (Source: Gordon I. R. Lore, Jr., Strange Effects |

| 1964 -  At 10:30 p.m. several green saucer-shaped UFOs maneuvered     |
| offshore over the surface of the sea near Nicastro, Calabria, Italy   |
| for ten minutes. As fishermen approached in a boat dove under the     |
| sea. (Source: Larry Hatch, case  # 6460, citing ITACAT, case # 56).   |

| 1966 - On this night the engine and lights of a car with three women  |
| passengers suddenly died in Chascomus, Argentina. At the same time    |
| they saw an object flying slowly away from their car. It was emitting |
| a blue beam of light. After the object had disappeared from view the  |
| car could be restarted. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports          |

| No. 17)                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 5:30 p.m. there was a knock at Edward Christiansen's home   |
| in Wildwood, New Jersey. Seventeen-year-old Connie Christiansen went  |
| to the door. Stunned, she reported back to her mother, "It's the      |
| strangest looking man I've ever seen." Mrs. Christiansen then went to |
| the door and unlatched it and looked outside. It was growing dark and |
| was bitter cold out. There was no car in view and this seemed unusual |
| because the Christiansen home was in an isolated area and guests were |
| unlikely to be arriving on foot. A tall man stood at the door and     |
| asked if Edward Christiansen lived there. He then said he was from    |
| "the Missing Heirs Bureau" and asked to be let in. They invited the   |
| stranger inside. The visitor must have been at least two meters (six  |
| and a half feet) tall, and was enormously broad shouldered. He wore a |
| Russian fur hat with a black visor on it and a very long black coat   |
| that seemed to be made out of thin material--too thin for the cold    |
| weather. He told the family "this will only take forty minutes." As   |
| he removed his hat he revealed an unusually shaped head that was      |
| large and round, while his face seemed angular and pointed. He had    |
| black hair, which was closely cropped. There was a perfectly round    |
| spot on the back of his head as if that area had been shaved          |
| recently. His nose and mouth seemed relatively normal, but his eyes   |
| were large, protruding, like "thyroid eyes," and set wide apart. One  |
| eye appeared to have a cast, like a glass eye, and did not move in    |
| unison with its companion.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| During the course of the conversation Mr. Christiansen noticed a      |
| badge on the stranger's shirt pocket, which he quickly covered with   |
| his hand and removed, placing it in his coat pocket. It resembled a   |
| gold or brass badge and it seemed to have a big K on it with a small  |
| x alongside and letters and numbers around the edge, according to     |
| Connie Christiansen. Underneath his thin outer coat he was wearing a  |
| short-sleeved shirt made of a Dacron like material. His trousers were |
| of a dark gray or black material, and were a little too short. He     |
| wore dark shoes with unusually thick rubber soles. A strange feature  |
| on his leg fascinated Connie and Mrs. Christiansen. When he sat down  |
| they could see a long thick green wire attached to the inside of his  |
| leg. It came out or his socks and disappeared under his trousers. At  |
| one point it seemed to be indented into his leg and was covered with  |
| a large brown spot. The Christiansen's noted that the visitor had an  |
| unnatural pallor. His speech was also strange, with a high "tinny"    |
| voice that seemed especially peculiar coming from such a large man.   |
| He also spoke in a strange, hard to understand, sing-song manner. At  |
| one point when his face reddened he asked for a glass of water, and   |
| swallowed a large yellow capsule which he gulped down. He then        |
| returned to normal. After about 40 minutes he donned his hat and coat |
| and told Mr. Christiansen that he would be in touch. When he reached  |
| the road, he made a gesture and a black 1963 Cadillac drove through   |
| the trees and pulled up. He climbed into the car and it drove away    |
| with its headlights off. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |

| 1967 - On the same night Jules Derome, age 60, of Acton Vale, Quebec, |
| Canada reported that he encountered and photographed several          |
| 90-centimeter tall luminous humanoid forms in his garage. The strange |
| forms disappeared by moving through the wall of the garage and        |
| presumably outside. The photos only show a vague luminous area. The   |
| witness apparently has had additional subsequent encounters. (Source: |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1967, case 23, citing    |

| 1970 -  On this night a disc-shaped object was seen in the sky over a |
| farm in Rouillac, Charente district, France followed by a flash. The  |
| next day a big hole in the ground was found in a field on the farm,   |
| and some soil was missing. (Sources: Ion Hobana and Julien            |

| 1974 -  A UFO with a red light on top, and with green, orange, yellow |
| and white flashing lights around the middle traveled west to east     |
| over the Deschutes River Canyon, then stopped over Grass Valley,      |
| north of Madras, Oregon at 1:30 a.m. It was joined by a second        |
| object. That night a UFO with a multi-colored ring of lights was seen |
| descending slowly near Route V eight miles south of Sedalia,          |
| Missouri. It disappeared behind a ridge at 8:20 p.m., and may have    |
| landed remotely. (Sources: (1) Bend Bulletin, January 9, 1974; (2)    |

| 1976 -   Jean Dolecki, age 55, was driving home after sunset at 7:10  |
| p.m. near Echevis, Isere department, France when a luminous object    |
| appeared in the sky and landed 100 yards away in a farm field beside  |
| the road. It had the form of a "coffee pot", a 50-60 foot high        |
| cylinder with a narrow waist, the upper portion larger than the lower |
| one, and was about 40 to 45 feet in diameter. From the bottom a       |
| bright white light turned on, which illuminated it. The top surface   |
| seemed to be vibrating, and on each side near the top was attached a  |
| relatively small vertical helix, which also vibrated. A door opened   |
| in the upper portion, and three beings that looked like “robots”      |
| resembling “aluminum diving suits,” 6.5-7.0 feet tall, descended.     |
| They had square heads, disproportionately small legs, and in lieu of  |
| arms, a telescopic “pole” about 7 feet long, mounted on their chests. |
| These entities moved about near the UFO for about ten minutes,        |
| walking in a mechanical manner and wagging their poles up and down.   |
| They then re-entered, and the machine took off, disappearing at a     |
| rapid speed. (Sources: Gil Bil Helaar, Skylook, May 1976, p. 4; David |

| 1978 - Two members of the Gould family were sitting in their living   |
| room in South Middleton, Massachusetts at 7:30 p.m. when they saw an  |
| approaching large yellow ball of light angling towards the ground     |
| through their window. One of them ran out the back door to glimpse    |
| the object disappear behind some trees. Telephone interference was    |
| experienced in the home at about this time. Later one of the children |
| in an upstairs bedroom reported seeing a white figure at the foot of  |
| his bed that tried to touch him. Moments later the father heard a     |
| noise coming from an empty room, and when he went to investigate he   |
| then heard a noise at the window. Pulling back the curtains, he saw a |
| white figure standing on top of the back porch roof, only four feet   |
| away. The figure was hooded and seemed to be wearing a mask. Later    |
| while investigating a noise at the door to the front porch he again   |
| saw the white suited figure standing just outside the glass door.     |

| 1979 -  At three o'clock in the morning a milkman at the Willow Grove |
| Exit of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania  |
| suddenly encountered a bright orange circular UFO hovering over his   |
| truck. It vanished abruptly. Other witnesses reported UFO sightings   |
| in Norristown, Lower Merion, and Lower Gwynedd, Pennsylvania.         |

| 1979 -  Three police officers driving on a highway in Castel D'Asso,  |
| Latium, Italy saw a 10 meter in diameter glowing disc-shaped object   |
| at or near the ground at 5:30 a.m. They tried to use their two-way    |
| radios but experienced radio interference. The saucer shaped craft    |
| rose to one meter altitude and moved away rapidly in a horizontal     |
| direction. (Source: Verga Maurizio, ITACAT, case # 143).              |

| 1979 -  A domed ovoid-shaped UFO chased a car driving along Route 26  |
| for three hours between Tacuarembo, Argentina and Melo, Uruguay       |
| during the day. There were four people in the car, two of them        |
| police. The UFO changed color and brightness, from red to bluish      |
| white, formed over a base ring of plasma. It made no sound. (Source:  |

| 1984 - Mr. & Mrs. Sprinster had a close encounter with a              |
| multi-colored triangular shaped UFO 10 miles west of Torrington,      |
| Connecticut on Route 4 at 9:30 p.m. The object moved very slowly, and |
| dropped in altitude to pace their car. Its underside was              |
| criss-crossed with tubes and grill work. A red light in the center of |
| the object detached, circled the object three times, then returned    |
| back to its original position. It left by making a sharp turn to the  |
| south. The encounter lasted 10 minutes. (Source: Philip J. Imbrogno,  |

| 1984 - Two witnesses in a car driving north of Hawthorne, New Jersey  |
| at 9:33 p.m. saw two silent 75-foot in diameter parabolic discs 200   |
| feet above SR 208. The objects seemed to be avoiding being seen by    |
| passing cars. (Source: Robert Gribble, MUFON UFO Journal, December    |

| 1984 -  At 7:30 p.m. a metallic object described as blimp like with   |
| red lights buzzed two cars on US Highway 395 south of Pearsonville,   |
| near the China Lake Weapons Center in Kern County on a clear night.   |
| At 10:30 p.m. several independent witnesses reported seeing a huge    |
| silent cigar shaped object over the highway on SR 14 15 miles north   |
| of Mojave, Kern County, California. It was only 100 feet over the     |
| road and had red lights on the bottom; it flew off to the north.      |

| 1986 -  Multiple cars stopped along Interstate 84 in Hartford,        |
| Connecticut at 9:00 p.m. to watch a silent boomerang-shaped object,   |
| estimated to be the size of a Boeing 747, with white, red, blue and   |
| green lights as it moved low through sky, then hovered for 15 seconds |
| before heading off to the west. The boomerang seen over Hartford and  |
| New Britain was also seen by dozens of witnesses in Torrington,       |
| Connecticut. A family reported the UFO, with 10 white lights, hovered |
| directly over their house, engulfing their home in a brilliant white  |
| light. They were so frightened they fled to the basement. (Sources:   |

| 1993 - Popudinske Mocadliny, Slovakia - The witness saw first an       |
| orange ball of fire at a minute before midnight, resting in a field.  |
| Later they saw a flying triangle only 30 cm in diameter that landed   |
| on top of a nearby pigeon house. A door opened and a tiny smoky       |
| humanoid exited the object. Two weeks later the witness saw a similar |
| humanoid in his bedroom. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |
