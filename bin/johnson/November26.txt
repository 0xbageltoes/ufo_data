| 1943 - Approximate year. During World War Two, on a bombing mission over Bremen, Germany crew  |
| members of the United States 8th Air Force reported that green "rings |
| of flame 2 or 3 feet in diameter" corkscrewed through their           |
| formation, as if floating. (Source: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947 website |
| on aerial encounters).                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1950 - On this day in 1950, two airmen flying over the Sussex, England       |
| coastline saw a silver-blue disc flying south. The object "tumbled    |
| over" and disappeared into some clouds at a terrific speed. (Source:  |
| Awareness, April 1979, p. 8).                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - On this night in 1954, an object with four reddish-yellow lights      |
| forming a rectangle circled over Millville, New Jersey. Shortly       |
| afterward a searchlight caught the object, revealing it to be a huge  |
| disc. As soon as the light touched it, the UFO sped up and swiftly    |
| disappeared. (Source: Donald Keyhoe, Flying Saucer Conspiracy, p.     |
| 232).                                                                 |

| 1962 - In 1962 at 1:00 a.m., just southeast of Abra Grande, Argentina in the |
| province of Santiago del Estero, two men driving a tractor-trailer    |
| truck loaded with coal watched a lit-up "railway car" near some       |
| railroad tracks that run parallel to the road project a brilliant     |
| beam of light on the road. When they got closer they made out that it |
| was some type of unknown craft emitting phosphorescent flashes.       |
| Making no sound it rose up into the air to a height of some 50        |
| meters, then landed again beside the road. Throughout their entire    |
| journey to Clodomira the object kept jumping ahead of them. When the  |
| first lights of the city came into sight the object broke off pursuit |
| and climbed into the sky at a terrific speed. (Source: Oscar Uriondo, |
| FSR Case Histories (Supplement 12), December 1972, p. 10, citing El   |

| 1964 - The witness, an eight-year-old child at the time, reported     |
| that he and his family experienced the total electrical failure of    |
| their family car in Adams, Wisconsin on this night when they had a    |
| close encounter experience with a single bright, stationary light. At |
| the same time, "trees looked like they were transparent." (Sources:   |

| 1965 - In 1965 in a wide area from St. Paul, Minnesota to the Wisconsin      |
| border, blue lights in the sky, power failures, and electro-magnetic  |
| effects on cars were reported. At 8:00 p.m. many residents of Totem   |
| Town, St. Paul, Minnesota saw strange objects flying overhead,        |
| emitting blue and orange flashes. Some reported that their house      |
| lights went out when the objects passed overhead. One person in a car |
| said that his headlights and radio had failed as the objects passed   |
| nearby. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, December 1965, p.1; Mark    |

| 1966 - In St. Albans, West Virginia a woman saw "Mothman" standing on |
| her front lawn. She described the creature as about six feet tall     |
| with a "funny little face" with "big red eyes that popped out." She   |
| screamed and ran inside her house. In Lowell, Ohio during the         |
| afternoon Marvin Shock and three others reported seeing four "giant   |
| birds" that stood 4-5 feet tall and had 10-foot wing spreads and      |
| bills 5-6 inches long. They kept them in sight for two hours.         |

| 1968 - Two Air Traffic Controllers at Bismark, North Dakota airport,  |
| Watts and Wilhelm, watched two bright lights in the sky engage in     |
| sudden maneuvers. The first  one was northbound at 45 degrees         |
| elevation above the horizon, the second one was southbound at 30      |
| degrees elevation. The Great Falls radar confirmed erratic targets.   |
| The second object made a 180 degree turn to join the first object,    |
| then hovered in the sky, finally departing toward the northeast. The  |
| entire incident lasted more than five minutes. Their were other       |
| independent witnesses, including the crew of a Capital Aviation       |
| flight. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience, p. 38;  APRO    |

| 1969 -  An 18-year-old man named Oram sighted a cigar-shaped UFO      |
| hovering over the gasworks in East Ham, Essex, England in clear skies |
| at 8:35 a.m. He experienced visions and received a telepathic message |
| to "keep quiet" about his close encounter experience. (Source:        |

| 1972 -  On this evening a yellow delta-shaped UFO flew over           |
| L'Ancresse in the English Channel Isles for 10 minutes heading        |
| south.  A faint hum was heard when the object was overhead, which     |
| then zig-zagged through the sky. (Source: FSR, January 1973, p. 30,   |

| 1973 -  Two raccoon hunters spotted a large reddish orange sphere     |
| across the field north of Lincoln, Missouri at 9:30 p.m. Their dogs   |
| ran away, past some cattle, and jumped into their truck and refused   |
| to get out. When the hunters drove away the UFO silently paced their  |
| truck for half a mile on Highway 65, near some power lines. (Source:  |

| 1974 - Mike Grivoski, a teenager in Minneapolis, Minnesota saw a      |
| large orange luminous ball crossing the sky in the evening and ran    |
| for his Polaroid camera. He snapped one photograph. His father also   |
| saw the object, which was as bright as the full moon. The photo,      |
| however, showed five small lights, each with a dashed trail leading   |
| across the picture. Later that night Mike was awakened by the noise   |
| of someone in his bedroom. He saw a "creature" with heavy brow        |
| ridges, jowls, and large pointed ears removing the photograph from a  |
| drawer. When he sat up, the creature dropped the picture and ran out  |
| the door. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |

| 1974 -  A loud 110 decibel roar was followed by the sighting of a     |
| two-meter wide sphere or ovoid near the ground in a garden in La      |
| Plata, Buenos Aires province, Argentina at around 11:30 p.m. On the   |
| ground was found a 3.4 meter diameter ring plus numerous equilateral  |
| triangular marks that were one meter on a side. The grass and a tree  |
| top was burnt, and a silvery powder residue made up of Calcium Oxide  |
| was found. (Sources:  Inforespace, June 1976; Roberto E. Banchs,      |

| 1980 - A witness driving in a car near Bentwaters RAF Air Base in     |
| Suffolk, England at around 2:00 p.m. saw a black ball in the sky      |
| being chased by two jet aircraft. It stopped in the sky, then shot    |
| straight up. (Source: Jenny Randles, From Out of the Blue, p. 133).   |

| 1984 -  A UFO seen at 6:15 p.m. by Mr. & Mrs. Hoel in Gloucester,     |
| Massachusetts seemed to respond to their comments while flying over   |
| Magnolia Bay. The  dark triangular object, 150 feet wide, with a      |
| canopy underneath, flew at 125 feet altitude and passed over Magnolia |
| Bay and surrounding trees. It made a low droning sound, and seemed to |
| be made of a non-reflective material. (Sources: Doris Graziano, APRO  |
| Bulletin, June 1985, p. 8, citing the Gloucester Times; John          |

| 1993 - At 7:45 p.m. a witness driving in Riverside, California        |
| reported seeing an object whirl around in the sky, then land about    |
| 200 feet from his car. A door opened on the top of the craft and      |
| several persons came out. They appeared to be normal looking humans.  |
| He heard them talking, and when they apparently noticed him they      |
| entered the craft and left. The witness believes that what he saw was |
| a crashed alien spacecraft recovered by the U.S. military and now     |
| being manned by the government. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |

| 1999 - A glowing silver cigar-shaped object traveled very quickly up  |
| and down the beach in the Bethwells Beach area in Auckland, New       |
| Zealand at 11:30 p.m. It was seen by several witnesses and seemed to  |
| dematerialize and reappear a number of times; It finally hovered low  |
| over the water 200 meters away from shore. A dog started barking at   |
| the object, and the dog's owner, who felt a static charge emanating   |
| from the object, then became frightened. (Sources: Robert Frola,      |

| 2003 -  A soft humming noise was first heard in Dunstable,            |
| Bedfordshire, England at 9:00 p.m. Then the witness saw some hovering |
| spherical objects that were then chased away by military aircrafts.   |
