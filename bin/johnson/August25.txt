| 1950 - 250 miles southwest of Bermuda over the Atlantic Ocean (29.67º |
| N, 67.47º W). At 8:00 p.m. radarman S/Sgt. William Shaffer, flying in |
| a B-29, picked up an unidentified radar blip. The B-29 followed the   |
| unidentified target, then passed it at one-quarter-mile distance,     |
| whereupon the target followed them for the next five minutes. It      |
| passed the B-29 and sped away. A blue streak was seen in the sky      |
| three minutes later. Total time of tracking: 20 minutes. (Source: Don |

| 1951 - At 9:10 p.m. four Texas Tech professors--Robinson, Oberg,      |
| Ducker, and George--in a backyard in Lubbock, Texas saw the "Lubbock  |
| Lights", a string of perhaps 50 beads of light in a semi-circle or    |
| wing shape, which passed over from north to south. They were seen     |
| again less than one hour later. (Sources: Project Grudge Report #2,   |

| 1951 - In Albuquerque, New Mexico Sandia Base Security Guard Hugh     |
| Young and his wife sighted a huge flying wing-shaped craft pass over  |
| their heads at 9:58 p.m. at an estimated 800 to 1,000-feet altitude.  |
| The craft made no sound. Its size was estimated as 1.5 times the      |
| wingspan of a B-36 bomber, or 350 feet. It had dark, chordwise        |
| stripes on the underside, and 6-8 pairs of soft, glowing lights on    |
| the trailing edge of "wing". Its speed was estimated at 300-400       |
| m.p.h., object seen for about 30 seconds. (Sources: Don Berliner,     |

| 1952 - At Holloman AFB, New Mexico around 3:40 p.m., civilian         |
| supervisor Fred Lee and foreman L.A. Aquilar saw a round silver       |
| object fly south, turn and fly north, then make a 360-degree turn and |
| shoot up vertically after 3-5 minutes. (Sources: Don Berliner,        |

| 1952 - In Pittsburg, Kansas at 5:35 a.m. radio station musician       |
| William Squyres saw a dull aluminum object, shaped like two meat      |
| platters, face to face. The object was hovering about 10 feet above   |
| the ground, 100 yards off the road, with a slight rocking motion. He  |
| estimated its size at 75-feet long, 45-feet wide, and 15-feet thick.  |
| The head and shoulders of a man could be seen through a window in the |
| front section, through which a blue light shone. The midsection had   |
| numerous windows through which could be seen some type of regular     |
| movement. A series of small propellers were arranged along the outer  |
| edge of the object spaced close together, revolving at high speed. It |
| ascended vertically with a sound like a large covey of quail starting |
| to fly at the same time. Vegetation showed signs of having been       |
| disturbed under the object. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, January |

| 1959 - At around eleven o'clock in the morning near Hagen,            |
| Werdehl-Eveking, Germany Lutz Holtmann began walking toward a bright  |
| object he had seen in the forest, but he fainted when he got close to |
| it. When he regained consciousness he saw it silently take off in a   |
| vertical ascent. He described the UFO as round with tripod landing    |
| gear and two rows of bright openings. It was about 30 meters in       |
| diameter. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of |

| 1960 - On this afternoon an agriculture student named Nielsen was     |
| sucked up into a flying saucer in Halmstad, Sweden. He lost           |
| consciousness; when he came to he found himself on a bed in a room    |
| with light-emitting walls. A man wearing coveralls apologized to      |
| him in Swedish. He was then taken to an underground base. (Source:    |

| 1961 - On or about this date five persons riding in a car near        |
| Toulouse, France observed a luminous, yellow sphere, 8 meters in      |
| diameter, that was flying about 10 meters above the road. It had      |
| horizontal and vertical bands of darker tone that gave the impression |
| of windows. The UFO flew up and away very fast when the car reached   |
| town. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of      |

| 1964 - A silvery gray object with a dome on top, blinking red lights, |
| a solid white light, and lights on the rim was sighted at close range |
| by four boys in Littleton, Massachusetts at 9:30 p.m. It hovered with |
| a fluttering motion near the ground, then finally shot off at high    |
| speed. The witnesses were able to approach to within 500 feet of the  |
| craft before it left. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, case investigation  |

| 1964 - An hour later in Lynn, Massachusetts another witness,          |
| 17-year-old Richard Pratt, heard a whistling sound and sighted a      |
| second domed disc. It was described as a silvery oval twenty feet in  |

| 1965 - At three o'clock in the morning Zoilo Campos Aguilar, a night  |
| watchman, observed an object very close to the ground                 |
| in Terreon, Mexico for 38 minutes. It was semi-oval shaped with a     |
| powerful yellow-orange light and left rapidly toward the south with a |
| double trail. The apparent diameter was that of the full moon.        |

| 1965 - At 10:10 a.m. a red object shaped like a plate with two        |
| antennae on top and emittting fire and smoke through two openings in  |
| its lower section, shook a school building as it allegedly landed on  |
| the roof in Callao, Peru. Faculty and students at the Santa Leonor    |
| College observed the craft when it rose from the building, spinning   |
| and emitting red light beams as it flew off to the northeast.         |

| 1967 - At 4:00 p.m. in Eldon, Missouri an ovoid object flew slowly    |
| and silently to the southwest at 800 feet altitude. Two witnesses in  |
| a car attempted to follow it, but it tilted and vanished. (Source:    |

| 1967 - Shortly after 11:00 p.m. a round, hazy mass of orange-red      |
| light, about a quarter of a mile away, was sighted by two witnesses   |
| in Rising Brook, Staffordshire, England. It was estimated to be about |
| 60 feet in diameter, and at a maximum height of 300-400 feet from the |
| ground. It hovered, then moved slowly to the south, stopped, and then |
| moved back again. It made no sound. (Source: Roger H. Stanway &       |

| 1968 - In Aldaya, Valencia, Spain Juan Gazcon del Toro, age 44,       |
| was riding his bicycle home from work at 8:00 p.m., and was crossing  |
| a cultivated field when, as he turned a bend, saw a silvery           |
| gray object on the ground resting on four legs. Next to the object    |
| stood two short beings; the witness bicycled closer to the object,    |
| stopped 40 meters away from it, and then looked at it more closely.   |
| The craft had a small dome with an antennae on top, and an open door  |
| from which a silvery ladder extended to the ground. Both beings wore  |
| helmets with visors from which a rubber hose like protrusion was      |
| apparently connected to their chest area. They also wore wide belts   |
| and small boots, and their outfits were white in color. The beings    |
| stood by the object ignoring the witness, so he pedalled his bicycle  |
| away from the site and did not watch the object depart. (Sources:     |

| 1971 - Feeling a compulsion to go to a certain place, Paul de Brescia |
| walked to an isolated wooded area near Grasse, France. In a clearing  |
| he encountered two very tall humanoids, about 1.85 meters in height   |
| with well-proportioned bodies and long blond hair. They wore          |
| tight-fitting bluish metallic coveralls with wide white belts and     |
| white gloves. The witness felt a sense of compassion and              |
| understanding emanating from the humanoids. The humanoids approached  |
| him and communicated in French, telling him that they had come from   |
| the star system of Vega. They were here on a mission to attempt to    |
| persuade humanity to change its ways. After more conversation one of  |
| the humanoids gave Paul something resembling a piece of chocolate,    |
| which he ate, he became drowsy and later woke up in his apartment,    |
| suffering a complete amnesia of the event. He was only able to recall |
| the incident on a later date. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |

| 1972 - Steve Cleveland, a carnival worker from Eau Claire, Wisconsin  |
| called radio station WLS in Chicago to report that as he had been     |
| sitting on his suitcase outside of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin at around |
| 2:00 a.m. hoping to hitch a ride to Eau Clare, when he had seen "a    |
| huge ship" come down in a nearby field, out of which came two beings  |
| about five feet tall. They took some samples of the vegetation and    |
| got back into the object, which then lifted off. He said he observed  |
| the phenomenon for 15 minutes. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, |
| HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1972-22, citing           |

| 1976 - At 2:30 a.m. a 10-year-old boy in Blissfield, Michigan got up  |
| to go to the bathroom. When he looked out the window he saw a deep    |
| orange luminous globe blinking on and off and slowly zigzagging in    |
| the sky. He watched it for 10-15 minutes, feeling a “pull” from it.   |
| Then when it blinked he suddenly found himself inside it, where       |
| two greenish beings sat with their arms over a table with little      |
| black knobs. They were busy manipulating the knobs while a third      |
| being stood in front of the boy. The third entity was about an inch   |
| taller than the boy. The beings appeared not to have any eyes, nose,  |
| mouth, or neck, and instead of fingers they had pincers like a        |
| crayfish. They had two small projections on the top of their heads.   |
| Their legs did not end in feet, and when they walked it sounded like  |
| "a wooden legged pirate.” The skin on their cheeks and arms was bumpy |
| and rough like an alligator, and there were scales on their bodies.   |
| They did not utter words, but “hummed like Morse code.” After what    |
| seemed like about five seconds the boy found himself back in his      |
| house, and ran upstairs. Later that same night, at about five a.m.,   |
| his 11-year old sister awoke and saw a blue light outside her window. |

| 1977 - At 10:30 a.m. a driver described as a very reliable man was    |
| driving along a highway in Lluchmayor Palma de Mallorca, Baleares,    |
| Spain when he saw a very small (35 cm) object in the road directly    |
| ahead of him. It was too late to stop the car, and he knocked the     |
| "bowling pin shaped" thing down and ran it over, "feeling an intense  |
| sensation that he had killed a living being." Investigation at the    |
| site disclosed a circular wet stain. About two weeks earlier, there   |

| 2004 - Military maneuvers code-named "Shield of the Fatherland-2004"  |
| had begun in the forests of Belarus. A senior lieutenant named        |
| Dmitriy, commander of a reconnaissance diversion group (RDG), was     |
| performing rear guard operations and was engaged in destroying        |
| targets pre-positioned at Krepachi, Baranovichi area, Brest region.   |
| On the night of August 24 they made camp. Two men code-named          |
| "Rainbow" and "Hedgehog" were posted for night watch duty. The group  |
| had decided to make camp 375 meters away from the village of Krepachi |
| in the Brest region. The location was mixed forest, in a clearing     |
| with two large old oak trees and a lake between them. The almost      |
| deserted village was not on any map, and the nearest really inhabited |
| place was the hamlet of Gorodiszhe. At 3:08 a.m. they were awakened   |
| by a bright but plain spreading orange light. Their portable radio    |
| communications continued to work. Dmitriy asked Rainbow by radio if   |
| he had seen anything. Rainbow replied that he could see a             |
| plate-shaped craft about 27 meters from him, hovering over the ground |
| at an altitude of about 2.5m. Dmitriy then gave the command to take   |
| defensive positions and prepare the grenade launcher. After           |
| confirming that all his men were ready, Dmitriy took another man,     |
| "Barkhan", and went on a reconnaissance patrol. The object was        |
| generally saucer-shaped with a truncated cone above. At close         |
| observation the object seemed metallic. The UFO emitted a beam of     |
| turquoise beam of light from its center. Unexpectedly, "Hedgehog"     |
| next reported that he could see four figures approaching him from the |
| object, but he could not see them properly because of the tall grass  |
| concealing them. The soldiers then turned on their laser rangefinder  |
| to infrared mode. The humanoid figures seemed very tall, but the men  |
| still could not see them properly. Dmitriy noticed that the figures   |
| moved evenly as if robotic in nature. Seconds later the UFO quickly   |
| gained altitude, zooming out of sight beyond the clouds. According to |
| the laser rangefinder the UFO's departing speed was 2600 kilometers   |
| per hour. The humanoid figures then walked in different directions.   |
| Dmitriy did not order his men to follow them, because that could lead |
| to separating the group, which contradicted the defensive order. The  |
| figures seemed to walk through some high tension wires as if they     |
| were not there. Dmitriy could only hope that the humanoids and object |
| would quickly leave and that his men would not be harmed.             |
|                                                                       |
| After returning to their unit, some of the men informed senior        |
| officers of what had taken place. The officers ordered the men to     |
| keep silence, in order to prevent them from being discharged from the |
| Army for "psychological" reasons. One officer suggested that the men  |
| had been hallucinating as a result of the rigorous training           |
| exercises. Later, intelligence personnel interviewed the men, and     |
| appeared to be relieved that the men had not used their weapons       |
| against the "aliens" for fear of retaliation. A female resident of    |
| the village told Army investigators that spherical and disk-shaped    |
| objects were often observed in the location. The villagers had been   |
| pasturing cows in the glade where the UFO had descended, and the      |
| soldiers had camped, and they reported that the cows' milk production |
| had dropped dramatically. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2004 Humanoid   |

| 2004 - At 4:00 p.m. an elderly man and a young boy in Lagos, Nigeria  |

| object flew over him and crashed onto the waters off of the beach. He |
| reported the case to the Aviation Authority, but they did not believe |
| him. The young boy, who was peddling spring water around the beach    |
| resort, also corroborated the first witness's account, but was also   |
