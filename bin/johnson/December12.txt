| 1948 – A silent green fireball flew over Bernal, New Mexico toward    |
| the west for 2.2 seconds at a low altitude, then ascended. It was     |
| seen by Dr. La Paz, a meteor expert who later prepared a report on    |
| these anomalous green fireballs. He concluded that what he saw was    |
| not a meteor. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official   |

| 1955 - In 1955 there were three UFO reports from London, Hertfordshire, and  |
| West Sussex, England. At 6:45 a.m. an observer in the Beckenham       |
| neighborhood of London felt the urge to look up, and then watched a   |
| golden colored disc streak across the sky. At 4:40 p.m. a bright      |
| silver disc curved down and then flew back up into the clouds over    |
| Hitchin, England. It then shot away to the southwest very fast.       |
| Twenty minutes later a 25-foot wide golden disc streaked across the   |
| sky in Horsham, England heading toward the south. It flew at an       |
| estimated altitude of 2500 feet and vanished quickly from sight.      |

| 1967 – A woman, Mrs. Rita Malley, was driving down a rural road in    |
| North Lansing, New York with her infant daughter when she noticed     |
| that she was being followed by a multi-colored, domed disc-shaped     |
| object. The saucer hovered directly over her car, a Ford Mustang, and |
| the engine stalled. At the same time she heard a weird chorus of      |
| voices informing her of the approaching death of a friend. (Sources:  |

| 1968 – On this evening at 18:04 p.m. in Franois, France nine          |
| witnesses saw strange figures moving around in front of a light on    |
| the ground alongside the highway as they drove by. The light source   |
| wasn’t there when they checked back later. (Source: J. Tyrode, FSR    |

| 1972 - In 1972 in Huaco, San Juan Province, Argentina four men watched three |
| glowing red, oval-shaped objects zigzag over the Rio Huaco valley,    |
| heading toward the east. (Source: Oscar A. Calindez, Stendek, March   |

| 1973 - At 9:15 a.m. the witness was alone at home with her young      |
| daughter and had just stepped out onto her patio in Mayaguez, Puerto  |
| Rico when she saw a bright oval-shaped craft hovering at a high       |
| altitude overhead. It appeared to be rocking back and forth. She went |
| back inside the house and she next heard a loud humming sound, which  |
| stopped for a few moments, then started again. She then saw through   |
| her kitchen window a strange being standing 15 feet away. He was of   |
| normal height, but wore a bright, tight-fitting uniform and a black   |
| helmet. His skin was reddish bronze in color and he seemed not to     |
| have a mouth or a nose. His eyes were two round holes that stared at  |
| the witness intensely. A yellowish beam of light illuminated the man  |
| from an unknown source in the sky. The witness felt like she going    |
| into a trance, and began receiving telepathic messages from the       |
| being. At one point she felt compelled to go to the front of the      |
| house, where she saw a floating box about three inches long and very  |
| shiny, it seemed to have had a calming effect on her. After the       |
| incident she went into a fit of hysterics. (Source: Albert S.         |

| 1976 – On this morning around 7:20 a.m. at a factory in Meylan,       |
| France Mr. Hermann, a 38-year-old security guard, saw a 5.5' tall     |
| luminous green human form appear about 20 meters away from him. It    |
| stood in the center of a circular orange-yellow spot. It seemed to be |
| wearing a helmet. Mr. Hermann’s neck muscles were paralyzed, but he   |
| was able to run outside. When he returned it was gone. (Source:       |

| 1978 - Ms. Adele Holzer was in her car driving to work at 8 a.m. when |
| she saw a hemispherical white disc in Burghausen, Bavaria, Germany.   |
| More puzzled than afraid, she pulled off to the side of the road, and |
| saw a "row of shining green ports along its periphery." Then, she     |
| thought to herself, "If I could only see its bottom," and it suddenly |
| turned exposing the underneath. She said there were three spheres on  |
| its bottom surface, the middle one being larger. It possessed a       |
| bright orange spot at its center. As the UFO hovered over some nearby |
| trees, six beams of green light shot from it and she felt slightly    |
| paralyzed by one of them. She lost track of time as the object        |
| hovered over her. When the light beams went out the object rose       |
| silently up into the sky. Her watch had stopped at 08:01 a.m. and her |
| car's ignition key, that she believed had been in her hand the entire |
| time, was bent. She later told investigators she felt "somebody was   |
| trying to get into telepathic contact with her." She claimed to have  |
| been given a message saying that they had friendly intentions and     |
| wanted to stop us from destroying the Earth. (Source: Albert S.       |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978, citing Michael Hessemann).   |

| 1978 – At 10:15 p.m. a motorist in Marzocca, in the Tuscany region of |
| Italy, experienced engine failure, the lights of his car died, and    |
| the car’s cassette tape player stopped working. He then saw a         |
| luminous flying object that emitted a beam of light onto his car.     |
| When the object departed the car’s lights came back on and the tape   |
| deck resumed playing. On the same night a photograph of a domed disc  |
| with a neon glow was taken near an oil field by a Dubai government    |
| official in the United Arab Emirates. (Sources: Richard Hall, The UFO |

| 1978 - At 11:45 p.m. Alfonso Marinelli was traveling in his new       |
| Mercedez near Navelli, in the Abruzzi region of Italy when his engine |
| suddenly quit. He then noted two bright lights approaching slowly in  |
| his direction. As the lights approached Marinelli was able to make    |
| out two short human-like figures. The figures wore silvery suits,     |
| resembling those of astronauts. The suits were luminous, and both     |
| figures wore huge oval-shaped helmets. The front of the helmets had   |
| black visors. Over the chest the figures had what appeared to be      |
| straps with a bright round light on the center. The figures rose off  |
| the ground to a height about 90 cm and in flew over the witness       |
| vehicle, quickly disappearing from sight. Marinelli was soon able to  |
| start his car's engine and drove away from the area. (Source: Albert  |

| 1979 – At 11:45 p.m. a multi-colored disc passed by fast a            |
| residential neighborhood in Romans, France at a low altitude,         |
| spinning as it went. It left behind a luminous trail. (Source:        |

| 1983 – A triangular flying object was sighted over Byron, Illinois by |
| three men. It moved erratically and made no sound. It had blinking    |
| red and white lights. Its erratic path was detected on FAA radar at   |
| the Greater Rockford, Illinois airport. (Source: APRO Bulletin,       |
| September 1984, p. 8).                                                |

| 1987 – On this day six odd looking humanoid beings were sighted on    |
| the ground near a nuclear power plant in Malvezi, France in a         |
| restricted area. They were overheard speaking in an unintelligible    |
| language. They flew away on flying sleds. Later that night United     |
| Airlines flight 1405 reported that two UFOs, each with two rows of    |
| lights, approached the airliner at a rapid speed 50 miles east of     |
| Fort Wayne, Indiana. (Sources: FSR, December 1988, p. 22; Dominique   |

| 1988 - In 1988 four people on a lonely road in Wisbech, England were buzzed  |
| by a disc-shaped UFO at around 7:40 p.m. Many police cars and         |
| helicopters were seen combing the nearby fields later that night.     |

| 1993 – In North Somercotes, Lincolnshire, England at 4:30 p.m. many   |
| people reported sighting several silent delta-shaped UFOs and lights  |
| hovering over nearby roads. Television sets reportedly changed        |
| channels without cause. (Source: UFO Newsclipping Service, March      |

| 1997 – At a sleepover in Lubbock, Texas, two girls reported that they |
| saw flashing lights in their room at two o’clock in the morning,      |
| followed by the blankets being thrown off their bed. They saw a       |
| number of tall, thin figures that “spoke” to them, followed by an     |
| episode of missing time. When they awoke they found strange           |
| triangular marks on their bodies. (Source: Peter Davenport, National  |

| 2001 – At 6:07 p.m. in Carlisle, England a retired military pilot saw |
| a large, bright object in the western sky. It moved rapidly toward    |
| the east at a high speed. It was disc-shaped with a "teardop-shaped   |
| aura". He estimated it was moving at Mach 3 when it vanished          |
| abruptly. (Source: UFO Magazine (USA), April 2002, p. 21).            |
