| 1947 - A former military photographer claimed that a UFO, 30-40 feet  |
| in diameter and about 15 feet in height, crashed near the area of     |
| Socorro, New Mexico and was recovered on this day. One occupant of    |
| the craft was killed in the crash, while three others allegedly       |
| emerged alive. When they were found by the U.S. military, the         |
| survivors reportedly made crying-like sounds and clutched box-like    |
| devices to their chests. One of them appeared to be injured. The      |
| occupants were of small height and had copper based blood. This       |
| object was reportedly eventually sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force   |
| Base near Dayton, Ohio, and ended up at the "Hangar 18" facility.     |

| 1948 - In 1948 at 1:20 in the afternoon, a cigar-shaped object moved through |
| the sky at terrific speed over Wilmington, North Carolina. Mrs. H. D. |
| Alspach reported that the object emitted smoke, appeared about three  |
| feet long, veered, slowed down, and then speed away toward the east   |
| at a high altitude. (Sources: Wilmington, North Carolina Morning      |

| 1951 - Niagara Falls, New York - A luminous disc with arc-shaped wings |
| rose into the sky at a very fast speed. It was seen by several        |
| military witnesses for 35 seconds at 11:20 p.m. This case is a        |
| Project Blue Book "unknown." (Source: Project Blue Book files counted |

| 1952 - South of Chorwon, Korea - At 4:20 a.m. pilot Hufberry turned    |
| his F-94 jet to descend and intercept a round, bluish white UFO. The  |
| F-94's radar locked onto the object, whereupon the UFO made a left    |
| turn climb, silhouetting the F-94 against the dawn sky. The UFO       |
| accelerated away after the fighter jet made two unsuccessful attempts |
| to pass the UFO. (Source: Richard F. Haines, Advanced Aerial Devices  |

| 1955 - At 11 o'clock in the morning on the farm of Messr. Coulange,   |
| in Puy St. Gulmier, France a 1.1 meter (5 feet) in diameter luminous  |
| white disc hovered vertically only a few meters away from the         |
| 74-year-old farmer, and only three meters from the ground. Many       |
| multi-colored filaments of light radiated from the UFO. The object    |
| rose up, went over the old man's head, and flew out of sight behind   |
| some nearby woods. (Source: Jimmy Guieu, Flying Saucers Come from     |

| 1957 - At 7:17 a.m. a British Airways airliner flying over Kent,      |
| England experienced radio and radar failure when a UFO was sighted.   |

| 1959 - A man named Priest sighted a reddish orange object with a      |
| tapering tail fly over Port Elliot, South Australia at 6:13 a.m. It   |
| moved from west to east at 25 degrees elevation in southern sky.      |

| 1961 - At noon on this day over Toompang, New South Wales, Australia  |
| five men watched a large object hover in the sky while four           |
| delta-shaped objects exited and maneuvered around it for over an      |
| hour. They finally rejoined it and the large craft flew away.         |

| 1967 - On the 31st of May in 1967 a farm woman living outside of Beausejour, |
| Manitoba, Canada (about 45 miles from Winnipeg) was sitting on her    |
| front porch at 11:30 p.m. waiting for her husband to return home. She |
| saw a brilliant red light with a smaller blue light beside it come    |
| towards her from the south. The light lit up the ground and appeared  |
| to land. She became frightened and ran inside her house. The next     |
| morning she and her husband went out to investigate where the object  |
| had landed. They found a 30 by 50 yard semi-circular area that was    |
| still in flames. The strange fact about this case is that on June     |
| 15th the area was still smoldering, despite considerable rain having  |
| fallen in the area. Radioactive soil was found at the site. (Sources: |

| 1969 - On this night a large sphere flew erratically in the sky over  |
| Sao Paulo, Brazil. It released a smaller sphere which flew away.      |
| Several witnesses reported that their cars failed during the          |
| sighting, including both the lights and motor. (Source: Mark          |

| 1971 - In 1971 at 1:10 in the afternoon, two witnesses In Newmarket, New     |
| Hampshire sighted a grayish white ovoid object, hovering in an        |
| upright orientation a few feet above the ground. It had dark          |
| portholes around its perimeter, and was in plain view in front of     |
| some trees for a few minutes before shooting straight up and out of   |
| sight. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs Interplanetary Visitors.      |

| 1972 - Mr. Reeve, a man in his fifties, was driving in the fog in     |
| Mannum, South Australia at 6:35 a.m. when he came across a dark       |
| oval-shaped object with a red light on one side, a white light on     |
| theother, hanging just above the ground. He stopped his car, and the  |
| object rose into the fog with a "swish" sound. (Source: Keith         |
| Basterfield, UFO Research South Australia, case SA72002).             |
|                                                                       |
| 1974 - In 1974 the strange events began early in the morning for a young     |
| married couple traveling from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to South Africa |
| via Fort Victoria and Beit Bridge. Peter and Frances saw what they    |
| thought was a policeman holding a walkie-talkie radio about 10        |
| kilometers south of Umvuma. This is what he seemed to be to Peter,    |
| who was driving his Peugeot 404 well in excess of the posted speed    |
| limit. As the road was noted for speed traps, he slowed down. The     |
| pair of them began to think in more detail about the policeman. The   |
| metallic-looking suit seemed queer for a policeman, as they normally  |
| wore khaki. The UFO appeared at 2:30 a.m. on the passenger side of    |
| the car (left hand side). It appeared fairly close and seemed to keep |
| pace with the car. For a brief while they wondered if it might be a   |
| helicopter. It had a bluish tinge, and was flashing bright and steady |
| for 5 seconds, then off for 2 seconds.                                |
|                                                                       |
| The car headlights began to fade next, and there was an immense light |
| around the car. As they drove along it suddenly became very cold in   |
| the car. They estimated the drop in temperature to have been between  |
| 20 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit, down to less than 50º F. Peter took his |
| foot off the accelerator but the car continued to move forward at an  |
| accelerated speed! He tried to apply the brakes but it had no effect, |
| and his steering had no effect on the direction of the car as well.   |
|                                                                       |
| When they were some 10 km from Fort Victoria the UFO shot off like a  |
| shooting star, but it reappeared again about 10 kilometers outside of |
| the city, but this time they also saw a second UFO move into position |
| above the car. Frances fell asleep around 6:15 a.m. just before she   |
| feel asleep they lost all sound from the radio. Peter lost all track  |
| of time and he remembered nothing from about three minutes after      |
| Frances fell asleep. He felt at the time he must have been mesmerized |
| by the road.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| At the Customs post at the South African border showed 8:30 a.m.      |
| although their watches indicated it was only 7:30 a.m. Peter was also |
| surprised when reading the car's trip odometer. He had reset it to    |
| zero at Fort Victoria, but found that it had recorded only 17 km, yet |
| the distance by road was 288 km. He had also filled the gas tank in   |
| Fort Victoria and expected to need a full tank when he reached the    |
| border, but when he tried to fill the tank it would take only 22      |
| cents worth, which at the time was less than a half gallon. Under     |
| hypnosis Frances had no other experiences revealed than those she     |
| remembered consciously. Peter, however recalled seeing the inside of  |
| the "spacecraft" which had three levels, and interacting with         |
| physical beings that he believed could take on any appearance that he |
| wanted them to look like. (Sources: Carl van Vlierden, "Escorted by   |

| 1975 - At around 9 p.m. an octagonal flying object with an            |
| illuminated cross-member, moved very slowly through the sky city sky  |
| above London, England. It then vanished while still in view. It was   |
| reported by a married couple named Fry. (Source: Jenny Randles, FSR,  |

| 1976 - A 17-year-old man named T. White saw a 5 foot, 6 inch tall     |
| humanoid in his backyard in Daw Park, South Australia at around 2:00  |
| a.m. The being wore a silver coverall suit with white boots, a black  |
| visor helmet, and had a box strapped to its chest. It flew into a     |

| wiring was effected. Unintelligible language was heard as well.       |

| 1984 - A V-shaped formation of ten to fifteen red lights flew over    |
| the Hudson Valley on this night and was seen from several locations.  |
| At 8:15 p.m. a V-Shaped formation of 15 lights, estimated to be the   |
| size of a Boeing 747 airliner if all connected to one object, passed  |
| directly over the home of an IBM engineer in Hawthorne, Westchester   |
| County, New York. It made no sound as it passed overhead except a     |
| faint humming. All lights simultaneously turned blue, and then made a |
| tight 180-degree turn and flew off to the north. At 8:30 p.m. the     |
| same or a similar object was seen from Route 117 in Pleasantville,    |
| New York. It was reported to be larger than a football field, and it  |
| followed a car being driven on the Taconic Parkway. At 8:45 p.m. the  |
| lights were seen by Mr. D. Boyd in Yorktown, New York. An engineer    |
| and private pilot, he watched them turn and fly away toward the west. |
| V-shaped or triangular UFOs were also sighted later that night in     |
| Fishkill and south Putnam County. (Source: Philip Imbrogno,           |

| 1994 - At 2:30 a.m. Mr. Oringdulph of Alamosa, Colorado - the witness |
