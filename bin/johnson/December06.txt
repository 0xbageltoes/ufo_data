| 1952 -  At 5:25 a.m. five blue objects buzzed a B-29 flying at 5000   |
| mph off the Louisiana coast, then merged with a huge object that was  |
| a half-inch blip on radar screen. The huge object shot away at 9,000  |
| mph. The entire incident lasted ten minutes. (Sources: James          |

| object hovered low over the horizon in Salvador, Bahia state, Brazil. |
| It split in half. One half descended while heading to the south,      |
| while the other half hovered in place. That same day in the           |

| 1971 - Following a pre-arranged date with some mysterious entities,   |
| the well known stage psychic Uri Geller and physicist Andrijah        |
| Puharich drove to the appointed place near Tel Aviv, Israel around    |
| 10:00 p.m. There they saw a bluish light pulsating over a small       |
| square of open field. Geller felt an irresistible attraction towards  |
| the light. They left the car and heard a cicada-like electronic       |
| noise. Geller remembered asking Puharich and another witness, named   |
| Iris, to wait there and he set off towards the pulsating light. As he |
| approached it he felt like he was entering some sort of trance.       |
| Everything became completely silent around him and he felt like he    |
| had entered some type of "vacuum." The very air had changed quality.  |
| He then remembered seeing a strange "building" or UFO having no       |
| discernible shape whatsoever. Soon a shapeless dark figure parted     |
| from the strange building and approached him, then put something in   |
| his hand. Geller felt a sudden feeling of fear and ran back to        |
| Andrijah and Iris. Before he reached them he realized what was in his |
| hand: it was the very same pen that had mysteriously vanished from    |
| their experiment box. (Sources: Andrijah Puharich, Uri Geller; David  |

| 1973 -  Beginning at around 7:45 a.m., an airliner was delayed from   |
| landing three times because of nocturnal lights and radar returns     |
| from all over the area of Pisa, Italy for 30 minutes. One of these    |
| lights flew off rapidly to the northwest. (Source: Lumieres dans la   |

| 1973 -  At 6:45 p.m. in the mountains five kilometers southeast of    |
| Fabregues, France two teenagers discovered a 12 meter wide            |
| disc-shaped object resting on four legs on the ground. It had a       |
| bright dome or "blister" on top. A door in the craft opened and a     |
| ladder unrolled. The witnesses fled and the UFO took off, making a    |
| humming sound. It pursued the witnesses for awhile, then flew off to  |
| the southwest. Four imprints were found in the ground at the landing  |
| site. They were arranged in a 1.3 meter square with a central burn    |
| mark. (Sources: newspaper clipping dated December 22, 1973; Fred I.   |

| 1973 -  A burglar alarm went off in a house in La Selva Beach in      |
| Santa Cruz, California around 5 a.m. Appliances in house started      |
| operating and kept rhythm with the lights flashing on a UFO outside;  |
| the freezer in particular surged when the lights on the UFO became    |

| and orange. (Source: James A. Harder, APRO Bulletin, November-December |

| 1976 -  John Brady and Ronald Pullman were driving home to Milford,   |
| Delaware at 3:30 a.m. and were at a place called Slaughter Neck when  |
| they saw two tall figures in an adjacent cornfield, about 100 yards   |
| away. The two giant humanoid figures were maybe 8 or 9 feet tall, and |
| standing close together as though they were hugging. They appeared to |
| be of a pine green color. No traces could be found the next day.      |

| 1976 - At 5:30 a.m. a married couple were heading west on Sterling    |
| Road in Davie, Florida to drop off his two children, ages 4 and 1 ½   |
| years, at a local daycare center. As he was passing a bicyclist he    |
| noticed a fireball in the northwest sky falling fast. After a minute  |
| the husband pulled over and shut off the car, to say a prayer because |
| he thought he had seen an airplane crashing. He sat there for several |
| minutes, then he and his wife observed a huge dull, grayish metallic  |
| object that was heading slowly towards them. The object was immense,  |
| made no sound, nor emit any smoke or exhaust that could be noticeable |
| from thermal fluctuations of the air around it. The object appeared   |
| to be oblong or cigar-shaped, more than 250 feet long and more than   |
| 30 feet high. There seemed to be some sort of whitish light atop and  |
| a light at each end, front and rear but not white.                    |
|                                                                       |
| As it approached their vehicle his wife leaned her upper body out of  |
| the window to look up at it, while he watched it from behind the      |
| windshield inside. As they kept asking what it was, he noticed that   |
| the entire interior of the car had become illuminated. He then also   |
| noticed that his four-year old daughter leaning on the back window    |
| looking up. He then looked at his interior light and saw that it was  |
| not lit. He again looked out his side window and it was still pitch   |
| black outside the car. He did his best to get a fix on the structure  |
| of the craft, that was now less than 50 feet from them. The surface   |
| did not appear to be metallic at all, but it had a rough, sandy       |
| texture similar to that of shark skin. He could not locate any seams  |
| on it or anything that would suggest conventional construction        |
| methods.                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| The object became stationary and they sat staring at it for minutes.  |
| Then he saw a small, child-like figure fun in front of the headlights |
| from the left. It started to climb over the metal road barrier, but   |
| hesitated and turned toward him. It wore no shoes, belt, tools,       |
| weapons, or any other accessories. His first thought was to jump out  |
| and grab the being to throw it in the car trunk, but a mental voice   |
| told him not to move or he would be harmed. He tried to lift his arm  |
| and was horrified because it looked like it was cut off where the     |
| light ended inside the car. He looked again at the small figure again |
| and had the thought that he could easily overpower it. A voice again  |
| warned him that the stretch cloth suit the figure was wearing carried |
| 40,000 volts of piezo-electrical current. The small being then hopped |
| over a fence and entered a field of a horse farm. His last memory of  |
| the incident was of looking behind his car and seeing a somewhat      |
| different shaped object about one mile south of his location, moving  |
| slowly at first but then accelerating so fast that it appeared to     |
| just vaporize. He then drove off without speaking another word to his |
| wife, and at the daycare center they realized that they had been at   |
| the site for over 40 minutes. He also lost his eyesight for almost    |
| two days after the incident. The witness also claims that, after      |
| several years of nightmares, he discovered that the occupants of the  |
| craft he had seen were from a parallel universe. (Sources: Peter      |

| 1977 - Along the coast of Tatapouri, New Zealand a red disc-shaped    |
| object came in over the land from the direction of the sea and        |
| followed a car with three female passengers along Highway 35 for a    |
| mile until they stopped the car, causing the car headlights to dim    |
| during its pursuit. The car's new battery had no water remaining in   |
| it after the close encounter. (Sources: Allan Hendry, International   |

| 1978 - In the isolated taiga in the Amur region of Siberia between    |
| the rivers Urkan and Tyndoy, a metallic UFO shaped like a mushroom    |
| was found on this day, apparently having crashed. Its diameter was    |
| about 5.5 to 6 meters and it was about 3.0 meters in height. It       |
| reportedly weighed 720 kg. It was transported to Novosibirsk, Russia  |
| where it was hidden in the Akademgorodok region. The body of a short  |
| dwarf-like humanoid was found inside, which was delivered for autopsy |
| to the scientific research institute in Novosibirsk. When first       |
| discovered the humanoid allegedly still had shown vital signs, and it |
| stayed in a coma-like state for two weeks before dying. A segmented   |
| aperture was found on the side of the disc where apparently other     |
| crewmembers had escaped out through an escape pod. (Source: Albert S. |

| 1978 -  At 6:30 a.m. three lights in a triangular pattern were seen   |
| in the sky over Avezzano, Abruzzi, Italy at the same time that a      |
| delta-shaped object was spotted on the ground. EM effects were noted. |
| At the landing site on some farm land there were later found some     |
| burnt areas and deep ground marks in the soil. (Source: Lumieres dans |

| 1978 - Mrs. Pilar Martinez de Arregui opened the windows in her home  |
| in Alegria de Alava, Spain at 12:40 a.m. in order to relax after a    |
| long day, as her husband slept in the nearby bedroom. She spied a     |
| strong orange light reflected from the glassware inside the house.    |
| She investigated and found that the source of the light was in a      |
| nearby field, but the light had gradually disappeared. Temporarily    |
| forgetting about the mystery light, Pilar began doing some housework, |
| when a second more powerful orange flash of light again brought her   |
| attention outside. She saw a orange sphere object approaching from    |
| the sky at very high speed. Afraid, she ran and turned off all the    |
| lights in the house. Outside the object had now landed some 100       |
| meters from the house. The craft was oval in shape appeared to        |
| balance itself just above the ground. Crouching behind her window she |
| peered out and noticed a light like a flashlight that was being       |
| carried by two tall and very corpulent humanoid figures. Pilar        |
| noticed that the humanoids wore tight-fitting one-piece coveralls,    |
| very light in color. They had just appeared standing next to the      |
| landed object; they had not emerged from any opening, they had just   |
| sudden appeared. Both beings began approaching the house. For several |
| minutes she watched them move around through partially opened blinds. |
| Finally, she decided she would bathe and then go to bed. Later,       |
| feeling nervous, she got up from bed and looked again to see the      |
| object rise and emit a sharp whirring sound. It quickly disappeared   |
| from view. Investigators found unusual tracks at the landing site.    |

| 1978 - At 11:00 p.m. a 26-year-old night watchman, Fortunato          |
| Zanfretta, was patrolling a housing development in Marzano Di         |
| Torriglia, Genova, Italy when he noticed some moving "torch lights"   |
| coming from a nearby courtyard. He tried to radio his headquarters    |
| but the two-way radio would not work. Armed with a pistol and a       |
| flashlight he entered the courtyard to search the area. He was        |
| suddenly pushed from behind and fell. He got up and was confronted by |
| a huge, three-meter tall reptilian "creature." The witness was by now |
| terrified and he dropped his flashlight and ran towards the car. He   |
| then saw a bright yellow, triangular shaped craft take off from       |
| behind a house. He called for help and was later found unconscious at |
| the site by the other guards. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled      |
| being taken into a very bright room by giant beings that put a        |
| painful helmet on his head. The beings were described as green        |
| skinned with yellow triangular eyes, red veins on their heads, and    |
| pointed ears. He suffered from persistent headaches after the event.  |

| 1978 - A security guard at the local hydroelectric plant in           |
| Marimbonda near Fronteira, Brazil was at his guardhouse on top of the |
| dam at 10:30 p.m. when he noticed some lights shining down on the     |
| water surface. He went out to investigate and noticed a luminous      |
| circular object approach from across the river. The object came       |
| closer and began to hover close to the ground near the power station. |
| The guard could see a door and a small window on the UFO. The window  |
| opened and a human face looked out at the witness. The craft's door   |
| then opened and three tall men came out. These men wore shiny         |
| metallic blue coveralls and all had very long, smooth black hair. The |
| beings approached the guard and spoke to him in an unintelligible     |
| language. He panicked and tried to fire a warning shot into the air   |
| with his revolver, but it jammed. One of the men then went inside the |
| UFO and came back out holding a black box and handed it to one of the |
| others. After that the witness was able to understand the beings and  |
| was told they were here on a "research and study mission." At one     |
| point one of the men started collecting stones from the ground and    |
| the witness protested. The men then put away the box and calmly       |
| walked back into their craft, which left silently and at high speed.  |
