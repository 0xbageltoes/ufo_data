| 1872 - At King's Sutton in Banbury, England an object resembling a    |
| haystack flew on an irregular course at one o'clock in the morning.   |
| Sometimes flying very high, sometimes very low, it was accompanied by |
| fire and dense smoke. It produced much the same effect as a tornado,  |
| felling trees and walls. It vanished suddenly. (Source: Jacques       |

| 1896 - A large airship flew over the small town of Camptonville, Yuba |
| County,California and landed nearby at 9:00 p.m. Five men went out to |
| investigate, and found the ship with its sole occupant, a bearded man |
| who appeared to be deaf and mute. Some written communication was      |
| attempted, in response the man produced an "alphabet" and spelled out |
| a message saying he lived in the Montezuma Mountains with his wife    |
| and two children. He declined to answer any further questions, so the |
| five men left. The craft was seen flying off the next day. (Sources:  |

| 1951 - At 8:15 a.m. an Atomic Energy Commission guard named Collins   |
| at the Oak Ridge Nuclear Research Facility in Tennessee sighted a     |
| "canvas colored" square object, estimated to be 20 feet wide, that    |
| moved up and down twice. The case remained unexplained by the Air     |
| Force. (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in official           |

| 1951 - A pilot trainer and his student, flying in an aeronca 65CV     |
| airplane over Torrance, California sighted a shiny metallic           |
| football-shaped object in the sky at 10:21 a.m. The object seemed to  |
| be stationary at first, then it moved away. (Source: Dominique        |

| 1954 - A 26-year-old man riding a bicycle near a farm in              |
| Gainchurizqueta, Irun, Spain saw an object land nearby. It came from  |

| meters. It was round, three meters in diameter, with a headlight and  |
| four fins. Traces: ground marks and metallic samples. (Source:        |

| seven minutes. A Project Blue Book "unidentified" case. (Sources:     |

| 1966 - On this night four women driving on Route 33 near Gallipolis,  |
| Ohio--the town just across the Ohio River from Point Pleasant, West   |
| Virginia--saw a brownish silver humanoid flying creature with glowing |
| red eyes. (Sources: John A. Keel, FSR, July-August 1968, p. 13; David |

| 1967 - On this evening near El Paso, Texas William C. Collins         |
| observed an unidentified object hovering about 200 feet in the air.   |

| 1970 - After finding huge mysterious footprints on their property in  |
| Vader, Washington three days before, a family watched a very bright   |
| object approach their house at 7:15 a.m. It seemed to have a central  |
| dome with a revolving ring around it and was deep orange in the       |
| center. The craft tilted slightly to one side, hovered briefly over   |
| some nearby power lines, then brightened while making a low sweep     |
| over the area. Two of the witnesses saw what appeared to be a gray    |
| colored "shape" drop from the object and scurry away into the woods   |
| before the UFO departed. Later that week a mysterious dark "prowler"  |
| was seen peering through windows. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |

| 1972 - A married couple named Willis saw a cylindrical light hovering |
| while driving in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey at 8:50 p.m. It moved     |
| into some nearby woods as their car approached. Ground traces and a   |
| missing plug of earth were found in the woods, at the suspected       |
| landing site. (Sources: Atlantic City Press, December 13, 1972;       |

| 1977 - In Tatapouri, New Zealand a red, disc-shaped object came over  |
| land from the direction of the sea at 7:30 p.m. It followed a car     |
| with three people inside. The headlights on the car dimmed but did    |
| not go out during the sighting, which ended when the UFO veered off   |
| into the sky. When the witnesses arrived home, they found the car's   |
| battery had no water in it, even though it had been serviced only two |
| days prior to the sighting. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports      |
