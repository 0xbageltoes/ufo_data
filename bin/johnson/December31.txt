| 1954 - At ten minutes after midnight, four men in a forest in         |
| Camaqua, Brazil in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, saw a 30-meter     |
| wide disc stop and hover silently one meter above the ground. A human |
| looking occupant got out of the craft and walked around it with a     |
| lamp of some kind. (Source: Felipe Machado Carrion, Phenomenes        |

| 1958 - Two men in their late 40s, Srs. Salas and Acosta, watched a    |
| cylindrical object with a pointed end shoot straight up in the sky at |
| 11:55 p.m. in Umbrete, Sevilla province, Spain. A moment later, when  |
| one of them opened the door of the truck in which they had been       |
| driving, a second object-two meters long-shot up from the ground.     |

| 1971 - On this evening in 1971 in Tulancingo, Mexico in the State of         |
| Hidalgo, Sra. Ochones saw a domed disc land 50 meters away, making a  |
| “sizzling” sound. A door opened in the craft and several beings       |
| emerged from a red illuminated interior. They wore white coveralls    |
| with tight-fitting hoods, and spent a short period of time collecting |
| soil samples. The ground marks at the landing site included 3 leg     |
| marks and 2 skids. (Source: Saga 1973 UFO Special, p. 32).            |

| 1972 - In Veteli, Finland in 1972 a dark form appeared at 7:30 p.m. and a    |
| “force field” threw a girl a distance of three meters. Another girl   |
| witnessed the event. Five hours later, at 11:30 p.m. on a highway in  |
| Hinojos, Spain a fiery square-shaped flying object flew close to the  |
| ground and lit up the surrounding terrain. The headlights in two      |
| cars, carrying a total of four witnesses, died. The car with the      |
| gasoline-powered engine also stalled, but the diesel-powered engine   |
| of the other car kept running. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, April |
| 1975 and issue 133).                                                  |

| 1973 - At 7:00 a.m. on highway 347 between Lens and La Bassee in      |
| Pas-de-Calais, France Mr. Liefooghe had a close encounter with two    |
| UFOs. He came upon a disc-shaped object on the road, and he watched a |
| cigar-shaped UFO land in a vertical position. He did not stay around  |
| but came back later with investigators, who found ground marks and    |
| small footprints. At five a.m. CST another cigar-shaped object with   |
| two small wings approached a home in La Grange, Illinois rapidly from |
| the west. The object was self-luminous and appeared solid, and passed |
| low over the treetops. At 4:20 p.m. Pacific Standard Time a           |
| photograph of a luminous UFO was taken in Spokane, Washington and the |
| event was witnessed by two families. At 10:30 p.m. Mountain Standard  |
| Time, on a highway near a farm east of Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada  |
| a man saw a bright light in his rearview mirror. It looked like the   |
| revolving light on a train, except there were no railroad tracks in   |
| the vicinity. He then noticed an eight-foot tall giant running in a   |
| ditch alongside the truck at speeds up to 60 mph. The being touched   |
| the hood and roof of the truck before being out-distanced. (Sources:  |

| 1976 - On this night in Bristol, Wales, UK Ken, an off-duty           |
| policeman, was driving home after his work shift and was passing the  |
| entrance gate of a research facility when he saw an 8 to 9 foot tall  |
| "spaceman" being. The being was wearing a one-piece suit and a helmet |
| with a black visor over his eyes. Ken had no idea what he was looking |
| at, so he drove straight home, arriving there in a state of shock.    |
| Although he told his wife, who did not believe him, he did not make   |
| an official report because he feared professional repercussions. The  |
| next day, he learned from reading the local newsapaper that two other |
| people reported seeing a "spaceman" looking into their car in         |
| Chilcomb, near Winchester, England after their car engine failed.     |

| 1978 - In the early morning hours of this day in 1978, at shortly after      |
| midnight, a famous motion picture film was taken by a news crew while |
| flying off the eastern coast of South Island, New Zealand near the    |
| town of Kaikoura. The luminous UFO was seen by everyone on board the  |
| aircraft and was tracked by radar at the same time. It was somewhat   |
| cone shaped, and was not a Japanese shrimp fishing boat, as claimed   |
| by debunkers. (Sources: International UFO Reporter, July 1979, p. 6;  |
| APRO Bulletin, May 1980, p. 2).                                       |

| 1978 - There were several other UFO reports from around the world on  |
| this day, from Brazil, England, Scotland, Italy, Switzerland, and     |
| Florida. In Mirrasol, Sao Paulo State, Brazil a man was walking home  |
| around 11:00 p.m. when he heard a noise and noticed a light           |
| approaching from behind while crossing the street. He stepped aside,  |
| thinking that it was a car, but he then realized that it was a huge   |
| yellowish light that was attached to the bottom of a large flying     |
| object. He was suddenly struck by a beam of light and lost            |
| consciousness. Later, he found himself inside the object, next to a   |
| corridor. He next noticed three short humanoid creatures who spoke    |
| among themselves in a strange incomprehensible language. The beings   |
| wore helmets and coveralls and their faces were covered in a green    |
| light. Their eyes resembled two simple holes, lacking eyelids or      |
| eyebrows. He apparently then blacked out again, and arrived home at   |
| 3:30 a.m. without any further recollection of the event. (Source:     |
| Walter K. Buhler, Guilheme Pereira, and Ney Matiel Peres, UFO         |
| Abduction at Mirassol).                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1978 - In Posada, Italy at one o’clock in the morning, a 3-meter in   |
| diameter glowing sphere appeared over a marsh. It had dark triangular |
| spots that moved back and forth on the surface of the object. In      |
| Bayford, England Mr. and Mrs. Mason sighted a cigar-shaped object at  |
| 7:00 p.m. moving silently through the sky from the west to the east.  |
| The UFO had a long body with lots of tiny lights. Before losing sight |
| of it two strong lights came on, one in the middle and one at the     |
| end. At the same time a silver triangle crossed the sky from west to  |
| east in Carlisle, England in Cumbria. Two minutes later a triangle    |
| with a grayish hue crossed the sky from west to east in Edinborough,  |
| Scotland, and three minutes after that another huge triangle was seen |
| flying in the same direction over Hull, England. (Sources: Maurizio   |

| 1978 - One hour after the multiple UFO flyovers in Great Britain, at  |
| three p.m. EST three men saw a silver disc hovering only one block    |
| away from one of their residences in Homestead, Florida. Mr.          |
| Betancourt, age 37, described the UFO as being between 40-50 feet in  |
| diameter and having no visible engine or wings, and making no noise.  |
| It hovered over a neighbor’s backyard for about 30 seconds before     |
| flying off. At 10:00 p.m. European time in Zermatt, Switzerland two   |
| people witnessed a luminous round object over the alpine glacier,     |
| brightly illuminating the ice. Later that night, at 2:30 a.m. the     |
| next morning, a big electrical power outage occurred in the city.     |
| (Sources: Dade News-Leader, January 3, 1979; Larry Hatch, U computer  |
| database, case 13046).                                                |
|                                                                       |
| 1980 - Near Sacramento, California the main witness, John, was        |
| driving on California Highway 5 heading toward Sacramento. Shortly    |
| after 10:00 p.m. he spotted a large, dark object coming toward him    |
| and moving slowly, left to right. The object passed him, but when he  |
| looked behind him it was no longer in sight. "I have to see what this |
| is," he thought to himself and he intended to pull over at the same   |
| time that he started to feel groggy and his truck's engine began      |
| sputtering. He experienced a period of missing time, and the next     |
| thing he remembered was that he felt he had just awakened from sleep, |
| although he was driving with both hands on the steering wheel. It     |
| struck him as odd that all the holiday traffic was gone and no other  |
| vehicles were on the roadway. Thinking only a few minutes had passed, |
| he called his girlfriend to tell her about his unusual experience,    |
| and was surprised that she was angry with him because he had been out |
| of touch for nearly three hours. It was already 1:00 a.m. on New      |
| Years Day.                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| (Continued.) In 1992 John underwent hypnotic regression, and was able to remember  |
| some of what had happened to him during his missing time episode. He  |
| remembered being led somewhere by hand, and having no control.        |
| Whoever was leading him seemed to have all the control. John became   |
| very agitated as they wanted him to look at something and he didn't   |
| want to. Becoming even more agitated and crying, he remembered that   |
| the aliens were showing him tanks and he didn't want to be there.     |
| John could not bear to look at what was being shown to him, and it    |
| took two more hypnotic regression sessions to get through his block   |
| and remember what he had been looking at. John described a small baby |
| floating in some type of hearvier-than-water fluid. Tearfully, he     |
| described one of "them" saying this particular baby was his and that  |
| he had to show it some love. John recalled, "They are saying, I am    |
| here for a reason, there are a number of them telling me it's my      |
| child, to love it, to feel love for that baby. I need to connect;     |
| they tell me it will help the baby feel part of something. I can't    |
| believe this is happening!" After showing John "his baby", the beings |
| escorted him to another romm he described as "clean, sterile and      |
| bright, with a long table in the middle." John began crying again and |
| said, "I'm telling them I don't want to do this again." He recalled   |
| the aliens telling him that they were just going to take a sample. He |
| became more agitated and repeated twice, "It's not right what they    |
| are doing...it's not right!" (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1980         |

| 1982 - In Kent Cliffs, New York in the lower Hudson River Valley a    |
| police officer and his wife spotted a delta-shaped UFO making a       |
| faint, low frequency hum at 11:54 p.m. The colored lights on the      |
| object switched off and three bright white lights lit up the ground.  |
| He was able to shoot some movie film of the UFO, but the images are   |
| of low quality. (Source: J. Allen Hynek & Phil Imbrogno, Night Siege: |

| 1984 - In Level Green, Pennsylvania in the UFO hotspot of             |
| Westmoreland County, two residents of the community heard a tapping   |
| sound on one of their house windows at 6:10 p.m. They saw what looked |
| like an eye-like orb peering in through the window. It turn and flew  |
| away, but repeated the performance one more time. (Source: MUFON UFO  |
| Journal, June 1985).                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| 1989 - After 11:00 p.m. Victor Seminskiy was walking home from a      |
| local farm to the hamlet where he lived in Artyemovka, Kharkov        |
| region, Ukraine when he saw a UFO descending over him. He next felt   |
| the air squeezing him, as if in a vacuum, and he saw an extremely     |
| bright light envelope him and a lattice-like structure surround him.  |
| He was next pulled up into the UFO, and the next thing he remembers   |
| he was unexpectedly next to his house. He thought that only 15        |
| minutes had passed, but he had actually been missing for two hours.   |
| Most of his memory of the abduction experience had apparently been    |
| repressed or erased, but the witness refused any hypnotic regression  |
| to aid him in recovering his memories of the experience. Victor's     |
| wife reportedly confirmed the experience. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, |
| 1989 Humanoid Contact Sighting Reports, citing Vladimir S. Mantulin,  |

| 1990 - In the middle of the afternoon in Taszar, Hungary an aircraft  |
| mechanic was approached by a strange man and woman riding in a        |
| totally black van with blacked out windows. The strangers seemed to   |
| be human, but were also able to read the witness's mind. The          |
| strangers left, but later that night the witness was approached by a  |
| reddish-yellow light the size of a football, at a height of about 2.5 |
| m. Terrified, he first two shots at the object, which quickly         |
| vanished from sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1990 Humanoid        |
| Contact sighting reports, citing Kriston Endre, RYUFOR Foundation     |

| 1990 - In Karaganda, Kazakhstan local resident Maksim Abramtsev was   |
| at home watching the New Years Eve celebrations on television when he |
| glanced out the window and saw the strange face of an unknown entity  |
| staring in the window at him. Afraid, he jumped up and ran outside    |
| into the street. There he saw several "men" or humanoids walking      |
| toward a globe-shaped object. The object was hovering low over the    |
| ground, and Maksim felt a strong fear after watching this scene, and  |
| ran and hid behind the door on his porch. Moments later, the globe    |
| ascended into the air, flying low over the ground, then stopped and   |
| hovered in the air for a brief moment before shooting away at high    |
| speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1990 Humanoid Contact sighting     |

| 1992 - A woman walking outside her home in San Antonio, Texas saw a   |
| huge, gray metallic disc drop straight down from the clouds. It made  |
| a buzzing noise. It altered its shaped to that of a sphere with four  |
| legs and landed. Under hypnosis it was revealed that she experienced  |
| an abduction aboard the craft, in which she was given a medical exam  |
| by pale, human-looking men. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid     |

| 1993 - An object that looked like a globe on a pedestal followed two  |
| people in a car for several kilometers near the shoreline in Yanchep, |
| Western Australia at around one o’clock in the morning, before flying |
| off. The same or a similar object was seen in Brazil that day. At     |
| 1:40 a.m. local time a huge, silent, light bulb shaped UFO with       |
| bright lights and a flat bottom, flew over the city of Quixada, Ceara |
| State, Brazil. (Sources: UFO Newsclipping Service, March 1994;        |

| 2000 - A bedroom visitation of possibly a holographic figure occurred |
| at four o’clock in the morning in Kingsville, Texas. The witness      |
| reported that a humanoid figure and a blue light passed through a     |
| skylight and materialized inside the bedroom. The figure and the blue |
| light disappeared at the same time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,       |

| 2001 - In the evening of this day in Pasadena, Texas a man reported   |
| seeing a huge rectangular object, an estimated 300 meters in length,  |
| about ten miles away. The UFO hung vertically in the sky at only a    |
| few hundred feet altitude, and had several white lights inside a red  |
| rectangular outer rim. (Source: George A. Filer, MUFON UFO Journal,   |
