| 1946 - A big noise was heard at 4:30 a.m. Huge "'projectiles" like    |
| rockets made a whistling sound as several of them flew overhead in    |
| the town of Bourges, Cher Department, France. Many people were        |
| awakened by the noise. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 151).  |

| 1947 - On this day three mountain climbers on Snoqualmie Pass,        |
| Washington saw a semi-transparent saucer-shaped object that made a    |
| buzzsaw sound. Very fast and near witnesses. (Source: Larry Hatch, U  |

| 1952 - A man driving through some woods at 6:00 a.m. in Frontenac,    |
| Kansas encountered a strange object and stopped to watch it. It       |
| looked like two turtle shells glued together and was about 25 meters  |
| long. There appeared to be a humanoid being in something like a       |
| control cabin in front. Windows on the object were lit by an intense  |
| blue light and a throbbing sound was also reported. The object was    |
| oscillating and suddenly flew straight up with a strong humming       |
| noise. The middle section supported what looked like propellers. The  |
| object hovered three meters above the ground. (Sources: Project Blue  |

| 1952 - Levelland, Texas. 9:30 p.m., 10:30 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. Elmer     |
| Sharp. One object, shaped like a spinning top, changing color from    |
| red to yellow to blue, and with a fiery tail, hovered for 20 minutes, |
| whistling, then flew away. It, or another like it, returned an hour   |
| later. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).         |

| 1954 - Egilstadir, Iceland. At 8:30 p.m. a farmer saw a small         |
| cylindrical flying object, 2-2.5 feet long and 4-5 feet in diameter   |
| that made a loud whizzing sound. It flew straight, level and fast;    |
| then slowed down and fell into a sandbar. (Source: Don Berliner,      |

| 1966 - At ten o'clock in the evening an airman at Minot Air Force     |
| Base, North Dakota observed and reported by radio a multi-colored     |
| light high in the sky. A strike team was sent to his location and     |
| confirmed the presence of the unknown object. A second object, white  |
| in color, was seen to pass in front of the clouds. At the radar base  |
| an object was detected and tracked. The observations lasted nearly    |
| four hours and were confirmed by three different missile sites. Radio |
| interference was noted by teams sent to locations where the object    |
| was sometimes described as hovering at ground level. (Source: Jacques |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case 791).        |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 5:00 p.m. a motorcyclist named Ron Hyde was riding on the   |
| Sydney to Melbourne highway between New South Wales and Victoria,     |
| Australia when he was suddenly engulfed in a bluish-white light that  |
| so dazzling he had to stop, near Wodonga, Victoria. He then saw a     |
| metallic object on or near the ground 30 meters away. Its shape was   |
| like that of two lens-shaped saucers on top of each other, with a     |
| dome on top. It was silvery on top but  the lower half was dark gray, |
| and it was about 10 meters in diameter. It also bore a black mark or  |
| insignia. Next to it appeared two human figures about 1.5 meters      |
| tall, wearing silvery coveralls and opaque helmets. A gesture from    |
| them scared the witness, who drove away but was subsequently followed |
| by the object. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A       |

| 1970 - At 10:00 a.m. a small object the size of a car tire landed in  |
| front of the school in Rawang Selangor, Malaysia. It was shaped like  |
| a turtle shell and had five small windows. Five three-inch- tall      |
| humanoids with two horn-like protrusions on their heads emerged from  |
| the craft. The humanoids rushed back into the object as a large crowd |
| gathered to watch. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| 1970 - At 6:35 a.m. three people had just arrived at a bus stop at    |
| Lindberg Boulevard and West Road in Olmstead Falls, Ohio when two     |
| strange figures approached. The two men were dressed in glowing       |
| orange suits from head to foot with only their faces uncovered. Their |
| skin was yellowish. Their headgear was conical and they were carrying |
| a disc-like object over their heads. They stood about five feet tall. |
|                                                                       |
| The beings got to within 50 feet of a house and then turned and       |
| walked away, side-by-side, to a nearby railroad crossing. They stood  |
| there for a few minutes, then walked a short distance towards the     |
| witnesses. As the witnesses boarded a bus, one of the beings extended |
| his arm upward. At this point they were able to see that the figure   |
| was wearing a cape.                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1970 - At 9:00 a.m. a nine-year-old girl saw an UFO shaped like a huge       |
| bubble come down from the sky and land near her house. Two figures    |
| appeared to have been waiting there. When the object landed they      |
| entered it. It then rose and quickly disappeared. One of the          |
| witnesses at the bus stop went back to the site that evening and      |
| found a spot where the high grass was matted and twisted. (Source:    |

| 1975 - At 5:00 a.m. in Blaine, Minnesota a 100 foot in diameter gray  |
| domed disc-shaped craft was sighted, at an estimated distance of 5    |
| miles. It flew to the south slowly, at an estimated altitude of 760   |

| 1978 - On this afternoon six children from a local school in Hamburg, |
| Germany saw a round silvery object slowly descend and land in an open |
| field. The object had two round black dots on its side. A ladder      |
| descended from the craft, and two human-like figures emerged; they    |
| wore white helmets and dark uniforms. The witnesses ran to get some   |
| help, but upon returning both the object and the figures were gone.   |

| 1978 - At 10:00 p.m. a red-orange object flew in front of a car being |
| driven by a 54-year-old woman, ten miles south of Ottumwa, Iowa.      |
| Mist, fog, and condensation were noted. The car engine died and the   |
| windshield fogged up by the close presence of the UFO. The nocturnal  |
| light then flew behind some trees, after which the engine restarted   |
| by itself. (Sources: Allen Hendry, International UFO Reporter,        |

| 1978 - At 11:40 p.m. in Ginghamsburg, Ohio two orange lights flew     |
| close to a car with two 19-year-old teenage girls as passengers,      |
| causing the engine to lose power as they drove past. The lights gave  |
| off a humming sound. One shone a light beam on the witnesses for      |
| about a second. When the witnesses looked back, the lights were gone. |

| 1978 - On this night a luminous craft descended in La Serena, Chile.  |
| It was reportedly very big in size. Two beings of human shape         |
| (perhaps the same two seen in Germany earlier in the day), paralyzed  |
| the witness. He tried to run, but fainted in the roadway. On the same |
| night eight military pilots reported they saw several UFOs maneuver   |
| in the area around their air base in Temuco, Chile. (Sources: La      |

| 1987 -  At 2:30 a.m. a house near Vejle in Denmark was illuminated    |
| from above. Three metallic disc-shaped craft with windows were seen   |
| hovering only one meter over the roof. Photos were taken but the      |
| images came out blank. The incident lasted three minutes. (Source:    |

| 1998 - Luis Cuesta Trinidad and a woman friend were camping near the  |
| shoreline on the beach in Mazagon, Extremadura, Spain. At 8:30 they   |
| were enjoying the view when they noticed a strange humanoid figure    |
| emerge from the water not far from them. The figure came out and      |
| began moving its arms in a strange fashion. At first it was standing  |
| with its back to them, but when it turned around it became aware of   |
| their presence by first noticing the flashlight being held by Luis.   |
| It took off running in a strange fashion, without bending its knees.  |
| They noticed that its head was hairless, but its body was covered     |
| with ample hair, and it had round, slightly Oriental-looking eyes     |
| that were orange in color. It was almost two meters tall, with long   |
| dangling arms and legs that looked deformed. It was very pale in      |
| color with its head was shaped like an inverted pear. It had no nose, |
| and they could not see a mouth. It was totally silent. The witnesses  |
| felt nervous during the incident. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |

| 2001 - On this evening there was a terrific meteor shower seen by     |
| many, but nothing to compare to the three black triangular UFOs seen  |
| at approximately 1:30 a.m. in Joshua Tree, California. The UFOs were  |
| seen zipping around rapidly and stopping dead in midair by a man, who |

| 2002 - A very bright white disc-shaped object traversed the sky in    |
| The Colony, Texas at four o'clock in the afternoon, about 500-700     |
| feet up, heading toward the North at a fairly fast pace. It was       |
| viewed through binoculars by a counseling psychologist and his        |
| daughter. It seemed to rotate, and changed from a disk to another     |
| shape. It was maneuvering in the sky, and no sound was detected. It   |
| was descending to the ground at a 25-degree angle. The winds were out |
| of the south at 5-10 mph on a sunny day. (Source: George A. Filer and |
