| object with a large bubble on top was seen just before sunrise. It    |
| reflected light from the Moon, and appeared to skim above the waves   |
| on the ocean. It flew to the North, and was seen again over the city. |

| 1960 - A gruesome case classified as spontaneous human combustion occurred   |
| on this date in 1960 in Grassy Creek, Kentucky. The burned bodies of  |
| four men and a youth were found in a car. Molten metal from the car's |
| roof had dropped on the cremated bodies. (Source: Coral Lorenzen,     |

| 1966 - In Campbells Creek, West Virginia on this day in 1966, six teenagers  |
| saw a gray man-sized creature with red eyes flying over the area. On  |
| this evening in Union City, New Jersey two women saw a UFO described  |
| as looking like a silver pumpkin. It had an antenna. Roof lights of   |
| their apartment building reflected off the bottom of the object.      |
| Across the Ohio River from West Virginia in Gallipolis, Ohio William  |
| Watson's German shepherd dog disappeared. It was found dead a week    |
| later in the center of an isolated field. The knee-high grass around  |
| the dog's body was pressed flat in a perfect circle 20 feet in        |
| diameter. Every bone in the dog's body was crushed, and no blood was  |
| in evidence. (Sources: (1) John Keel, FSR, July 1968, p. 13; David F. |

| 1967 - At 10:00 p.m. east of Roosevelt, Utah a UFO was sighted with   |
| pulsating, rotating green, red, and amber lights. The object had a    |
| shadowy round shape below the lighted area. It moved slowly at first, |
| then very fast, and made several maneuvers. (Source: Frank Salisbury, |

| 1968 - The Milakovic family was driving down their farm road in       |
| Hanbury, England at 5:30 p.m. when they noticed rabbits fleeing. They |
| then noticed a landed domed disc with white, amber, and green lights  |
| and a transparent dome in a field to the left. The brilliant object   |
| rose from the field and hovered above a house. It appeared to "quiver |
| like a jelly." Several human-looking figures were seen walking around |
| on the deck of the craft, bent down. The UFO left with jerky          |
| movements, and the bright lights from the craft hurt their eyes.      |

| off, circled around, and hovered over the car again for an additional |
| ten seconds. Later that night, at 9:30 p.m. local time, a UFO was     |
| seen landing remotely in Los Rios, a suburb of Santo Domingo in the   |
| Dominican Republic. At the same time there occurred an electrical     |

| arms, and it glowed with an off-white color. (Source: Albert Rosales, |

| night, on US highway 101 near Ventura, California two women were      |
