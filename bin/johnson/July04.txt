| 1947 - There are 73 UFO reports from across the United States and one |
| report from Canada recorded for this day in UFOCAT. The majority of   |
| the reports fall in a swath from the Pacific Northwest down through   |
| the Mississippi River Valley. Most of these sightings were of         |
| flyovers by daylight discs, although there was one humanoid report    |
| from Fort Worth, Texas. |
|                                                                       |
| 1947 - The retrieval of UFO wreckage and bodies allegedly occurred on |
| this day from a crash site near Corona, New Mexico. The bodies were   |
| taken later to Roswell AFB, New Mexico and then flown to Carswell AFB |
| in Texas. According to the relatives of witnesses who shared details  |
| about the alien humanoid bodies, they had baldheads, small sunken     |
| eyes, small noses, no ears, long forearms, and only four long slender |
| fingers on each hand. (Source: Patrick Huyghe, Field Guide to         |

| 1947 - At noon while flying between Tonopah and Austin, Nevada and    |
| cruising at an estimated 10,000 feet altitude, Mr. Harris and his     |
| passenger sighted five circular objects flying below his airplane.    |
| They were shiny and reflected sunlight. He tried to catch up to them  |
| but could not. (Source: Nevada Daily Free Press, July 7, 1947).       |

| 1947 - A young woman driving in the afternoon on the outskirts of     |
| Fort Worth, Texas saw a 25-foot diameter flying disc. She got out of  |
| her car and waved. The object tipped and the human-appearing          |
| occupants waved back to her, and then the disc flew away in silence.  |

| 1947 - At 1:05 p.m. a police officer at police headquarters in        |
| Portland, Oregon saw five flying discs, two going south, three flying |
| to the east at high speed. They were oscillating around a central     |
| vertical axis. Minutes later two police, both pilots, saw three more  |
| discs trailing one another. Then four patrolmen reported seeing 3-6   |
| "chrome hubcaps" flying over the city. At about the same time a       |
| highway patrolman in Milwaukee, Oregon watched two or three shiny     |
| white saucers fly quickly toward the northwest. (Sources: Thomas      |
| Olsen, The Reference for Outstanding UFO Sighting Reports, p. 2;      |

| 1947 - Also that day four silent discs passed the summit of Mount     |
| Jefferson in Oregon flying at a high rate of speed. In Troutdale,     |
| Oregon a V-shaped object flew toward the northeast over the Columbia  |
| River. It made dipping motions during its flight, and was observed    |
| through binoculars by three men. In Vancouver, Washington 20-30 round |
| objects flew toward the west and south in straight-line formations. A |
| low humming sound was heard. North of Craig, Montana a string of      |
| twelve plate-shaped objects flew over a couple while they were out    |
| fishing on a bridge at 3:00 p.m. (Sources: Project Blue Book files    |

| 1947 - At 5:30 p.m. at the residential area of Greenwood Lake in      |
| north Seattle, Washington Mr. Larson sighted a round white object     |
| descend vertically, then make a ninety-degree turn and proceed        |
| horizontally flying toward the south. Two more people at the nearby   |
| University of Washington campus also saw the UFO, as did 21 more in   |
| the Lake City area of the city. One of the witnesses in the Lake City |
| area took a photograph. (Source: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947: A         |

| 1947 - At 11:00 p.m. an orange ball of light, "as big around as a     |
| barrel," which resolved itself into a disc, frightened Ms. M. Voigt   |
| of Edgerton, Wisconsin. The UFO flew fast across the sky but was back |
| again for ten minutes, when it then suddenly vanished. (Source:       |

| 1969 - Ossipee, New Hampshire - The principal witness was fishing in a |
| boat at about 7:00 in the morning when he heard a big splash behind   |
| him. He swung around and looked up to see a silver oval shaped object |
| about 30 feet in diameter, 300 feet above him. The UFO made a humming |
| sound as it rose to about 3000 feet and hovered. There was a second   |
| witness to the UFO. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs Interplanetary Visitors, |
| pg. 356).                                                             |

| 1969 - At eight o'clock in the evening Mauricio Gnecco saw a          |
| yellowish red light moving in the sky over Anolaima, Colombia. When   |
| he signaled to it with a flashlight it approached to within 150 feet  |
| of his house. It was a Saturn-shaped UFO, yellow-orange in color, and |
| had two bent, blue and green legs. It appeared to land on a nearby    |
| hill. Arcesio Bermudez, an adult, went to the landing site and        |
| approached to within 20 feet of the craft. He saw a being inside the  |
| object whose upper body looked normal, but whose lower half--from the |
| waist down--resembled a luminous letter "A". The object then "blinked |
| on," rose and disappeared. Two days later Sr. Bermudez became very    |
| ill, and within a few days he died of gastroenteritis. (Source: David |

| 1969 - The witness and her father had gone to a local racetrack in    |
| Eau Claire, Wisconsin and at around 10:30 p.m. she was sitting by     |
| herself on the top bleachers when she had a feeling she was being     |
| watched. She looked to her right and saw a UFO hovering about 1,000   |
| feet away. She described it as an oval-shaped craft, with a           |
| transparent rectangular section in the center. She saw inside this    |
| transparent part the silhouettes of several men staring at her. At    |
| one point she briefly looked away, and when she looked back the       |
| object had disappeared. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact  |

| 1970 - Sequoyah Trueblood was sitting by his pool at his townhouse in |
| Laurel, Maryland, watching his children swimming with his wife        |
| sitting next to him. Without knowing why, he felt compelled to leave. |
| He got up, went into the house, changed his clothes, packed a small   |
| bag, drove to the airport and took a plane to Oklahoma City. A friend |
| then drove him to Norman, Oklahoma. He felt strange and wanted to lie |
| down, so went to lie down in his friend's bedroom. He was lying down  |
| relaxing when he saw a vortex of swirling lights "like a rainbow"     |
| into which he was sucked. Mr. Trueblood then found himself standing   |
| in a beautiful garden surrounded by hedges. He felt wide awake. In    |
| front of him he saw a silvery saucer-shaped craft and a shimmering    |
| small silver being standing on steps that came down from the bottom   |
| of the craft. The being had a grayish complexion and had a large      |
| baldhead with large eyes. The witness sensed that the being was       |
| "androgynous," neither male nor female. The being communicated        |
| telepathically and told him that he had been sent to take him because |
| "they" wanted to talk to him. He agreed to go and walked up the       |
| steps. Once inside the craft he heard no sound, but through a small   |
| window he could see the moon, the sun, and "millions of stars" go by  |
| in an instant. Soon the craft was hovering over a beautiful white     |
| city in what he believed was another planet or universe. He next      |
| found himself down on the ground. The people in the city appeared to  |
| be both male and female, wore white robes, and were fair skinned with |
| "hair that was glowing like the color of sunlight." The small being   |
| then took him down a street lined with beautiful white buildings      |
| three stories tall to a clearing in the woods that seemed like a      |
| park. There were a number of people there, and a male said to him     |
| that if he would "pay attention." The people told him that they did   |
| not need food, for the air they breathed was converted into what was  |
| needed to sustain life. A leader figure told him that he had been     |
| brought here to show him the potential of the human race. Soon he     |
| asked to be returned, and was taken back into the craft, through the  |
| vortex, and found himself back in bed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,    |

| 1975 - At five minutes after midnight a 70-foot diameter domed disc   |
| was seen near Mountain Lakes, New Jersey sweeping the ground with a   |
| bright beam of light near highway 46. It then flew off toward the     |
| northeast. There was radio interference noted at the time. (Source:   |

| 1975 - Nine teenagers were at a campground in Kentucky on this night. |
| Debbie and Nan Kitley, ages 16 and 17, had gone back out to their     |
| pickup truck to talk on the CB radio. The lights on the truck and the |
| CB radio went dead when four bright lights descended over them. They  |
| both had a memory lapse about what happened next. (Source: Thomas E.  |

| 1976 - On this morning in Mawman, England a young girl and her sister |
| saw a man perched in a tree nearby who had legs "bent backwards like  |
| a bird." It had red glowing eyes and a gray body. It saw them and     |
| rose straight up through the trees. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted    |

| 1976 - At 12:45 p.m. a huge disc-shaped object hovered for a long     |
| time over Bilbao, Spain. It flew back over the city and surrounding   |
| area several times, then made a ninety-degree turn and flew off       |
| toward the south. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case     |

| 1978 - At 3:15 p.m. in Santa Paula, California a small domed          |
| disc-shaped object, about 3-4 feet in diameter with rotating parts on |
| top, made a head-on pass at two witnesses in an airplane. (Source:    |

| 1978 - At 11:30 p.m. at Mount Etna, Italy three red objects, one a    |
| domed disc ten meters in diameter, landed behind a mountain. Five or  |
| six "Nordic" looking beings with long blond hair emerged from the     |
| craft, wearing uniforms that looked like diving suits. The four       |
| witnesses were paralyzed and could not move during the event.         |

| 1987 - On this Fourth of July holiday two adult women in Pensacola,   |
| Florida were outside in the evening setting off sparklers when they   |
| spotted a light in the sky. It first appeared to be flying south but  |
| it then turned in their direction and approached, coming to within 30 |
| feet of them. Both ran into their house screaming. (Source: Rex       |

| 1989 - An abduction attempt took place on this evening in a park near |
| Kiev, Ukraine on the banks of the Dnieper River. Two women, Vera      |
| Prokofiyevna, a retired factory employee, and her friend Alexandra    |
| Stepanovna, an engineer, together with Alexandra's six-year-old       |
| daughter, were out strolling in the park. At twilight they approached |
| the river and suddenly saw what they took to be a boat with three     |
| beings on board. The beings looked very pale and had identical faces, |
| like identical twins. The had long blond hair, big eyes, and were     |
| wearing collarless silver shirts that looked like nightgowns. They    |
| bluntly told the women they were from another planet, so far away     |
| that your minds "cannot fathom it." They went on to say that everyday |
| they take a person from Earth to their world. "We will take you. Our  |
| ship is nearby; we will show it to you." They spoke Russian with a    |
| strange accent that Prokofiyevna described as "ancient" rather than   |
| foreign. They then surrounded the three, preventing them from         |
| leaving. The women started begging them not to take them because they |
| had children and families.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| Behind some trees they saw the craft. It was silvery colored like     |
| their clothing and looked like a huge barrel with a circular antenna  |
| on top of it. The little girl began crying and the women reacted to   |
| this with deep anguish. They were then told, "well, we won't take     |
| you, we will find others." They went inside the craft by using a      |
| ladder with three steps. The ladder withdrew inside, the door         |
| automatically closed once the beings were aboard, and the craft took  |
| off without making any noise or causing any disturbance of the air or |
| the sand beneath it. Soon it was high in the sky and looked like a    |
| small star. (Source: Jacques Vallee, UFO Chronicles of the Soviet     |
