| 1909 - At 11:00 p.m. a Mr. Cole sighted a large ovoid object over the |
| city park in Stamford, Lincolnshire, England. It flashed its          |
| searchlight nine times, and then flew off quickly toward              |
| Peterborough. At 11:20 p.m. a witness named Boville in Shoeburyness,  |
| Essex, England said a torpedo-shaped airship flew silently to the     |
| west toward Southend-on-Sea. It hovered for four minutes, and emitted |
| two strong beams. (Source: Carl Grove, FSR, November-December 1970,   |

| 1956 - A small disc flew in and out of a larger disc at a low         |
| altitude in Jacksonville, Florida shortly after 11:00 p.m. They made  |
| no noise. Two girls, Joan Frost and Gertie Wynn, while waiting for a  |
| bus, saw two pulsating lights flying horizontally and disappearing.   |
| Fifteen minutes later the lights were seen again, stopping at the     |
| zenith, merging, and diving to an altitude of only 50 meters. It      |
| seemed that the disc-shaped objects had separated and the girls were  |
| in fear of being abducted when the bus arrived, and they ran to the   |
| vehicle in terror. (Sources: Leonard Stringfield, CRIFO Newsletter,   |

| 1964 - At eleven o'clock in the morning three children, John Owens,   |
| Cheryl Glunt, and Bernie Montello, saw a silvery dome-shaped object   |

| 1967 - On this evening two witnesses in Champaign, Illinois saw a     |
| white-lit object that changed color to red as it flew rapidly from    |
| north to south. The object circled the airport, turned on a bright    |
| light, made turns, and hovered. It then moved south, passing over the |
| witnesses, who followed it at speeds over 90 mph. (Source: NICAP      |

| 1974 - The main witness and six others were returning home late at    |
| night on Highway 57 near Mount Vernon, Indiana when they all spotted  |
| a large object hovering close to the ground. The object approached    |
| and hovered over their vehicle giving off heat. All the passengers    |
| inside except for the principal witness became sick and passed out.   |
| He then felt as if he was being drawn upwards and also passed out. He |
| next became aware of a bright white light around him and several      |
| figures looking down at him. The beings called him by his name, and   |
| then he passed out again. The aliens were described as five feet      |
| tall, with light skin, huge almond shaped eyes, and a small lower     |
| jaw. They were also apparently very strong. The man believes that his |
| aging process had slowed down subsequent to the abduction. On the     |
| same night in nearby Evansville, Indiana a Mr. Oscar Jordan had a     |
| close encounter of the first kind with a UFO. (Sources: (1) Albert S. |

| northwestern part of the sky over the town of Braine-le-Comte,        |

| 1979 - A power failure occurred in the predawn hours in Choconta,     |

| 1980 - Red balls of light the size of lemons climbed up, across, and  |
| down telephone lines in Bargersville, Indiana then went up another    |
| pole on a clear evening at 9 p.m. A dog whined and barked as more red |

| 1983 - At 3:00 a.m. Robert and Janine Lorent in Sambreville, Belgium  |
| sighted a three meter diameter metallic inverted dish-shaped object   |
| with a rotating lower part. It was silent when first noticed, then a  |
| white beam of light turned on. There was a red light also on the      |

| making a purring turbine noise. Their close encounter lasted six      |
| minutes. (Source: UNICAT, case # 624, citing Michel van Der Elst,     |

| 1985 - At 4:30 a.m. a man had stopped his motorcycle by the side of   |
| the road in Lowton, England to have a smoke. He became aware of a     |
| humming sound coming from the adjacent field. When he walked closer   |
| to the field, he saw a silvery glow coming from a depression in the   |
| field. Two figures suddenly appeared, and when he started to flee he  |
| heard a voice say, "Do not be afraid." The beings were both human     |
| looking, and of similar appearance. They both had blond, shoulder     |
| length hair parted in the middle, and were wearing what looked like   |
| blue ski suits. The female was about five feet tall, and the male     |
| somewhat shorter. Each had an egg-shaped implement attached to a belt |
| around their waist. The woman did all the talking, and she explained  |
| that they were from "the third solar system." She also said they use  |
| the Earth's magnetic field and gravity for propulsion. After the      |
| conversation was finished, both beings walked to the silvery glow in  |
| the field. Moments later the humming sound increased and the glow     |
| brightened. Then a craft shaped like a football and the size of two   |
| large buses lifted off from the hollow in the field. It hovered for a |
| few seconds, then silently shot away at incredible speed. (Sources:   |
