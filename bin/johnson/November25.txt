| 1949 - In 1949 a cloud cigar-shaped object was sighted by three witnesses    |
| driving between Edna and Inez, Texas at 2:30 p.m. It flew off rapidly |
| to the south toward Edna. (Source: Kenneth Arnold & Ray Palmer, The   |

| 1954 - On this evening in Calcerosa, Sicily, Italy two 12-year-old    |
| boys, G. Marziano and P. Santucci, watched three 1.2-foot-tall beings |
| with very large heads and gray skin enter a small sphere concealed 10 |
| meters away from them, behind some bushes. The UFO had two propellers |
| in front that started spinning. The object took off with a hissing    |
| sound. (Sources: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers Uncensored, p. 136;   |

| 1954 - A weatherman and an air traffic controller watched two         |
| luminous objects hover over the Cordoba, Argentina airport for two    |
| hours starting at 5:25 a.m. (Sources: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, |

| 1955 - State Senator S. T. Taylor reported seeing a dirigible-shaped  |
| object in La Veta, Colorado with a fat front, tapered toward the      |
| tail, which was luminous green-blue and jellylike. It first appeared  |
| overhead diving at a 45 degree angle, then reduced the angle to 30    |
| degrees. The object was seen for 5 seconds. (Source: Don Berliner,    |

| 1956 - At 4:30 a.m. near Hot Springs, South Dakota a USAF fighter jet |
| from the 54th Fighter Squadron made three passes at a brilliantly lit |
| UFO that was bobbing up and down. On the third pass the UFO was       |
| picked up on radar by the 740th ACW squadron. East of Pierre, South   |
| Dakota on highway 34, two police officers sight a UFO that plays a    |
| game of cat-and-mouse tag with their patrol car. At around 7 p.m. on  |
| the same day Mary Whelan was walking a colt on her farm in Reading,   |
| Minnesota when it was spooked by six disc-shaped objects that flew    |
| over in a semi-circle. Others horses were also frightened when these  |
| UFOs made 5-6 more passes in formation following the same maneuver.   |
| The discs gave off a green light as they flew past. (Sources:         |

| 1957 - In 1957, at 4:15 p.m., an odd round cloud observed in Indianapolis,   |
| Indiana became a rectangular object with sharp edges, and then faded  |
| away. In Mogi Mirim, Brazil all lights failed in the city at around   |
| 10 p.m. as a UFO flew overhead. (Sources: Loren Gross, UFOs: A        |

| 1964 - On this date in 1964, a famous UFO humanoid case lasting several      |
| hours was thoroughly documented by UFO investigator Ted Bloecher. Two |
| women in New Berlin, New York watched the entire operation for four   |
| hours, beginning shortly after midnight. A luminous, disc-shaped      |
| object landed on a hill at a distance of 3,800 feet away from their   |
| house. Their dog became frightened. Ten to twelve 7'-8' tall men      |
| exited the craft and appeared to engage in repair activity, working   |
| underneath the disc. They appear to be unsuccessful in their repair   |
| activities at first, until a second disc landed, presumably to lend   |
| assistance. The UFO occupants wore dark close-fitting suits. Ground   |
| marks left at the site formed equilateral imprint triangles, 4.6      |
| meters and 6.1 meters on a side. The UFOs made a humming or droning   |
| noise when they took off. (Sources: Schwarz Berthold E. Schwarz, UFO  |

| 1966 - In 1966, while driving home in the morning daylight at 7:15 a.m. on   |
| Highway 62 in Point Pleasant, West Virginia Mr. Ury, 25-years-old,    |
| became yet another "Mothman" witness. The bird-like creature, six     |
| feet tall with a ten-foot wingspan, circled his car as he drove down  |
| the highway. He increased his speed to between 70-75 miles per hour   |
| but the creature easily kept up with his car. (Source: John Keel,     |
| FSR, July 1968, p. 8).                                                |

| 1968 - On this date in 1968, at just after 6 p.m. on Highway 174 outside of  |
| the town of Marcellus in upstate New York, a mother and her small son |
| saw a domed-disc UFO with a red blinking light on top. As it          |
| approached to within 100 feet of their car the engine lost power and  |
| the radio filled with static. Their dog cried, clawed to get under    |
| the seat, and covered its eyes and ears with its paws. The UFO moved  |
| away then, but continued to pace them down the road. Once more it     |
| made a pass at the car, and again the engine lost power and the radio |
| wouldn't work. (Sources: Gordon Lore, Jr., Strange Effects from UFOs, |
| p. 40; Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, p. |

| 1968 - At 8 p.m, a light approached a residential area in    |
| Rossville, Georgia and was witnessed by three men. The object,        |
| triangular in shape with bulging sides, appeared to descend as it     |
| approached to an altitude of 200 feet, and then flew directly         |
| overhead. It had amber lights around edge, and was completely silent. |
| It was estimated to be about the size of two cars in length. It flew  |
| off to the southwest. (Source: NICAP case investigation files, field  |
| investigator K. Dammer).                                              |

| 1968 - Also in 1968, at 10:30 that night in Curico, Chile a two-meter wide   |
| disc landed on four legs. Three dwarf humanoids emerged, while a      |
| fourth was seen inside the craft. One of the beings scratched dirt    |
| from the ground, but no traces were found at the sight. The UFO made  |
| a pendulum movement during its departure. (Source: Jader Pereira, Les |

| 1968 - At perhaps the same time (10:30 p.m. EDT) a yellowish-white, glowing  |
| vertical cigar hovered silently 1/4 mile offshore from Dennis,        |
| Massachusetts. It hung in the sky about 200 feet above the water. An  |
| investigating policeman confirmed the sighting by the three intial    |
| witnesses. There was a total of seven independent witnesses. (Source: |

| 1970 - Four men near a railway line saw a brightly lit disc come down |
| through the clouds in Tunstead, England at 6:53 a.m. The principal    |
| witness hid behind a tree as the UFO hung motionless in the sky for   |
| seven minutes. (Sources: Mrs. K. Smith, BUFORA Journal, August 1971,  |

| 1975 - On this night in a field nine miles west of Goodridge,         |
| Minnesota, a disc-shaped object eight feel in diameter was seen in a  |
| field. It rose off the ground, then relanded. The witness's car       |
| stalled, and later required major tune-up repair work. (Source: Mark  |
| Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, p. 66).        |

| 1978 - While participating in a trans-Atlantic crossing during a      |
| yatch race, the skipper of the yatch "Salamandre" watched a very      |
| shiny white disc come down to right above the boat. The greenish-blue |
| color surrounding the object was so brilliant that it was blinding.   |
| The UFO shot off at astonishing speed. (Source: UFO Newspaper         |

| 1978 - That night in Trier, Germany at 10 p.m. an abduction by UFO    |
| occupants occurred. A metallic, ovoid UFO with a flashing red light   |
| hovered over a car with a German couple and a nineteen-year-old       |
| American woman named Owens. The car's occupants experienced over 90   |
| minutes of missing time. The principal abductee, the wife of an       |
| American soldier stationed in Germany, was levitated aboard the UFO.  |
| She was five months pregnant at the time. She had no memory of the    |
| abduction prior to hypnosis. During hypnosis she recalled that the    |
| aliens had huge, baldheads, and deep-set eyes. They had a greenish    |
| colored skin, with a roughness like mummy wrapping. Their hands had   |
| four fingers, and were twice the length of human fingers. Dark        |
| triangular objects with pale yellow lights were seen over Heathrow    |
| Airport and in Ducklington, England that day and evening. (Sources:   |

| 1980 - A cone-shaped UFO was seen in 1980 at 10:30 p.m., three miles away    |
| from three witnesses in Minocqua, Wisconsin over Lake Tomah. The UFO  |
| flickered with red, green and white lights. It was joined by and      |
| circled by a second UFO. The objects made no sound, but did cast      |
| reflections in the lake waters. (Source: APRO Bulletin, May 1981, p.  |

| 1986 - Many UFO reports were received from Wakefield, Rhode Island    |
| during the evening. A UFO at low altitude directed beams of light at  |
| cars on US Highway 1. Two silent discs paced a truck on SR 671        |
| northeast of Winchester, Virginia at 11:10 that night. They stayed    |
| parallel to the driver's side of the vehicle, and then veered away. A |
| radar target passed close to an airliner near the city of Magadan,    |
| Russia. It turned right over Shelekhov Bay, and achieved a top speed  |
| of 3000 kilometers per hour when it crossed the Kamchatka shoreline,  |
| where it was lost from radar screens 150 kilometers off shore.        |

| 1987 - In 1987 an abduction occurred in Okaloosa County, Florida not far     |
| from the town of Destin. A woman reported that her 5-year-old son was |
| apparently taken aboard a UFO that night. He had been sleeping on the |
| couch late that night, when he told his mother that a short,          |
| robot-like entity approached him and he was levitated up and into a   |
| hovering, disc-shaped object that was in a clearing in some nearby    |
| woods. He remembered being medically examined. He also reported that  |
| his throat hurt when he tried to talk about the experience. (Sources: |

| 1992 - In 1992 another abduction occurred. This time it was in Baca Grande,  |
| Colorado in the San Luis Valley, at 10:30 p.m. The last memory that   |
| the 40-year-old female witness had was turning off the heat in her    |
| pickup truck. Two hours later she awoke to an orange beam of light,   |
| with her truck that was now freezing inside. She had two hours of     |
| unaccounted for missing time, her watch had stopped, and her nose was |
| bleeding. There were 2 independent witnesses of a UFO in the area     |
| that night. (Source: Christopher O'Brien, The Mysterious Valley, p.   |

| 1996 - At 10:30 p.m. multiple callers reported a number of intense    |
| bright orange fireballs traveling fast over Canberra, A.C.T.,         |
| Australia. When last seen, the lights were headed to the northwest.   |
| At 11:15 p.m. many witnesses, including the entire local police force |
| of Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia watched at least four |
| intense bright-orange "fireball" type lights over the city, before    |
| the objects headed off in a westerly direction. At least 10           |
| photographs were taken of the objects, and one of the police officers |

| 1998 - San Fernando Cebu Island, The Philippines - At three o'clock in |
| the morning a man noticed a small strange-looking object hovering     |
| over a dead tree in some woods. There was a sudden flash of light and |
| large balloon-shaped object with three illuminated triangular windows |
| became visible. Inside the window he could see the head of a being    |
| with bright, crystal blue eyes. He heard a loud thundering voice      |
| speaking at him in an unknown language. Some of it sounded like:      |
| "arc-ha-an rha-ehn-raxh ehn." (Source: Albert S. Rosales, a998        |

| 1998 - At 5:00 a.m. a soldier at the Moron de la Frontera Air Force   |
| Base in Sevilla, Spain was on guard duty near special hangars 1, 5, 6 |
| and 9, accompanied by his German shepherd guard dog, when he heard a  |
| metallic scraping sound coming from nearby. He released his dog loose |
| to go check, then loaded his weapon, and fired two shots into the     |
| air. Suddenly from out of some nearby woods a two-meter tall humanoid |
| figure appeared. Because it was dark the soldier could not make out   |
| any features, except that the humanoid had glowing green eyes. He     |
| challenged the figure but it did not move, then he fired at it with   |
| his rifle, once, without any apparent effect. He then ordered the dog |
| to attack, but when the dog approached it started howling in pain and |
| slunk away. He fired at the humanoid again, but it just remained      |
| standing, staring at him. He took a few steps towards the figure      |
| which then raised one hand up, crouched down, and disappeared into    |
| the brush. The soldier conducted a search but failed to find          |
| anything. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1998 Humanoid Sighting Reports  |

| 1999 - At 4:23 p.m. Maria de Jesus was outside washing some clothes   |
| in her yard in Coari, Amazonas State, Brazil when she felt something  |
| moving nearby. When she turned around, she was confronted by a short  |
| creature about 1.20 meters in height, with large black eyes. It was   |
| wearing metallic clothing and holding a cane-like instrument in his   |
| left hand. The humanoid being began gesticulating towards her, when   |
| she screamed in fear. This startled the humanoid, who then seemed to  |
| levitate and disappear behind a nearby stonewall. A large ball of     |
| fire appeared a few seconds later from behind the stone wall, and     |
| shot up into the sky at very high speed. The encounter lasted for     |
| about three minutes. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1999 Humanoid        |

| 1999 - At 10:10 p.m. in Pemberton, British Columbia four witnesses    |
| watched orange lights in the northwest sky, moving slowly. The lights |
| wandered in the sky for four minutes. There were 4-6 lights in a      |
| "X-shape." (Source: Geoff Dittman, 1999 Canadian UFO Survey, case     |

| 2000 - In Ellisville, Mississippi a witness reported seeing a long,   |
| triangle-shaped object with lots of lights moving in the sky at 8:45  |
| p.m., and making no sound when it flew. (Source: Peter Davenport,     |

| 2002 - Fourteen-year-old Amy saw a slow flying equilateral triangle   |
| in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. It was medium gray (not black), silent, and |
| flying toward the east-southeast lower than the normal landing        |
| pattern. She saw it for three seconds, and it gave her "the chills"   |
| seeing it. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell, Filer's      |

| 2003 - Two witnesses in Creston, British Columbia briefly saw some    |
| blue lights in the sky at 9:20 p.m., then felt they had had a missing |
| time experience. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 2003 Canadian UFO Survey,    |

| 2004 - A triangular UFO with red and blue lights was sighted flying   |
| over Ottumwa, Iowa at 5:00 a.m. The lights appeared to be rotating in |
| a clockwise pattern. The object was completely silent as it flew.     |

| 2005 - A man was having a late dinner with his family in Wichita,     |
| Kansas at 10:30 p.m. when he saw three lights on the horizon. In a    |
| flash they grew into a large, nearly blinding light source. He went   |
| outside and walked in the direction of the lights, and could see a    |
| cigar-shaped object moving up and down in a vertical motion. He had   |
| two dogs, and one was barking uncontrollably, while the other--a      |
| normally more aggressive dog--was whimpering and hid under the back   |
| deck. As he stood watching the UFO , a man about five feet tall       |
| approached him. The man spoke to him in a foreign language which he   |
| was certain was German. He could not remember anything after that     |
| point. The next morning he woke up on his bed. His family had gone    |
| and his entire body felt sore, particularly below the waist. (Source: |

| 2005 - At sometime around 4 a.m. a 14-year-old witness in Leesport,   |
| Pennsylvania was asleep in his bed when he suddenly awoke and caught  |
| a brief glimpse of what looked to be an alien face. The figure was    |
| standing by a dresser next to his mirror, and was between 4-5 feet    |
| tall with large black eyes. As soon as he saw the alien's face he     |
| pulled his blanket over his face. Moments later, while hiding under   |
| the blanket, he heard shuffling noises on the carpet and also what    |
| sounded like plastic tubes being slapped against a hand. The last     |
| sound he heard was a loud clapping noise. After daylight had broken   |
| he finally had the courage to pull off his covers and go to the       |
| bathroom, but by now everything seemed to be back to normal. (Source: |
