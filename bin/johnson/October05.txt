| ledge. She opened the drapes and saw a hovering yellowish-green,      |
| balloon-shaped object emitting a white light beam. At 4:15 a.m. a red |
| object with beams of bright light was sighted in Walsh, Illinois.     |
| (Source: APRO Bulletin, September-October 1970, p. 4;                 |

| unidentified flying object, and an orange, yellow, and green object   |
| trailing white smoke and emitting a high-pitched whine. Horses were   |
| frightened by the presence of the UFO. At 9:00 a.m. a 59-year-old     |
| woman in saw a luminous orange object descend very low over some      |
| houses in Montreal, Quebec. She described the object as a very        |
| luminous orange circle surrounded by a sparkling white halo. Inside   |
| the circle she saw a small black object pivoting upon itself. During  |
| this time she realized that she was paralyzed and couldn't move.      |
| After a minute the object ascended rapidly into the sky, leaving a    |
| long trail behind it. She wanted to get some air and stepped out onto |
| her balcony. She confronted a very heavy mist and a strong odor,      |
| which had a choking effect upon her. She went back inside, fainted,   |
| came to 10-15 minutes later with her eyes burning, her head feeling   |
| hot and heavy, and quite stunned. She felt electrical jolts in her    |
| body, and her hair had turned yellow in color. Her diabetes also      |
| manifested itself in an alarming fashion. UFO report involving        |
| physiological effects occurred in Quebec City, Quebec. At 9:00 p.m.   |
| that night in Saint-Romuald, Quebec two witnesses saw a elongated,    |
| luminous flying object. Their car radio had heavy static during the   |
| sighting. (Sources: FSR, November-December 1970, p. 29; Montreal Le   |

| south-southwest, but came back again at 4:40 a.m. and landed. Later   |
| that evening in Verdugo, California three discs flew at a low         |
| altitude toward the south. They had red glowing rims. (Sources:       |

| sound during this close encounter. At 5:20 a.m. in Nohant-en-Gout,    |
| France there was another case involving fog or mist. A motorcycle     |
| stalled as a luminous ovoid object approached and hovered, with smoke |
| or fog underneath. A being two-meters tall appeared suddenly, put a   |
| hand on the witness's shoulder. The creature was wearing a large      |
| helmet and had slit eyes. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, December    |

| hovered for three minutes. At 7:20 p.m. hundreds of phone calls were  |
| received by the police in Connersville, Indiana about a circle of     |
| light that was seen in the sky making several passes over the area at |
| high speeds and a low altitude. A third case of this day involving a  |
| UFO surrounded by mist or vapor occurred in El Centro, California. At |
| 8:00 p.m. a large, disc-shaped object surrounded by glistening vapor  |
| rose to 1200 feet altitude, turned, then shot away leaving a vapor    |
| trail. (Sources: Bob Gribble, National UFO Reporting Center, case     |

| circular control room, onboard a V-shaped craft. A beautiful tall     |
| blond woman greeted her. She wore shiny pale-blue pants, a jeweled    |
| scarf, and a headband. The woman introduced herself then a taller man |
| wearing a silvery white suit appeared and introduced himself as the   |
| captain. There was a metallic pole in the center of the craft that    |
| flashed in multi-colored hues of light; and it seemed to be part of   |
| the flight control mechanism. She was taken to a soft contour chair   |
| and given a peach-colored liquid to drink. She was later shown a huge |
| viewing screen on which she was given different messages. (Sources:   |

| and walked mechanically. Their eyes also appeared not to reflect      |
| light. They seemed unaccustomed to typical manners or customs. After  |
| they left they vanished without leaving footprints on the ground.     |

| taken out of the bottom," with yellow, orange and blue lights,        |
| markings, and a dark circle in the center, hovered over some woods in |
| Middleton Wood, England. A videotape was made as the object seemed to |
| expand and get smaller. It also emitted pulses of light. Later in     |
| Bradford, England at 10:40 p.m. a large UFO was viewed through        |
| binoculars as it stood almost upright with bright lights at each end. |
| It had white and amber lights, and a red strobe light was running up  |
| and down the length of the objects between the ends. It passed behind |
| a church tower at a fairly low altitude. (Source: UFO Magazine (UK),  |
