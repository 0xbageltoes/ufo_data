| 1944 - An object was allegedly shot down by the U.S. military as it   |
| attempted to depart from the island of Oahu, Hawaii near Kaneohe. One |
| female occupant was captured and flown to Washington, DC. (Source:    |

| 1947 - In 1947 during the beginning days of the great UFO wave of 1947, a    |
| rapidly moving, round, silvery-white object was seen at 11:30 a.m. in |
| the town of Greenfield, Massachusetts. It was one of the early cases  |
| secretly investigated by the FBI. Later that same day, at 1 o'clock   |
| in the afternoon, Mr. Hammond and his son were vacationing in Radium  |
| Springs, New Mexico and saw a "flying pie-plate" disc while swimming. |

| 1949 - In Oak Ridge, Tennessee on this evening in 1949, a teacher, a         |
| scientist, and one other watched two delta-shaped UFOs and a disc fly |
| over the US government nuclear research facility around 7 p.m.. The   |
| objects appeared to be metallic, and flew slowly toward the           |
| northwest. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 1415).     |
|                                                                       |
| 1952 - Near the Korean front in 1952, two sergeants sighted an orange disc   |
| four feet in diameter just above an airstrip. It dove vertically,     |
| emitting a red flame 2-5 feet long as it did so, and stopped          |
| momentarily 100 feet over the end of the runway. The object then flew |
| to the west, circled back taking about 45 to 60 seconds to execute    |
| the 180-degree turn, flashed, the flew on to the east. A second       |
| bright flash was seen followed by complete darkness: the disc had     |
| vanished. No sound was heard coming from the object. The case was     |
| unexplained by Project Blue Book. (Source: J. Allen Hynek, The Hynek  |

| 1953 - At 2:10 a.m. the pilot and radar operator of a USAF F-94 jet   |
| interceptor flying from Goose AFB, Labrador, Canada sighted a red     |
| light flying at an estimated 1,000 knots (1,100 mph). The object      |
| eluded the pursuing F-94 after five minutes. (Source: Don Berliner,   |

| 1954 - At around 9 p.m. U.S. Marine Corps Major E. Buchser and Major  |
| J. V. Wilkins In Miami Beach, Florida witnessed a meteor-like object  |
| descend, stop, and become extremely bright. Sighting lasted 7         |
| minutes. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO Unknowns).       |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - Also in 1954 an eighty-foot long blimp-shaped UFO drifted over        |
| Cleveland, Ohio at 300 feet altitude. The object veered up sharply    |
| and shot away after about 5-10 seconds. (Source: Project Blue Book    |

| 1957 - Two patrolmen at Rye, New York watched a large object with two |
| white lights and one red light plunge into Long Island Sound.         |
| (Source: Ivan T. Sanderson, Invisible Residents, p. 39).              |

| 1960 - A strange flying object struck Clan Lake, which is located     |
| some 30 miles north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada at  |
| around 6 p.m. About 20-25 minutes after a airplane had dropped off    |
| witness C. T. Wright, he heard a noise that sounded like a large      |
| plane in the distance. The noise got louder but he could not see      |
| anything in the sky. He then heard something strike the water behind  |
| him and saw an object with arms or spokes rotating in the water. It   |
| was rotating very rapidly and throwing water, but gradually it began  |
| to spin less and finally stopped. It was about 1700 feet away from    |
| him. When his partner arrived they took a canoe and went over to the  |
| shallow spot in the lake where the object hit the water. There was    |
| grass about 18 inches high were the object hit and it appeared to be  |
| burnt and cut up over an area of 20 feet by 60 feet. They felt around |
| in the water with their paddles where the floor of the lake was very  |
| much disturbed and muddy, and one to three feet deeper than the       |
| surrounding lake proper. The object looked to be about 4-6 feet wide. |
| Mr. Wright did not see any steam when the object hit the water. He    |
| and his partner went back to the location on two more occasions but   |
| could find nothing. (Source: Carl Feindt, www.waterufo.net, citing    |

| 1969 - Ms. Terry Ennshyman reportedly encountered a "robot" type      |
| humanoid in Dunedin, New Zealand who conducted her onboard a landed   |
| disc-shaped UFO. He or it then had sex with her several times. The    |
| robot had cold extremities and a cold penis, but does not lack        |
| "warmth" and sweetness despite his constant guttural sounds. (Source: |

| CIGU 1988, quoting Dunedin Telegraph, in Denys Breysse Project        |

| 1976 - Guia de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands (Spain) - Three men in a   |
| taxi observed a gray-colored, perfect sphere at 9:30 p.m. which       |
| hovered a few meters above the ground. The taxi's radio stopped       |
| working and the witnesses felt very cold. Inside the sphere, which    |
| was transparent, they saw two humanoids about three meters tall,      |
| wearing reddish, tight-fitting clothing. The driver switched on a     |
| spotlight and pointed it at the object, which rose up about 30 feet   |
| and emitted a bluish gas. It then grew as large as a 20-story         |
| building, though the two humanoids and their control panels remained  |
| their original size. After a few minutes, the huge object flew away,  |
| giving off a whistling sound. People in a nearby house reported that  |
| their TV had stopped working during the sighting. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference, case  |

| 1976 - In the town of Galdar on the island of Las Palmas also in the Canary  |
| Islands, at 10:30 p.m., an electric-blue semi-transparent sphere with |
| two tall entities inside was seen hovering for 20 minutes. The object |
| then changed size enormously, growing in size to the equivalent of a  |
| twenty-story building. On that same night a photograph of another UFO |
| was taken near Maspalomas on the neighboring island of Tenerife. A    |
| close encounter with a UFO emitting beams of light also occurred      |
| earlier in Bothwell, Tasmania around 7:30 p.m. local time. (Sources:  |

| 1979 - On this afternoon offshore of Gorgona, Italy in the Ligurian   |
| Sea during a beautiful summer day, the yacht Rainbow II was heading   |
| for Corsica, after leaving Viareggio at 3:45 p.m. On board was the    |
| owner of the boat, who was a businessman in Milano, his wife and      |
| children and a crew of 11 people. At about 6:30 p.m. the beautiful    |
| and tranquil day was interrupted by a bewildering and disturbing      |
| event. About three miles ahead of the prow of the boat they saw a     |
| black cylindrical shape. This object was coming out from the surface  |
| of the sea like a tower and rose 30 meters into the air. The yacht    |
| approached and they noticed the dimensions and shape of the object.   |
| When they were within 1.5 miles from the object, it disappeared below |
| the surface with a loud rumble in less than three seconds. This       |
| sighting was also observed from the harbormaster's office on Livorno. |
| The harbor captain remained in continuous radio contact with the crew |
| and in particular with its wireless operator, Mr. Guzzi. But this     |
| phenomenon did not end with the disappearance of the object. Although |
| the compass showed the yacht as headed in the right direction, the    |
| yacht instead drifted about 12 miles south and ended up in Bastia.    |
| This change of course was unexplainable because the sea was calm,     |
| there were no currents, and the compass was working perfectly.        |
| Another strange occurrence was that the dog on board started barking  |
| and appeared scared and terrified. (Source: Marco Bianchini, USOCAT   |

| 1981 - In 1981 at 10:35 a.m. the fire lookout at the Satus Peak fire tower   |
| on the Yakima Indian Reservation in central Washington State saw a    |
| slow moving light descend in the sky, moving toward the northwest.    |
| The light entered a long, thin cloud, and never exited. At about the  |
| same time a large orange glow filled the windshield of a motorist and |
| family in Forreston, South Australia pulsing on and off once a        |
| second. They drove under the source of the light and then it          |
| vanished. (Sources: Greg Long, Examining the Earthlight Theory: The   |

| 1984 - In 1984, an object shaped like the rounded-off "tail fin" of an       |
| airplane with a very short fuselage came straight down over a woman's |
| car in her driveway in Adelanto, California at 11 o'clock in the      |
| morning. She watched it hover 125 yards away as it wobbled and made a |
| "fluttering" motion. On the same night a videotape showing six lights |
| in a crucifix formation was made in Montrose, New York just eight     |
| miles south-southeast of West Point. (Sources: APRO Bulletin,         |

| 2000 - At 10:30 p.m. in 2000 near Providence, Rhode Island a westbound       |
| commercial airliner flying at 8,000 feet altitude observed an         |
| egg-shaped object standing on end. The top and bottom of the object   |
| was spiked with three points each. Air traffic control confirmed the  |
| presence of a radar target one mile from the aircraft. It drifted     |
| toward the east until it was lost from radar. (Source: UFO Magazine,  |

| 2003 - A shiny object, not well defined, fell into the sea between    |
| Martinsicuro and San Benedetto del Tronto in the Adriatic Sea just    |
| before 9:00 p.m. Many telephone calls came into the fire department   |
| of Teramo, the Port Authority of San Benedetto, Italy and to the      |
| Maritime Offices of Giulianova, Italy. Some spoke of a possible       |
| meteorite, judging from the form and color of the object, which dove  |
| into the ocean at some distance from shore. Immediately the alarm was |
| sounded and the military police from Alba got involved. A motorboat   |
| was sent from San Benedetto, which reached the location where the     |
| object plunged into the sea but they were not able to find anything.  |
