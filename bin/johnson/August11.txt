| 1948 - Two boys were playing outside at noon in Hamel, Minnesota when |
| a dull gray, round object 70 cm in diameter landed near them with a   |
| metallic noise. It spun, went up, hovered, maneuvered to avoid        |
| telephone lines and trees, and flew away to the northeast. An FBI man |
| from St. Paul found an area 70 cm in diameter where the ground showed |
| signs of extreme pressure. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to       |

| electrical engineer and assistant manager of the Moeller Shipwrecker  |
| Co., and Kosei Nakamoto sighted a line of blue lights that flew over  |
| their ship at the site of the S.S. Docteur Angier shipwreck. When     |
| overhead the two men could see that underneath the lights was a blue  |
| ring with a black center. After passing over the ship it climbed      |
| vertically, illuminating and agitating the clouds. (Sources: UNICAT,  |

| house in Lawrence, Massachusetts. That evening, at 7:54 p.m., a       |
| disc-shaped object glowed and soared around the control tower at      |
| Maxwell Field in Alabama. It was seen by both ground and air          |
| observers, and confirmed on radar. (Sources: Leonard Stringfield,     |

| 1960 - An important close encounter case involving ignition           |
| interference with the engine of a tractor occurred on this day in     |
| Left Hand Canyon, Boulder County, Colorado at 3:10 in the afternoon.  |
| Mr. Robert Hawks was operating a tractor with a backhoe when his      |
| tractor stalled. Looking up he saw a disc-shaped object hovering in   |
| the sky above the canyon, making a humming noise, and he watched for  |
| the next 15 minutes, unable to re-start his tractor, while some       |
| apparent repair activity was performed on the hovering craft. A panel |
| on the craft was rotated inside and replaced. Ater the repair was     |
| completed, the craft departed by shooting straight up in the sky. Mr. |
| Hawks could then restart his tractor. (Sources: B. V. Wilson, APRO    |

| 1963 - Beginning at shortly after midnight, three witnesses in        |
| Saileralm, Austria watched 50 small glowing orbs fly in and out of    |
| caves in a mountain over the next four hours. The glowing balls of    |
| light then flew up into a large ovoid UFO. (Source: Gordon Creighton, |

| 1965 - At 7:25 p.m. a 62-year-old woman named Clarkson reported       |
| observing two silver objects shaped like four-leaf clovers hovering   |
| over the suburb of Menands, Albany County, New York. She also         |
| reported the smell of smoke. At around midnight that same night Mr. & |

| 1966 - An abduction and forced sexual encounter allegedly occurred    |
| near Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on this evening. Marlene Travers, |
| age 24, was visiting friends in the country and had taken a walk      |
| alone after dinner. She heard a sound like an airplane and saw a      |
| 50-foot diameter disc land in a field. A tall man dressed in a        |
| loose-fitting green tunic got out of the craft. She tried to run away |
| but couldn't move. When he touched her she felt compelled to obey,    |
| and followed him aboard the craft past an instrumental panel into a   |
| "wildly furnished" room. She understood through telepathy that he     |
| intended to impregnate her.                                           |
|                                                                       |
| After sexual intercourse he escorted her out of the ship, but when    |
| she tripped over some kind of a switch the resultant flash burned her |
| ankles and she fainted. When she woke up she found herself lying in   |
| the field where the UFO had landed. Her friends had been searching    |
| for her for several hours. A doctor who examined her found burns on   |
| her legs and ankles. She brought her friends back to the spot where   |
| she claimed to have been inside the UFO, and a large indentation was  |
| found in the earth. She later was examined again by a medical doctor  |
| and found to be pregnant. There is no account of how the pregnancy    |
| turned out. (Sources: Hans Holzer, The UFOnauts, pp. 247-248; Frank   |

| 1969 - At around 1:00 a.m. an ovoid UFO with lights around its        |
| periphery flew low over Groomsport, North Down, Northern Ireland. It  |
| hit a house with light beams, causing reported physiological effects  |
| for the female witness. It followed the contours of the land as it    |
| flew to the northeast. The close encounter lasted for about an hour.  |

| 1969 - Jean Migueres was driving an ambulance at around 6:00 a.m.     |
| from Perpignan to Rouen, France when he heard a voice in his head     |
| say: “Do not be afraid, nothing bad will happen to you, you will feel |
| nothing.” Twenty minutes later he observed a nearly spherical cloud   |
| moving toward him. It then took the form of a cloudy nucleus          |
| surrounded by an incandescent white ring having at its base a dull    |
| black metallic platform, shaped like a domed disc, about 65 feet in   |
| diameter. At the same time, a “DS” car appeared, moving directly      |
| toward the ambulance. Migueres was unable to avoid it, and a head on  |
| collision took place 30 kilometers from Rouen. He estimated that the  |
| ambulance was speeding at 100 kph at the time. After the crash, a     |
| being “materialized” on the seat beside Migueres, and addressed him   |
| telepathically in French. “Be assured, you are only apparently        |
| injured…you will feel no physical pain…I am going to “regenerate” you |
| by a procedure that is not yet known on your planet.” He then took    |
| from a pouch on his belt a disc about 1 inch in diameter, of an       |
| incandescent white luminosity, and applied it to the nape of          |
| Miguere’s neck. Migueres felt a prickling sensation all along his     |
| spinal column. The being said:”This accident was necessary for you;   |
| we will come back to see you.” Then he disappeared. Migueres had      |
| multiple injuries and broken bones but reported feeling no pain, then |
| or later. He underwent several lengthy operations and was twice       |
| pronounced “clinically dead.” After an internal hemorrhage with       |
| bursting of the gall bladder, he received a telepathic message to     |
| “leave the hospital immediately,” which he obeyed, being transported  |
| to a hospital at Montpellier, near his home, where he was again       |
| pronounced “dead.” Nevertheless he survived. After three weeks in the |
| Montpellier hospital he received a message: “You have succeeded in    |
| your mission thanks to our help…you can now go home, we will continue |
| to protect you.”                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| He went home, but for three years his broken bones remained unhealed. |
| “Then one day, all the bones re-knitted in record time,” and he was   |
| able to walk again, without even a limp. Migueres says that since his |
| accident he has had the gift of healing. He remains in contact with   |
| the “extraterrestrials,” who have given him a “code which permits him |
| to free the corresponding wavelength of his brain” to establish       |
| contact with them. The “extraterrestrial” seen at the time of the     |
| accident was of medium height, or less, with a very swarthy skin and  |
| a big head with a very high and wide forehead, eyes far apart,        |
| eyebrows “like scars,” and brown hair cut short. He was wearing a     |
| coverall or a pants and shirt combination resembling a military       |
| uniform, with no hat or helmet. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted        |

| 1969 - At 11:30 p.m. 20 teenagers watched a domed disc-shaped object  |
| descend slowly for 20 minutes west of Bargemon, Var department,       |
| France. It came down low over the source of Doux River, then turned,  |
| and finally flew off to the northeast. (Source: Larry Hatch, U        |

| 1971 - At around midnight a 30-year-old woman in the Gavea district   |
| of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil was sitting by an open window while her     |
| husband slept. It was cloudy, and she noticed an orange glow coming   |
| from behind a cloud, which she first thought was the moon. She        |
| watched a large, elliptical metallic object come out from behind the  |
| cloud that was larger than a Boeing jet plane. It hovered, trembling  |
| and shaking like a dry leaf, then it stopped entirely and hovered     |
| directly above the science building on the University campus. Two     |
| smaller objects, perfect replicas of the first, next came out from    |
| beneath it and started oscillating in their flight around the larger  |
| one. The larger UFO was silvery metallic in color but had a wide      |
| orange, phosphorescent band crossing it from side to side. Within     |
| this band the witness believed she saw oval-shaped portholes of a     |
| light hue, and three or four shapes moving behind them.               |
|                                                                       |
| The larger UFO emitted a broad, bluish beam of light that fell        |
| directly into the room in which the witness was sitting, so it        |
| appeared to have been aimed at her. She compared the type of light to |
| that of an oxyacetylene lamp. Every time it hit her it nearly blinded |
| her. The light turned off briefly and then turned on again, at first  |
| gradually, then more brightly. She now felt irresistibly drawn to it  |
| and had to hold on to the back of the settee so as not to fly out the |
| window. She felt that the light was having a hypnotizing effect on    |
| her, and she tried to call out to her husband but could not say a     |
| word. The beam of light turned off and on five times over a ten       |
| minute period until she finally managed to wake her husband who came  |
| over to see the larger metallic object fly away. It flew at an        |
| incredible speed in a northeasterly direction until it was lost to    |
| sight beyond the Sugar Loaf in the direction of Niteroi. (Source:     |

| 1993 - A man and a woman in Holland, Michigan witnessed a             |
| multicolored, silent disc-shaped object in the sky at 10:45 p.m. The  |
| duration of the sighting was 20 minutes. Each time it appeared as a   |
| row of alternating red and blue lights (the drawing shows two of each |
| color close together). The lights were blinking and round. The        |
| first set spun clockwise and became blurred when moving forward.      |

| 1995 - A man named Brzinski was working the late night shift at a     |
| coat-hanger factory in Wallington, New Jersey. At 10:30 p.m. he was   |
| alone at the time in an aisle when he heard some peculiar sounds      |
| coming from behind some hanger racks. The sound resembled a fast,     |
| choppy, garbled speech. When he looked between the rows of hangers he |
| saw three distinct creatures. When they realized that he saw them     |
| they seemed surprised. They then stopped talking. One was a few       |
| inches taller than the other two but all three were dressed           |
| identically. The shorter ones were about 4 feet tall. They wore       |
| something resembling a wet suit, a tight-fitting, flexible and        |
| elastic-like coverall that even covered their hands and fingers. They |
| appeared to have some kind of face mask or facial covering also. The  |
| creatures had only three digits on each hand. One resembled a thumb   |
| and the other two were longer and located closer together, like       |
| fingers.                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| Mr. Brzinski said that the taller one seemed to be explaining to the  |
| other two something about the automated coat hanger making machine.   |
| They seemed very interested in it for some reason. It was very dark   |
| and it was difficult to make out any facial features, partially due   |
| to the covering they wore. When they realized they had been seen the  |
| shorter ones ran away very quickly in a peculiar shuffling manner,    |
| with apparent with difficulty. The factory windows and doors were all |
| open that night. The taller humanoid remained behind. It opened its   |
| hand and emitted a strange, robotic sound. As it did, the uniform     |
| that covered its hand caught a bit of light from the factory lighting |
| and seemed to give off a silver hue. When it opened its hand a small  |
| sphere appeared in the center of its palm that emitted an extremely   |
| bright light beam. The laser-like beam struck the witness in the      |
| eyes, knocking him backward with its force. It stung like needles and |
| caused him pain, causing him to close his eyes. When he opened them   |
| the creature had disappeared. The entire incident lasted about a      |
| minute. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1995,  |

| 1996 - A strange object was seen in the sky over Wallaroo, South      |
| Australia at 11:30 p.m. by a 17-year-old man. He described it as      |
| bullet shaped with a flame coming from it.  It zig-zagged all around  |

| 1996 - In Przbylow, Poland a man saw some flashing lights in a field  |
| at 10:40 p.m. Because they were just above the ground, he first       |
| thought they were lights on a harvester. However, five more witnesses |
| 600 meters away had a better view of the same lights. According to    |
| them the flashing lights were on a disc-shaped craft with a dome on   |
| the top which had several circling flashing lights. They also noticed |
| a small, human-like creature standing in front of the object, but     |
| were unable to make out any details due to the bright light. (Source: |

| 1997 - A UFO was sighted offshore of Lima, Peru at 11:15 p.m. It      |

| 1999 - At 4:30 a.m. a witness in Montluel, Ain, France who was        |
| suffering from insomnia observed a very shiny luminous point in the   |
| sky that had two rays of light that were shining a tender green       |
| color. The light source seemed to dance in the sky. (Source: GEIPAN,  |

| 1999 - According to a caller to the National UFO Reporting Center,    |
| while traveling on Interstate 90 in South Dakota at 5:30 p.m. he      |
| spotted a huge, peculiar oval-shaped cloud in the sky. It produced    |

| 2000 - A man driving on a highway in Oklahoma had run out of gas at   |
| 4:45 a.m. and had started walking towards some nearby lights. As he   |
| was walking, a car drove around him, pulling ahead of him quite a     |
| distance, and then stopped. A man exited the vehicle and looked at    |
| him. He described the man as having glowing green eyes. Then he       |
| looked behind him and saw two more men. One had green glowing eyes,   |
| too, and the third had eyes that glowed like diamonds. The men did    |
| not say anything, but the witness felt they were telling him to trust |
| them. He next felt an electrical current going through his body and   |
| was unable to move. His memory ends about this time. He was later     |
| found unconscious by a police officer in the middle of the road,      |
| apparently unharmed. (Sources: Peter Davenport, National UFO          |
