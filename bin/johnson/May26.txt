| 1952 - At 3:20 a.m. a brilliant white object was seen overhead by a   |
| US Air Force F-94C fighter jet flying in Grid Area CT 4856 in Korea   |
| during the Korean War. The UFO was picked up by both ground and       |
| airborne radar. It shot away with tremendous acceleration. (Source:   |

| 1956 - At 2:40 p.m. hundreds of witnesses at a military airshow in    |
| Flutag outside of Bern, Switzerland watched a white triangle-shaped   |
| craft hover at three kilometers altitude. The center of the craft was |
| spinning. (Source: UFO Nachrichten, October 1956).                    |

| 1957 - Starting at around 5:00 a.m. a yellow cigar-shaped object      |
| maneuvered in the sky in all directions for 45 minutes over Ben       |
| Lomond, Strathclyde, Scotland. It ascended, descended, then sped away |
| toward the northwest. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database).     |

| 1962 - At 11:45 p.m. a group of seven teenagers in Westfield,         |
| Massachusetts saw a red diamond-shaped object that gave off sparks    |
| like sparklers. The object slowly descended in a gentle S-curve. It   |
| landed remotely on a nearby mountain. Shortly after landing it        |
| reappeared in the sky, and stayed there until after the observers had |
| left the scene. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official |

| 1964 - At 3:43 p.m. on a cloudy afternoon, a thin, white ellipsoid or |
| cigar-shaped object that was estimated to be three and a half times   |
| longer than it was high flew on a straight and level flight path over |
| Cambridge, Massachusetts. Mr. Wankowicz, a civilian witness, reported |
| the sighting to the U.S. Air Force. (Source: Project Blue Book files  |

| 1964 - At 11:00 p.m. a yellow-orange light shaped like the bottom of  |
| a ball (hemispherical) was spotted in a field and chased for two      |

| 1967 - At 10:15 p.m. a strange white light chased a car with three    |
| teenagers in Albuquerque, New Mexico then hovered directly overhead   |
| while the car was still moving. After a few moments, the engine and   |
| headlights of the car ceased operating. When the car had come to a    |
| complete stop the light sped away and the car couId then be           |
| restarted. (Source: APRO Bulletin, May-June, 1967, p. 6; Mark         |

| 1974 - Joseph Susedik was asleep in his camper with his wife and two  |
| small children in the pre-dawn hours near Mitchell Caverns,           |
| California when he was awakened by a humming sound and a pulsating    |
| light that reflected on the inside of the camper wall. He tried to    |
| call out to his wife and children but was immobilized. He saw         |
| "pinwheels of odd-shaped colored lights," that were red, orange,      |
| yellow and blue-green in color but could not recall any further       |
| conscious details. He awoke two hours later than usual that morning   |
| with bloodshot eyes and body aches. He had vague impressions of       |
| having been inside a craft but could not recall any specific. He      |
| remembered that he had observed a UFO earlier that evening with other |
| family members.                                                       |

| Later under hypnosis the witness recalled being inside a UFO and      |
| described a row of gyroscopes along an inner wall. "Pinwheels" of     |
| light energized the gyroscopes to form an "artificial gravity field." |
| He described a crew of eight men, seven of whom wore maroon "foil     |
| type uniforms" and one wore a pale blue uniform. One of his examiners |
| looked at his eyes through a magnifying glass. He also saw a "nebulae |
| in various colors showing concentrations of metals and minerals, a    |
| color image close up of Saturn displayed on a coil edged screen, and  |
| three black reclining style high backed chairs at a control panel.    |
| After this incident he claims to have become a prolific inventor.     |

| 1974 - At 10 pm. Mr. A. Rias, a stonemason, was listening to his      |
| radio in his small cabin in the middle of a field in Les Nourradons,  |
| Var, France when static suddenly erupted on the radio. Alarmed, he    |
| armed himself with a gun and went outside. He next caught sight of a  |
| being running through the field and a bright beam of light was shone  |
| upon him. He re-entered the cabin and closed the door. Then he heard  |
| knocks on the door and the cabin shook. His dog started trembling,    |
| terrified. Re-emeging from the cabin, he saw an object resembling a   |
| racecar prototype moving low over the field with two beings inside.   |
| Five other humanoids were walking nearby, moving with heavy steps.    |
| The beings wore khaki uniforms with large belts and a kind of mask    |
| over their faces. One being pointed a glass tube at the witness and a |
| luminous beam of light struck him, paralyzing both him and his dog.   |
| The beings and the strange craft soon left towards a forested area    |
| and disappeared. The next day he saw red lights in the field that     |
| flew away when he approached. Mr. Rias suffered from shock and stayed |
| in bed for the following two days. His dog also appeared to suffer    |
| some discomfort for several days. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |

| 1977 - An ovoid object followed an airliner for 30 seconds over       |
| Dowagiac, Michigan at 4:10 p.m. according to one of the passengers    |
| aboard. The witness, a radio announcer, reported that the object was  |
| larger than the airliner and flew away toward the east. (Source:      |

| 1979 - A disc with three legs for landing gear hovered just a half a  |

| 2000 - The pilot of a DC-9 airliner sighted a domed disc flying at    |
