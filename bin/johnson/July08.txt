| 1947 - There are at least 74 UFO reports recorded for this day in the |
| UFOCAT database. At ten o'clock in the morning an aluminum colored,   |
| pancake shaped object was sighted by a farmer as it flew over         |
| Corapeake, North Carolina. It flew at an estimated 800 mph at 2,000   |
| feet altitude. He described it as having two windows and protruding   |
| pipe-like extensions, and emitting vapor and making a slight noise.   |
| At 11:45 a.m. Eastern Time an ovoid object was sighted over Norfolk,  |
| Virginia. It was seen rocking and spinning, and followed by smaller   |
| objects. An Air Force major observed a metallic object at Muroc Field |
| (now Edwards AFB) in California at noon. The object reflected         |
| sunlight and oscillated up and down in the sky, going down to ground  |
| level then rising again. It was observed simultaneously by a captain  |
| in Rodgers Dry Lake Bed. At the same time a student pilot sighted at  |
| flying disc that looked like it had a hole in its center, flying at   |
| 500 feet altitude over Spokane, Washington. At 5:33 p.m. an object    |
| flew in a zigzag pattern over Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii. At    |
| 9:47 p.m. five teenagers camping out at a golf course in Madison,     |
| Wisconsin saw a flat, brilliant disc close to the horizon. It flew    |
| from the southeast to the northwest very quickly. (Sources: (1)       |

| 1949 - Eight metallic discs flew 300 meters over a boat in a lake at  |
| Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming at seven o'clock in the morning. |
| They were completely silent. (Source: Project Blue Book files counted |

| 1961 - In Beulah, Michigan a bluish-white light with a faint rotating |
| beacon inside was sighted at 11:00 p.m. It had three red and three    |
| white lights inside. It descended to tree top level, and then went    |
| behind the trees. Soon, a red light followed by a white object        |
| emerged from behind the trees; they flew low over the ground, and     |
| then the two lights merged together. (Source: Lloyd Mallan, Official  |

| 1964 - At 10:30 a.m. a man named Senac saw a three meter wide by 1.5  |
| meter tall disc-shaped object hovering low over the roadside of the   |
| D-21 highway in Maraunats, Pyrenees-Atlantique department, France.    |
| Two short humanoids dressed in khaki were also seen walking by a      |
| hedge. (Sources: Fernand LaGarde, FSR, November-December 1969, p. 17; |

| 1965 - A police lieutenant named Haag and fellow police officer in    |
| Sunnyvale, California saw a hovering white object that undulated,     |
| darted back and forth, zig-zagged, and then climbed away at steep     |
| angle. (Source: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A       |

| 1968 - Sr. Aldo Juan Santiago, with Miss Espinoza and her son and a   |
| young friend of the latter, were driving near Canota, Mendoza         |
| province, Argentina on a cold, moonlight night at around 3:00 a.m.    |
| when they saw a luminous object pass over and land near               |
| Villavicencio, about three kilometers away. The object was            |
| fluctuating in color between blue-green and yellow. They stopped and  |
| had a mid-night cookout, and toward the end of their stopover they    |
| witnessed a man approach, walking on the road to Villavicencio. He    |
| walked by making "giant strides," and came up and then passed by them |
| without speaking. He was wearing "a sort of one piece Montgomery,     |
| fastened at the wrists & ankles." It was blue in color, with a hood   |
| over the head, and he seemed to be wearing spectacles. The area was   |
| far from any town and they had seen no one else, and no other car, on |
| the road. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of |

| 1968 - A 20 foot long vertical metallic cylinder with yellow-orange   |
| body lights followed a Cessna 172 light airplane flying over Warren,  |
| Ohio at 10:20 p.m. It darted back-and-forth, then sped away to the    |
| east. The sighting lasted ten minutes and there were four witnesses.  |

| 1971 - A 12 meter long ovoid UFO with portholes around the edge was   |
| seen near the ground in Kervinio-en-Ploemeur, Morbihan department,    |
| France at 6:30 a.m. It turned, then shot away fast. (Source: Lumieres |

| 1971 - Alain G. was tent camping with three adolescent boys in a      |
| grotto about ten kilometers from Rocamadour, Lot department, France   |
| when he heard the sound of breaking branches outside his tent at      |
| around one o'clock in the morning. They were all concerned about      |
| possible prowlers, so he looked out from his tent window and saw a    |
| human-like figure, foggy white in color like a phantom, walking down  |
| a path toward the boy's tent. The farther away the figure went, the   |
| less distinct it became. Stunned, he got up and ran out of his tent   |
| and down the path toward the other tent, but the figure had           |
| disappeared. He got the boys up and they explored the surrounding     |
| area, but they found no one. They then got into his car and they      |
| drove for several kilometers in both directions but found nothing     |
| more unusual. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:          |

| 1974 - A witness named Imolesi had a close encounter with a 15 meter  |
| wide disc-shaped object with a wing over a road in Barbiana, Italy at |
| 10:10 p.m. A 25-foot wide circular trace mark was found on the nearby |
| riverbed. (Source: Ted Phillips, Skylook, February 1975; Maurizio     |

| 1974 - At 12:50 a.m. a luminous disc-shaped object began following a  |
| car with two passengers in Chateauneuf-du-Pape, Vaucluse department,  |
| France. It eluded the car when the car attempted to approach it, then |
| reapproached the car before it shot straight up vertically on         |
| departure. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, April 1975).               |

| 1978 - At midnight a motorist saw a sharp white gleam of light some   |
| 300 meters ahead on the road in Lempdes, Puy-de-Dome, France. As he   |
| came to the curve, he saw that the gleam came from a mass             |
| approximately 5 meters in height. He can not observe the base of the  |
| object, which is below the side of the road. The top was rounded in   |
| the form of a dome, surmounted by a white light. As he drove by he    |
| saw through a transparent wall in the UFO numerous human like figures |
| wearing helmets and tight-fitting suits. He drove away but soon came  |
| back with his wife and her mother, who saw two zigzagging luminous    |
| points of reddish-orange and green lights. Ground traces were found   |
| at the site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |

| 1978 - An 80 meter long ovoid object flew over Katta-Kurgan,          |
| Uzbekistan toward the southeast, then landed in a vineyard at 11:45   |
| p.m. Ground marks were later found on the ground, and the vegetation  |
| (grape vines) were effected. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer         |

| 1996 - Police sergeant Marian Mancu and volunteer police officer      |
| Marcel Rusu were walking on patrol on the main road that passes in    |
| front of the police station in the village of Certesti, Romania at    |
| around midnight. Mancu lives in the area and told Rusu he was going   |
| to walk home to get something to eat. Between the road and the        |
| sidewalk was a deep ditch with small foot bridges across the culvert. |
| When the sergeant passed the corner near his house he heard a         |
| whistling sound from the street and felt a rush of air. He turned     |
| around immediately and saw something on the road that "was splashed   |
| with blue and red lights" and made a "voom-voom" sound. Mancu first   |
| thought it was the district police car that was coming back from a    |
| routine patrol, but getting closer he realized the object was         |
| hovering half a meter above the paved road. There was also a small    |
| strange looking figure moving around it. He yelled for Rusu, who was  |
| now hiding behind the ditch and watching the strange spectacle from   |
| their.                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| Rusu reported that immediately after Mancu had left and gone behind a |
| nearby apartment house, "a fluttering from above appeared". The neon  |
| lighting in the street seemed to change in intensity. The object      |
| descended slowly, without noise, and came down behind him. Rusu       |
| became frightened when he saw the object hovering above the ground,   |
| with three small human-like creatures were moving around it. Both     |
| witnesses agreed that the object had the form of a flat hut, five or  |
| six meters across and two or 2.5 meters high, and it was balancing    |
| about half a meter from the ground. Around the periphery of the       |
| object was a continuous girdle of light "like a rainbow." The colors  |
| changed from red to blue and flared in intensity. On the bottom of    |
| the object was a bright white light. Neither of the witnesses saw any |
| doors, portholes, or other similar features. After about two minutes, |
| the UFO rose vertically. At the moment it moved up to an altitude of  |
| about 30 meters its lights became much brighter, and the neon         |
| streetlights went out. It then shot off to the east at high speed.    |
| Rusu reportedly had a better view of the humanoid creatures than      |
| Mancu, who only noticed one of them from behind. He estimated their   |
| height to have been around a meter or less. Rusu said he heard some   |
| noises made by the humanoids, sounding like "rain in a drain pipe."   |
| Both described the creatures as ugly; they had large heads, very      |
| elongated behind and covered with bumps, with no hair, and large      |
| ears. Their faces were white and they had big eyes. Gray metallic     |
| shiny scales, resembling fish scales, covered their bodies. They also |
| had large, limp protruding bellies. They also had thin spindly arms,  |
| and no noses or mouths were visible. The witnesses thought that the   |
| creatures floated just above the ground and moved around "as if they  |
| were drunk." A huge sweet cherry tree nearby had around 15 % of its   |
| leaves shriveled as if by extreme heat. Other witnesses in nearby     |
| villages reported strange lights over the area the same night.        |

| 2005 - A bright silver cigar-shaped UFO was sighted coming out of a   |
| cloud near a military base in Killeen, Texas at 12:35 p.m. Within ten |
| seconds it disappeared into another cloud but never reappeared.       |
