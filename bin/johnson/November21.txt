| 1968 - A woman was on a bus that stopped for a while in Macedo, Sao   |
| Paulo State, Brazil. At 9:30 p.m. she saw at the bus station there,   |
| about 40 yards away, a domed metallic UFO the size of a small car,    |
| which was hovering only a few feet above the ground. Around the rim   |
| of the craft were a row of changing lights that gave the impression   |
| of it rotating, and beneath it a patch of violet light was cast onto  |
| the ground. A door in the object was open, with three steps below it, |
| and standing in front of the UFO were three six-foot tall figures of  |
| human appearance, wearing skin-tight, shiny black coveralls and shiny |
| black boots. The suits were one-piece, with hoods covering the heads, |
| so that only the face was left exposed. One of the men was carrying a |
| cylinder 2 feet long and 3 inches thick, with a thinner tube of       |
| aluminum like material coiled around it in a spiral. Facing the       |
| beings was a crowd of about 20 people, including three police         |
| officers, who had their guns drawn, and two police cars were parked   |
| nearby. After a short while a beam of silver light shot forth from    |
| the cylinder and the people closest to the beings were paralyzed,     |
| while the others felt dazed as if in a faint. The UFOnauts calmly     |
| walked back to their craft, which they then boarded, and the          |
| craft took off and rapidly climbed out of sight. The duration of the  |
| entire incident was about 15 minutes. (Sources: Nigel Rimes, FSR,     |

| dusk in Plattonville, Louisiana when he saw two bright luminous       |
| objects flying low over some nearby houses. He pursued them, running  |
| down a farm road, and came upon one of the objects resting on the     |
| ground at the edge of a woods. Its brightness dazzled him so that he  |
| had to cover his eyes. Having the feeling that someone was watching   |
| him, he turned and saw a strange figure just behind him. He his       |
| astonishment he turned run, but ran straight into the figure and was  |
| knocked to the ground. He picked himself up and took off running      |
| again, thoroughly frightened. The figure was small, reaching only to  |
| Lance's chest, but was stocky. It had no neck and had a "pushed in"   |
| nose similar to a Pekinese. The color of its skin was "bluish" like   |
| "a bruise." The teen reported the encounter immediately to his        |
| father, who took him to the sheriff's office where a complete report  |
| was made. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of |
