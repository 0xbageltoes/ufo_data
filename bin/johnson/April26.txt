| 1897 - A lawyer was surprise to see a lighted object fly over as he   |
| was driving his carriage three miles north of Aquila, Texas. His      |
| horse shied and nearly toppled the carriage. When the main light was  |
| turned off, a number of smaller lights became visible ont he          |
| underside of the dark object, which supported an elongated carriage.  |
| The airship went down toward a hill to the south, five kilometers     |
| from Aquila, Texas. When the witness was on his way back, one hour    |
| later, he saw the object ascending. It reached the altitude of the    |
| cloud ceiling and flew to the northeast at a fantastic speed with     |
| periodic flashes of light. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to       |

| 1954 - What first appeared to be a flaming ring made sharp turns in   |
| the sky over a school in Newburyport, Massachusetts at around 3:30    |
| p.m. It resolved into a solid silver, disc-shaped object with a dark  |
| center and protruding top. It made an intense roaring sound that      |
| lasted five seconds. It left a bright white tail in descent, and flew |
| off rapidly to the southeast. At 8:35 p.m. 15 balls of light in a     |
| V-formation buzzed a University of Georgia professor of aeronautics   |
| and four other witnesses in Athens, Georgia. (Sources: (1) Richard    |

| 1958 - At 9:05 p.m. a red hot coal-like object streaked across the    |
| sky over Adelaide, South Australia. It made a hissing noise. (Source: |

| 1959 - Luis Da Silva had seen a red colored disc in the sky before he |
| went to bed in Sao Paulo, Brazil and when he awoke at midnight he     |
| felt a compulsion to go out into his garden, where he found a note    |
| telling him to return the next night at 1:30 a.m. He did so, and a    |
| circular UFO appeared at a low altitude, perhaps 100 meters. He felt  |
| paralyzed and unable to move. In a spiral a man descended from the    |
| UFO but did not quite touch the ground. He wore a helmet and was clad |
| in plastic looking clothing, with gloves that looked transparent like |
| glass. He told Da Silva to return again on Thursday at 2:05 a.m. and  |
| then re-ascended in a spiral to his craft. On Thursday the same       |
| sequence of events occurred, but this time three entities descended,  |
| one at a time. The last of these beings asked Da Silva for a sheet of |
| paper, and he inscribed upon it a message consisting of               |
| undecipherable markings. (Sources: Flying Saucer Review, May-June     |

| 1964 - An interesting photograph was taken this day in Burgh le       |
| Marsh, Cumbria, England. A Mr. Templeton took a photograph of a       |
| little girl holding a nosegay of flowers in the early afternoon. Not  |
| seen at the time was what appears to be the image of a man standing   |
| behind her, dressed in a white spacesuit. (Sources: Flying Saucer     |

| 1964 - At 12:30 p.m. Orlando Gallegos observed a bright, metallic,    |
| egg-shaped object about 70 meters away, on the ground, north of La    |
| Madera, New Mexico. Blue flames appeared to circle the base of the    |
| machine, which was silent and about the length of a telephone pole.   |
| Scorch marks and four imprints were found, according to Police Capt.  |
| Martin Vigil. Also on the same day, a thirty-foot wide silver,        |
| inverted bathtup-shaped UFO was sighted near Truth of Consequences,   |
| New Mexico by a Mr. Mitropolis. It was seen a quarter of a mile to    |
| the east, flew up over a mountain, then down out of sight near the    |
| Caballo Reservoir. (Sources: (1) Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: |

| 1965 - At 5:00 p.m. Gary W., age 9, in New London, Minnesota saw an   |
| object which came down silently and hovered at ground level, 60       |
| meters away. A sort of periscope emerged from the craft, and a        |
| strange noise, which was also heard by the boy's father, was noted.   |
| After a couple of minutes the "periscope" disappeared, the object     |
| rose, and then dashed up into the sky at unbelievable speed.          |

| 1966 - A young man was driving his car in Follansbee, West Virginia   |
| at 11:30 p.m. when he saw a silent UFO shaped like two bowls glued    |
| together. It flew at 30 meters altitude, ahead of his car. He         |
| estimated the diameter of the object at 10 meters. He drove away as   |
| quickly as he could without looking back. (Sources: Jacques Vallee:   |

| 1967 - At 8:30 p.m. a Miss Roberts of St. Catherines, Ontario saw a   |
| blindingly red object ascend into the sky, then turn a green color.   |
| It next shot beams of light at a dog on the ground, and made an exit  |
| with erratic maneuvers. In nearby Waterloo, Ontario at 9:00 p.m. a    |
| Mr. Dorscht saw an oil-drum shaped cylinder descend from the sky,     |
| extend six legs, and then land on his farm. The 1.5 meter tall object |
| left behind six landing imprints in the ground after it departed. At  |
| 9:30 p.m. EDT a witness in Kitchener, Ontario saw a small cylinder,   |
| estimated to be 3 feet in diameter and 5 feet tall, with flashing     |
| lights. The object landed, deploying six legs when it was about four  |
| feet from the ground. A whirring sound during landing stopped once    |
| the object was at rest. Ground impressions (physical traces) were     |
| found at the landing site. (Sources: (1) NICAP UFO Investigator, June |

| 1967 - On this night in Mount St. Helens, Washington two teenagers    |
| saw a saucer-shaped object with a dome. It had a swept back wing, and |
| red body lights. As it pursued the witnesses' car and illuminated it  |
| with a light beam, a whistling sound could be heard. The object then  |
| turned away and started to follow a truck that passed. (Sources:      |

| 1969 - On this evening David Arychuk was out walking his dog in       |
| Calgary, Alberta when he saw a circular object with three pulsating   |
| red lights around the top, 200 yards away from him. The UFO was about |
| 30 feet in diameter and 20 feet high, and cream-colored with a pitted |
| surface. He smelled a rather nauseating odor of "sweet bitterness"    |
| that was in the air. One hundred yards away stood two humanoid        |
| beings, "taller than normal," wearing dark clothing. David yelled out |
| "Hey you!" and they walked around behind the UFO. His dog refused to  |
| go on and was shivering from fright. By the time David came back to   |
| the site with his stepfather the UFO was gone, but the odor was still |
| present the next day. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1969 - Sr. Robler's watch stopped when he drove his car under a       |
| luminous red, cone-shaped UFO on a highway between Ibiuna and Sao     |
| Paulo, Brazil in Sao Paulo State at 4:30 a.m. (Sources: Hans          |

| 1974 - Forty-one year old Oscar Patero failed to return from a short  |
| business trip that he embarked upon on this day. Five or six days     |
| later he was found rain soaked and covered with ticks on a thousand   |
| foot mountain near Colatina in the state of Espiritu Santo, Brazil,   |
| which was over 900 kilometers from his home. He said that a light     |
| appeared at around 11:30 p.m. just before he crossed a bridge while   |
| driving between Catanduva and Julio de Mesquita, Sao Paulo, Brazil.   |
| In fact, his car was found there. Under hypnosis he revealed that he  |
| had been taken aboard a UFO and been given a physical exam, but he    |
| resisted giving any further details except to say that a tall,        |
| fair-haired and blue-eyed young man was one of the aliens. The man    |
| was described as about 5 feet 8 inches tall with a small nose and     |
| small ears. He revealed that this was actually his second UFO         |
| encounter, because he had given a ride to this same individual        |
| previously on the night of his first encounter. (Sources: Gordon      |

| 1975 - A UFO dove at spectators who had stopped to watch it along the |
| side of a highway in Gerena, Sevilla, Spain, causing the witnesses to |
| panic. The six witnesses got back into their cars and drove away, but |
| were chased for two miles. The red, elongated or ovoid object came so |
| close that the drivers were dazzled by the light. When they pulled    |
| into a filling station for santuary the light finally shot off        |
| rapidly to the east. The incident lasted approximately eight minutes. |

| 1994 - At 1:10 p.m. a distant white, disc-shaped UFO hovered over     |
| Santa Rosa Sound as witnessed from Gulf Breeze, Florida. It created a |

| 2000 - At around 2:00 a.m. several residents living on the slopes of  |
| a hill in Tocopilla, Antofagasta Province, Chile saw a strange        |
| looking entity climb rapidly up the side of a steep hill. It moved up |
| a practically vertical cliff using reptilian like movements, and      |
| seemed to expand as if it possessed dark wing-like membranes on its   |
| back, which may have helped propell it up the cliff. Once it reached  |
| the summit witnesses began hearing strange growling and screeching    |
| sounds coming from the top. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |

| 2001 - In Mount Gambier, South Australia at 7:00 p.m. there was a     |
| procession of orange/red fireballs that passed from west to east. The |
| second followed the first at a 5 minute interval, then 20 minutes     |
| passed before the third object, and then five minutes again until the |
| fourth one passed. They all travelled beneath the cloud line. One     |
| went out completely, while the others faded in the distance. At 7:45  |
| p.m. there was another procession of objects. Another object was seen |
| in the sky, then another one 5-6 minutes later, then a third one came |
| from the northwest direction, which moved east toward Victoria.       |
