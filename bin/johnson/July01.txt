| 1947 - Radar operators at Chitose Army Air Base on Hokkaido, Japan    |
| picked up an unidentified target 16 miles north of the base on course |
| of 180 degrees and a speed in excess of 500 mph. The target reversed  |
| course, broke up into two responses, then merged back together again  |
| into one large response. (Source: Jan Aldrich, Project 1947 Research  |

| 1947 - Dr. G. Oliver Doctor saw a 'flying disc' zip over the city of  |
| El Paso, Texas on this day. It was shaped like two pie pans           |
| rim-to-rim, and was estimated to be 30 feet in diameter. It hurtled   |
| over Mount Franklin and then flew off towards Mexico. (Source: Jan    |

| 1947 - At 9:58 p.m a red disc-shaped object flew north to south at    |
| an extremely fast speed over Charleston, South Carolina. It had been  |
| seen earlier at Wilmington, North Carolina at 9:30 p.m. (Sources:     |

| 1947 - Late in the evening at around 11:00 p.m. thirteen silver       |
| disc-shaped objects flew over Albuquerque, New Mexico. They flew      |
| first toward the south, then turned to the east, and finally flew off |
| to the west. A blue disc was also seen zig-zagging in the             |
| northwestern sky. (Sources: Albuquerque Journal, July 2, 1947; Ted    |

| 1952 - Lynn, Massachusetts - At about 7:25 in the morning two F-94's   |
| were scrambled to intercept a UFO that a Ground Observer Corps        |
| spotter reported was travelling southwest across Boston. Radar        |
| couldn't pick it up so the jets were vectored into the general area.  |
| At 7:30 a.m. a man and his wife in Lynn noticed the two vapor trails  |
| from the F-94 interceptors and looked around the sky to see if they   |
| could spot what the jets were after. They saw a bright silver         |
| cigar-shaped object "about six times as long as it was wide" moving   |
| southwest. As they watched they saw an identical UFO was following    |
| the first one some distance back. Both were moving just a little      |
| faster than the two jets. The UFOs appeared to be at a very high      |
| altitude, and the couple watched as the two F-94's searched back and  |
| forth far below the UFOs. The Air Force lists the explanation of the  |
| objects as probable balloons. (Source: Edward J. Ruppelt, The Report  |
| on Unidentified Flying Objects. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1956, pg. |

| 1953 - On this day or the next, at around 11:00 a.m. in Villares del  |
| Saz, Cuenca, Spain an illiterate cowherd, 14-year-old Maximo          |
| Munos-Olivares Hernaiz, heard an intermittent whistling soung behind  |
| him. When he turned around he saw a "big balloon" on the ground. It   |
| was shaped like a water jug and was metallic in appearance. Through   |
| an opening came three dwarfs 60 cm tall, with yellow faces, narrow    |
| eyes, and oriental features. They spoke in a language he could not    |
| understand. They were dressed in blue, had a sort of flat hat with a  |
| visor in front, and a metal sheet on their arms. One of them smacked  |
| the boy's face, then they re-entered the machine, which glowed very   |
| brightly, made a soft whistling sound and went off "like a rocket."   |
| There were footprints left behind at the site and four holes 5 cm     |
| deep forming a perfect square, 36 cm on each side, that were found by |
| the police. (Sources: Antonio Ribera, in Charles Bowen (editor), The  |

| 1965 - A domed disc-shapec object flew over Beijing, China at 10:00   |
| p.m. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 218).                    |

| 1965 - One of the most famous landing and humanoid reports occurred   |
| on this day in Valensole, Alpes-Haut-Provence department, France. At  |
| around five o'clock in the morning farmer Maurice Masse, age          |
| 41, heard a strange noise and saw an egg-shaped object 30 meters away |
| in a field of lavender. The craft was set on a central pivot with six |
| legs, was about five meters long, and had a door showing two seats    |
| back to back. Nearby it were two dwarfs the size of eight-year-old    |
| children, with bald heads, normal human eyes, and fine hands with     |
| five fingers. They seemed surprised when the witness approached them, |
| and stopped their examination of a plant to aim a small device at     |
| him, causing him to become temporarily paralyzed and unable to move.  |
| They spoke among themselves in shrill sounds similar to a gargle. The |
| craft took off and "vanished" into the air. Ground traces were found  |
| in the field. (Sources:Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century |

| 1965 - On this night many witnesses in Framingham, Massachusetts saw  |
| a silvery white round object, which made side-to-side pendulum        |
| swings, then flew away to the north. (Source: APRO Bulletin,          |

| 1968 - Returning home at four o'clock in the morning after a dance,   |
| 17-year-old Raul Salcedo encountered two very tall strange beings in  |
| Ricardone, Entre Rios, Argentina. They were nearly 10 feet tall. He   |
| "felt himself drawn towards them by the powerful magnetism radiated   |
| by them," which temporarily immobilized him, but he was able to break |
| free and fled home in terror. There was simultaneously a spate of UFO |
| sightings locally and in nearby San Lorenzo. (Sources: Jacques        |

| 1968 - At 12:30 p.m. three boys in Botucatu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil  |
| saw a disc-shaped object on the ground about eight meters wide and    |
| 350 meters away. It had a large tripod undercarriage and a ladder     |
| reaching down to the ground. These landing devices were retracted     |
| inside the object, and the object rose a few meters into the air,     |
| then flew off at high speed. Physical traces included the ground      |
| marks left behind by the tripod landing gear: imprints 7m x 6.8m x    |
| 5.45m apart, and marks left by the ladder. There was also a residual  |
| "gunpowder" smell, and the boys thought they heard a "tingling" sound |
| during the encounter. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia:  |

| 1968 - A man, who lived in a third floor apartment along with his     |
| wife and young son, was watching television around midnight with his  |
| wife. It was a hot and humid summer night in Norwich, Connecticut.    |
| Suddenly the TV reception began to snow, and then they heard crying   |
| coming from the child's room. The man then caught a glimpse of        |
| someone in the room and ran to see who it was. When he got to the     |
| bedroom window he saw the figure fly away to a point about 200 feet   |
| up and several hundred feet south of the apartment building. It was   |
| headed towards a UFO that was ruby red in color. In seconds the       |
| figure was like a silver dot that had merged with the object along    |
| with 3 or 4 other dots. The object then rose to about 1000 feet and   |
| went southwest at high speed. The creature was described as about     |
| four-foot tall with large eyes and fang-like teeth. Its arms were     |
| disproportionately long, like an ape's arms. It wore a silvery        |
| colored suit and its feet did not appear to touch the ground. It      |
| seemed to float across the room and went out the open window.         |

| 1969 - At 6:15 a.m. Mr. Fred Yoos, age 62, heard a clattering sound   |
| that shook the building in Olds, Alberta, Canada. Looking out a       |
| window, he saw a 20 foot green oval-shaped object descend from a      |
| dense cloud in the northwest. It hovered just above the ground 50     |
| feet away. By the light of the rising sun he could see the movement   |
| of two figures through a window-like opening. The object ascended     |
| vertically, leaving an imprint. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted        |

| 1973 - Jarmo Nykanen was staying at his lakeside summer cottage in    |
| Sounenjoki, Finland when he awoke to a buzzing sound in the early     |
| morning hours. The cottage was being bathed in a strong blue light.   |
| Going outside, Jarmo saw a blue light "twice as big as a row boat"    |
| approach from over the lake. It stopped and hovered offshore. The     |
| light seemed to radiate from a kind of "jelly," glowing in an unusual |
| manner. Jarmo thought he could see a strange being inside the light.  |
| The next thing he remembered he was lying on the porch of his cottage |
| porch at about 6:00 a.m. He had lost track of four hours of time.     |

| 1975 - Hamden, Connecticut - At 9:20 p.m. two witnesses were sitting   |
| on their porch when they noticed a bright red oval shoot across the   |
| nearby tree tops. The object was moving at a height of 100 feet above |
| the nearby trees, and covered the distance on three city blocks in    |
| approximately 15 seconds. During the sighting static interfered with  |
| television reception, and the family dog was upset for a few minutes  |
| immediately following the sighting. (Sources: "From the Center for    |
| UFO Studies", FSR, April 1976, p. 24).                                |

| 2001 - On this evening a couple riding bikes in a wooded area of      |
| Palmerston, Ontario, Canada observed a group of tall humanoid beings  |
| covered with brown hair. They seemed to be holding or carrying        |
| unusual devices. The hairy beings fled into the woods when they       |
| noticed the witnesses. Around the same time there were numerous       |
| reports of low flying glowing orange disc-shaped UFOs over the area.  |

| 2001 - Odete Fortini was standing on the verandah of her house in     |
| Paracambi, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil on this night when she        |
| observed a ball of light approach and land about 200 meters away.     |
| When the light dimmed she could see that it was a disc-shaped object  |
| with a cupola on top and several small windows around its             |
| circumference. In the center of the object a door opened, and two     |
| one-meter tall humanoids stepped out. They appeared to be interested  |
| in the vegetation around the object. After a few minutes of           |
| investigation, they re-entered the object, which became bright again  |
| and took off at high speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |

| 2001 - On the same night eight-year-old Zeca Borba of Guaraja-Mirim,  |
| Para State, Brazil reported encountering and communicating with a     |
| short bluish-skinned humanoid with a large head and big eyes. The     |
| humanoid carried something that looked like a cane, and wore a        |
| silvery helmet. After 30 minutes the humanoid boarded a triangular    |
| shaped object, which quickly disappeared. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, |
