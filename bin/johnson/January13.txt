| 1910 -  Several thousand people in Chattanooga, Tennessee watched a   |
| white cigar-shaped object that passed rapidly over the city at around |
| 11:00 a.m. at 500 to 1,000 feet altitude. It disappeared into a bank  |
| of smoke along the river. "Flags on the custom house hung limp [so    |
| the wind]…would not have propelled a...balloon." (Sources: Donald E.  |

| 1957 - Two men, West and Liddell, watched as a forty meter in         |
| diameter fluorescent oval-shaped object nearly touched down on the    |
| grass in Balfour, New Zealand at 3:10 a.m., but it jumped away as the |
| two men approached. It changed to a bluish-white sphere with a dark   |
| red center. It cleared a fence, and then vanished. (Source: Richard   |

| 1958 - At 6:30 p.m. in Casino, New South Wales, Australia Brian       |
| Crittendon, age 21, was chased by a dome-shaped object that emitted a |
| narrow light beam toward the ground. He was so frightened that he     |
| drove home on a flat tire, followed for five kilometers by the        |
| object, which was about 50 meters away from him and 10 meters above   |
| ground. It overtook his car at a speed in excess of 100 km/h. Radio   |
| interference was noted but the UFO made no noise. There was an        |
| independent witness to the UFO. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs in the |

| 1959 - A witness driving alone in Bygholm, Denmark saw a stationary   |
| object ahead in the sky. After about five seconds the object moved    |
| toward the car and passed over it at a height of 100 meters. The      |
| car's engine stopped at this point but the headlights were not        |
| affected. The object, which now changed color from yellow-green to    |
| yellow-white, moved quickly away into the west. (Sources: Richard     |

| 1959 - At 7:00 a.m. Robert Collins, while driving a pick-up truck     |
| near Greenville, Pennsylvania, noticed lights in the sky he thought   |
| were a plane making an emergency landing. The lights eventually       |
| coalesced into a single bright light. This light then hovered over    |
| his truck for several minutes. His truck's engine, lights, and radio  |
| failed at this point. The light, which was too bright for Mr. ColIins |
| to discern any structure, departed quickly to the west and out of     |
| sight in 30 seconds. The truck then could be restarted. (Sources:     |

| 1967 - Nine-year old Freddie Amos woke up at 1:30 a.m. in his         |
| farmhouse in Iola, Kansas to see a round object hovering motionless   |
| low over an adjoining field. It was 25 feet in diameter, had a dome   |
| on top, short wing-like protrusions, and three wheels on its          |
| underside. There were red lights on the ends of the "wings," and a    |
| blue light on top of the dome. A man stood inside the dome looking    |
| out, and another man was visible sitting behind a console behind him. |
| The man standind wore a "crinkly" green uniform that covered him      |
| entirely; his face was in shadow and his facial features could not be |
| seen. This "terrible" man frightened the boy although he could not    |
| say why. He got back into bed but continued to watch the object,      |
| which circled his house and hovered again for five minutes back in    |
| its original position before flying off. In the morning some of their |
| cows were found to have broken through the fence around their         |
| pasture. One had broken her leg. A pond in the pasture near the site  |
| continued to remain unfrozen although the temperatures were well      |
| below freezing. This encounter occurred during a minor concentration  |
| of UFO sightings at nearby locales. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted    |

| 1967 - At 10:00 p.m. Pilot Carl M., a flight officer, and passenger   |
| Jimmie Moran on a Lear Jet 23 en route from Houston, Texas to Las     |
| Vegas, Nevada flying at 41,000 feet and 300 knots saw a red oval      |
| luminous object in the 10 o'clock position. The object split into     |
| four similar red oval objects vertically a number of times, each      |
| separated by about 2,000 ft and each emitting a "red ray". They then  |
| retracted up into the top object. Albuquerque radar tracked the       |
| object 39 miles ahead of the Lear jet moving on the same heading,     |
| with no transponder signal. The object blinked off visually for 30    |
| seconds then blinked back on. Albuquerque control contacted a         |
| National Airlines DC-8 over Casa Grande, Arizona, whose pilot         |
| confirmed the Lear Jet pilot's reports. Albuquerque control warned    |
| the Lear that the object suddenly darted towards the Lear at high     |
| speed, and within seconds the radar blips merged. The object flooded  |
| the Lear Jet with intense red light so bright the pilot had           |
| difficulty seeing his instrument panel, and it maintained a position  |
| in front of the Lear for a few minutes. Then, it blinked off-on again |
| and started to fall back behind the left wing, but then pulled        |
| forward again. When the object blinked off the Albuquerque radar      |
| controllers would lose contact with the object, then regain it when   |
| it blinked on again. Both the UFO and Lear jet made left turns over   |
| Winslow, Arizona, when Los Angeles ARTC Center radar picked up both   |
| targets. Past Flagstaff the object climbed at a 30° angle             |
| disappearing to the west in less than 10 seconds. (Source: J. Allen   |

| 1968 - At 6:20 a.m. in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania a large round      |
| white object, at times reddish, emitted smaller satellite objects     |
| that maneuvered independently. The larger UFO was 40 to 50 feet in    |
| diameter UFO and about 350 feet in the air. It rose slowly, and gave  |
| off a white haze. The white light then changed color from red         |
| to reddish-orange then back to white. It emitted four small red balls |
| of light from a hatch, then five white ones. There were at least 20   |
| witnesses. That night in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania the Rev. R.          |
| Mossir reported sighting four pulsating objects leaving a white UFO,  |
| which seemed to explode in the sky after the red objects left it.     |

| 1969 - In Vado Ligure, Italy at around 6 p.m. an eight meter          |
| in diameter circular object was seen taking off from a construction   |
| site, crushed grass was found at the landing site. (Sources: Larry    |

| 1970 - A witness riding on a motorcycle on highway D123 north of      |
| Cramoisy in Oise department, France encountered a low flying, slow    |
| moving, 10 meter long sausage-shaped object with a row of portholes   |
| in front at 6:45 a.m. The witness felt sick later. (Source: Larry     |

| 1977 - At 12:30 a.m. a 17-year-old woman driving in Plantation,       |
| Florida had her car paced by a disc-shaped object. It engaged in      |
| erratic maneuvers, and then was joined by a second disc. Both objects |
| flew off to the east. They did not appear on radar. (Source: Allan    |

| 1979 - On this evening, perhaps as early as 4:30 p.m., a 50-year-old  |
| farmer named Mancini in Viterbo, Italy spotted a large blindingly     |
| bright fiery red sphere descend in a nearby pasture. The sphere       |
| changed colors to a bright orange and then to red, and finally dimmed |
| to reveal a two-meter wide metallic sphere. A small man only 20       |
| inches tall, wearing a silvery white suit, emerged from the object    |
| and walked around the object, frequently bending down as if he was    |
| picking things up. Frightened, the witness ran away from the scene.   |
| The object took off and flew to the northwest. (Sources: Jane Thomas, |

| 1979 - At 11:50 a.m. a 12-year-old boy named Suarez, the son of the   |
| school's janitor, was alone in a school room in Loreto, Santiago del  |
| Estero province, Argentina when he heard a sudden noise. Looking      |
| around, he saw a rectangular silvery object, five feet tall by two    |
| feet wide and three feet long, hovering a few inches above the        |
| schoolyard ground. Two flaps opened on the sides of the object and    |
| two little men emerged and descended. Each was about three feet tall  |
| and dressed in shiny aluminum colored one-piece coveralls, and their  |
| hands had only four fingers. Both wore helmets with dark faceplates   |
| that covered the eyes. They each had a device with a tube and         |
| clock-like instrument attached. They entered the school and one being |
| grabbed the boy. A voice coming from the object spoke to him in       |
| Spanish telling him to sit down. Once seated the boy was paralyzed    |
| and unable to move from the chair, while one of the beings went into  |
| another room and the other went back inside the object. A reddish     |
| beam of light from the object knocked the witness out. When he woke   |
| up later the object and beings were gone, but a strong sulphurous     |
| odor remained behind. (Sources: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping         |

| 2000 - Three pinkish-red objects were sighted travelling in vertical  |

| 2000 - Late on this night in Jacksonville, Florida a woman suddenly   |
| awoke to find herself being dropped onto her bed by a non-human       |
| looking entity. Close to her face she saw a huge head on a thin body. |
| At the same time she felt a puff of breath coming from the entity's   |
| open mouth. She sensed that the being was surprised that she had      |
| woken up. Although terrified, she still fell asleep. (Source: Albert  |
