| 1897 - A large glaring light circled for a few minutes in the sky     |
| over Hastings, Nebraska at 9:30 p.m. It then descended to an altitude |
| of 200 feet, traveled at a remarkable speed, slowed, and again        |
| circled for 15 more minutes. Finally, it descended once more and      |
| disappeared mysteriously. (Source: Philip L. Rife, It Didn't Start    |

| 1948 - At shortly after two a.m. in Circleville, Ohio a Mr.           |

| 1954 - Two bright white objects approached a cosmic ray research      |
| balloon over Tuscaloosa, Alabama at 2:00 p.m. It was witnessed by     |
| several scientists from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and one   |
| of them named Baumgartner took some photographs. The first two        |
| objects were joined by four others. (Sources: Project Blue Book files |

| farm country in Ladapeyre, France beginning at 11:30 p.m. (Source:    |

| 1967 - At 9:00 p.m. three witnesses in Boadilladel Monte, Spain       |
| independently saw a craft emitting light signals land a few meters    |
| away. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of      |

| 1968 - On this night a sentry at Cinco Picos AFB on the Azores        |
| Islands, Sr. Serafin Viera Sebastiao, age 36, noticed interference on |
| his transistor radio then saw a UFO so close to the ground that he    |
| could see four occupants. The metallic oval object was topped by a    |
| transparent "tower" with a small balustrade against which two of the  |
| beings were leaning. The other two could be seen as silhouettes       |
| inside the transparent tower. After telephoning another sentry he     |
| approached and shone his flashlight on the craft. He was enveloped in |
| smoke emitted by the UFO and fell to the ground in a faint, where the |
| other sentry found him a few minutes later. (Sources: FSR,            |

| 1968 - At 8:15 p.m. two men six miles west of Vernal, Utah named      |
| Allred and Barton saw a reddish orange ball of light that was much    |
| larger than the biggest star. It moved rapidly, blinked on-off, and   |
| disappeared in the south. (Source: Frank B. Salisbury, The Utah UFO   |
| Display, Appendix case 60).                                           |

| 1978 - At 10:20 p.m. the witness saw a large silvery disc-shaped      |
| object shoot overhead and land behind some nearby trees in            |
| Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England. Two figures about six feet tall  |
| were next seen standing next to the landed UFO. Both were human       |
| looking wearing silvery suits. The UFO then left the area at very     |
| high speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database     |

| 1993 - At 12:30 a.m. in Noranda, Western Australia Kylie C. awoke and |
| saw a small figure standing beside her bed, halfway down the side. At |
| the foot of her bed stood three taller beings. The smaller figure had |
| dark almond-shaped eyes, small nostrils, and thin lips. Its head was  |
| bald and prominent. It had a potbelly and appeared to have only three |
| fingers on each hand. The witness felt the desire to reach out and    |
| touch the figure as an overwhelming feeling of love and compassion    |
| embraced her, but she was unable to move or call out. The being moved |
| back and disappeared, but before it did it gave her a telepathic      |
| message that "its not time yet." The following morning she was sore   |
| behind the ears and found some small pin pricks in the same area.     |

| 1994 - At 8:30 p.m. the witness's vehicle engine stalled in           |
| Badalucco, Italy as a silvery cigar-shaped craft hovered over the     |
| road. The craft then directed several beams of light towards the      |
| ground. A humanoid figure is also seen standing on the road near the  |
| vehicle. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1994,  |
| case # 2506, citing Jan Aldrich, Project 1947 website).               |

| 1998 - At around 2:30 a.m. Rowena Judd was asleep in her bedroom in   |
| Freemantle, Western Australia when she suddenly awoke to see a        |
| humanoid figure standing at her bedroom door. The figure seemed to be |
| dark in color and had a shining light around it. No facial features   |
| could be seen. It seemed to disappear. Two weeks later a beam of      |
| light came out of the sky after a loud zipping noise and illuminated  |
| the Judd house. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database |
