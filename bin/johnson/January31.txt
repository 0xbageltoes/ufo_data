| 1916 -  Royal Flying Corps pilot Lt. Morgan was flying at 5000 feet   |
| over Rochford, Essex, England on this evening on the lookout for      |
| Zeppelins. At 8:25 p.m. he saw an object with a row of lights like    |
| the windows on a railway carriage with the blinds drawn. He tried to  |
| close but his airplane's engine started malfunctioning. When he fired |
| a pistol at the lights they rose rapidly into the heavens and         |
| disappeared out of sight. (Sources: Richard H. Hall,  From Airships   |

| 1960 -  Six in a boat on the ocean on the coast of Lae, Papua New     |
| Guinea saw a 14 meter diameter umbrella-shaped craft swaying back and |
| forth in the sky in overcast skies at around five o'clock in the      |
| morning. It had four windows on the underside. It shot up vertically. |

| 1963 - An object was reported to have landed in Ganada de Algosaray,  |
| Argentina. The Lopez brothers found traces in the grass and evidence  |
| of intense heat. There was a police investigation, during which a     |
| whitish powder was found at the landing site. (Source: Jacques        |

| 1965 - At 6:15 p.m. three men sighted two discs hovering over some    |
| high-tension power lines between Kent and Renton, Washington. The     |
| UFOs appeared to be connected to each other. (Sources: Coral E.       |

| 1965 - On the same night a group of people in Torrent, Argentina in   |
| the province of Corrientes saw a craft land and five tall, "Cyclops"  |
| beings (i.e. creatures with only one eye in the middle of their       |
| foreheads) emerge. The creatures entered a house and reportedly       |
| attempted to abduct a local man, but were driven off. (Sources:       |

| 1969 - At around 8:00 p.m. a small “space ship” approached General    |
| Moacyr Uchoa and his investigating team on Wilson P. Gusmao’s         |
| Alexania Fazenda, Goias State, Brazil where UFO sightings had been    |
| occurring frequently for more than a year. It performed some          |
| maneuvers before landing 100 meters away. Senor Gusmao left the group |
| of investigators and walked up to within a meter of the vessel, which |
| he found to be only two meters long and a meter wide, hovering 18     |
| inches above the ground. A door in the top of the craft opened, and a |
| crew member stood up in the hatch. He looked at Gusmao while          |
| manipulating something on his belt, which Gusmao thought was a        |
| camera. Then he turned around, and as if obeying an order a big light |
| arose from the nearby ridge. The occupant then turned to face Gusmao, |
| and he put his hand on his belt again, causing a luminous halo to     |
| surround his body. After this, the onlookers could see him only as a  |
| ball of light. Then, with a slight gesture, he slipped down again     |
| into the craft, which took off rapidly. (Sources: Moacyr Alfredo      |

| 1974 -  A V-Shaped light appeared over a car northeast of Tarbes on   |
| highway N21, France around two o'clock in the morning in the          |
| Pyrenees. The four witnesses felt heat and electricity, and later had |
| headaches. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer database case 11084;     |

| 1978 -  John C., age 10, and his friends Eddy and Michael H. (8 and   |
| 10 years old) were playing on the ice in the playing field of the     |
| Montvale Memorial Elementary School in Montvale, New Jersey at 6:15   |
| p.m. It was dark, and the school's floodlights illuminated the field. |
| The boys then noticed a "plane" like object that passed slowly over   |
| the field. Moments later a second object arrived, which was described |
| as shaped like a square with large yellow lights in each corner, with |
| a slight dome on top and a red light underneath. The object emitted a |
| red beam of light towards the ground, but stopped short before        |
| touching it. They next noticed several humanoid figures moving around |
| the school park, walking stiffly. These figures were of average       |
| height and bald headed, and dressed in bright yellow outfits with     |
| boots and gloves. One of the beings looked different, because he had  |
| a larger head which seemed "creased" down the middle and had on a     |
| brown cape over the yellow suit. As the boys watched the figures,     |
| they noted an uncanny silence and an unpleasant sulphur like odor in  |
| the area. The figures walked away towards the nearby Public Works     |
| Garage. The boys then noticed another figure, this one a woman        |
| standing in the parking lot. She had medium long brown hair and wore  |
| a dark suit with blue fur around her shoulders and when she walked,   |
| she did as if in slow motion. She sat down on a low fence then raised |
| her arm very slowly and pointed to the sky, apparently at another     |
| hovering square shaped object. The woman then also walked towards the |
| Public Works building and at one point seemed to appear and disappear |
| as a police vehicle drove by near her. (Source: International UFO     |

| 1988 -  A woman had a close encounter with a silent charcoal black    |
| triangular object while driving in the suburban town of Eureka,       |
| Pennsylvania at 6:50 p.m. The object passed only 30 feet above her    |
| car. It had three bright white headlights on the side facing her when |
| sighted, six small white lights underneath in two clusters of three,  |
| and a red light on the bottom forward. The edges of the object sloped |
| out underneath. (Source: Stan Gordon, MUFON Field Investigations      |

| 1990 - A huge manta ray shaped object, described as bigger than a 747 |
| without the fuselage, was seen by many witnesses in Piketown, Dauphin |
| County, Pennsylvania at 6:30 p.m. It was estimated to be flying at    |
| 10,000 feet altitude and had blinking lights. (Source: Timothy Good,  |

| 1993 -  A farmer in Dodge County east of Columbus, Wisconsin had a    |
| close encounter with a large flat disc-shaped object with a dome on   |
| top at 8:10 p.m. It illuminated the farm with light beams that faded  |
| and intensified. Sheriff deputies then chased the UFO for 20 miles.   |

| 1996 - Near Romatambo, a remote mountain village in Ancash province,  |
| Peru at eight o'clock in the morning, several Quechua Indian          |
| shepherds tending their flocks watched six objects fly over the area. |
| According to one of the witnesses, Silvia Bedoya, age 40, the objects |
| apparently emerged from nearby Lake Cococha. The objects formed what  |
| seemed like a protective circle around a larger cigar-shaped,         |
| mother-ship style object. The flight of the objects illuminated the   |
| whole valley in an eerie deep purple light. The "mother ship" landed  |
| upriver from the village. Soon two occupants emerged from the object. |
| These were described as about a meter tall with large oversized       |
| heads, long spindly arms and short bandy legs. They wore gunmetal     |
| gray helmets and matching one-piece coveralls. The humanoids took out |
| transparent containers and, ignoring the shepherds, collected many    |
| samples, including soil, grass, alpine weeds, and water from the      |
| nearby river. Soon the UFOnauts re-entered the large object and all   |
| the objects shot away into space at high speed. (Sources: Lumieres    |

| 2002 -  A senior INS Border Patrol officer and his dog witnessed a    |
| disc-shaped object very quickly pass over their patrol vehicle at     |
| 5:30 a.m. in the desert near Jacumba, San Diego County, California. A |
| warbling sound emanated from the object, which the dog reacted to.    |
| Seconds later, a dozen more discs are witnessed flying to the east    |
| with a delta-shaped object in their midst, then fly off to the west.  |

| 2003 - At 10:30 p.m. a large white object like two saucers rim to rim |
| flew slowly at a low level over a farm field and farmhouses in        |
| Villeneuve, Alberta, Canada. There were two witnesses and the         |
| sighting lasted almost two minutes. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer |

| 2005 - At ten o'clock at night a triangular object hovered over a     |
| frozen pond in Columbia City, Indiana for three minutes and melted    |
| the ice. On the same night in Wood River, Nebraska a bright           |
| oval-shaped object allegedly picked up a cow. (Source: Peter          |
