| 1953 - On this day in 1953, some gardeners in Strasbourg, France watched a   |
| brilliant disc move back and forth in the sky. It shot off to the     |
| south at a very high speed. (Source: Loren Gross, UFOs: A History     |

| 1956 - In Valley City, North Dakota at 1:20 a.m. in 1956, a round, reddish   |
| UFO caused interference on a police radio while being observed.       |

| 1957 - In 1957 at 6:00 a.m. a huge cigar-shaped object with 8 shimmering     |
| lights on its side moved slowly through the morning sky in Yokohama,  |
| Japan. Later that same day a US Air Force plane circled at a low      |
| altitude as a 1 meter in diameter disc hovered above it. The disc     |
| vanished in plain sight. (Source: Loren Gross, UFOs: A History 1957   |

| 1958 - One year later, a wingless fuselage circled slowly at a high  |
| altitude east of Grants, New Mexico at 2:30 in the afternoon. Earlier |
| that day, at 2:07 a.m., a round, white glowing object moved back and  |
| forth for 90 minutes new Lake Elsinore, California. The observers     |
| signaled the UFO with a flashlight, and it approached to within 10    |
| feet, pacing their truck and emitting a high-pitched hum. They then   |
| saw a "well built" man run across the road in front of them. (Source: |

| 1966 - At 6:35 p.m. in Middleboro, Massachusetts an apparently        |
| oval-shaped object dove in front of the witness's car on Highway 25.  |
| It carried two large bright red pulsating lights. It stopped to hover |
| silently over some woods just off the road. A curved shaped could be  |
| seen behind the lights. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:             |

| 1971 - In 1971 on this night in Minnesota more than 15 police and sheriff    |
| deputies in five towns, centered on Excelsior, Minnesota sighted a    |
| glowing sphere. The object changed color from red to green. It was    |
| sometimes silent and sometimes reported to be humming. One photograph |
| was taken as it hovered over Chanhassen, Minnesota a few minutes      |
| before midnight. (Source: Jay Rath, The M-Files: True Reports of      |

| 1973 - In 1973, Mr. Marjapori was loading gravel at French Lake in           |
| Annandale, Louisiana at eight o'clock in the morning when he spotted  |
| a silver, cone-shaped UFO. The large end of the cone was revolving,   |
| and it was emitting silver streaks from the short end. It shot away   |
| to the southeast at a very high speed. At 7:00 that evening a shiny,  |
| silver cigar-shaped object descended and paced a car with a mother    |
| and daughter in Sugar Grove, Ohio. The UFO had a red light on one     |
| end, a green light on the other, and a pulsating white light in the   |
| center. It fixed a beam of light on the car and pursued it for 15     |
| minutes. (Sources: Newspaper Clippings file, December 6, 1973; Geri   |

| 1974 - At 11:00 p.m. three persons in a parked car near Moose Jaw,    |
| Saskatchewan, Canada observed several bright lights that looked like  |
| they were on the perimeter of a large, dark flying object. The object |
| hovered at a low altitude and moved up and down. On several occasions |
| a light approached their vehicle at high speed and stopped about 20   |
| feet away. These shooting lights were quite bright but dimmed upon    |
| stopping, then disappeared. The occupants of the vehicle felt a cold  |
| sensation when the lights approached. One of the witnesses saw two    |
| human-like figures walking near their car. They were wearing silvery  |
| outfits with face masks and helmets. Each helmet had a single         |
| antenna. As the UFO left the witnesses felt a strong rush of air and  |
| something strike their vehicle. At that moment they felt a strong     |
| sensation of heat. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| military).                                                            |

| 1978 - In 1978 at 1:40 a.m., a small dark disc with a luminous underbody,    |
| estimated to be about 1.5 meters in diameter, flew slowly along the   |
| coast heading south in Giulianova, Italy. About four hours later, in  |
| Milan, Italy the entire electrical system of a car failed when a      |
| luminous, orange and green saucer-shaped UFO flew overhead. The       |
| object circled the car then rose vertically. The car functioned       |
| without trouble after the UFO left the scene. At 7:15 that same       |
| morning a silver triangle with yellow lights flew from the west to    |
| the east over Ruislip, England. (Sources: (1) Lumieres dans la Nuit   |

| 1981 - On this night in 1981 a bullet-shaped object, a sphere, and several   |
| nocturnal lights were sighted flying to the north over Hessdalen      |
| Valley, Norway toward Trondheim. According to John Spencer, this      |
| report was the first of a four-year wave of reports from the          |
| Hessdalen Valley. (Source: John Spencer, UFO Encyclopedia, p. 143).   |

| 1987 - In the pre-dawn hours on this morning in 1987 on the outskirts of     |
| Ilkley Moor, West Yorkshire, England ex-constable and UFO abductee    |
| Mr. Spencer photographed a little man on the moors south of town. The |
| ufonaut ran to a disc-shaped craft and took off. (Source: Jenny       |

| 1989 - On this evening in 1989 a 51-year-old man and two other witnesses saw |
| a UFO maneuver at about 600 feet altitude in Indianapolis, Indiana.   |
| It was escorted by what looked like four black, Huey-model            |
| helicopters. All five craft moved slowly into the distance until out  |
| of sight. (Source: Norma Croda, MUFON case investigation database,    |

| 1991 - Three young farm hands were playing cards late at night in a   |
| small shack on a farm in Laboulaye, Argentina when a bright light     |
| outside caught their attention. Frightened, they looked out and saw a |
| huge luminous object resting nearby on the ground. About 15 small     |
| humanoid figures were walking about near the object. The beings wore  |
| helmets with lights on them, resembling those worn by miners, and     |
| seemed to be wearing small capes on their shoulders. The UFO and the  |
| short humanoids stayed in the area most of the night. The next        |
| morning a circular ground trace was found at the landing site. A dog  |
| reacted during the incident. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid     |

| 1992 - In 1992, in the town of Iaeger, McDowell county, West Virginia at     |
| 4:00 p.m., David Church saw a delta-shaped UFO fly overhead very      |
| slowly at about 250 feet altitude. It moved backwards, with the       |
| pointed end toward the rear. It had many multi-colored lights on the  |
| underside, lit up like a Christmas tree. (Source: Bob Teets, West     |

| 1993 - In 1993 at 8:45 p.m. in Baca Ranch, Colorado author and UFO           |
| investigator Christopher O'Brien videotaped 7 or 8 aircraft--probably |
| helicopters--escorting a large unblinking flying sphere. Mr. O'Brien  |
| and another witness watched with the aid of night vision goggles as   |
| the objects maneuvered around and over the Sangre de Cristo           |
| mountains. An unblinking craft, escorted by three helicopters, was    |
| sighted an hour later near Gunnison, Colorado. (Sources: (1)          |

| making no noise, at approximately 70 meters altitude. (Source:        |

| 1996 - According to Michael Hesemann, on this date in 1996 the Space Shuttle |
| mission STS-80 filmed a UFO maneuvering in Earth orbit. (Source:      |

| 1996 - Late at night two coon hunters and their hunting dogs were     |
| parked on Leonard Road six miles south of Bethel, Ohio waiting for    |
| the right time to set their dogs loose. They released them and        |
| followed them into a harvested cornfield. As they approached the      |
| nearby power lines the dogs got very quiet, which was very uncommon   |
| for these dogs. When one of the hunters stepped into a clearing he    |
| was shocked to see a silvery saucer-shaped craft with a transparent   |
| cupola sitting on the ground. Nearby stood three humanoids wearing    |
| coverall uniforms. The beings were described as "Greys," short with   |
| slanted black eyes. One of them was slightly taller and had a much    |
| bigger head. As both the hunters and their dogs watched, the three    |
| humanoids ran to their saucer and entered through an open hatch. The  |
| object then rose straight up into the air and vanished. (Source:      |
| Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database, case # 2474, citing     |

| 2001 - In 2001 at 9:20 p.m. near Tucumcari, Texas many people witnessed a    |
| brightly lit object move across the sky chased by F-16 fighters. The  |
| UFO changed directions several times. According to the witnesses, the |
| jets fired missiles at the UFO and hit it, causing it to explode in   |
| the air. According to NORAD they witnesses the re-entry of a Russian  |
| satellite. (Source: UFO Magazine, April 2002, p. 20, citing Filer's   |
