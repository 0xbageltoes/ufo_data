| Montana, maneuvering and making sharp turns before it finally         |
| vanished abruptly. (Sources: NICAP case files, report dated February  |

| 1977 - At around 7 p.m. a five meter long walnut-shaped UFO followed  |

| driving on National Highway 11 near San Justo, Santa Fe province,     |

| car stopped immediately. A tall being dressed in black approached,    |
| stopped three meters away, turned around, then walked back into the   |
| light. No traces or footprints could be found. (Sources: Jane         |

| 1979 - A newsman driving in Cassola, Italy saw a metallic gray disc   |
| in a field. It had a weak bluish-glow coming from the bottom of the   |
| craft. It rose vertically into the sky very fast. Radio interference  |

| 1979 - A small cigar-shaped object with small windows came out of a   |
| cloud in the predawn hours and was seen by four witnesses in Melo,    |
| Uruguay. It changed colors from red to green to yellowand finally     |
| to blue while it flew in a horizontal straight line. It then went     |
| back into the clouds. The witnesses included a young woman and the    |
| Police Chief of the city. It was the young woman's second sighting    |
| and the Police Chief's third. (Sources: Jane Thompson, UFO            |

| 1981 - The main witness had finished closing up his canteen in        |
| Fuentecen, Valladolid province, Spain at 2:30 a.m. He was walking     |
| back to his house when he observed several golden lights in a nearby  |
| field. He approached the lights but they suddenly rose up, circled,   |
| and landed again, this time closer to his home. The man went inside   |
| and woke his wife and son, and they all observed an object on the     |
| ground that intermittently gave off bright flashes of light. At       |
| this time his dogs began barking and acting strangely. His wife       |
| became frightened and went back to bed. Later, he heard footsteps and |
| one of his dogs led him to a "figure" standing by the fence on his    |
| property. The being was a meter and a half tall, box-like in shape,   |
| and appeared metallic and almost robotic in nature. It did not seem   |
| to have a head, arms or feet. The dog approached the figure and began |
| barking, and then both man and his son heard a strange barking "echo" |
| that seem to come from the figure itself. The witness grabbed a       |
| flashlight and ran out, he then heard a loud "crackling" sound. The   |
| figure by now had disappeared. He next saw an object with rotating    |
| red lights rise from a nearby field and leave at high speed. A        |
| scorched area was found on the ground by government authorities.      |

| 1982 - A 25 meter arrowhead-shaped UFO with spotlights hovered over a |
| field in Spartanburg, South Carolina at 10:30 p.m. It then followed a |
| car being driven by the witness. An odd silence was noted. (Source:   |

| 1997 - At 11:30 p.m. Marta Aguilar Montoya and her two small children |
| were asleep in their bedroom in Santiago, Chile when she heard a      |
| crackling noise that woke her up suddenly. Turning her head, she      |
| noticed a small figure about 4-foot 8 inches tall standing next to    |
| the TV; it was wearing a tight-fitting suit and a helmet with a       |
| visor. The being also wore a backpack connected to the helmet by two  |
| hoses, one over each shoulder. Frightened, she brought her two        |
| children to her bed and just continued to watch. The being stared at  |
| the trio but never made a move towards them. After several minutes    |
| the being turned to face the bedroom wall, and again there was a loud |
| crackling sound. It then disappeared through the wall, leaving only   |
| its silhouette on the wall, which disappeared after two               |
| minutes. (Sources: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case # 17872;    |

| 2003 - A police crime scene technician in Seattle, Washington was     |
| driving home from a crime scene at 2:30 a.m. when it started to rain. |
| His car suddenly began making weird noises and the car radio turned   |
| on automatically, scanning through numerous stations at a rate of one |
| a second. Lights inside and outside the car were also flashing. When  |
| he looked up he saw a huge triangular-shaped object above the car. In |
| a few seconds blinding blue lights distracted the witness. The next   |
| thing he remembers all action suddenly stopped, and his car was       |
| parked on the side of the road with everything switched off. When he  |
| looked at his watch it was 3:03 a.m. He had lost track of 33 minutes  |
| of time. He turned his car engine on and drove back to his office.    |

| 2004 - 2004, Jordanow, Poland - At one o'clock in the morning Mrs. K. J.,    |
| age 77, awoke and went to the bathroom and then back to her bedroom.  |
| As she passed through the kitchen she was surprised to see a strong   |
| fiery orange light outside, floating in the sky. She realized it      |
| couldn't be the moon. The light was hemisphere shaped, with a flat    |
| bottom and round top. The light had an apparent size 2-3 times larger |
| than the full moon. The light hung over the forest on Hajdowka Hill,  |
| 1.5 kilometers from her house. She watched it for about five minutes  |
| and started to feel so she went back to bed. During the night she had |
| a disturbing "dream" about meeting with a huge shiny "thing". She     |
| awoke feeling very frightened, around 6:30 a.m. (Source: Albert S.    |
