| 1909 - An elongated object flew toward the east over the town of      |
| Donghoi at 4:10 a.m. in Vietnam. It gave off a strong light and was   |
| seen by two fishermen to plunge into the sea six kilometers away from |
| the coast after a steady flight lasting about nine minutes. (Sources: |

| 1948 - A banana or cucumber-shaped object with beams of light was     |
| tracked on radar when it descended across the course of Russian test  |
| pilot Aprasksin flying over the Kapustin Yar test flight facility in  |
| Astrakhan, Soviet Union. The experimental aircraft he was flying      |
| experienced a total electrical failure when it was hit by a cone of   |
| light, with the engine and controls failing. Although temporarily     |
| blinded, he was able to glide the plane to a landing. (Sources: Felix |

| 1952 - A Staff Sergeant saw five gray discs in a arc formation shoot  |
| to the east over Walker Field, Roswell, New Mexico at 8:30 p.m. They  |
| flew at an estimated speed of 550 mph. A Project Blue Book "unknown"  |

| 1965 - On this night a bright light seen in the sky over Townsville,  |
| Queensland, Australia gradually accelerated, next zig-zagged,         |
| and then stopped and started moving three times before disappearing   |
| out of sight. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the Southern         |

| disc-shaped object spiral through the sky east of Elista, Kalmuk,     |
| Russia at 9:50 p.m. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case   |

| 1967 - On this night Mrs. Wallace and her family watched a            |
| cone-shaped UFO with rotating green and red flashing lights for one   |
| hour over Port McNeill, British Columbia, Canada. (Source: Gene       |

| 1972 - A man, Mr. Meerton, leaving his house in Merricks, Victoria,   |
| Australia at 8:30 p.m. was confronted by a dull metallic object with  |
| 30 orange lights that had just landed in his field. Cows in the       |
| pasture panicked. The whole area was illuminated by the UFO, and a    |
| strong wind blew that bent the trees over. The UFO also made a high   |
| pitched sound like that of an electric mixer. The encounter lasted 90 |
| seconds. (Source: Victorian UFO Research Society, Australian FSR,     |

| 1974 - At about 5:00 a.m. a 46-year-old farm laborer was driving near |
| Caceres, Spain when a bright object illuminated the highway. He saw   |
| three tall helmeted figures standing inside the craft. When the       |
| witness turned off his headlights the UFO moved away; when he turned  |
| them back on the UFO approached, and followed him home. (Sources:     |

| 1977 - Middelburg, Eastern Cape, South Africa - At 5:15 a.m. a glowing |
| object engulfed a van being driven by a single witness, a Mr. Gouws,  |
| in a brilliant light. The man experienced amnesia when exposed to the |
| intense light source and may have possibly been abducted, as he has   |
| an hour of time unaccounted for. There was a buzzing sound            |
| accompanying the light and the van's engine and lights died. Later    |
| the engine restarted spontaneously by itself. Mr. Gouws was so        |
| fearful after the incident that he was shaking like a leaf. (Sources: |

| 1978 - A man had been hitchhiking home after midnight when he spotted |
| a soft glowing object in a nearby field near Borisoglebsk, Voronezh,  |
| Russia and walked towards it. As he approached he could see that the  |
| object had a transparent dome on top and inside he could see three    |
| short humanoids. The dwarf beings had large egg-like heads and very   |
| long fingers. They seemed to be working around a central console.     |
| When he got to within 25 yards of the object he was stopped by some   |
| kind of a force field and blacked out. When he came to he noticed     |
| that the briefcase he had been carrying looked old and frayed. The    |
| force field was gone, so he again began to walk toward the object but |
| was knocked down by a blast of wind. The craft began to glow and rose |
| off the ground and shot away quickly at high speed. He learned later  |
| that he had lost track of 45 minutes of time. Under hypnosis he       |
| recalled being gently led into the craft and examined. (Source:       |

| 1978 - Oulton, England - At 11:15 p.m. a 16-year-old man was returning |
| from his girlfriend's house in a heavy rainstorm when he started      |
| hearing a very loud voice "talking nonsensically" all around him. The |
| voice was so loud that he thought it might wake everyone in the       |
| village and he compared it to the voice of a radio announcer. The     |
| volume rose and fell as though the voice was being blown on the wind. |
| He could not distinguish the words, however, and it faded away after  |
| about five seconds. He walked another 50 meters further on when he    |
| noticed, through a wooded gate to his right, a cylindrical column of  |
| white light. This vertical beam appeared to be on the grounds of a    |
| convent and was 200 meters away. It looked to be 3 1/2 meters high    |
| and 2 meters in diameter, and it appeared solid and sharply defined.  |
| The witness then had the impression that something or someone was in  |
| the beam, and he became scared and ran home, having watched the beam  |
| for about 5 seconds. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact     |
| Database 1978, citing Martin Keatman, BUFORA Journal, Vol. 9, No. 1). |

| 1987 - Two amateur astronomers, after having heard a strong hiss, saw |
| on the mirrored water of the Adriatic Sea off the shore of Riccione,  |
| Italy a luminescent object of ovoid shape. During the few minutes of  |
| the sighting, the object changed coloration several times. (Source:   |

| 1989 - Two brothers were engaged in opal mining in an isolated area   |
| of Queensland, Australia on this night, with the nearest community    |
| being Yowah. They sighted a large disc-shaped craft accompanied by    |
| six smaller objects hovering over the area. A twenty-minute time      |
| lapse was reported. Hynoptic regression at a later date revealed an   |
| abduction scenario that involved small Grey type entities and tall    |
| human-looking beings with long blond hair. There seemed to the        |
| brothers that a struggle ensued between the two different groups of   |
| beings. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1989,   |

| 1995 - A silent bell-shaped disc flashed and maneuvered over the      |
| shore of Puget Sound northeast of Shelton, Washington. It emitted a   |
| bright red beam of light. After 10 minutes it flew off towards the    |
| northeast. (Source: West Virginia UFO Newsletter, issue #8).          |

| 2004 - A chrome colored sphere was sighted over Milan, Tennessee at   |
| 12:30 p.m. It flew into a small cloud and didn't emerge again.        |
