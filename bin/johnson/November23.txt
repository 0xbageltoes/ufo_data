| 1896 - Several observers in Stockton, California witnessed a fast     |
| moving, bright light in the sky that had exited from a shadowy ovoid  |
| object at 10:10 p.m.; it dips low near buildings in the city. There   |
| were several other reports this evening from Antioch, Chico, Lathrop, |
| Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose, California. (Sources: Stockton  |

| 1948 - An aerial encounter with a red UFO involving radar and visual  |
| confirmation occurred over Germany on this night at 10:20 p.m.        |
| Two U.S. Air Force Captains flying in a F-80 fighter, and a 1st Lt.   |
| from the 23rd Fighter Squadron on the ground at Furstenfeldbruck AFB  |
| saw the reddish star-like object to the east moving south over Munich |
| at 200-500 mph, turning slightly southwest and then southeast.        |
| Captain Slater in the F-80 called the Racecard DF Radar Station which |
| tracked the unidentified target at 27,000 feet and 30 miles to the    |
| south of Munich, climbing to 40,000 feet at 40 miles south of Munich, |
| then circling around in a high speed ascent. (Sources: Donald E.      |

| 1950 - At 3:20 p.m. a disc-shaped UFO flew from the southwest to the  |
| northeast near Maxwell Air Force Base, then performed a flip over the |
| city of Montgomery, Alabama. A second disc flew from the southwest to |
| the northeast, then two more flew from the south to the north at a    |
| high rate of speed. town. There were three witnesses, and the entire  |
| event lasted nine minutes. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History.  |

| 1953 - The famous Kinross Air Force Base disappearance of an F-89     |
| fighter plane occurred on this date. An F-89 was scrambled from       |
| Kinross AFB at 6:41 p.m. to pursue a UFO over Lake Michigan and the   |
| Upper Pennisula of Michigan. The radar blips of the UFO and the jet   |
| merged into one near Soo Locks and Keeneenaw Point, Michigan then the |
| jet disappeared and the UFO flew away. An extensive air search and    |
| rescue found no trace of the missing aircraft, with the two airmen    |
| named Moncla and Wilson. The radio communication between the pilot    |
| and Air Traffic Controllers has never been released. The massive      |
| search and recovery effort went on for an extensive period of time,   |
| and failed to find any wreckage. (Sources: Sault Ste. Marie Evening   |

| 1954 - At around five o'clock in the evening two young shepherds, M.  |
| G. and P. T., age 12, were returning to their flock in Colcerasa,     |
| Macerata, Italy when they noticed that the sheep had moved from were  |
| they had left them and that their sheep dog was barking. M. G.        |
| observed three “dark colored, animal like creatures” moving between   |
| some bushes and a couple of bonfires that the shepherds had lit       |
| earlier. They also saw what looked like a small barrel, 60-70         |
| centimeters wide by 1.5 meters long. The edges of the object were     |
| flattened. M. G. was unable to view the beings clearly; they stood    |
| approximately 35 cm tall and had rather disproportionately large,     |
| flat-topped heads. They appeared to be dressed in dark shiny suits,   |
| as if made out of plastic. The creatures quickly retreated into the   |
| object, which quickly took off producing a hissing sound. When the    |
| object had reached an altitude of 20 meters it expelled a large       |
| fireball. This exploded just before touching the ground, and a strong |
| gust of wind struck both boys. The object sported something like      |
| “antennae” situated on its forward section, which vibrated when the   |
| object lifted off. The craft zipped rapidly in an easterly direction  |
| and disappeared from view to the left of Mount La Cesa. Both boys     |
| ran home to relate what they had just seen. (Source: Albert S.        |

| 1954 - On this afternoon three 10-year-old girls returning from       |
| school in Torpo, Norway--Anne & Tora Storedal and Tora Moy            |
| Hauge--found themselves being followed by a flying saucer. It came    |
| down to hover only 3 or 4 feet away from them. It was round, about 10 |
| feet in diameter, and the bottom was black, trimmed with yellow spots |
| which could have been lights, with a number of small, "red jags." The |
| upper part was a transparent dome, and a man who was operating        |
| controls was visible inside. He wore black trousers, a black jacket,  |
| and immense red goggles over his eyes. He stared at one of the girls. |
| When the craft rose it collided with a high-tension power line with a |
| shower of sparks, and the girls ran away. They noticed a smell "like  |
| fried sausages." A "streak" was found in the snow, apparently left by |
| the craft having brushed the surface of the snow covered ground.      |

| 1957 - In the desert 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nevada Joseph Long's   |
| car engine died at 6:10 a.m. He then heard a high-pitched whining     |
| sound and saw to his right four large, metallic Saturn-shaped craft   |
| resting on the ground 400 meters away. The objects were 50 feet in    |
| diameter, with a dome in the center and a rotating ring on the edge.  |
| He walked up to within 50 feet of the objects during the next 20      |
| minutes, when the four objects slowly rose up and left the area, at   |
| which time he returned to his vehicle and the car engine could be     |
| restarted. The humming sound increased in pitch when the objects took |
| off. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official            |

| 1958 - At 11:35 p.m. Julio M. Ladaleto, an engineer, stopped when his |
| car hit a can rolling on the road in Cojutepeque, El Salvador. He     |
| then observed an object about 35 meters away. It was shaped like a    |
| lamp shade with an upper transparent sphere emitting a bluish,        |
| pulsating light, 12 meters diameter, seven meters high, and resting   |
| on three half-spheres. An very tall occupant, 2.5 meters in height,   |
| was photographed by the witness as the crossed the road and appeared  |
| to inspect the craft. The UFOnaut wore a blue coverall and            |
| luminescent heelless boots, and had a bald head. The observation      |
| lasted 10 minutes, after which the object took off with a whining     |
| sound, sparks and smoke. The following day, before he had revealed    |
| anything about the case, Ladeleto was contacted by strange "newsmen"  |
| who appeared to know all the details of it. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, |

| 1969 - For 15 minutes beginning at 12:30 a.m. four witnesses watched  |
| and viewed through a telescope a glowing ovoid object over Kauri      |
| Mountain, New Zealand that moved up-and-down, side-to-side, and       |
| hovered. It departed by shooting straight up. (Source: FSR, March     |

| 1975 - A domed disc-shaped object with three white lights and a       |
| smaller blinking red light in the center was sighted by a young       |
| couple in Chicago, Illinois at 4:50 p.m. on a clear evening. It       |
| hovered motionless for a few seconds, dropped down, hovered again,    |
| then moved to the east, hovered a third time, and finally moved       |
| rapidly off to the northwest. It made no sound and the witnesses were |
| confident it was not a plane or helicopter. (Source: Fred Merritt,    |

| 1976 - A lounge owner and a bartender watched a large domed object as |
| it hovered over trees in Kenner, Louisiana on a clear night, flashing |
| red, green, and white lights. The dome was three times the size of a  |
| helicopter, and it passed over their car at 3:30 a.m. It hovered for  |
| two minutes over the trees, then moved slowly toward Moisant Airport  |
| in the east. (Sources: International UFO Reporter, January 1977,      |

| 1977 - At 8:30 p.m. in the village of Colares, Para State, Brazil     |
| 35-year-old Anotnio Ferreira witnessed an "airship," red on the       |
| bottom, gray metallic on the top, and oval-cylindrical in shape. It   |
| was estimated to be 1500 meters distant, and it moved in small wavy   |
| pulsing actions, spinning as it went. At the same time 34-year-old    |
| pilot Ivaldo Viegas Pantoja was flying from Colarfes and spotted the  |
| dull metallic "airship" when his plane was at 60 meters altitude, and |
| the UFO was at only 30 meters, 3000 meters away. It was small,        |
| perhaps only 1.5 meters in size, and going from southeast to east at  |
| 100 km/h. He reported being frightened by his encounter with the      |
| object. (Source: Bob Pratt, Operacion Prato, p. 34).                  |

| 1978 - In the early evening a silver triangular object with two       |
| yellow lights paced a "Tristar" airliner from Heathrow Airport, Kent, |
| England. It came back several times during the three minute           |
| encounter, and was tracked on radar. There were several independent   |
| witnesses. At 7:15 p.m. a man in Whitstable, Kent, England making     |
| weather observations at his home saw a silver, plate-shaped UFO,      |
| within a block of light gray vapor. The UFO was glistening silver,    |
| and emerged from the front of the mist. It showed great acceleration, |
| and left a vapor trail. (Sources: (1) D. N. Mansell, Awareness, April |

| 1996 -  David L., a local cab driver, was taking several passengers   |
| home from a pub in Hallbankgate, Cumbria, England at around 1:40 a.m. |
| when he observed a large green ball of light with a white ring        |
| around. The ball of light dropped from the sky and then hovered in    |
| some woods at a nearby farm. Later, after driving another group of    |
| passengers from the pub, he came up a hill and saw a tall figure      |
| emerging from a gate in a field on his right hand side. The figure    |
| wore a silver suit with some kind of helmet on his head. It was       |
| carrying what appeared to be a "white sheet" in front of him that he  |
| was not holding, but seemed to be stuck to his hands. Both David and  |
| his two passengers were extremely frightened and did not stop,        |
| driving quickly away from the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,       |
