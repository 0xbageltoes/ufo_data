| 1957 - In the early morning hours of this day in Balfour, New         |
| Zealand, William West and Wallace Liddell saw an object similar to a  |
| shooting star come close to them. As it got closer it appeared to be  |
| an oval-shaped craft, fluorescent, about 40 cm in diameter. It came   |
| down toward the ground and nearly touched the grass but did not land. |
| They rushed towards it to capture it, but it jumped away and turned   |
| into a bluish-white sphere with a dark red center. Each time they     |
| tried to catch it the object jumped further away. It cleared a high   |
| fence and slowly vanished. The Invercargill Weather Bureau had no     |
| explanation. (Sources: Grey River Argus, January 15, 1957; Jacques    |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia, p. 254).                                 |

| 1965 - At 10:00 p.m. five miles northwest of Wilmot, New Hampshire    |
| Mr. Knee saw a glowing light that made a humming sound. His car       |
| radio, lights and engine died while the luminous object hovered       |
| nearby; the electrical power returned when the UFO sped away.         |

| 1967 - At 6:30 a.m. local time a 69-year old woman in Ikuri, Finland  |
| suddenly awoke to see through her bedroom window that a 1.2-1.4 meter |
| tall creature was in her yard, walking through the deep snow using    |
| stiff mechanical steps. The being wore a blue-green tunic and baglike |
| trousers, and had some kind of helmet with four antennas. It also     |
| wore some kind of mittens on its hands. The face could not be seen.   |
| It walked past the swing in the yard and disappeared into thin air.   |
| It left round footprints on the snow. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1967 - At 3:00 a.m. EST, or about three and one-half hours later, a   |
| red oval-shaped UFO that looked like an upside-down saucer with a     |
| white glowing rim, approached and circled the witness's home in       |
| Boxford, Massachusetts before flying away. (Source: Raymond E.        |

| 1967 - After another three and one-half hours, at 7:30 p.m. local     |
| time, attorney Ong Huck Hong and his son observed a domed disc in     |
| Selat Utara, Malaysia. The object moved up and down, slowed its pace, |
| and appeared to be changing its shape. There were whirling bars of    |
| light on the dome that resembled windows. The UFO flew off toward the |
| south. (Source: Ahmad Jamaludin, Summary of Unidentified Flying       |
| Objects and related events in Malaysia, p. 25).                       |

| 1967 - Wildwood, New Jersey. Two nights after the Christiansen family |
| heard strange metallic sounds over their house, Mr. & Mrs.            |
| Christiansen returned home to find their children in a very           |
| distraught state. They had heard the strange metallic sound again,    |
| and then heard heavy footsteps crunching through the thick woods      |
| outside. A 19-year old neighbor present at the time looked out the    |
| window to see a tall humanoid figure hurrying away from the house. He |
| was wearing a long white cape. When the man reached a five-foot high  |
| fence he leaped over it effortlessly disappeared into the woods.      |

| 1969 - During the afternoon of this day Ludwig Pallmann felt a        |
| burning sensation from a ring given to him by someone he presumed was |
| an extraterrestrial. The sensation was a signal for an upcoming       |
| contact, so Mr. Pallmann took his motorboat to a local sandy beach on |
| Isla del Altar, El Salvador. There he noticed that several huge       |
| concentric circles ruffled the normally placid waters of the lake.    |
| Shortly after that he encountered a human looking being named Satu    |
| Ra, who he had met on previous occasions. Satu Ra was sitting         |
| motionless on a nearby rock. He wore dark green coveralls and had on  |
| a broad instrument belt on which was a large device. Ra was           |
| inexpressively sad. He told Pallmann that another extraterrestrial    |
| that they both knew, named Xiti, had been killed. Supposedly a        |
| disaster had befallen the expedition on another planet. Shortly after |
| this close encounter locals reported observing a silvery disc-shaped  |
| UFO hovering over the capital city San Salvador. (Source: Albert S.   |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1969, case 32, citing Timothy      |
| Good, Alien Base).                                                    |

| 1969 - At 8:30 p.m. a man driving from Extremadura stopped his car in |
| Las Pajanosas, Sevilla province, Spain and got out to investigate a   |
| light he saw nearby. When he got to within 200 meters of it he could  |
| see an illuminated rectangle in which several figures were seen       |
| walking in front of. A dog that had been watching the light with him  |
| had its hair raised and was growling softly. Alarmed, the witness     |
| left the scene. When he returned a few days later with a friend they  |
| found three apparent landing marks at the site, six feet apart.       |

| 1971 - A 69-year-old woman awoke abruptly in Ikuri, Tampere, Finland  |
| at 6:30 a.m., and watched out her window to see a 1.2 to 1.4 meter    |
| (four-foot) tall being appear in the yard and walk in the deep snow   |
| using stiff and mechanical steps. The creature wore a blue-green      |
| tunic and baglike trousers, and had some sort of helmet with four     |
| antennae. It also wore something like mittens on its hands. Its face  |
| could not be seen. The creature walked past the swing in the yard and |

| 1974 - Two students were walking along the beach in Mar Del Plata,    |
| Argentina at midnight when they sighted a small white light moving    |
| towards the coast from the sea. It divided into three lights as it    |
| came closer. They walked to the nearest pier to catch a better look   |
| of the lights and began walking down the pier when two more lights    |
| became visible to their right. They could now see that the lights     |
| were five humanoid beings that were walking gracefully in the water.  |
| The seawater reached their chests. These beings were dressed in       |
| diving suits and their heads were covered with helmets with a mask    |
| and a tube going onto their backs. The beings walked out of the water |
| and onto the road, leaving the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,      |

| 1975 - Several reports were made of a green disc heading in an       |
| eastward direction near the airport in Groton, Connecticut. Witnesses |
| included an American Airlines crew and two Air National Guard pilots  |
| flying in the area. (Source: APRO Bulletin, September 1975, p. 5).    |

| 1986 - At around seven p.m. the witness was walking home on Wiktorska |
| Street in Mokotow, Poland when he saw a dull metallic bowl-shaped     |
| flying object descend and land in a vacant field between two          |
| buildings. Moments later a hatch slid open from the top of the object |
| and a woman dressed in black came out. The man felt compelled         |
| mentally to go with the woman, who took him inside the UFO. it was    |
| very bright inside the craft and he saw two men wearing dark          |
| tight-fitting overalls with hoods. He was ordered to lie down on a    |
| table, and at this point he lost consciousness. He later awoke        |
| standing at the door outside of his house with no recollection of     |
| what happened in between. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid        |
