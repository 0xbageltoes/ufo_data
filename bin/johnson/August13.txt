| 1909 - At 11:00 p.m. a top-shaped object was observed through a night |
| glass as it moved in a northerly direction over Glen Innes, New South |
| Wales, Australia. Its lower portion was lighted while the upper       |
| portion was dark, and as the body of the object revolved a light kept |
| turning on to the terrain beneath. (Source: Richard H. Hall, From     |

| 1917 - A luminous globe was seen spinning through the clouds by over  |
| 18,000 witnesses who had assembled at Fatima, in the Cova da Iria,    |
| Portugal to see another monthly apparition of the "Lady in Blue",     |
| thought to be the Virgin Mary by Roman Catholic faithful. The sky     |
| turned rainbow colors including pink, yellow, and blue. There was a   |
| perceived lowering of the temperature, and angel hair residue.        |

| 1942 - Sixty-eight UFOs were seen over the Capitol in Washington,     |
| D.C. on this night around 11:00 p.m. Photographs were taken, and      |
| a big CAA investigation followed. (Source: Richard F. Haines, Project |

| 1947 - Mr. A. C. Urie and his two sons were fishing in the Snake      |
| River Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho at about one p.m. when they saw a |
| sky blue, seven-meter wide inverted plate-shaped flying object 100    |
| meters away and 25 meters above the ground. Treetops under it were    |
| spinning wildly, although the object itself did not appear to spin.   |
| It made a swishing sound. There was a red flame visible on one side   |
| of the top. According to the FBI investigative report of this case,   |
| at about 1:00 p.m. Mr. Urie "sent his boys to the (Salmon) river to   |
| get some rope from his boat. When he thought they were overdue he     |
| went outside to his tool shed to look for them. He noticed them about |
| 300 feet away looking in the sky and he glanced up to see what he     |
| called the flying disc. This strange object was flying at high speed  |
| along the canyon which is about 400 feet deep and 1,200 feet across   |
| at that point. It was about seventy-five feet above the floor of the  |
| canyon (and so more than 300 feet below the edge of the canyon) and   |
| moving up and down as it flew. It seemed to be following the contours |
| of the hilly ground beneath it. Urie, who said he was at about the    |
| same level as the UFO, so that he had a side view, estimated it was   |
| about twenty feet long, ten feet wide and ten feet high, with what    |
| appeared to be exhaust ports on the sides. It was almost hat shaped   |
| with a flat bottom and a dome on top.                                 |
|                                                                       |
| Close Encounter at Snake River Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho - 1947   |
|                                                                       |

| Its pale blue color made Urie think that it would be very difficult   |
| to see against the sky, although he had no trouble seeing it          |
| silhouetted against the opposite wall of the canyon. On each side     |
| there was a tubular shaped fiery glow, like some sort of exhaust. He  |
| said that when it went over trees they didn't sway back and forth,    |
| but rather the treetops twisted around, which suggests that the air   |
| under the object was being swirled into a vortex. He and his sons had |
| an excellent view of the object for a few seconds before it           |
| disappeared over the trees about a mile away. He thought it was going |
| 1,000 miles an hour. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, February 1978, |

| 1952 - While flying over Tokyo, Japan at 9:45 p.m. USAF Marine Corps  |
| pilot Major D. McGough sighted an orange light that flew a left orbit |
| at 8,000' and 230 mph. It then spiraled down to no more than 1,500    |
| feet altitude, remained stationary for 2-3 minutes more, and went     |
| out. An attempted interception was unsuccessful. (Source: Don         |

| 1956 - At Bentwaters RAF Base in Suffolk, England radar returns at    |
| 9:20 p.m. showed a large unidentified craft moving in excess of 4,000 |
| mph. The crew of a C-47 confirmed a visual sighting of a blur of      |
| light moving at high speeds. Both air and ground radars confirm       |
| fantastic maneuvers were performed. (Sources: James E. McDonald, FSR, |

| 1959 - Two women at a lake near Ogden Dunes, Indiana saw a glowing    |
| domed disc at six o'clock in the morning. The object was 20 meters in |
| diameter, and hovered and maneuvered 15 meters over the lake for      |
| two minutes. (Sources: Gary (IN) Post-Tribune, August 14, 1959; Loren |

| 1959 - At around 4:00 p.m. a pilot flying a Cessna 170 between Hobbs  |
| and Albuquerque, New Mexico encountered three round, gray UFOs that   |
| circled his aircraft just southeast of Corona, New Mexico and caused  |
| his compass to spin. Compass deviation. The pilot reported the        |
| incident and was later interrogated by the U.S. Air Force.(Sources:   |

| 1959 - At 9:30 p.m. six woman travelling by car through a rural area  |
| near Freeport, Texas saw a bright UFO pass low in front of their car, |
| causing the car's engine and headlights to die. The UFO landed in a   |
| wooded area. Dense underbrush prevented approaching landing site.     |

| 1960 - At 11:50 p.m. a red colored, cigar-shaped UFO in Tehama        |
| county, California twice approached a police car at close range.      |
| Police officers Scott and Carson were 18 miles north of Red Bluff and |
| east of Corning, California on Hoag Road when they first encountered  |
| the UFO. It had red lights at both ends, and one of the red lights    |
| swept the ground like a searchlight. They experienced heavy static on |
| their police radio, and the UFO swerved to avoid their spotlight.     |
| There were at least two other independent witnesses to the UFO that   |
| night. (Sources: San Francisco Chronicle, August 16, 1960; Gordon I.  |

| 1963 - At 9:30 p.m. a family and their housekeeper saw an elliptical  |
| object on the ground near Molasses Pond, Ellsworth, Maine for almost  |
| an hour. The craft had body lights along its length, and there were   |
| rays that shone upward from each end occasionally. (Source: Walter    |

| 1963 - A chemist in Honolulu, Hawaii at 11:30 p.m. saw a round red    |
| object pass overhead from the southwest to the northeast. The UFO     |
| "traveled across the sky at great speed making two sharp turns at the |

| 1965 - As he drove away after dropping off his two daughters Mr.      |
| Ryerson noticed two unusual "persons" walking along the side of the   |
| road next to a bean field. His two teenagers, Ellen Grace Ryerson,    |
| age 16, and Laura Jean Ryerson, 13, in Renton, Washington approached  |
| these two very unusual beings, while walking next to the bean field   |
| at seven o'clock in the morning. The little men were grey colored     |
| "like stone", had no hair, and had large bulging eyes. The first      |
| “person” was described as like a gnome and wrinkled. He wore a funny  |
| little hat. He was dancing and jumping around in front of the other   |
| being as they approached. He was making a cackling sound that the     |
| girls thought sounded like laughter. The other being was              |
| approximately 5 feet tall. He had a very unusual head. His face was   |
| gray but the back of his head had a bulbous extension with veins      |
| showing through it. It pulsated. On the rest of his cranium there     |
| were large pores and this part of his head was white. His eyes were   |
| described as like a frog’s eyes. In his mouth he had a little pipe,   |
| and he was blowing on it and making a shrill sound. The taller one    |
| wore shiny clothes, like satin. Both beings wore sleveless purple     |
| vests over white coveralls. Ellen feared that they were going to grab |
| her, so she yelled at her sister to run. The girls fled, and when     |
| they looked back after running 50 feet the beings had completely      |
| vanished. (Sources: Jerome Clark, Flying Saucer Review, March-April   |

| 1965 - David G., age 14, and his father and sister were sitting in    |
| their yard at four o'clock in the afternoon in Waverly, Iowa when     |
| they heard a high-pitched whining sound and saw an aluminum object    |
| 15-20 feet in diameter, looking like “two saucers glued together,”    |
| descend slowly from the sky. It disappeared behind a hill a third of  |
| a mile away, and the young man walked over to the hill to             |
| investigate. When about 150 yards from the site, he saw a humanoid    |
| being 3.5 feet tall, with a baldhead, peeking out from behind a tree. |
| He did not see the figure leave, but a minute or so later he saw a    |
| “blur” and heard a rush of air. At the landing site, in an old        |
| quarry, he found a 15-20 foot circle of burnt glass, within which     |
| were three indentations of 5” x 12” and an inch deep. The encounter   |
| lasted about a minute and occurred during a minor wave of reports     |
| from Iowa and elsewhere. (Sources: Ralph DeGraw, APRO Bulletin,       |

| 1965 - At 12:55 p.m. EDT two bakers saw a slow moving, red tinged     |
| white globe glide noiselessly over their bakery in Lynn,              |
| Massachusetts. The UFO then descended into an area of some electrical |
| power line pylons, one mile away. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs:   |

| 1967 - At about four o'clock in the afternoon Inacio De Souza, age    |
| 41, and his wife Maria were approaching their home at Santa Maria,    |
| Brazil near the town of Crixas Pilar de Goias, when they saw three    |
| figures "playing about" on the landing strip of the owner of the      |
| Fazenda. The beings were as tall as young children, had no hair and   |
| were wearing skin-tight clothing of a pale yellow color. At the end   |
| of the landing strip was a landed UFO having the shape of an inverted |
| washbasin. De Souza, carrying a .44 caliber carbine, fired a shot at  |
| the nearest being. Just then a beam of green light came from the UFO  |
| and struck De Souza on the head and shoulders, knocking him           |
| unconscious. The three entities entered the object, which then took   |
| off vertically at a high speed with a sound like buzzing bees. De     |
| Souza incurred a circular burned patch six inches in diameter, and he |
| was also diagnosed with leukemia by a physician, from which he died   |
| less than two months later. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, March-April      |

| 1970 - At 11:50 p.m. a car being driven by a man named Maarup in      |
| Haderslev, Denmark was engulfed by a bluish-white cone of light from  |
| a metallic gray disc. His car's engine, lights, and two-way radio     |
| died. The light was so brilliant it hurt his eyes and felt heat       |
| coming from the UFO. He took three photographs before the object made |
| a rapid upward departure. (Sources: Richard Hall, Uninvited Guests,   |

| traveling in the sky at 3:00 p.m. near Gatwick Airport, England. It   |
| flew from the northeast to southwest with the rear end of the object  |
| enveloped in smoke. The smoke or mist eventually obscured the object. |
| After 70 seconds the smoke cleared to reveal the object had vanished. |

| 1975 - Sgt. Charles L. Moody, age 32, was driving through the desert  |
| near Alamagordo, New Mexico at 1:20 a.m. when he encountered a        |
| metallic, disc-shaped UFO. He remembers a high-pitched sound coming   |
| from the object and that his car wouldn't start. He then experienced  |
| a lapse of time or memory loss of an hour and a half. He later was    |
| able to recall an abduction by two Grey aliens about 4 feet 8 inches  |
| tall, with large eyes and heads, slit mouths, and wearing             |
| tight-fitting coveralls. The abduction experience involved a medical  |
| exam on a table, telepathy, and a message. (Sources: Coral E.         |

| 1986 - At 12:30 a.m. in Syracuse, Ohio an air traffic controller and  |
| two other witnesses observed red, green and white nocturnal           |
| lights flashing in the sky  for 45 minutes. The airport radar         |
| confirmed that there were numerous objects hovering and maneuvering   |
| in the vicinity. (Source: Bob Gribble, National UFO Reporting Center, |

| 1986 - At 7:50 p.m. in Indianapolis, Indiana a silent metallic        |
| hamburger-shaped domed disc was seen by three witnesses from the      |
| sixth floor of a hospital. It flew from north to south at a low       |
| altitude. Later, it flew above an airliner, seemingly evading         |
| detection by the occupants of the airliner. When it passed above the  |
| airliner, it tipped up on one edge and reflected sunlight. It had a   |
| pale green haze that was visible along one side. As a special note, a |
| UFO abduction occurred near this location six weeks later on          |
| September 30, 1986. (Sources: Mark Rodeghier, International UFO       |

| 1989 - An 84-year-old man in Mansura, Louisiana went into his         |
| backyard at 10:30 a.m. and saw a small yellow oval or disc-shaped     |
| object close by at ground level. He called a second, female witness,  |
| who watched from the back door of the house. The 3-foot wide object   |
| hovered and moved about at ground level for approximately five        |
| minutes, 30 feet away, circled a tree, then flew off vertically and   |
| was quickly gone from sight. It made no sound as it flew, and left    |
| some ground traces on the lawn. (Sources: Hal Price, MUFON Field      |

| 1991 - At two a.m. in Maguayo, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico Mrs. Camacho     |
| encountered two four-foot-tall Grey entities in her garden. They had  |
| large skinny heads and narrow chins. They also apparently had no      |
| noses, no lips, and slit-like mouths. They took leaves from the plant |
| Monsterosa deliciosa. They mumbled some form of unintelligible        |
| gibberish. The witness was unable to move during her encounter, which |
| lasted about two minutes. (Source: Jorge Martin, in Timothy Good      |

| 1991 - Four men staying at a local guest house near Victoria, Entre   |
| Rios, Argentina were alerted to two maneuvering lights in the sky at  |
| 10 p.m. One was yellow and the other red, and they first moved up and |
| down, then in a triangular pattern. One of the lights then descended  |
| onto the road near the guesthouse. Two dark human-like figures        |
| emerged from the landed object and appeared to float above the ground |
| moving around back and forth. Although they were human-like, their    |
| heads were slightly larger than normal. Suddenly the light            |
| illuminating the object turned off, and a white bowl-shaped object    |
| could be discerned. A few of the witnesses were not able to see the   |
| figures completely, and only saw their arms and legs. Later that same |
| evening a man reported that he had been abducted, and awakened in a   |
| nearby garden as a blue beam was being retracted into a departing     |
| UFO. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1991,     |

| 1992 - On this morning at around 9 a.m. a woman was sitting at her    |
| dining room table in Salem, Oregon facing the living room with the    |
| kitchen to her left, when she caught sight of something outside her   |
| kitchen window. It was a short hairless greenish-gray figure that     |
| walked quickly into her kitchen. It stopped and stood briefly by a    |
| kitchen storage cabinet. She attempted to communicate with the        |
| creature telepathically, but it suddenly vanished. The figure had an  |
| elongated head and what appeared to be large "eyelids" drawn over the |
| eyes. Her dog did not seem to react to the intruder. Twenty minutes   |
| later when she sat down again at the dining room table a greenish     |
| three-fingered hand touched her wrist quickly from behind her. The    |
| touch was very painful, almost like an "electric shock", and then the |
| alien hand vanished. Two days later the witness noticed a round red   |
| mark on her wrist. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| 1994 - At 11:00 p.m. several witnesses including police in Salisbury, |
| North Carolina watched nocturnal lights hover, orbit, and dance in    |

| 1995 - At 12:45 a.m. a starlike object zig-zagged eight times during  |
| its descent over Rennes, Ile-Vilaine department, France. It seemed to |
| enlarge as in descended. A dark mass was perceived at low altitude,   |
| but was lost from view behind some trees. On the same night there was |
| an occurrence of anomalous radar echoes in the Central European       |
| surveillance area. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue # 334;      |

| 1998 - Several people in Surrey, British Columbia observed a bright   |
| white disc "drop out of the sky" and hover nearby for about 30        |

| RV park in Waterville, Nova Scotia, Canada. At 2:15 a.m. at Cow Bay,  |
| Nova Scotia, Canada a huge triangular-shaped object blocked out stars |
| as it flew very slowly at 15 km/hour towards the northwest. Its flat  |
| side was forward as it flew, and it was absolutely silent. Electrical |
