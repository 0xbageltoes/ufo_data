| altitude as it flew toward the northwest. (Source: Daily Oklahoman,   |

| Nunez, age 66, and his son of the same name, age 24, both mechanics,  |
| were driving south of the city in their 1930 Chevy pickup when their  |
| vehicle was lifted from road. They experienced a total change in      |
| their environment and scenery and found themselves speeding through a |
| city with tall buildings on a five-lane highway. The sky, which had   |
| been clear and starry, was now red.                                   |
|                                                                       |
| They were nearly blinded by a brilliant red light and felt very cold. |
| The vehicle's engine and the car stereo stopped running, and they     |
| noticed that all sounds had ceased. Finally their car "landed" back   |
| on the highway near Lujan de Cuyo, about 9 kilometers (5.5 miles)     |
| beyond the point where the incident had begun. Their pickup's engine  |
| restarted and they drove home. Both men felt a compulsive need to     |
| wash the car and take a bath. (Sources: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping |
