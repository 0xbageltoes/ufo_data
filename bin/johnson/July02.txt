| 1907 - Burlington, Vermont. The Bishop John Michaud was standing on a |
| Burlington street corner around 2 in the afternoon, engaged in a      |
| conversation with Ex-Governor Woodbury and Mr. A.A. Buell, when       |
| without warning they were startled by what sounded like a nearby      |
| explosion. Looking eastward along College Street they observed a      |
| torpedo-shaped object, some 300 feet away, hovering in the air about  |
| 50 feet over the tops of the buildings. It was estimated to be about  |
| 6 feet long and 8 inches in diameter. It was dark, with red flames    |
| being emitted from spots on the surface resembling unburnished        |
| copper. The object began to move slowly toward the south. As it moved |
| the surface seemed to be rupturing in places, and through these       |
| ruptures came the intense red flames. (Source: Charles Fort, The Complete     |
| Books of Charles Fort. New York: Dover, 1974, pg. 292.).              |

| 1950 - Steep Rock Lake, Ontario, Canada. A man and his wife saw a     |
| double saucer with portholes and a rotating antenna come to rest on   |
| the surface of the lake. Ten figures, four feet tall, dressed in      |
| shiny clothing, emerged and walked on deck like robots "changing      |
| direction without turning their bodies." Their faces could not be     |
| seen. One of them wore a red cap, had darker arms and legs and seemed |
| to be their leader. They immersed a hose in the lake, apparently      |
| extracted water, and then took off. Fishermen later reported a green  |
| moss formed on the lake. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to         |

| 1956 - A bright object crossed and re-crossed the sky over Conway,    |
| Massachusetts. The Greenfield Recorder-Gazette said that "although    |
| traveling at what appeared to be a high rate of speed" the object     |
| "was able to reverse its course completely". (Source: Arthur          |

| 1965 - At 7:00 p.m. five scientists and meteorological observers at   |
| the English research base on Deception Island in Antarctica watched   |
| zig-zagging, maneuvering, color changing UFOs for 8-10                |
| minutes, including a lens-shaped disc. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen,   |

| 1965 - A woman named Brundage driving in Kent, Washington had a close |
| encounter with a top-shaped UFO making a whistling sound at 11:00     |
| p.m. It caused the car lights, radio, and engine to die. (Sources:    |

| 1968 - At 11:25 a.m. 15-year old Oscar Iriart was riding his horse in |
| Sierra Chica, Buenos Aires, Argentina and encountered two strange men |
| who beckoned to him. They were five and a half feet tall, with thin   |
| white hair and wore red clothing. The witness noticed that their legs |
| were semi transparent. They told him, in Spanish, "You are going to   |
| know the world. We will take you. But not now, as we have a big       |
| load." They directed his attention to an elliptical object six feet   |
| in diameter, standing on 20" tripod legs in a drainage ditch. Then    |
| one of them handed the boy an envelope, telling him to dip it into a  |
| nearby puddle. He did so, and found that neither the envelope nor his |
| hand were wetted. In the envelope, written in a crude hand like a     |
| small child's, was the message, "You are going to know the world, F.  |
| Saucer." The two men then got into their machine through the top, and |
| it took off vertically at great speed. Oscar found both his horse and |
| dog paralyzed, and unable to move for some minutes. At the spot were  |
| found 3 holes 5" deep, arranged in an isosceles triangle. 5 local     |
| skeptics visited the site at 2315 that night and were amazed to       |
| observed a luminous object zigzag above them at low altitude.         |

| 1968 - At 8:15 p.m. a boy named Sola saw a bright object hovering     |
| over a nearby mountain in Cofico, Salta province, Argentina. At the   |
| same time the boy beheld at only a few meters distance from him, a    |
| "strange being about 2.10 meters in height, hanging suspended in air, |
| his body emitting a strange luminosity." This being suddenly spun     |
| around like a top, then rose into the air and vanished above the      |
| mountain. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of |

| 1968 - A woman in St. Alexis de Montcalm, Quebec, Canada saw a green  |
| object shaped like a hat or mushroom at 9:14 p.m. which flew by at    |
| the height of her apartment window. She believed she saw up to 20     |
| small men inside, all of green color with rather pointed noses,       |
| resembling sculptures in the African Pavilion at the Montreal Expo.   |

| 1968 - Constable M. Michaud and another police officer in St. Thomas, |
| Quebec, Canada reported that at 9:30 p.m. they saw two naked little   |
| men run through a drainage ditch and flee. Their report stated that   |
| they thought they had cornered the "little men" but they disappeared  |
| as they were about to be apprehended. They were estimated to be only  |
| two feet tall with shoulders the size of adults and                   |
| disproportionately large heads. The appearance of a large meteor at   |
| the time was also noted. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1968 - Several witnesses in Wooler, Ontario, Canada saw a bright      |
| object land on some nearby brush at 10:00 p.m.. Later several shadowy |
| beings were seen entering nearby homes and reportedly they took       |
| several items. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database  |

| 1969 - An small flying object was reported to have landed next to the |
| local primary school in Johore Baru, Johore province, Malaysia at     |
| 10:35 a.m. Several school children reported seeing five tiny men like |
| figures wearing red colored outfits emerge from the object. The       |
| children rushed at the little men in an attempt to capture one but    |
| they jumped into a hole in the ground and hid. The UFO was described  |
| as silvery colored, and it also vanished. (Source: Ahmad Jamaluddin,  |
| A Summary of UFO and Related events in Malaysia 1950-1980).           |
|                                                                       |
| 1990 - Kiev, Ukraine - Vitaly Rudenko and his brother were sleeping on |
| the roof of their kitchen around midnight when they spotted a         |
| maneuvering light that changed color from a light silver to a         |
| brilliant yellow. As they watched an eerie silence surrounded them.   |
| Rudenko half jokingly yelled out, "Come down and take us!" Quite      |
| unexpectedly, the light descended rapidly and hovered very close to   |
| them. They described it as an enormous sphere that was slightly       |
| elongated. A dazzling beam of light shot out from the sphere and      |
| struck both men. At this point they lost all track of what happened   |
| next. Rudenko woke up later crawling through the vegetable garden     |
| with his clothing scorched. His brother was found unconscious with    |
| bruises on his forehead. No hypnotic regression has been attempted to |
| date. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1990,     |

| 2001 - On this night Jose Da Silva in Canatuma, Amazonas State,       |
| Brazil saw a large disc-shaped object with several windows and a      |
| small doorway into which two two-meter tall humanoids were seen to    |
| enter. Immediately after boarding, the object began to spin very      |
| rapidly and rose slowly from the ground. It then emitted a sudden     |
| bright flash of light from the top section, and vanished in front of  |
| the witness. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |
