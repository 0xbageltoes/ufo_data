| 1897 - This was the peak date in a wave of "airship" sightings around  |
| the United States and Canada. There were over fifty reports of        |
| "airships" on this day, including 18 in Michigan alone. There were    |
| six humanoid reports, two in Iowa and one each in Texas, Wisconsin,   |
| Illinois and Michigan. Two of these reports invovled communication    |
| with quite human-looking people. |

| 1897 - A large object was seen in Linn Grove, Iowa in the morning hours of   |
| this day in 1897 flying slowly toward the north. It seemed ready to   |
| land and five men--F. G. Ellis, James Evans, David Evans, Joe         |
| Croaskey, Benjamin Buland--drove toward it in a buckboard wagon.      |
| About seven kilometers north of Linn Grove they found the craft on    |
| the ground. They came within 700 meters of it but it "spread its four |
| giant wings and rose towards the North". Two figures with             |
| shoulder-length hair were seen aboard the craft and made efforts to   |
| conceal themselves. Most residents of Linn Grove saw the craft in     |
| flight. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of    |

| 1897 - Two farm workers, Adolph Winkle and John Hulle, saw a strange craft   |
| in a field near the city of Springfield, Illinois around midday. They |
| had a discussion with its occupants, a woman and two men, and were    |
| told the ship had flown from Quincy to Springfield in 30 minutes and  |
| that the crew was making electrical repairs. (Source: Jacques Vallee, |

| 1897 - At nightfall the same day a flying object followed a train traveling  |
| from Howard to Artesian, South Dakota in Miner County. It came closer |
| and closer to the ground as it did, reported the engineer, Joe        |
| Wright. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of    |

| 1897 - At around 9:00 p.m. a passenger train on the Wabash line heading      |
| toward Quincy, Illinois had just passed Perry Springs, Missouri when  |
| a low-flying object started following it. All the passengers saw the  |
| craft, which followed the train for fifteen minutes. It had one red   |
| and one white light. It flew ahead of the train and disappeared       |
| quickly, although the train was then moving at 65 mph. (Source: Chicago       |

| 1897 - At 11:00 p.m. a cigar-shaped airship without wings and with yellow    |
| lights at the bow and stern flew to the north over Hudson, Michigan.  |
| It flew at an estimated altitude of 500 feet, and was clearly visible |
| in the bright moonlight. (Source: Lucius Farish newspaper clipping    |

| 1930 - A farmer in Largentiere, France saw a bright orange glowing,   |
| cone-shaped object on the ground at 5:30 a.m. The object took off     |
| slowly and flew away. The grass was flattened where the object had    |
| been. (Source: Richard Hall, From Airships to Arnold: A Preliminary Catalogue |

| 1952 - That evening in Gardena, California a set of unidentified      |
| nocturnal lights flew silently to the north slowly, pulsating at      |
| regular intervals. The bright white light had a red glow preceeding   |
| it and one behind. When the white light went off the red glows seemed |
| to merge to form a semi-elliptical red glow. It abruptly changed      |
| direction in a zigzag maneuver. (Source: Edward Sullivan, Civilian    |
| Saucer Intelligence-Los Angeles, letter dated April 26, 1952).        |

| 1958 - On or about this date in the mountains near Tabladitas,        |
| Argentina about 14 kilometers from Abra Pampa, a luminous object 30   |
| meters in diameter came down to ground level. (Source: Jacques        |

| 1959 - On this evening Ove Christensen was coming home after work on  |
| his bicycle along the road between Svendborg and Nyborg, Denmark when |
| he was stopped by a disc-shaped object spinning at ground level.      |
| After five minutes it began chasing him, flying six meters above him  |
| for five minutes. The UFO was luminous and seemed to be made of a     |
| glasslike material. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A  |

| 1966 - While flying near Santa Catalina Island, California a          |
| professional Hollywood movie cameraman named Hansen shot a motion     |
| picture film of a disc-shaped object while shooting an action film    |
| from a helicopter. The television show NOVA claimed the film shows    |
| what probably was a light aircraft. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, December |

| 1967 - Two young boys sawa dark gray UFO hovering over the eastern    |
| coast of Denmark in the early afternoon. An elevator descended from   |
| the bottom, with eight occupants sliding down a thick cable. They     |
| wore masks and breathing apparatus boxes on their backs, and one of   |
| them wore a blue colored uniform. They waved at the witnesses.        |

| 1968 - A three-foot in diameter reddish orange disc was seen on the   |
| ground by several soldiers near a canal north of the Gobi Desert in   |
| Xinjiang province, China on this evening. It shot straight up as the  |
| soldiers approached. (Source: Wendelle C. Stevens & Paul Dong, UFOs   |

| 1969 - At 11:00 p.m. two people driving on the highway near           |
| Pichidangui, Chile in Coquimbo province were paralyzed and their      |
| truck engine died when they encountered a disc-shaped object ahead on |
| the road. The object lit up the road and flew away, but came back two |
| minutes later. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, citing      |

| 1970 - Kalle Tiihonen, age 39, a locally well known and respected     |
| retired athlete, had just come from the sauna and was drinking coffee |
| in his kitchen in Kursu, Salla, Finland at around 5 p.m. when he and  |
| his family heard a sound resembling a swarm of bees. He then had the  |
| feeling that someone was staring at him from the doorway behind him.  |
| He turned around and saw a small creature about 1.2 meters in height, |
| clad in a tight fitting shiny green suit and helmet. The creature had |
| very dark, large eyes, with a human look. Tiihonen believed that the  |
| creature had not come in through the door since he would have heard   |
| some noise. For several moments they stared at each other, and then   |
| Tiihonen asked the creature where he was from. "From the space," was  |
| the answer. Tiihonen was unsure if he in fact heard the answer or if  |
| it was a mental message. In an effort to make conversation Tiihonen   |
| asked the alien if the Apollo 13 astronauts, then stranded in space,  |
| would get back home safely. "Yes they will", was the answer. Tiihonen |
| spoke with the being of other subjects for some time, but could not   |
| recall later what they spoke about, other than the creature promised  |
| to return. It took a step backwards and disappeared in an instant.    |
| Tiihonen again heard the noise resembling a swarm of bees. Tiihonen's |
| eight-year-old son was sitting in another room during the encounter   |
| and heard his father talking to someone, but the dividing wall kept   |
| him from seeing the humanoid. However, he did see a bright object     |
| land on the grass outside, and also saw it lift off. Tiihonen ran to  |
| the sauna where his wife was and told her about his encounter. After  |
| the incident, Tiihonen was unable to sleep for three nights in a row, |
| and experienced a sort of malaise for over a week. (Sources: K. Gosta |

| 1970 - At 1:38 p.m. local time in Mar del Plata, Argentina a luminous |
| disc-shaped object glowed as bright as the sun, yet vanished while    |
| still in view. A man by the name of Galan took a photograph of it     |
| before it disappeared. Richard Hall gives the photographer a high     |
| rating for reliability and the photograph a strong rating for         |
| genuineness. (Sources: CUFOS files; Richard H. Hall, The UFO          |

| 1971 - Two forestry workers, Morel and Hay, were driving through the  |
| forest west of Taupo, New Zealand on a cloudy evening around 9 p.m.   |
| when they encountered a large cone-shaped object with rotating lights |
| on its rim. It followed their car for over three minutes. (Source:    |

| 1972 - At 6:30 p.m. three women watched a large dark shiny            |
| disc-shaped object with two triangular windows on top and a rotating  |
| bottom. It approached their house in Driffield, Humberside, England   |
| to within 200 meters. It hovered there for a minute, then backed away |
| very slowly. It curved away to the north-northwest, and then went     |
| behind some woods. The sighting lasted for over six minutes, and they |
| were able to view the UFO through binoculars. (Source: BUFORA         |
| Journal, April 1973, p. 19).                                          |
|                                                                       |
| 1973 - During the late afternoon on the road between Manor and Penn,  |
| Pennsylvania twelve witnesses saw a disc-shaped object, between 35-60 |
| feet in diameter, that came within 70 meters of a car, causing the    |
| car's headlights to dim. During the night of April 15-16 more than a  |
| dozen witnesses reported observations of UFOs in the area of Penn and |
| Manor, Pennsylvania, near the larger town of Jeanette. Among these    |
| was the report of a single witness who was driving near the Manor,    |
| Pennsylvania Power plant at 10:55 p.m. when he observed a large       |
| glowing object over the nearby railroad tracks. It was just above the |
| trees, and the light from the object illuminated the immediate area   |
| with an intense white color. The witness pulled over to the side of   |
| the road and got out for a better look. The object, no more than a    |
| hundred yards away, was about 400 yards west of the power plant and   |
| approximately 10 feet above the trees. The object itself was          |
| completely illuminated but apparently solid in construction and about |
| three car lengths in size. It had a dome like structure on top, which |
| was the same bright color as the rest of the object. Around the main  |
| section were 2 or 3 rows of multi-colored lights, or square windows.  |
| One was whitish, the next red, and the third a blue or green hue.     |
| From the left side of the UFO a line or cord extended some 30 yards,  |
| and at the end of the cord floated a human form some eight to ten     |
| feet tall, similar to the "Apollo astronauts walking in space". It    |
| was of a purple or orange color. The witness did not see the humanoid |
| form retracted into the UFO; rather it disappeared like "a string of  |
| lights." The witness had left his lights on and engine running when   |
| he got out of his vehicle, and he noticed that the headlights had     |
| dimmed to the strength of a weak flashlight. When the object          |
| departed, the headlights came back on as bright as before. The object |
| made a high-pitched sound "like a spinning top" when it departed.     |
| "You could hear the trees blowing" as it went over them. The          |
| encounter lasted three to four minutes. (Sources: (1) Irwin           |

| p.m. It emerged out of ocean near a huge rock, traveled at a low      |
| altitude, then dropped into the water. It then rose from the ocean a  |
| second time, flew a good distance, then dove back into the water      |
| again. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 137; Richard Hall, UFO  |

| 1975 - A science teacher and six others in San Jose, California       |
| viewed an orange glowing domed disc through binoculars as it          |
| approached them at 9:23 p.m. The object made a right angle turn       |
| toward the witnesses, then stopped over their street and front yard.  |
| It was estimated to be 90 feet in diameter, with a ten foot wide      |
| cabin structure. Although it made no sound, it emitted a white beam,  |
| an orange glow, and red sparks that dropped from underneath it. It    |
| oscillated, then shot straight up into space. (Sources: Slava Mach,   |

| 1994 - Three 12-year-old boys including Diego Percebal were walking   |
| near an old crumbled shrine to the Virgen De Ciguela in Torralba de   |
| Ribota, Zaragoza, Spain at around 8:00 p.m. when they saw a           |
| strange-looking dwarfish figure moving close to the building. The     |
| figure was dark in color, about 1.30 meters in height, and somewhat   |
| deformed with a huge oval-shaped cranium and a dark featureless face. |
| It moved on two short, thick legs. The dwarf was heavy set and wore a |
| shiny black suit, and was seen to enter the abandoned shrine. The     |
| boys saw the strange humanoid hide behind some debris and broken      |
| boards. Terrified, the boys ran to get adult witnesses, several of    |
| whom responded and went inside the shrine to investigate. The adult   |
| witnesses saw the strange figure moving behind a partially collapsed  |
| brick-wall and ran from the area. There were other encounters with    |
| the humanoid later in the same area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,      |

| 1996 - Two police officers were conducting their nightly rounds late  |
| at night driving on the outskirts of Gerona, Spain when a powerful    |
| light crossed in front of them on the highway. One man felt           |
| mesmerized by the brilliant outburst of light, while his partner      |
| tried to keep hold of the patrol car's steering wheel. When the light |
| extinguished the mesmerized officer told his companion that he felt a |
| very odd sensation of being pulled upward at the same time that he    |
| saw two pairs of moist, black oval shaped eyes staring down at him    |
| from large, pear-shaped heads. The police officer had not even been   |
| able to comprehend the uncanny experience when the bizarre light      |
| staged a return. According to the officers, nine lights identical to  |
| the first appeared out of nowhere, and were then joined by three more |
| that came from across the Portuguese border. The twelve lights were   |
| elongated and had an intense yellow glow. The lights remained         |
| suspended some 100 feet above the highway, prompting the police       |
| officers to flee the scene in terror. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1997 - A woman reported seeing red and white lights flashing outside  |
| her home in Bridgeton, New Jersey late at night. She next remembered  |
| seeing a hundred white lights moving in unison like a swarm of bees,  |
| each carrying its own light in formation. She then experienced three  |
| hours of missing time. She can recall seeing a man inside a plastic   |
| looking column filled with liquid, with blue electricity flowing      |
| through it. She woke up violently ill, and with a scar on her face.   |
| While this was occurring her next door neighbor also woke up with     |
| facial burns, but he had no recollection of anything unusual          |
| happening. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database      |

| 1999 - At 2:30 a.m. a man in Mexico City, Mexico woke up in a sweat,  |
| feeling dehydrated. He got up and drank a glass of water, and felt    |
| the need to open the window curtains. When he did so he saw a bright  |
| spherical object that was circling overhead. He took out his video    |
| camera and began to tape the object. The UFO began making symmetrical |
| maneuvers, drawing lines and numbers in the sky. The witness felt     |
| mental communication then the video camera shut down. After about 10  |
| minutes of circling around the object left. The witness felt what he  |
| described as a strange electrical sensation in his left lung soon     |
| afterwards. Upon viewing the videotape he reportedly saw three        |
| humanoid figures, including a female figure. Whereabouts of the film  |
| is unknown. (Sources: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, |

| 2004 - A woman awoke at around 6:00 a.m. and walked to her screened   |
| bedroom window in Orlando, Florida.  She saw a small, oval, slightly  |
| glowing object hovering just above the ground, low outside the        |
| window.  The object was about 12 inches in diameter or less. A cat    |
| noticed the object and attempted to stalk it, whereupon it made a     |
| quick zig-zag maneuver and suddenly streaked away in a nearly         |
| instantaneous acceleration. (Sources: Peter Davenport, National UFO   |
