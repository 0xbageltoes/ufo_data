| 1954 - At 9:00 p.m. a red oval-shaped object was seen on the ground   |
| near a river in Bru, Gironde, France, 50 meters away from witnesses.  |
| The main witness, a Mr. Gamba, tried to approach it but was unable to |
| move. The object rose up into the air, and as it did it changed color |
| from white to red. Traces found at the site showed that the ground    |
| had been dug up, and some small trees had been cut. (Sources: Jacques |

| 1954 - In Bergamo, near Clusone, Italy a cigar-shaped object was seen |
| hovering 25 meters from the ground at midnight. Several figures could |
| be seen inside a transparent compartment. (Sources: Jimmy Guieu,      |

| 1967 -  Coming home from a basketball game in Breese, Illinois at     |
| 9:30 p.m., four teenagers watched a motionless bright light in the    |
| sky and got out of their car. They felt an intense heat, and heard a  |
| humming sound. The sensation of heat became very strong, even in the  |
| car. The UFO left after 10 minutes. (Sources: Skylook, April 1969, p. |
| 11;  Jay Rath, The I-Files: True Reports of Unexplained Phenomena in  |
| Illinois, p. 52).                                                     |

| 1974 -  Multiple reports of a UFO with bright colored lights came     |
| about the same time that a family of four called the Lumberton County |
| Sheriff's dispatcher to report seeing a humanoid figure wearing "a    |
| silver and black suit with some sort of helmet" in the Forest Acres   |
| area of Lumberton, North Carolina. The figure would jump into bushes  |
| and vanish when observed. The callers sounded sober, according to     |
| dispatcher Fred Barnes. Four deputies checked the woods around Forest |
| Road and Barker Ten Mile Road but found nothing.  (Sources: Ted       |
| Bloecher, CUFOS case files, report dated June 5, 1975; David F. Webb  |
| & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case #         |
| 1974-60, citing Lee Spiegel).                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1980 - Shortly after 9 p.m. Betty Cash, age 52, was driving through a |
| pine forest on a rural road near her home in Dayton, Texas with her   |
| friend Vickie Landrum, age 57, and Landrum's grandson, six-year-old   |
| Colby. They watched as a brilliant diamond-shaped object descended    |
| over the road directly in front of them, spitting flames from its     |
| underside. Betty Cash slammed on the brakes and brought the car to a  |
| halt about 150 feet away from the UFO. They immediately felt an       |
| intense heat inside the car and heard a loud roaring sound. They got  |
| out of the car and stared at the blinding light and a metallic        |
| structure as big as the 200 foot-tall water tower in Dayton. It was   |
| shaped like a diamond with a blunt top. The UFO seemed to be          |
| struggling to climb above the treetops, and it was emitting blasts of |
| fire and a continuous roar that reminded the women of a shrill        |
| welding torch, only much louder. After ten minutes the object rose    |
| above the trees, tilted onto one side, and began moving off slowly    |
| toward the south. They then saw up to 23 large, Chinook style         |
| helicopters show up in the sky, apparently in pursuit of the object.  |
|                                                                       |
| (Continued.) On the drive home Betty and Colby said they suffered headaches and    |
| later nausea, and over the next several days experienced bouts of     |
| vomiting, diarrhea, and skin burns. Betty Cash also lost most of her  |
| hair, and on January 2, 1981 was admitted to Houston's Parkway        |
| General Hospital as a burn patient. She spent four of the next five   |
| weeks in the hospital.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| Cash and Landrum contacted the state police and nearby military       |
| bases, but no one could or would provide them with an explanation.    |
| Cash was advised to contact John F. Schuessler, a NASA contractor and |
| employee of McDonnell Douglas Aircraft, who was a project manager for |
| the Space Shuttle Flight Operation, and is now the Director for       |
| MUFON. Schuessler and NASA physicist Alan Holt interviewed the        |
| witnesses, who took them to the encounter site. Where the UFO came    |
| down over the highway the yellow line had swiggled from the melting   |
| heat. "A roughly 20-foot circle of the road surface appeared to have  |
| melted and then resolidified," said Schuessler. Trees in the vicinity |
| were blackened twenty feet above the ground on the side facing the    |
| road.                                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| Schuessler also found five other witnesses who had observed the same  |
| or a similar UFO the same night. Another eight witnesses, including a |
| Dayton police officer, claimed to have seen the swarm of helicopters  |
| but not the UFO. For the next several years Schuessler tried without  |
| success to identify the helicopters and where they came from, but     |
| there were unconfirmed rumors that the helicopters came from a Texas  |
| Air National Guard base.                                              |
|                                                                       |
| Health problems continued to plague Betty Cash, Vicky Landrum and     |
| Colby. Cash moved to Birmingham, Alabama where, as Dr. Bryan          |
| McClelland said in an interview, "The illness that she suffered after |
| her exposure was an absolute classic radiation injury in which she    |
| lost skin and hair, then had diarrhea and vomiting. She could not     |
| have made it up. Vicky Landrum has subsequently died. (Sources: John  |

| 1992 -  A woman arriving home from work in a residential area of      |
| Chicago, Illinois was confronted by eight faceless men in her parking |
| lot at about 7:00 p.m. They carried hand-held devices like black      |
| flashlights. One spoke in a computer-like voice. She developed a      |
| blinding headache, and then lost consciousness. (Source: Albert S.    |
| Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1992, case # 1046, citing Ann B.   |
| Livingston).                                                          |

| 1994 -  Two witnesses driving in a car at 7:30 p.m. in Plerin, France |
| observed flashing blue lights, occurring successively and changing    |
| place. They tried to approach but were stopped by a luminous barrier  |
| 1.5 meters above the ground. They also felt a sensation of heat.      |
| (Source: French GEIPAN database, case 194).                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1994 -  A woman decided to take a short cut home on a dirt road       |
| through a wheat field in Lacrosse, Washington at 9:45 p.m.  She had a |
| close encounter with three black, wedge-shaped flying objects, with   |
| lights on their leading edge, that passed in front of her car.  The   |
| objects were about 20 feet long and emitted strong beams of light.    |
| They made a humming sound as they flew along very low and slowly,     |
| then turned and flew off to the north. The event frightened her       |
| badly. (Sources: Gerald Rowles, MUFON Field Investigations Database,  |
| case 950106S;  T. David Spencer, MUFON UFO Journal, June 1996, p.     |

| 1996 -  Two men out trapping in the woods in Hartsburg, Missouri at   |
| around 7 p.m. witnessed a silent, black triangular object overhead.   |
| It had 3-4 white strobe lights, and also blue and red lights. It made |
| no sound. (Source: Francis L. Ridge, UFO Intelligence Newsletter;     |

| 2005 -  Several large glowing orange balls of light came up from      |
| horizon east of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada at around 8:15 p.m. |
| They stopped in the sky, then circled, then dropped from view. A      |
| photograph was taken. (Sources: Geoff Dittman, 2005 Canadian UFO      |
