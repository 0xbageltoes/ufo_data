| 1952 - On this day two silver discs were sighted by over a dozen      |
| witnesses near the Vanadium Corporation's uranium processing plant in |
| Durango, Colorado. (Source: Loren E Gross, UFOs: A History. 1952:     |

| 1952 - At 10:50 p.m. six to seven translucent cream-colored objects   |
| were sighted over Tenafly, New Jersey. One object circled the area,   |
| while another flew away and then came back. This case is listed as a  |
| Project Blue Book "unknown." (Sources: Project Blue Book files        |
| counted in official statistics, case #1183; Kevin D. Randle, Invasion |

| 1953 - One mile north of the Yuma, Arizona USAF fighter base, Wells   |
| A. Webb noticed a strange object in the clear blue sky at 9:45 a.m.   |
| The UFO initially seemed to be a cloud, but it made a sharp 90 degree |
| turn, and he then saw the cloud resolve into a silver disc-shaped     |
| object. Through polaroid glasses Mr. Webb could see dark concentric   |
| rings around the craft, possibly due to a force field around the      |
| disc. With the glasses off the rings disappeared. He continued to     |
| watch for 15 minutes while the UFO receded into the distance. No      |
| sound was reported. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence       |

| 1954 - Over the Woomera Missile Test Range in South Australia a       |
| disc-shaped object was viewed throuth binoculars flying to the west.  |
| It then turned and shot off to the south and out of sight at a speed  |
| estimated to be 5,800 kph. The object was estimated to be 10 feet in  |
| diameter, and the sighting reportedly lasted five minutes. (Source:   |

| 1954 - The young boy was sitting with his goat on a small hill near   |
| the village of Fregim Amarante, Portugal when he heard a whistling    |
| sound at around four o'clock in the afternoon. He ran in the          |
| direction of the sound, which came from a nearby hollow. Once there   |
| he saw one dome-shaped object leaving the area headed towards a       |
| nearby river, but an identical object still rested on the ground. It  |
| was a metallic colored, dome shaped, and had a metal ring on the      |
| bottom and a transparent section on top. It also had a conical        |
| protrusion, brown in color, on the top. As the object left the boy    |
| felt a wave of heat. Inside this second object he could see two       |
| beings with large heads and large eyes that were wide apart; both     |
| appeared to have antennae on top of their heads, and their mouths     |
| appeared like round holes. They wore metallic blue outfits, and       |
| appeared seated with one of them operating levers while the other     |
| looked out at the witness. Ground traces were later found at the      |
| site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1954,     |

| 1958 - On this day at 3:40 p.m. a brilliant top-shaped UFO (that was  |
| symmetrical above and below the middle), suddenly approached an       |
| aircraft being flown by 40-year-old Carlos Alejo Rodriguez near the   |
| airfield in Pan de Azucar near the city of San Carlos, Maldonado      |
| province, Uruguay. The object, estimated to be three times the size   |
| of the Piper aircraft, or 15-20 meters in diameter, passed within 500 |
| meters, and the pilot felt a wave of heat. The UFO stopped and        |
| hovered for three seconds, rocked twice in a balancing motion, then   |
| shot away toward the sea leaving a vapor trail. (Sources: Gordon I.   |

| 1964 - At 8:30 in the morning a farmer, Alfred Ernst, saw an object   |
| rise from a field in Comstock, Minnesota and fly rapidly into a cloud |
| bank. It was described as oval in shape, and it left a depression and |
| four rectangular imprints in the ground. (Source: Jacques Vallee,     |

| 1966 - One year later, at 5:45 p.m. four UFOs were sighted at 20      |
| degrees elevation by the navigating officer and several other crewmen |
| aboard the HMAS ANZAC while sailing south of the Santa Cruz Islands.  |
| They were closely grouped, and the lead object glowed red. The        |
| trailing three objects were green, and formed an equilateral          |
| triangle. They left trails of color six times the size of the         |
| objects. (Source: Debbie Payne, Australasian Ufologist, October 2004, |

| 1968 - Jerome Clark and three other young men had driven to visit a   |
| rural site on a highway between Fargo and Kindred, North Dakota where |
| a "ghost light" had been recently reported. They spotted a nocturnal  |
| light and had been chasing it, more or less fruitlessly, in their     |
| car. When it re-appeared at 1:45 a.m. it loomed up in front of them,  |
| and against its reddish orange light they could see the silhouette of |
| a huge figure gliding toward them. They took off in fear in their     |
| automobile, but when they looked again from a side road the           |
| silhouetted figure was still visible and still moving towards them.   |
| This time they drove several miles before stopping. (Source: David F. |

| 1968 - At 8:35 p.m. a cylindrical UFO was seen flying north to south  |
| on this night and the next over the river in Tirgu Ocna, Romania by   |
| several witnesses including the principal witness, a Mr. Dumila. It   |
| had a pointed read end, and antennae on the sides. (Source: Ion       |

| 1969 - A deaf mute named Antonio Rodrigues, age 60, of the Fazenda    |
| Constantino was fishing during the day on the Rio Das Velhas near     |
| Jaboticatubas, Minas Gerais, Brazil when he was confronted by the     |
| same type of beings that Jose Antonio Da Silva encountered the day    |
| before in Bebedouro, 20 kilometers to the east. When they made signs  |
| for him to approach he fled in terror, and they pursued him and       |
| knocked him to the ground by the force from an energy weapon one of   |
| the short humanoids drew from his belt. They gathered around          |
| Rodrigues, felt his arm, and conversed amongst themselves in an       |
| unintelligible language. Finally, they shook their heads and departed |
| in a UFO parked nearby that ascended vertically. The witness          |
| identified the beings from various drawings, including Da Silva's     |
| that were shown to him by the investigators. (Source: David F. Webb   |

| 1972 - Aarno Heinonen was at home in Imjarvi, Finland at 10:15 p.m.   |
| when he heard a strange noise, and then a female voice that told him  |
| to go alone to a certain crossroads. He did so, and encountered a 4   |
| foot, 8 inch tall young woman with blond hair, wearing a yellow       |
| pantsuit that seemed to glow, and silver colored shoes. She carried a |
| silvery ball by a handle, and it had three antennae like projections  |
| on it. She told him that her people had come from "the other side of  |
| the Milky Way" and that three different kinds of humanoids, ranging   |
| from very small to very tall, had visited Imjarvi. She also told him  |
| that she was 180 years old, and instructed him not to mention the     |
| contact to anyone else. Heinonen previously had a dramatic close      |
| encounter with a friend while out cross-country skiing in January     |
| 1970. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of     |

| 1974 - At around 7 p.m. Ms. Becky Ingram was driving alone on a       |
| country road on Pisgah Ridge, Tennessee when she heard her nickname   |
| called ("Tomboy") and was telepathically directed to a nearby field.  |
| There she saw a 100-foot long, football-shaped UFO on the ground. In  |
| an open doorway, with a ramp extending to the ground, stood two       |
| beings named "Alton" and "Tombo" that she had met on a previous       |
| encounter, who invited her onboard. She greeted them with a handshake |
| and entered. Inside she saw five or six more humanoid beings seated   |
| around a table, eating. She declined an invitation to join them. They |
| spoke in an incomprehensible language. She declined an invitation for |
| another ride, explaining that her family was expecting her. She       |
| noticed that this time both Alton and Tombo walked without bending    |
| their knees. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue |

| 1974 - At around 11:50 p.m. on the beach in Paraipaba, Ceara state,   |
| Brazil an odd looking "jeep" was seen being driven with three men     |
| with ropes aboard. The jeep ran up the beach five times, then drove   |
| into the sea and vanished. (Source: Bob Pratt, UFO Danger Zone:       |

| 1975 - At 9:20 p.m. a domed disc-shaped object was seen on the ground |
| in Pleasanton, Texas with two figures inside the dome. The witness,   |
| who was in a truck, was hit by a blinding light, and his hands went   |
| numb. The encounter lasted for two minutes. (Source: John Schuessler, |

| 1977 - At 9:15 a.m. a 22-year-old Cessna 150 pilot trainee, Sr. Lopez |
| Ojeda, had a close encounter with a white object that looked like an  |
| inverted plate while flying over Tabio, Cundinamarca province,        |
| Colombia. There was a brilliant flash of light that temporarily       |
| impaired his vision, and the airplane's control would not respond for |
| a short while during which his surroundings seemed strangely altered. |

| 1977 - At midnight the witness, a truck driver, had made a rest stop  |
| at a truck stop on the major highway near Ragusa, Italy when he saw a |
| yellow light illuminate the cab. The light originated from a gray     |
| metallic, oval-shaped object that was hovering near the truck and     |
| close to the ground. It had a rotating ring around its middle and two |
| circular openings, one on the top and one on the bottom. A figure     |
| wearing a dark gray coverall and a helmet could be seen inside one of |
| the openings. It seemed to be controlling and directing the yellow    |
| beam of light. It made some hand gestures towards him as if greeting  |
| him. A flattened area was found in the grassy field. (Sources:        |

| 1979 - Clear photographs were taken of a metallic, hat-shaped disc    |
| over a dam in Calamuchita, Cordoba, Argentina. The photographs were   |
| taken in the middle of the afternoon by a 34-year-old man named L.    |
| Ferreyra. The UFO had three portholes, and made no sound. It shot     |
| straight up when it left. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, November 1979,  |

| 1979 - On this night an object with portholes landed in a field in    |
| Pampulhas, Minas Gerais, Brazil for 90 seconds. The witnesses were    |
| two police officers, who reported that the encounter caused EM        |
| effects on their vehicle. The ground was lit brightly, and figures    |
| could be seen looking out through portholes in the craft. It took off |
| vertically at great speed. (Sources: Jane Thomas, UFO Newsclipping    |

| 1980 - In San Jose de Mayo, Uruguay construction workers and truck    |
| drivers at a meat packing plant that was under construction saw a red |
| and green luminous ball hovering overhead. It emitted a dull noise,   |
| and its presence interrupted electrical light power and also caused   |

| 1982 - In Youngstown Ridge, Pennsylvania a single witness observed a  |
| 15-foot diameter top-shaped UFO with a dome at 8:00 p.m. There was a  |
| red pulsating light contained within the dome. It was described as    |
| the size of Piper Cub aircraft, and it flew slowly to the east at an  |
| estimated altitude of 1000 feet, then reversed direction              |
| toward Greensburg. At 11:17 in in Pleasant Hills, Pennsylvania        |

| 1984 - At 2:55 a.m. a loud pulsing sound preceded the presence of a   |
| metallic ovoid or football-shaped UFO flying overhead at 200 feet     |

| 1984 - At 1400 hours GMT a Defense Support Program (DSP) spy          |
| satellite detected the entry of an unknown object that passes 15      |
| miles in front of it, and then flew below it over the Indian Ocean.   |

| 1992 - A around two o'clock in the morning in an undisclosed location |
| in Georgia, a man woke up to see a 4.5 foot tall entity at the corner |
| of his baby son's crib. The dwarf wore a black cape with a peaked     |
| hood connected to the cape. No facial features could be discerned.    |
| The entity next moved from left to right and then disappeared through |
| the wall of the house. This experienced was followed by an unsettling |
| dream about the baby, and later by another frightening incident. A    |

| with claws move out of the hallway and touch the chest of one of the  |
| older children in the house. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid     |
