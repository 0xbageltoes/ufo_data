| 1901 - On this afternoon in 1901, newspaper accounts report a flying machine |
| was photographed in Silver City, New Mexico. The photograph "has the  |
| appearance of three cigar-shaped objects, which seemed to be lashed   |
| together, the one hanging below the other two." Unfortunately, the    |
| photograph was later lost. (Source: Jerome Clark & William Corliss,   |
| UFO Calendar 1999).                                                   |

| 1950 - In 1950, two discs passing over Durango, Mexico stopped in the sky    |
| for two hours. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 211, citing the  |
| Los Angeles Times).                                                   |

| 1952 - On this day in 1952, two flat, silver discs parked in the sky over    |
| the Tucson, Arizona suburbs for several minutes. The objects were not |
| detected on radar. (Source: Loren Gross, UFOs A History: 1952:        |
| January-May, p. 24).                                                  |

| 1959 - At 9:30 a.m. Rev. Pearl Kerwin of Silver Spring, Maryland saw  |
| a man wearing a white "helmet" behind a hedge, so she went around the |
| hedge to meet him. She encountered a being wearing a white, one-piece |
| coverall suit that covered even his feet, with bright blue trunks.    |
| The "helmet" was part of the suit, like a hood. She yelled and the    |
| man ran off very rapidly, apparently "skimming" over the ground. John |
| Gill, who saw the creature's face at a distance of 15 feet, said      |
| there were two black holes where the eyes should be. (Source: David   |

| 1959-03, citing Eli Berzweig, Don Neill, & Richard Hall, NICAP).      |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - A UFO pursued a car near Elgin, Illinois and then landed in   |
| some woods at 12:30 a.m. Something zoomed out of the UFO directly at  |
| the car, and then two white beams of light shone through the car's    |
| back window. A dog in the car was badly frightened. The UFO, which    |
| was reportedly surrounded by a fog or mist, followed the car home.    |
| Ten minutes later in St. Joseph, Michigan a multi-colored UFO was     |
| reported hovering over Lake Michigan. It was observed through         |
| binoculars, and was described as about the size of a tangerine at     |
| arm's length. It changed colors from red to green to white, and had   |
| what were described as police cruiser lights on its bottom. It made a |
| sound like "a hot-rod" initially, which later changed to a            |
| swishing-crunching sound.                                             |
|                                                                       |
| Amherst, Massachusetts - 7 March 1967                                 |
|                                                                       |

| 1967 - Later that evening UFO investigator Raymond Fowler received a  |
| UFO report from Amherst, Massachusetts of a light in the sky, twice   |
| the brightness of Venus, that changed color from white to orange as   |
| it moved away. It was also seen through binoculars, but no structure  |
| could be discerned. (Sources: NICAP investigation files, reports      |
| dated March 7 and 9, 1967; Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs Interplanetary     |

| 1969 - Three luminous UFOs were seen sitting in the evening on the   |
| ground on the roadside by many passengers on a bus traveling north of |
| Bocaiuva, Brazil. One of the UFOs later followed the bus, and         |
| returned light signals from the bus driver. (Source: APRO Bulletin,   |
| May-June 1969, p. 6).                                                 |

| 1972 - At 2:30 a.m. Diana Granville Matthews was driving along the    |
| Warminster-Bath Road near Norridge Common, England when she saw an    |
| orange oval-shaped UFO that crossed the path of her vehicle. It came  |
| from behind a hedgerow to her left and sailed down to road level, no  |
| more than 12 yards in front of her car, before lifting and careering  |
| over another hedgerow and out of sight. Startled, she did not stop to |
| investigate but continued driving on. No sooner had her dazed vision  |
| become re-accustomed to the road when she saw a tall male figure all  |
| in white clothing walking towards her on the far side of the road. He |
| was a few hundred yards ahead of her and was loping along quickly .   |
| She noted little about his facial features or coloring, but he was of |
| giant stature. She pressed hard on the accelerator and saw the tall   |
| figure striding along through deep pools of water alongside the road. |
| She drove home badly frightened. She went to bed but at about 5 a.m.  |
| she was awakened by a sharp rapping on her front door. She heard a    |
| voice clearly and insistently calling. She got up, went to the front  |
| door and opened it but saw no one there. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,  |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1972, citing Ken Rogers, The Warminster     |
| Triangle).                                                            |

| 1973 - At 10 o'clock on this day in 1973, Japanese tourist Mr. Takao took a  |
| photograph of a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, Thailand. A               |
| silver-colored, Saturn-shaped flying object showed up in the print    |
| when the film was later developed. (Source: Paul Dong, UFOs over      |
| Modern China, p. 312).                                                |

| 1974 - At 6 o'clock in the morning in 1974, two men in their twenties        |
| sighted a 30 meter long, brightly illuminated "trolley" in a field in |
| Comberouger, France. It ascended from the ground slowly and changed   |
| shape, then flew away to the east at a high rate of speed. (Source:   |
| Lumieres dans la Nuit, April 1977).                                   |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - At nine p.m. Mrs. Jane Bowles was driving with a friend, Mrs.  |
| Ann Strickland, along a country road near Winchester, Hampshire,      |
| England when their car stopped and a brilliant glow "like a white     |
| sun" lit up the area around them. An oval object was observed that    |
| was luminous and making a humming sound. A man emerged from the UFO,  |
| one similar in appearance to the one involved in Mrs. Bowles earlier  |
| close encounter. He was human like with long hair, a beard, and pink  |
| eyes. He approached, holding out his hands, and touched Mrs Bowles.   |
| His hands were warm to the touch like a human's. The man looked at    |
| Mrs. Strickland and then spoke in an unknown language. He gave        |
| something to Mrs. Bowles which she would not divulge, and then he     |
| returned to the UFO, which ascended into the sky with a hum and       |
| high-pitched noise. The women returned to Winchester, and Mrs. Bowles |
| observed that her hands were red and swollen. She had to remove her   |
| wedding ring and she found the skin underneath raw. (Source: David F. |
| Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Encounters, case |
| 1977-12, citing Lionel Beer, BUFORA).                                 |
| 1987 - At midnight a family of three in the town of Ping Wu, Szechwan |
| Province, China, including a young child, was awakened by a loud      |
| high-pitched humming coming from outside their small house. All three |
| went outside to investigate and were nearly blinded by a beam of      |
| yellow light coming from a huge reddish-orange hat-shaped UFO. It     |
| hovered above them, spinning slowly. The humming grew louder and all  |
| three had a strange floating sensation, and then blacked out. When    |
| they awoke they found themselves strapped to three steel tables in a  |
| circular room. The woman began screaming when a tiny hatchway opened  |
| in the wall and five three-foot tall humanoid beings stepped into the |
| room. They were human in shape, but with featureless faces having     |
| three huge white eyes on their foreheads. Their skin looked           |
| translucent and was bluish in color. The creatures said nothing as    |
| they proceeded to remove blood from all three abductees' arms. They   |
| then inserted long needles into their knees and ankle joints. The     |
| husband and the child seemed to have been in a trance-like state      |
| during the encounter. Electrode devices were taped to their skulls    |
| and the woman was again able to hear the loud high-pitched humming    |
| sound. One of the beings made an incision on the child's thigh that   |
| was quickly healed by a pencil-like device that was passed over it.   |
| Moments later the room became dark and everything began spinning.     |
| Their next conscious memory was walking on a roadside, seven miles    |
| from their home. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |

| 1987 - At 8:20 p.m. the witness was walking along a dirt road in      |
| Dobroslawice, Poland heading for his house when suddenly he saw five  |
| bright flashes of light. He looked in their direction and saw a       |
| bright ball of light. It landed between some trees and took off a few |
| seconds later. He continued walking until he saw a strange creature   |
| on the road just in front of him. The creature, which was wearing a   |
| tight-fitting dark suit, made a long jump into the bushes. Scared,    |
| the witness also hid in some bushes. From his hiding place he saw     |
| five additional creatures about 1.20 meters in height, wearing        |
| similar dark outfits. He started to run from the area when he noticed |
| one of the creatures was walking straight towards his hiding place.   |
| He ran about the entire 1.5 kilometers to his house. The next day he  |
| went back to the location with his family and found several           |
| footprints in the snow and a dead bull with one of its ears cut off.  |

| 1996 - At shortly after midnight 38-year-old Jose Manuel Castro       |
| Gonzalo in Ferreiras, Lugo, Spain was getting ready to retire for the |
| night and glanced out the window to take one last look at the fields. |
| Immediately he noticed a small orange sphere, encased in a            |
| multi-colored glow, hovering over a nearby hill. He decided to go out |
| and look at the strange spectacle. At the same time he summoned his   |
| brother Cesareo. Jose Manuel then took out a small flashlight and     |
| began signaling the object; at the same time yelling "come down, come |
| down!" Suddenly the sphere descended at a very high speed to treetop  |
| level. Jose Manuel ran upstairs to an outside terrace where he could  |
| see the sphere better. Inside the transparent sphere he could see     |
| five very tall men. They appeared to be floating around as the sphere |
| slowly rotated and emitted a low humming sound. Moments later a shaft |
| of "coherent" light appeared under the sphere; it reached the ground  |
| right below the sphere. Soon after, three small humanoids descended   |
| to the ground via the shaft of light. These beings seemed to move in  |
| slow motion. Once on the ground the three formed a line, grabbing     |
| each other's shoulders, not unlike a "Conga" line dance. Using quick  |
| jumping motions they began moving towards the witness. Frightened, he |
| jumped into bed and hid under the covers until dawn. The next day     |
| strange footprints were found at the spot where the small humanoids   |
| had been jumping around. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |
