| 1950 - A glowing light descended, then hovered with a swaying motion  |
| over farm country in Clarksburg, California at 5:00 a.m. It made a    |
| droning sound, and stayed in the area for 15 minutes. (Sources: R. B. |

| 1950 - An nine meter in diameter object, described as a spaceship     |
| with a propeller, allegedly landed in Penon de Los Banos, Mexico on   |
| this day. The pilot of the craft conversed in the Spanish language    |
| with the witness. His message was that "they" will colonize after we  |
| destroy ourselves. There was a reported odor of sulphur accompanying  |
| the presence of the UFOnaut. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,  |

| 1959 - Driving over a hill in Purnong Landing, South Australia at     |
| 2:10 a.m., 1.6 kilometers from the ferry, two men names Briggs and    |
| Towill came upon a multi-colored domed disc on the ground. It was     |
| about 10 meters in diameter and 100 meters away from them. The UFO    |
| went through a regular sequence of color changes. It had red and blue |
| lights, and when on the ground they were half blue and half red,      |
| which would switch colors. When they decided to get closer it rose    |
| and flew off. They watched it for 10 minutes. (Sources: Michael       |

| 1963 - Fred White was fishing in Richards Bay, South Africa at 10:30  |
| p.m. when he heard a high-pitched whine coming from the east and saw  |
| an object come in his direction and land 15 meters away, scattering   |
| sand. It was at least 30 meters in diameter, and was shaped like two  |
| plates glued together. Through several oval portholes he could see    |
| light inside. A man with a fair complexion, wearing a metallic        |
| helmet, was looked at him through one of the portholes. He wore a     |
| sky-blue, one-piece coverall with no visible buttons or fasteners,    |
| and gloves made of shiny mesh. Warm air was felt as the craft took    |
| off about six minutes later, and radio interference was noted.        |

| 1964 - At 6:17 p.m. a UFO paced a vehicle being driven by a man named |
| Grazier along Salt Creek, Tilley, South Australia. The object was     |
| estimated to be 200 feet long, silver in color, and made a whining    |
| noise as it chased the car. (Sources: Keith Basterfield, UFO Research |

| 1966 - On this night a news reporter and his family saw an egg-shaped |
| object 150 feet over some power lines in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.   |
| The felt a vibration and the TV and house lights dimmed. That same    |
| night in Black River Falls, Wisconsin a greenish-white object was     |
| seen from a house, emitting loud beeps. The witnesses' dogs reacted   |
| by barking, and there was static on the TV and stereo radio. (Source: |

| 1973 - Jorge Roberto Herrera, an engineering student, saw a daylight  |
| UFO shaped like two plates put together rim to rim about 20           |
| kilometers north of Salta, Argentina. It descended in a falling-leaf  |
| fashion until it was within a yard of the ground, then it settled in  |
| a tilted position beside the highway he was on. It was aluminum       |
| colored while it was landing, but turned color to a dull copper after |
| in landed. It was about 3-4 meters (16 feet) wide. After three        |
| minutes some legs thrust out, which leveled the UFO. Then Herrera saw |
| beside it a being 5 feet two inches tall, dressed in a white "diving  |
| suit" with an opaque helmet. The beings arms were cut off short       |
| without any hands. The feet were covered by the suit, with no other   |
| footwear. He did not see the entity emerge from the craft. It glided  |
| a few feet without walking, then vanished. A few seconds later the    |
| UFO retracted its legs, returned to an inclined position, and took    |
| off. Herrera was about 50 feet away from it at the time. He took what |
| he thought was one step and found he was already standing at the      |
| landing marks, having moved 50 feet without any conscious memory.     |
| There were seven imprints at the site, nonsymmetrically arranged,     |
| covering an area of only about five feet square. A small truck came   |
| up and its driver said that he had seen the UFO and it had caused his |
| engine and his radio to fail. This man drove Herrera, who now felt    |
| ill, to Salta. He entered a medical clinic there, where he underwent  |
| treatment for eight days without ever being told the diagnosis.       |

| 1975 - There were many UFO reports from Ashland and Iron Counties in  |
| northern Wisconsin on this night. At 9:00 p.m. a noisy disc-shaped    |
| UFO witnessed by the Baker family left a ring-shaped ground mark in   |
| the snow in Mellen, Wisconsin. Three nocturnal lights circled and     |
| buzzed cars from the Sherriff's department in Iron County at 11:00    |
| p.m. A police radio failed to work for 15 minutes during the          |
| encounters. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, April-May 1975, p. 1; CUFOS case |

| 1977 - Two teenagers near Mandurah, Western Australia observed a      |
| globe of light moving in a straight line in the sky at 8:30 p.m.      |
| Their car's engine died during the sighting, which lasted only a few  |
| seconds, but their car headlights remained on. The object was         |
| bluish-white in color and vanished in the distance, still moving at a |
| steady speed. The car's engine then could be restarted with no        |
| trouble. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle       |

| 1977 - At 9:00 p.m. Stephen Taylor, age 17, was walking home from a   |
| visit to his girlfriend's house in Pen-Y-Cwm, Pembrokeshire, Wales    |
| when he saw an orange, luminous, pear-shaped UFO in the sky. He       |
| walked to a friend's house to tell him but was not believed. About    |
| half a mile further on he noticed that he could not see the lights of |
| farmhouses to his right. Looking closer, he saw that they were        |
| obscured by a large dome-shaped object, dark in appearance, about 30  |
| to 40 feet in diameter and 40 feet high, that was resting in the      |
| adjacent field. Around its underside there was a dim glow of light.   |
| As he watched he heard footsteps, and looking around only a few yards |
| away was a figure "like a skinny human six-foot tall." The being      |
| looked "like an old man" with high cheekbones, and had large round    |
| eyes resembling those of a fish. Over its mouth was a box like device |
| with a tube leading over the shoulder. It was wearing a one-piece     |
| suit that looked semi-transparent. Taylor took a swing at the figure  |
| and ran for home. On arrival he found his dog acted strangely toward  |
| him, snarling and barking, and had to be put outdoors. The dog        |
| behaved normally the next day. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted         |

| 1980 - At 7.50 p.m. a 31-year-old man saw a huge cigar-shaped object  |
| with red lights at both ends fly silently south to north over the     |
| A422 highway east of Alcester, Warwickshire, England. The man's       |
| steering wheel became unbearably hot during the flyover, and it       |
| caused burns on his hands, including one that left a permanent mark   |
| on his left hand. (Source: Tony Green, FSR, January 1981, p. 32).     |

| 1982 - Several teenagers attending a disco in Messel, near Frankfurt, |
| Germany watched three groups of four lights arranged in squares in    |
| the night sky. The first two formations of objects moved slowly, and  |
| then hovered. The third group flew fast. At 21:30 a luminous blue     |
| domed disc appeared over some woods, and approached to within 100     |
| meters. It was ten meters in diameter, made a humming sound, and had  |
| rotating multicolored lights. Police also witnessed the object. The   |
| close encounter lasted 20 minutes. (Source: Illobrand von Ludwiger,   |

| 1987 - At 4:54 a.m. a silent, tapered 12-foot long cylindrical object |
| pursued a car near Moose Jaw, Saskachewan, Canada for four minutes.   |
| It followed the car with three witnesses closely, coming to within an |
| estimated 40 feet. It gave off no Exhaust. (Source: MUFON UFO         |

| 1990 - Ms. D. MacPhee had previously heard strange sounds in her      |
| house in Marshfield, Massachusetts at around 11:30 p.m. (March 12th)  |
| and discovered some furniture that had been overturned. Later she     |
| heard loud knocking sounds coming from the crawlspace underneath the  |
| living room floor. She ran upstairs and woke up her husband, but he   |
| fell back asleep. At 1:30 a.m. she took a flashlight with her and     |
| went to the sunroom, where she found the heavy doorframe knocked down |
| and lying on the grass. See next saw a three-and-a-half-foot tall     |
| humanoid floating above the ground. The being had a large oval-shaped |
| head with large black almond shaped eyes, smooth gray skin, a small   |
| slit for a mouth and nostril. The humanoid wore a black               |
| loose-fitting, cape-like garment. She dropped her flashlight and      |
| attempted to run upstairs to alert her husband. A period of about 50  |
| minutes of missing time was reported, confirmed by the clock and her  |
| husband, and an abduction event was later confirmed under hypnosis.   |

| 1990 - Two women driving in Pensacola Beach, Florida at three o'clock |
| in the afternoon saw two white, milk bottle-shaped objects make an    |
| angular descent over Pensacola Bay. The objects were estimated to be  |
| about 20-30 feet in length, and reflected sunlight. When less than    |
| 150 feet above the water, and at an estimated distance of two miles,  |
| the objects dematerialized and vanished in few seconds. (Source:      |

| 1992 - At ten o'clock in the morning Mr. Hooker, the chief            |
| photographer for WFRV-TV, videotaped a cigar-shaped UFO in Bellevue,  |
| Wisconsin, which is a suburb of Green Bay. The UFO traveled from      |
| right to left in the frame, passing behind a windmill. Its estimated  |
| altitude was 25,000 feet, and it had a speed of 7,000 mph. (Source:   |

| 1992 - That same night, several witnesses in Jacanas, Puerto Rico     |
| watched numerous lights maneuvering over a nearby hilltop. A huge     |
| round, lighted craft descended and appeared to land behind the hill.  |
| Two women got into their car and drove towards the location to        |
| investigate. As they neared the area they noticed a grayish luminous  |
| light hovering over the hill, and a columnar beam of light was        |
| emanating from it. One of the then went into a trance and would not   |
| respond to her companion, so the other decided to drive back to her   |
| home. Once at her house they picked up some additional witnesses and  |
| they again drove back to the area where the light had been seen       |
| hovering. When they arrived, all of the witnesses except for the      |
| driver noticed a five-foot tall humanoid figure standing by the side  |
| of the road, no more than then feet from their vehicle. The being was |
| thin with long thin arms, a large head and large dark almond-shaped   |
| eyes; his skin was gray in color and appeared to have a slight glow   |
| to it. He stood motionless looking at the witnesses. Behind him a     |
| shaft of grayish light could be seen, apparently coming from the      |
| light source above. At this point the witnesses panicked and drove    |
| away quickly from the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |
| Contact Database 1992, case # 2101, citing Jorge Martin, Evidencia    |

| 1997 - Thousands in Phoenix, Arizona saw lights arranged in a         |
| V-shaped formation on this evening beginning at 7:55 p.m. There       |
| appear to have been two separate incidents. Earlier in the evening    |
| what may have been a huge V-shaped object passed over the states of   |
| Nevada and Arizona. Over the next two hours multiple objects or       |
| lights, estimated to be one to two miles apart, hovered motionless    |
| over the mountains and were seen and videotaped from several          |
| locations. The Government explanation of the sightings was that the   |
| Air National Guard was performing flight operations from Luke A.F.B.  |
| dropping flares, and this may well be the explanation for the later   |
| sightings. However, the sightings earlier in the evening remained     |
| unexplained. (Sources: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting        |
