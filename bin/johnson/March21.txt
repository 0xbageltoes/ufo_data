| 1952 - At 10:42 p.m. a dull orange saucer was sighted moving slowly   |
| at first, then very fast for 30 seconds over farmland in Centreville, |
| Maryland. There were two witnesses, named Hutchison. A Project Blue   |
| Book "unknown." (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in official  |

| 1953 - Six disc-shaped objects flew directly over the city of Elmira, |
| New York at 3:05 p.m. They flew high and fast, and were viewed        |
| through binoculars. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in      |

| 1965 - In Malvern, Victoria, Australia a sphere with a red dome on    |
| top with three illuminated tails was sighted. It flew off to the      |
| south. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the Southern Hemisphere, p. |

| 1966 - At 8:40 p.m. a ring of lights was seen maneuvering in the sky  |
| over Niteroi, Brazil. It was difficult to see the body of the object, |
| but it was assumed to be a disc. Planes appeared and chased the UFO.  |

| 1966 - A police officer investigated a vertically descending luminous |
| object in Exeter, New Hampshire. He came upon it moving back and      |
| forth over some power lines at 10:00 p.m. Other police soon arrived,  |
| and described the object looking like a glowing egg with a dome,      |
| having red, white and green lights around the rim. (Source: Raymond   |

| 1966 - At 11:30 p.m. William Van Horn, Civil Defense Director, and    |
| over 80 Hillsdale College coeds in Hillsdale, Michigan watched a UFO  |
| from the college dormitory. They first saw a pattern of lights on the |
| ground. The source of the lights next appeared to hover and do        |
| manuevers over a marsh for the next two hours. (Sources: Duluth       |

| 1967 - On this night several teenage girls were driving in a car in   |
| Hillsboro, Kansas when they saw a bright light ahead on the road. The |
| light then approached the car and hovered directly over the roof. It  |
| was shaped like an upside-down cup on a saucer. The car's engine      |
| failed as the object hovered overhead, and although the car was       |
| stopped, it rocked back and forth quite violently. The UFO eventually |
| left and the car could be restarted without any trouble. (Sources:    |

| 1973 - On this night Brian Scott returned to the site of his 1971     |
| alien abduction in Apache Junction, Arizona. He again experienced     |
| being taken aboard a UFO by the same nine-foot-tall entities as on    |
| the earlier occasion. This time he also encountered a short, squat    |
| being known as "The Host." However, he believes the experience was    |
| projected into his mind, rather than a real, solid event. The voices  |
| of the entities "didn't seem to come from their mouths." He said that |
| on this occasion he also found the pair of boots that he'd lost on    |
| his earlier encounter. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,       |

| 1974 - Truck driver Maximiliano Iglesias Sanchez, age 21, was driving |
| to Algunilla, Spain when he encountered a blinding white light on the |
| road near Valdehijaderos at 2;15 a.m. When he was a distance of 200   |
| meters from the source of the light, his car headlights and diesel    |
| engine went out. The 8 meter wide metallic UFO, now only faintly      |
| luminous, stood of three half-meter long legs, was wider than the     |
| road and had no visible openings. A second non luminous object        |
| hovered some 16 meters above the ground to the right. Two beings      |
| appeared in front of the landed object, and they gestured with their  |
| arms. One went around the side of the UFO and returned, then both     |
| disappeared to the right side and the object ascended making a        |
| humming sound. The figures were human looking, 6 feet tall, and wore  |
| tight fitting coverall type garments with a metallic hue. They        |
| appeared to walk and move in a normal manner. Mr. Sanchez was unable  |
| to make out any facial features. After he passed the site he looked   |
| back and saw that one object had landed again on the road. (Sources:  |
| Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, Catalogue of 200 Type-I UFO Events in   |
| Spain and Portugal, case 175; David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:   |

|                                                                       |
| 1974 - Valdehijaderos, Spain - At 11:30 p.m. Mr. Sanchez had a second  |
| encounter less than 24 hours after his first close encounter, near    |
| the same site. Driving the same truck, he encountered three "ships"   |
| on the ground, and again his motor and lights malfunctioned. As       |
| before there were no openings in the UFO, but he saw four men         |
| approach him on the road. He got out and ran, and the figures pursued |
| him. After running nearly 2 kilometers he threw himself into an       |
| irrigation ditch and hid as the four men searched the area, but they  |
| were unable to find him. After waiting a safe period of time, he      |
| cautiously returned to his truck. The three objects were still there, |
| and his engine would not start. When he got into the cab and closed   |
| the door the same four figures re-appeared, gesturing to each other.  |
| They walked around the object and disappeared and it rose off the     |
| ground slowly with a humming or whistling sound. The truck then       |
| started normally. After passing the site, Mr. Sanchez saw that the    |
| third object had again landed and he stopped and returned on foot,    |
| hiding about 9 meters away. He saw the figures digging into the       |
| roadside with a T-shaped implement and a large horseshoe shaped tool. |
| He could still make out no facial features. After 3 minutes he left.  |
| A few days later UFO investigators found radioactive traces and three |
| 12-meter wide circles of flattened grass in the area. Civil guard     |
| officers also found traces. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen and Jim       |

| 1980 - Two 19-year-old teenage boys, one the son of the circus owner, |
| had burns on their bodies after a 1:15 a.m. UFO close encounter in    |
| Gioia del Colle, Italy. One had burn marks on his wrist under his     |
| wristwatch, and the other had scalding burns on his waist where his   |
| waist band had two iron studs. (Source: Massimo Greco, UFO            |

| 1982 - On an overcast evening at 9 p.m. a UFO shaped like a vertical  |
| football with three tube-like appendages banked to the north across   |
| the Ohio Turnpike in Toledo, Ohio and next came in low over a         |
| residential area at 200 feet altitude. It flew off to the south. It   |
| had three steady white lights and a small blinking red light.         |

| 1984 - At 7:45 p.m. a truck driver driving on Interstate highway I-87 |
| south of Albany, New York saw a delta-shaped UFO that looked larger   |
| than a Boeing 747. It paced his truck for five minutes. He reported   |
| it had "prism-ish" lights. (Source: J. Allen Hynek, Philip J.         |

| 1984 - Three 12-meter long boomerang-shaped objects hovered at low    |
| altitude over a highway in Claxton, Georgia at 8 p.m. One of the      |
| object flew directly overhead at treetop level. It had lights all     |
| over it. (Source: Michael Hitt, Georgia UFO Phenomenon 1947-1987, p.  |
| 81).                                                                  |

| 1986 - At 1:00 a.m. a farmer reported seeing an object with brilliant |
| lights descend and land slowly near him in Santa Ana, Corrientes      |
| province, Argentina. Two short humanoids wearing black tight fitting  |
| uniforms emerged from the object. They approached the witness and     |
| signaled to him, then spoke to him in an unknown language. The beings |
| left when the witness told them he could not understand them. A       |
| six-meter circle of burned grass was found on the site and the        |
| witness suffered from headaches after the incident. (Sources: Peter   |

| 1990 - At Pereyaslavl-Zalessky, Russia a fighter aircraft was         |
| scrambled at 10:05 p.m. to intercept a UFO that was being tracked on  |
| military radar. The pilot reported the appearance of a black body     |
| with two white flashing lights. Their was the suggestion of a         |
| silhouetted saucer-shaped craft behind the lights. The UFO changed    |
| altitude and direction at a range of 1,000 meters. It illuminated a   |
| cloud, hovered, made S-turns, and moved many times faster than an     |
| aircraft. There was also a red light moving parallel to the ground in |
| a horizontal flightpath. (Sources: Igor Maltsev, UNICAT database,     |

| 2004 - Kingfisher, Oklahoma - Two young women, both college students,  |
| witnessed two very bright lights in the night sky at 7:26 p.m., which |
| suddenly descended.  The object, triangular in shape, appeared to     |
| land.  It was brightly lit with what looked like halogen type lights, |
| and was clear or hollow in the center. Other cars stopped to park     |
| along the highway to look at it. (Source: Peter Davenport, National   |
