| 1948 - Jumping from a coal train at night in post-war Wesserbillig,   |
| Luxemborg 45-year-old Mr. Klotzbach suffered severe leg injuries and  |
| experienced a lot of bleeding. He fainted, but surprisingly when he   |
| woke up he found himself inside a UFO. The UFO occupants spoke to him |
| in German. They shared with him some undisclosed messages, and he     |
| next experienced a further loss of time. He awoke again four days     |
| later in Luxemborg, legs fully healed. (Sources: Thomas E. Bullard,   |

| 1952 - A glowing disc-shaped object dropped from the sky, darted      |

| 1955 - Mr. Robert Hunnicutt was driving down a road in Branch Hill,   |

| mouths, and lopsided chests. They were standing by the roadside as    |
| his car passed. Mr. Hunnicutt reported an odor like alfalfa and       |
| almonds. No UFO was seen. (Sources: Isabel Davis, Close Encounter at  |

| 1957 - At around 6:00 a.m. a seven meter in diameter bowl-shaped      |
| object was sighted low over the ground in Milford, Pennsylvania by a  |
| 62-year-old woman named Stichler. It hovered only five meters above   |

| craft, with bronze-colored skin and wearing a silver-colored uniform  |
| and helmet, studied the witness for a short while. (Source: Loren E.  |

| 1967 - At 10:00 p.m. in Castro Valley, California Mr. & Mrs.          |
| Ofinowicz saw a metallic domed disc descend and hover at an estimated |
| 5000 feet altitude. It emitted a bright red flame from an aperture    |
| underneath as it hovered. The flame withdrew and the object           |
| zig-zagged away. (Sources: NICAP case files; NICAP UFO Investigator,  |

| 1971 - At 10:50 p.m. Mrs. Rose was driving down a road in Belchar's   |
| Bar, England when her car headlights dimmed, the engine lost power,   |
| and a transistor radio died. An amber colored, disc-shaped object was |
| close to the highway only 30 meters away, and it approached slowly    |
| and bathed her car in light as it passed over. When 110 meters away   |
| from the object her car's power came back fully. No other vehicles    |
| were in the area at the time. (Sources: Geoffrey Coxon, FSR Case      |

| 1974 - Beams of light entered a farm house in Graye et Charnay, Jura  |
| department, France at around 2:00 a.m., and lights in the sky were    |
| seen from an object that changed color. Landing traces were later     |
| found in an oval pattern. (Sources: Richard Hall, MUFON UFO Journal,  |

| 1979 - At 1:10 a.m. a silver colored, heel-shaped or bullet-shaped    |
| object hovered between fifty and five hundred feet above some trees   |
| near the Sacramento River in Colusa, California for three minutes. It |
| had a row of red and blue-green lights along its leading edge between |
| two headlights. It also had a smooth metallic surface. It made a      |
| sound like an electric motor as it moved very slowly toward the two   |
| witnesses, Ruben and Carlos Genera. Many animals reacted to its       |
| presence. The close encounter lasted seven minutes. (Sources: Paul C. |

| 1979 - At 8:00 p.m. a nocturnal light came down and landed behind a   |
| store in the town of Charleston, Missouri. A neon sign was effected   |

| 1995 - At 11:30 p.m. a huge cigar-shaped object, 300 to 400 feet in   |
| length, was tracked by NORAD radar and sighted from an American West  |
| airline flight emerging from a thunder cloud near Bovina, Texas.      |
| Another airline crew flying near Pueblo, Colorado that same night saw |
| a large, extremely bright object zigzagging through the sky at an     |
| estimated speed of Mach 4. (Sources: (1) MUFON UFO Journal, April     |
