| 1952 - The crew of a U.S. Navy P2V Neptune patrol plane, Boak,        |
| Prentis and Hara, flying near Portland, Maine at 6:22 p.m. sighted a  |
| dark elongated cigar and a group of five unidentified lights and      |
| picked up a long thin blip on radar. Investigators considered whether |
| the crew had sighted a USAF KC-97 aircraft involved in a refueling    |
| operation, but decided that this was unlikely. The sighting lasted 20 |
| minutes. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official        |

| 1952 - At 7:30 p.m. three Air Force officers and two civilians at     |
| Warner-Robbins AFB, Georgia observed two unidentified white lights    |
| flying abreast, at a speed of 100 mph, for 15 minutes. (Source: Don   |

| 1954 - At 5:45 p.m. a metallic round flat object, was seen gliding    |
| along rapidly in calm air over Le Pin, Isere, France by four          |
| witnesses. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight Line |

| 1954 - In Marion, Virginia a radio station transmitter failed as a    |
| round shiny UFO passed by the tower. (Source: Richard Hall, The UFO   |

| 1955 - Boisseuges, France. A young shepherd heard a whistling sound   |
| at 6:00 p.m. as a dark mass appeared to fall from the sky and a rush  |
| of air swept him from his feet. The object looked like a machine with |
| an opening where a stairway became visible. Two occupants were seen.  |
| One was observed to have a reddish face, a baldhead, and very fine    |
| teeth. The craft was round, about 3.5 meters in diameter, and two     |
| meters high; it was lighted with a neon-like light. The occupants     |
| gathered some plants and flew away to the northwest. (Sources:        |

| 1957 - At 7:30 p.m. in Smithfield, Queensland, Australia Les          |
| McDonald, age 17, and Gladys Smith, age 14, saw a red light changing  |
| to green, spreading around them like a mist and covering an area      |
| about 100 meters in diameter. They became nearly paralyzed and "felt  |
| a warm glow." They had no fear, but were "merely cognizant of things  |
| as they were without [the ability] to react." This sensation lasted   |
| two minutes. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century  |
| of Landings, p. 258 (case 402), citing UFO Bulletin, December 1957).  |

| 1962 - On this night a rubber plantation worker in Vila Conceicao,    |
| near Barcelos, Amazonas, Brazil saw a round glowing object emitting   |
| sparks come down into a clearing in the plantation. Three humanoid    |
| beings jumped out, attacked another man, who happened to be a soccer  |
| referee, abducted him and took him away. They also stole 17 hens, six |
| pigs, and two cows from the plantation. The UFO shot straight up into |
| the sky when it took off. Neither the man nor the animals were        |
| ever returned. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, January 1963, p. 3; FSR,      |

| 1965 - Pretoria, South Africa. Two police officer witnesses in an     |
| approaching car, Lockem and De Klerk, watched in astonishment as a    |
| copper-colored, domed disc-shaped UFO, 30 feet in diameter, lifted    |
| off from the road in front of them at 12:10 a.m., emitting flames     |
| from two tubes on the underside. The physical traces included a       |
| burned five foot diameter depression on the macadam road. (Sources:   |

| 1971 - Radar/visual confirmation. At 8:45 p.m. astronomers and many   |
| other witnesses in St. Michel, east of Manosque, Alpes-Haut-Provence, |
| France saw a 12 meter diameter disc-shaped object make maneuvers and  |
| turns; it shot off to the northeast. (Source: Aime Michel, FSR Case   |

| 1973 -  At 7:30 p.m. a brightly glowing ellipse hovered near a house  |
| in Greilickville near Elmwood Township, Michigan. There were four     |
| witnesses, including Mr. Peacock. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO  |

| 1974 - At around 9:15 p.m. Mrs. Richards was driving north of St      |
| Helens, Tasmania, Australia with her two young children when she      |
| noticed the sky light up ahead of her. Crossing a bridge, the car     |
| then lost power and rolled to a stop. The entire electric system was  |
| out, even the heater, radio, headlights and dashboard lights, and an  |
| attempt to restart the car failed. Then "a deafening vibrating noise  |
| enveloped the car." As she and the children covered their ears,       |
| "painful electrical shocks began penetrating their bodies." This went |
| on for about a minute. Next, the car filled with a "choking smell,"   |
| and they evacuated the car and ran down the road to a house some      |
| distance away. The local resident noted their alarmed condition and   |
| took them in, and after a short while they all went back to check on  |
| their vehicle. The light had gone, and all that was unusual with the  |
| car was that its hood was hot. The car started normally, and they     |
| drove home. Coincidentally, Mrs. Richards husband was out waiting for |
| them and saw lights in the sky and heard a distant roar. Although the |
| children suffered no subsequent physiological effects, Mrs. Richards  |
| had swollen arms, fingers, and became numb on the right side of her   |
| face. (Sources: Saturday Evening Mercury, September 21, 1974; W. K.   |

| 1974 - On this afternoon west of Dargnies, Somme, France two domed    |
| discs were seen on the ground. "Men" were seen working outside the    |
| crafts. The objects took off rapidly to the west, and "lava rock" was |
| found at the landing site. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue      |

| 1978 - At 2:30 a.m. in Delano, Tennessee a witness saw two            |
| humanoid beings with what looked like flashlights in the yard. Then a |
| pink-colored UFO descended, and the figures vanished. (Source: Larry  |

| 1981 - Mr. Burke, age 48, was driving between Nowra and Kangaroo      |
| Valley, New South Wales, Australia when his car was enveloped in a    |
| blazing light which allegedly melted his tape recorder. It also       |
| caused soreness in witness's leg and fingers. (Source: ACOS Bulletin, |

| 1981 - At Charleston Lake, Ontario three members of a family watched  |
| three red spheres at 9 p.m. The first object came in over the lake at |
| tree level, banked left over the water, and disappeared in the east.  |
| The other two stayed over water, then vanished "into thin air".       |

| 1989 - Radioactive release occurred on this day at 8:20 a.m. at       |
| Chernobyl' Unit 4, Ukraine. A few hours later a doctor, Dr. I.        |
| Gospina, sighted an amber, elliptical UFO. She was able to discern    |
| its top and bottom. (Source: Paul Stonehill, The Soviet UFO Files, p. |

| 1989 - On this night a young female employee of a local meat packing  |
| plant in Nikolayev, Russia had stepped outside for a quick break at a |
| tramway when a beam of light struck her from above. Looking up, she   |
| saw a hovering disc-shaped craft which the beam had emanated from.    |
| The object was about 40-60 meters in diameter. She reported that she  |
| felt no fear and indeed had a euphoric feeling as she began rising up |
| into the air towards the object. She was levitated up to 160 feet and |
| near to the UFO. She also heard a voice extolling her to "fly with    |
| them". Other workers came to the scene and began yelling and ran      |
| towards the woman.The witnesses screaming apparently had an effect,   |
| for the beam disappeared, she was returned to ground, and the UFO     |
| flew away. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, UFO Chronicles of the Soviet     |

| 1989 - On this night witnesses north of Zaostravka, Perm, Russia      |
| watched several disc-shaped objects engaged in what looked like an    |
| aerial battle or "dogfight" with another gold-colored disc. After     |
| several explosions the electrical power in Zaostravka went off. The   |
| gold-colored disc was seen crashing into a swamp. Several military    |
| personnel tried to get near the crash site, but the isolated location |
| seemed impossible to access. The zone was declared off limits by the  |
| local military, several families living nearby were displaced, and a  |
| barbwire fence was installed in the area. Aircraft flying over the    |
| area afterwards reported equipment malfunctions and were diverted to  |
| other flight paths. The downed object was described as                |
| mushroom-shaped with a greenish-gold dome and a matt black rim with a |
| narrow base. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |

| 1992 - At 12:30 a.m. on County Road 70 northeast of Elk River,        |
| Minnesota, Mr. Townsend, age 49, witnessed a huge gray, silent domed  |
| disc over a clearing in the midst of a rainstorm. He viewed it        |
| clearly when the lightning flashed. The main body of the craft was    |
| disc-shaped, like a plate upside down, with a smaller bowl on top.    |
| There were four round white lights spaced evenly around the bottom,   |
| and it had smaller green and red lights in between. An interesting    |
| feature was that the rain stopped one foot from top the top of the    |
| craft, as if the energy field surrounding the object was causing the  |
| rain to dissipate. (Sources: Gary Trash, MUFON field investigation    |

| 1994 - At 10:15 a.m. several children in school in Ruwa, Mashona      |
| East, Zimbabwe watched three silver discs or spheres disappear with a |
| flash of light, then reappear three times. One of the objects landed  |
| and a small man emerged. He was one meter tall and pale with a        |
| scrawny neck, big eyes and long black hair. He wore a shiny tight     |
| black suit. There were a total of 62 witnesses, and the incident      |
| lasted eight minutes. In another account of the same or a parallel    |
| incident, at 10:18 in nearby Harare, Mashona East, Zimbabwe school    |
| children at a school in a rural area spotted an unknown craft that    |
| landed in the valley below, with black humanoids patroling outside.   |

| 1994 - At 8:00 p.m. numerous witnesses observed a strange craft       |
| hovering over Metepec, Mexico. At about the same time Sara Cuevas     |
| filmed a disc-shaped craft hovering over the area. A few hours        |
| later she noticed a strange luminous being standing about 90 feet     |
| away from her in the middle of a nearby sugar cane field. She filmed  |
| the four-foot-tall humanoid as it slowly moved away. The next day,    |
| footprints and strange formations of flattened crop-formation         |
| depressions were found in the sugar cane field. Another witness came  |
| forward who had seen a luminous dome-shaped craft land in the field   |

| 1996 - At around 5:00 a.m. a witness in a car noticed a shiny         |
| luminous point of unusual size in Corme Royal, Charente-Maritime,     |
| France, then saw an ovoid craft with three portholes emitting a       |
| strong orange light. It was stationary at an altitude from 30-40      |
| meters and 300-400 meters from the road. (Source: GEIPAN, case 237).  |

| 1996 - The 6-year-old witness was sleeping on the floor of his        |
| brother's room in Windsor, North Carolina when at 4:15 a.m. he awoke, |
| looked to his right, and saw a white face with a grayish tint that    |
| was apparently lying on the ground staring at him. It had large black |
| eyes and an almond-shaped head, no ears, a slit for a mouth, and two  |
| holes for a nose. It seemed to be about 5 feet 8 inches tall. The     |
| witness could not move his neck much, so he could not see its entire  |
| figure. Both the alien and young boy stared at each other for at      |
| least five minutes. It didn't flinch or move. When the witness        |
| attempted to scream he couldn't. He could move his arms, but not his  |
| legs. He then heard a voice in his head that said, "Don't move it is  |
| already done" or something similar to that. Upon hearing that, the    |
| witness decided to defend himself and punched it directly at the      |
| face. As soon as his hand made contact with the creature, it          |
| disappeared. There appears to have been about an hour time lapse, and |
| in the morning the witness found marks on his arm and later on his    |
| back. He remembers that while he was staring at the alien there       |
| appeared to be a white light aura surrounding him. He does not        |
| believe he was in his brother's room at that point. (Source: Albert   |

| 1996 - On this evening 62-year-old Uri Sakhov was walking to the      |
| local post office in Nazareth, Israel when he suddenly heard a loud   |
| whizzing sound and felt hands grab his hair and shoulders. In an      |
| instant he found himself being pulled into an egg-shaped object.      |
| Inside he found himself in a strange crystal chamber surrounded by    |
| several small humanoids. These were described as 2 to 3 feet tall,    |
| with heads shaped like light bulbs and skinny limbs that made         |
| unintelligible noises. The leader was described as taller and green   |
| colored, wearing flowing robes. He was very slender and had a narrow  |
| vertical head, with eyes located on either side of it. One of the     |
| small humanoids stepped up to the witness and sprayed his face with a |
| yellowish powder. Soon they were conducting numerous medical tests on |
| Sakhov, which made him feel "horrible" and very uncomfortable. Midway |
| through the tests he lost consciousness. When he recovered            |
| consciousness he found himself lying flat on his back in the middle   |
| of a soccer stadium, half a kilometer from his house. Feeling dizzy,  |
| he went home and noticed that he still had some of the yellow powder  |
| on his face. The powder was analyzed at a local hospital and it was   |
| found to be about 60 percent aluminum and different from any soil     |
| found in the area. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1996 Humanoid Sighting |

| 1998 - In Serpent River, Ontario two witnesses observed a silver oval |
| object hovering overhead (below the clouds) for a few seconds at 1:00 |
| p.m. Then it moved further away and hovered again. It left at a high  |
| rate of speed. (Source: Geoff Dittman, 1998 Canadian UFO Survey, case |

| light slowly descended from the sky to within 30 feet of a campsite   |
| in Bayfield Inlet, Ontario. It approached the witnesses, and when a   |
| flashlight was pointed at the light it reacted by moving away.        |

| 2007 - Anza Borrego State Park, California. Carl Mandeville           |
| (pseudonym) and his girlfriend had decided to go on an overnight      |
| backpacking adventure. Their destination was Mount Laguna, in the     |
| unincorporated area of San Diego, California. However, a forest fire  |
| in Julian closed off Route 78, so they took an alternative route and  |
| stumbled upon the Anza Borrego Desert State Park. They arrived at the |
| park at 5:00 p.m. He had never hiked or backpacked at the park        |
| before, so Carl went to the visitor center and got the information he |
| needed, and set off on his journey to Culp Valley Campground. Culp    |
| Valley campground is at approximately 3,500 feet in elevation. He and |
| his girlfriend pulled into the campground, loaded their backpacks,    |
| and set off. They only backpacked about one mile out due to it being  |
| the evening. They set up a tent about 20 feet north of the trail. The |
| tent was set up on a small slope looking down on the trail.           |
|                                                                       |
| At around 3:00 a.m. the moon had sunk behind the mountains            |
| surrounding the desert, and it was pitch black, and his girlfriend    |
| was sleeping. Unable to sleep Carl just lay there staring at the      |
| starry sky. Suddenly, he heard a man’s voice, he when he looked in    |
| the direction it was coming from he saw a green light being waved     |
| back and forth. He immediately thought it was the park ranger. The    |
| light was about 50 yards east from his tent, and he could tell that   |
| whoever it was was using the green light to guide somebody on the     |
| trail. The green light was coming closer and closer to their          |
| tent, probably not directly to the tent but down the trail. Abruptly, |
| the green light disappeared and Carl panicked, because out of nowhere |
| a massive amount of light lit up the trail 20 feet from where he was. |
| He was terrified; nobody was talking at this point, and he didn’t     |
| hear footsteps--just saw a massive amount of white light. The light   |
| was getting closer. He immediately ducked down and lay low in his     |
| tent, very scared. He then peeked out of the tent and saw 12 to 15    |
| humanoid figures that looked like people, but some were extremely     |
| tall, and the rest were really very short with large bald heads. The  |
| tall figures appeared to be wearing white, cloak-like outfits, and    |
| the short figures appeared to be naked. Terrified and with his heart  |
| pounding, Jeremy watched the beings walk very gracefully and slowly,  |
| turning their heads from left to right with each footstep. They were  |
| all holding metal rod-like implements which emitted a powerful white  |
| light. They seemed to ignore the tent and walked “peacefully” by. The |
| witness remained lying still and as quiet as he could, as the         |
| beings walked by his tent. The light eventually faded as the beings   |
| continued down the trail and disappeared. Still terrified, he woke    |
| his girlfriend 10 minutes later. He waited because he didn’t want the |
| beings to hear them talking. The next day, he told the ranger about   |
| what had happened, and the ranger wrote it down in a report,          |
| suspecting it was some type of religious cult. (Sources: Peter        |
