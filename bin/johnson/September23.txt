| 1948 - At 9:40 a.m. a group at the Los Alamos, New Mexico airport saw |
| a tilted, silver disc-shaped UFO with the apparent diameter of a dime |
| at arm's length. Its estimated distance was 15 miles. (Source: Larry  |
| Hatch, U computer database, case 1347, citing Jerome Clark).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1948 - San Pablo, California. At twelve noon Sylvester Bentham and    |
| retired U.S. Army Colonel Horace Eakins observed two daylight UFOs:   |
| one a buff or gray rectangle with vertical lines, the other a         |
| translucent "amoeba" with a dark spot near the center. The arms of    |
| the "amoeba" undulated. Both objects traveled very fast. (Source: Don |

| 1951 - On this morning a total of seven F-86 fighters were scrambled  |
| to chase a UFO that remained over southern California for nearly      |
| ninety minutes. Two F-86 jet interceptors were scrambled from George  |
| AFB near Victorville, California then vectored by air defense GCI     |
| radar to a target off the Pacific Coast 30 miles west of Long Beach   |
| Airport, where the jets circled and then headed east toward Long      |
| Beach when the object was seen at 7:55 a.m. PDT at the 12 o'clock     |
| high position. It was in a left orbit at about 50,000 feet, above the |
| F-86's. It appeared to be a bright silvery aircraft with highly swept |
| back 45° wings. The F-86's tried to climb to intercept the object but |
| it climbed away in response. Another two F-86's were scrambled from   |
| George AFB at about 8:00 a.m. as the first two were running low on    |
| fuel and broke off pursuit. The second pair of F-86's was vectored by |
| GCI  radar to Camp Pendleton, arrived there at 8:10 a.m. at 43,000    |
| feet, and spotted the object at the one o'clock high position back to |
| the north toward Muroc/Edwards AFB, appearing to be at about          |
| 50,000-55,000 feet in a controlled orbit. It looked like a swept wing |
| aircraft that sped up when the F-86's tried to close. The object was  |
| again found near March AFB, Riverside, California to the NNW but the  |
| jets broke off intercept because they were low on fuel at about 8:20  |
| a.m., landing at 8:45. A third flight of two F-86's were scrambled    |
| from George AFB and saw the object shortly after takeoff, heading     |
| south. The F-86's made climbing turns up to 43,500 feet under the now |
| round silvery object at 55,000 feet over the San Bernardino           |
| Mountains. They broke off the intercept at about 9:25 a.m. A seventh  |
| F-86 was scrambled to the south toward Long Beach but the UFO had     |
| gone. The Air Force explanation for the sightings was a balloon.      |

| 1954 - At 9:00 p.m. in Le Jou, France the Patient family witnessed    |
| the landing of a bright object that gave off a magnesium-like light,  |
| a red glow, and a narrow beam of light. It took off again a moment    |
| later and followed their car until they reached Fontland. Policemen   |
| in Plombieres and several other independent witnesses observed the    |
| object as it flew erratically over the area for 60 minutes. (Sources: |

| 1954 - At the same time as the Patient family sighting, Mrs.          |
| Vignolles of Lencouacq, France saw a luminous object come down from   |
| the sky very rapidly. It made no noise as it landed in a nearby       |
| field, next to a church. It took off very fast a few seconds later.   |

| 1962 - An abduction reportedly occurred near Franconia Notch in the   |
| White Mountains of New Hampshire. While driving on Route 3 at ten     |
| p.m. the male witness saw a large, lighted domed-oval craft, the same |
| as he had seen in 1959. He parked his truck and walked into a blue    |
| beam. Inside the craft he met the same four entities as he had        |
| encountered three years before. He was shown controls, and watched    |
| others being abducted and medically examined. He was taken to a       |
| mother ship and returned in two hours. (Source: Morton Schafer, MUFON |

| sky. (Source: International UFO Reporter, July 1979, p. 12).          |

| 1984 - At 7:30 p.m. several nocturnal lights buzzed fishermen fishing |
| in the Parnaiba River in Maranhao State, Brazil. A door was heard to  |
| slam, and voices were heard. Footprints were found on the bank of the |
| river. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Confrontations: A Scientist's Search  |

| 1984 - At 8:00 p.m. a large disc-shaped UFO followed a Piper airplane |
| from Cordoba to Resistensia, Argentina. It reportedly maneuvered at   |
| great speed, and changed color from silver to orange. The plane's     |
| compass oscillated between 0.5 and 270 degrees, and there were        |
| several other variations noted in other onboard instruments. (Source: |

| 1989 - At 9 p.m. a boy named Torshin returning home late in the       |
| evening from school in Voronezh, Russia noticed a large round red     |
| object with a black, door-like hatch hovering close to the ground. It |
| suddenly landed on four legs and the hatch opened. A ladder descended |
| and a square, robot-like being emerged. The witness did not stay      |
| around. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union: |

| 1996 - In Bouville, France a circular object was seen at 8:50 p.m.    |

| in the front. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 17426,  |

| 1996 - Lyn and Jean, two women from Kennoway, Fife, Scotland had seen |
| a huge triangular craft shining very bright beams of lights towards   |
| the ground at around 8 p.m. The object hovered over the area and was  |
| seen to bank slowly, revealing a large dome on top. On the underside  |
| they could see three small red lights on each apex. The craft shot    |
| away suddenly at the sound of an approaching aircraft. At 8:30 p.m.   |
| the witnesses again saw the huge triangle over the same location,     |
| shining down powerful beams of white light.                           |
|                                                                       |
| The witnesses returned back to the area at 9:55 p.m. and watched a    |
| powerful blue glow appear over a nearby field at about treetop level. |
| In order to get a better look they drove down a narrow lane and       |
| parked their vehicle. They then saw a large star-like object just     |
| above the blue glow that was pulsing while appearing to grow          |
| repeatedly larger and smaller. Suddenly they noticed the silhouettes  |
| of many small thin figures, moving about in the field. One of the     |
| figures was much taller than the others, around seven feet tall.      |
| Other small beings moved in among trees in the field, while a large   |
| black object sat on the ground. The figures appeared to be moving     |
| towards this object. At this point the witnesses became extremely     |
| frightened and drove away.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| They arrived at the home of one of them and borrowed some binoculars, |
| after which they soon returned to the same location and again saw the |
| blue light, still glowing, and they again saw the little beings       |
| moving about the trees. They also saw the very tall being again,      |
| standing with its back to them. Viewing the hovering object with      |
| binoculars, they could now tell that it was amber in color, with dark |
| indentations all around it. It rotated slowly, occasionally turning   |
| on its axis. Dozens of small creatures were visible inside,           |
| apparently carrying small boxes and tubular canisters around. Taller  |
| figures were also seen and described as having brown skin and         |
| oriental shaped eyes. They seemed to be supervising a large group of  |
| the smaller beings. Using the binoculars they now spotted a large     |
| transparent illuminated capsule-shaped object, that rippled on the    |
| outside and had indentations like the crenulations of a brain. The    |
| object appeared to be resting on the ground, and there were some very |
| small, thin beings inside it. Next to this object was another smaller |
| one, identical to the first, but this one contained a very tall being |
| with brown skin and narrow eyes. Another larger craft was also seen   |
| on the ground near the woods. There were lots of lights around it and |
| dozens of small entities that appeared to be working in groups,       |
| coming and going from the woods. The witnesses also saw capsule       |
| shaped objects resembling cocoons coming out of the woods. These      |
| objects suddenly shot across the field towards the witnesses,         |
| hovering only a few feet from them. Each of the capsules contained a  |
| small entity. They were soon dozens of bubbles or capsules hovering   |
| near the two women.                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| At this point the witnesses became disoriented and had vague memories |
| of being touched by the small entities with probe-like devices. These |
| small entities were described as having big dark eyes, big heads, and |
| smiled at the witnesses. They communicated among themselves by making |
| loud high-pitched noises. They remember leaving the area and          |
| returning home in a state of shock. Later, while checking the scene   |
| of the incident, UFO investigators found circular marks on the        |
| ground, burnt and dead vegetation, and branches from nearby trees     |
| covered in what appeared to be white spider web material. (Sources:   |

| 2000 - Ms. Rosa Lopez was on her way home late one night at 3:25 a.m. |
| near Sevilla, Spain when her vehicle entered a strange fog on the     |
| road. When she drove out of the fog she was surprised to see that it  |
| was almost five a.m. already, although it seemed only minutes had     |
| passed. Later, under hypnotic regression, she recounted encountering  |
| a huge metallic object on the road. Her car then stalled and stopped. |
| Several short figures with large heads and huge eyes next surrounded  |
| her vehicle. She felt weak and helpless as the humanoids carried her  |
| into the UFO. She was questioned and put through what she thought was |
| a "brain scanning" device. She was then taken back to her car, and    |
| she drove away apparently still under the control of the humanoids.   |
| She only seemed to snap out of it completely when she got home.       |
