| 1917 - Approximately 70,000 people crowded the fields surrounding the |
| Cova da Iria, a grotto in Fatima, Portugal to witness a promised      |
| miracle. Miraculous events and apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary |
| had been occurring monthly on the 13th of every month since three     |
| children--Lucia, Jesus and Marto-- had first met a mysterious lady in |
| blue there in May. Not many of those in the crowd, even those close   |
| to the three children, were able to witness the apparition of the     |
| Lady on this day, but it is reported that everyone present saw        |
| "something." The most common description was of a "gyrating sun" that |
| became a silver disc, and emitted bright rainbow shafts of light,     |
| changing colors in succession from red to violet to blue to yellow.   |
| The flat silver disc plunged downward toward earth in a zigzag        |
| fashion. Catholics present interpreted these events as a sign from    |
| God, and the religious event was later sanctioned as a miracle by the |
| Roman Catholic Church. The prophesies revealed that day have been     |
| kept secret by the Vatican, but reportedly involve the assassination  |
| of "the last Pope." (Sources: Richard H. Hall, From Airships to       |

| 1953 - Four maneuvering, nocturnal UFOs and the fall of "angel hair"  |
| was reported to have occurred in Pleasant Hill, California this       |
| night. (Source: Harold Wilkins, Flying Saucers Uncensored, p. 201).   |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - At 10:05 a.m. a weather observer in Nouasseur, French Morocco, |
| following a balloon in his theodolite, saw a round, flat, silver      |
| object fly straight and level. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Blue Book       |
| Unknowns).                                                            |

| 1954 - At 4:30 p.m. in Graulhet, Tarn department, France, numerous    |
| witnesses consistently reported that a white object flew southward at |
| full speed without leaving a vapor trail and then exploded. At the    |
| same time a circular object, much smaller and silvery, seemed to      |
| spurt out of the mass of debris and continue straight toward the      |
| south. The burst of fragments scattered throughout the sky and fell   |
| gently down like shreds of paper or cloth. The debris, which          |
| resembled silvery filaments clinging together like cobwebs, "wilted   |
| away" when handled. This volatile "angel hair" dropped by UFOs,       |
| usually in the month of October, has been described many times since  |
| 1947. (Source: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight Line      |
| Mystery, p. 170).                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - Three hours later in Crocq, France, at Donjon de Montlaur, J.  |
| Dubois and four other witnesses saw a round craft maneuver, giving    |
| off a blinding light. It had some openings or portholes, and seemed   |
| to come down and land far away from them. (Source: Jacques Vallee,    |
| Passport to Magonia, p. 227).                                         |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - On that same night Messrs. Olivier and Perano and a third man  |
| in Bourrasole, France saw a reddish disc about 4 meters in diameter   |
| with a small humanoid close by. The being stood about 1.2 meters (5   |
| feet) tall, wearing a diving suit. "His head was large with respect   |
| to the rest of the body and he had two enormous eyes. The suit was    |
| bright and shiny like glass." The Disc was surrounded by a sort of    |
| misty glow. One of the witnesses came within 20 meters of it and      |
| found himself paralyzed. The craft took off, throwing the man who     |
| stood closest to the ground, and rose into the sky very fast.         |

| 1957 - On this night Antonio Villas Boas witnessed a UFO making       |
| complex maneuvers in the sky above his family's farmhouse in Sao      |
| Francisco de Sales, Brazil. This is three nights prior to his famous  |
| abduction experience, which occurred in the early morning hours of    |
| October 16. (Source: Olavo T. Fontes, APRO Bulletin, July 1966, p.    |

| 1967 - On this day in Le Mas, France (Lozere department) at 12:45     |
| p.m., a young woman saw three small beings dressed in copper-red      |
| suits. Other observers saw only a compass needle deviate and a brief  |
| apparition of a line of six luminous discs. (Source: David F. Webb    |
| and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of humanoid reports, citing       |

| 1969 - At 10:00 p.m. a round object flew over Vancouver, British      |
| Columbia. The witness reported seeing several men inside. (Source:    |

| 1971 - In the afternoon in Kladar, Bosnia (then part of Yugoslavia) a |
| cloud of dense "flying smoke" one kilometer long and 1 meter wide     |
| moved in an undulating wave across the sky. (Source: Awareness,       |
| October 1977, p. 10, citing J. Bernard Delair, UFO Register, volume   |
| 3, 1972, case no. 121).                                               |
|                                                                       |
| 1972 - At 2:30 a.m., in the old part of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Sr.    |
| Joaquin Mercado and his wife watched a triangular formation of lights |
| move back and forth in the sky from the terrace of their apartment.   |
| In the early morning of the same day, twenty hospital employees of    |
| the Aguadilla Hospital and others saw several UFOs maneuvering in the |
| skies. The hospital supervisor, Sra. Rosa G. de Castro, told          |
| reporters that she had seen the dish-shaped objects, with a cone on   |
| the upper part, very clearly. They had lights rotating around their   |
| peripheries. At one point she saw something shoot out from one of     |
| them towards the ground, and then come back up again. (Source: Gordon |
| Creighton, FSR Case Histories, December 1973, pp. 11-14).             |

| 1973 - Photographs of nighttime lights and objects were taken in      |
| Tennessee and West Virginia, in the midst of the largest wave of UFO  |
| sightings since 1967. In Elkhorn, West Virginia a photograph was      |
| taken of a huge object, flashing regularly every one-third of second, |
| which flew toward the southeast. (Source: Ted Spickler, MUFON UFO     |

| 1983 - In Gaffney, South Carolina, a married couple awoke at 12:30    |
| a.m. to the sound of a siren, then witnessed a glowing orange-yellow  |
| UFO only twenty feet above their neighbor's house. Dogs barked. The   |
| UFO, estimated as the size of Winnebago, had two beams of light       |
| coming from the bottom. It crossed some power lines and headed to the |
| east toward the nuclear power plant. (Sources: George D. Fawcett case |
| investigations file; UFO Magazine, June 1990, p. 33).                 |
|                                                                       |
| 1989 - Several UFO sightings and a report of humanoids occurred       |
| during this day. At 10:20 a.m. in Langenburg, Saskatchewan, Canada a  |
| silver disc hovered over a garage, moved away to the north, then came |
| back to hover over a barn. A 22-year-old man out driving to meet a    |
| friend in the city of Pensacola, Florida at 8:30 p.m. saw a white,    |
| rectangular object hovering near the approaching intersection. He     |
| lost sight of it when he drove through the intersection because some  |
| trees blocked his view. In Welch, Oklahoma a family of six out        |
| driving in the evening on US Route 59 south of town saw two UFOs and  |
| two nine-foot-tall luminous green beings, near a disc-shaped object   |
| blocking the road. (Sources: Timothy Good, The UFO Report 1991, p.    |
| 231; Rex and Carol Salisberry, MUFON case investigations file, case # |
| 891007E; UFO Magazine, June 1990, p. 31).                             |
|                                                                       |
| 1997 - near Gundagai, New South Wales -- On this Monday at             |
| approximately 6 p.m. a married couple were traveling by car to        |
| Victoria along the Hume Freeway. The weather was clear and there were |
| no clouds in the sky. It was warm and previously there had been a     |
| strong north wind, but it had subsided. The witnesses were traveling  |
| toward the west and were approximately 100 kilometers north of        |
| Gundagai, Australia. As they came over the top of a hill, they        |
| noticed a light directly in front of them at about 25 to 30 degrees   |
| above the horizon and to the left of the first object. Neither object |
| appeared to be moving.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| They watched the objects for the next 30 minutes while driving toward |
| the objects. The distance to the objects had decreased to             |
| approximately one mile. They were then able to see that one was       |
| triangular and the other was a sphere with a ring around it. The      |
| objects began to throw flames from underneath, similar to rockets,    |
| although at first neither seemed to move. They stopped the car and    |
| got out and the UFOs started to move. The higher object was moving    |
| away much faster than the lower one.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| The witnesses got out their camera and took three photographs as the  |
| UFOs moved higher into the sky. The top object veered to the right    |
| while the lower one veered left. They remained lit by the sun while   |
| the witnesses were already in the gathering darkness. Both objects    |
| turned into black balls as the flames were emitted and remained that  |
| way. The total observation time was approximately 45 minutes. The     |
| photographs showed many details. The RAAF and Australian Army         |
| provided information that discounts the possibilities that these      |
| objects were jets, missiles or rockets. (Source: James Owen case      |

| 1997 - On the same day as the Australian sighting, four lights in a   |
| row approached a car from behind, being driven by a 30-year-old woman |
| at 8:30 p.m. in Struthers, Scotland. The witness drove at speeds of   |
| 90 miles per hour in an attempt to get away, and she does not         |
| remember how she got past a sharp bend in road. Possible missing time |
| of about ten minutes. (Source: Ron Halliday, UFO Scotland: The Secret |

| 2000 - At 12:30 a.m. a multicolored UFO zigzagged around the sky over |
| Kelowna, British Columbia and made a loud rumbling noise. (Source:    |
