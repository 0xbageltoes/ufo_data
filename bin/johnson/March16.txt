| 1966 - A revolving domed disc with lights around its rim circled      |
| Great Lake in Portland, Connecticut three times before flying off to  |
| the east toward Cobalt. A radio report of another UFO sighting in     |
| West Hartford, Connecticut was heard by the five witnesses, two       |
| teenage girls and their family members, immediately after their       |
| sighting. (Source: Donald A. Johnson case files, report dated April   |
| 3, 1967).                                                             |

| 1972 - Luis Bracamonte, a truck driver, saw a sparkling mist appear   |
| over the fields in Granadero, Argentina around dawn. He stopped his   |
| truck and saw the mist replaced by a blindingly vivid light. When he  |
| opened his eyes again he saw "a large oblong machine with a rim on    |
| the upper part and wide projections in the under part" about 100      |
| yards away. Three men with very broad shoulders emerged, walking with |
| difficulty. They "looked like Chinese, but with sharper features."    |
| They came up to the witness and one of them touched him, gripping his |
| elbow. They spoke to him in a strange language, but he understood     |
| that he should not be afraid of them. Then one of them took out "a    |
| plaque with two shining symbols on it," and showed it to him.         |

| 1993 - Two investigators parked out in the remote desert of Tikaboo   |
| Valley, Arizona and started watching mysterious lights maneuver over  |
| the area at 8:31 p.m. One of the lights began to approach. It was a   |
| large object with bright square-shaped light panels that glowed amber |
| and blue. It transformed into two or three bright orbs of light, and  |
| as it passed over their vehicle one of the men attempted to snap a    |
| photograph. At this point a state of confusion seemed to have         |
| overcome both witnesses, as both then became aware of a strange       |
| vehicle driving quickly away from them. A period of missing time was  |
| noted.                                                                |

| Later, under hypnotic regression, the first investigator was able to  |
| recall that the UFO stopped and hovered over their vehicle. He was    |
| then floated up through the bottom of the object and inside was met   |
| by a being that seemed to emerge through the brightly lit interior    |
| wall of the craft. The humanoid being was gray in color and about six |
| feet tall. Its eyes were slanted and it had what appeared to be black |
| plastic shields over them. Its head was egg-shaped. He wore a         |
| two-tone gray suit, with a lighter V in the front and a black belt    |
| with a black tube on his right side. He also sported a triangular     |
| emblem enclosing a helical coil on the suit's left breast. The being  |
| had long arms that ended in four long fingers. He communicated with   |
| the witness, then took him gently by the arm and escorted him inside  |
| a brightly illuminated dome-shaped room. The witness remembers seeing |
| the second investigator lying on the floor, as if frozen, and         |
| apparently being guarded by a short Grey humanoid. He was then placed |
| on a metal table that tilted 30 degrees to face a curved wall filled  |
| with a row of video screens. The being said that this process was a   |
| mind-sharing procedure that would allow the witness to learn new      |
| things. After what seemed like five minutes he was returned to an     |
| exit and floated down to the ground, about 20 feet below. (Source:    |
