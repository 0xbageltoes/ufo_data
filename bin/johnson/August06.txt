| 1860 - Red objects with a green tint were seen flying in formation   |
| over Norfolk, Virginia, moving erratically with an "undulating        |
| motion, rising and subsiding." (Sources: Baltimore Sun, August 6,     |

| 1947 - In Media, Pennsylvania at 6:00 p.m. an ex-U.S. Air Force pilot |
| and two others saw a hovering saucer-shaped object. It shot away at   |
| an estimated 725 km/h, emitting a slight hiss and flames. Many        |
| observers in nearby Philadelphia, Pennsylvania sighted a "giant       |
| firecracker" in the sky at 10:30 p.m. flying at several hundred mph.  |
| The FBI inverviewed many of these witnesses. (Sources: (1) Richard H. |

| 1947 - In Robert Lee, Texas a disc maneuvered in the sky at 10:00     |
| p.m, then flew away. It came back 15 minutes and maneuvered for       |
| another 30 minutes, changing its shape to the appearance of a cigar.  |

| 1952 - At 8:30 a.m. a dark circular object hovered for thirty minutes |
| over the U.S. Haneda Air Force Base near Tokyo, Japan. It was tracked |
| on radar as its blip hovered, then shot away at 300 knots, and in the |
| process divided into three evenly spaced radar targets. (Source:      |

| 1952 - At around 9 p.m. an orange colored flying sphere struck the    |
| chimney of a house in West Lumberton, North Carolina, breaking it,    |
| and fell into the back yard. The object was eight feet long and stood |
| six feet high. A little man only 30 inches tall was standing beside   |
| it. When the witness, Mr. J. Allen, asked him if he was hurt, he and  |
| the craft vanished with a loud noise. (Sources: Lumberton (NC)        |

| 1954 - Starting at 10 p.m. a DC-3 flying over the ocean at Baranagua  |
| Bay, Parana State, Brazil was continuously buzzed by an orange        |
| fireball for two hours. It would turn blue on acceleration. Jets were |

| 1961 - In Meekatharra, Western Australia beginning at 3:30 a.m. 12    |
| white metallic disc-shaped objects flew over the countryside in pairs |
| for six hours. They left an angel hair residue, a snowy-white mesh    |

| 1963 - On this evening in Sanford, Florida UFO investigator Orville   |
| Hartle saw a UFO with 13 other witnesses. The object appeared in the  |
| northeastern sky first as a red, then a white moving light. The UFO   |
| engaged in gyrations, pulsated, moved up-and-down, back-and-forth,    |
| and once emitted a flare of green-white light. The sighting lasted    |
| several minutes. (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume  |

| 1965 - At 2:00 a.m. a UFO landed in the San Bernardino area of        |
| Caracas, Venezuela. It created a "scorched area 10 meters wide" in a  |
| cornfield. Three beings emerged from the craft, but when a farmer     |
| approached they "whipped back into it" and took off at once. (Source: |

| 1965 - (1) Shortly after 11:00 p.m. cows in a pasture in Ambleside,   |
| Cumbria, England panicked when a fiery red cigar-shaped object with   |
| illuminated windows flew over, making a groaning noise. (2) That same |
| evening at 10 p.m. EDT a maneuvering disc-shaped object caused an     |
| animal reaction in West Homestead, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.        |

| 1966 - At 2:20 a.m. in rural Bellingham, Massachusetts a couple heard |
| a hissing sound for several minutes. One got out of bed, looked out,  |
| and saw a multicolored disc-shaped object hovering at 500 feet, then  |
| depart at high speed. The 35-year-old female witness reportedly heard |
| a "hum", then the object "came from behind the barn", hovered over a  |
| tree near their home, and finally shot off to the northeast. (Source: |

| 1966 - At 2:00 p.m. a man and his family near Kelly Air Force Base in |
| Cameron County, Texas observed a dark object hovering near their      |
| isolated house. It had a square "door" emitting a yellow light. Three |
| children saw a dwarf through the opening. He was dressed in shiny     |
| black coveralls. The object left slowly with a soft humming sound.    |

| 1967 - Again in the San Bernardino area of Caracas, Venezuela (see    |
| report above from 1965), at 2:00 a.m. Pedro Riera was awakened by     |
| someone shaking his bed. When he focused his eyes he saw in front of  |
| him a small humanoid being with a disproportionately large head,      |
| wearing a "rubber suit." He jumped out of bed and grabbed the little  |
| man, but the dwarf wriggled free and went out the second floor        |
| window. Riera looked out and saw a round, multicolored, luminous      |
| object so brilliant that he had to close his eyes. In the morning he  |
| found deposits of a rust-like substance, and small footprints in this |
| "rust" on the pavement below his balcony. Several neighbors had also  |
| observed the UFO. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:     |

| 1967 - On this afternoon at 3:30 p.m. in Wyoming Flats, Luzerne       |
| County, Pennsylvania six men reporting witnessing a shiny, metallic   |
| disc only three feet in diameter. It made a buzzing sound and         |
| descended from above some power lines, and landed giving off a red    |
| glow. It shot back up into the sky after a short while, flying east.  |
| A five-foot wide circular burned area was found, but a local farmer   |
| said he had burned some brush there. (Source: NICAP case files,       |

| 1968 - At 9:30 p.m. four young men were outside near St. Gertrude,    |
| Quebec, Canada when they heard their dog barking furiously. They      |
| heard a creaking sound and saw a four foot tall luminous figure jump  |
| out of a hedge nearby. The figure had large shoulders and long arms   |
| that hung down. It vanished quickly in plain sight in front of the    |
| witnesses. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |

| 1972 - Two teenaged sisters at home at 10:00 p.m. in Christies Beach, |
| South Australia heard a beep-beep noise, then saw a group of 3 or 4   |
| white lights lighting up the ground in an empty lot next door. The    |

| 1972 - At 8:45 p.m. in Liverpool, England an iridescent object hung   |
| stationary in the sky for three minutes. It then veered rapidly to    |
| the west, and hovered again for another two minutes. It left          |
| a contrail when it moved, and red flames shot from the rear end of    |
| the object. If finally flew away at 11:03 p.m. towards the west.      |

| 1972 - On this night in a heavily wooded area near Beaver Lake,       |
| Alberta, Canada a man felt compelled to go to a campsite where he was |
| convinced he would see a UFO. The main witness and two other men who  |
| accompanied him waited at the site for several hours before they saw  |
| a light travel across the lake and descend behind some nearby trees.  |
| Shortly later they heard heavy footsteps of someone approaching       |
| through the trees. Frightened, they ran to their car and began to     |
| drive away when a giant creature resembling an octopus with large     |
| tentacles appeared, apparently trying to grab them. The three men got |
| out of the car and struggled with the creature, but soon got back     |
| into the car and drove away, stopping at a field outside the forest.  |
| They then went back, but the creature had disappeared by then.        |

| 1974 - In Basella, Lerida, Spain a man and a woman watched a          |

| 1975 - In Maubege, Nord, France a white sphere with portholes was     |
| seen by three independent witnesses at 9:10 p.m. It may have landed,  |
| leaving behind possible landing traces on the ground. It flew off to  |
| the south. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, December 1975).            |

| 1976 - At around ten o'clock in the morning Freddy Chiasson, age 52,  |
| his wife Claire, and their two sons Morris and Rony were driving      |
| across Gaspesian Park, Quebec, Canada in a thick fog, heading toward  |
| Matane. Suddenly, a beam of red light coming from the sky struck the  |
| road ahead of their car. Despite the thick fog, this beam had very    |
| sharp edges, and formed a circle 6 inches in diameter where it struck |
| the road. It paced their car for several miles, always staying the    |
| same distance ahead, then broke up into several “sections” which shut |
| up into one another, like a collapsible telescope, and rose back      |
| upwards in a coherent light fashion. They then saw a dazzling white   |
| light to their left, which the witness estimated to be a half mile    |
| away. This light approached them and stopped over the road some       |
| distance ahead of them. Mr. Chiasson stopped the car. They then felt  |
| a very strong sensation of heat, and the car’s headlights and radio   |
| went out. Next the car's motor died, and it could not be re-started.  |
| They could smell a peculiar “acid” odor that irritated their nasal    |
| passages.                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| They got out of their car and walked through the fog toward the       |
| fuzzy, intense light ahead. When they reached it, they found that it  |
| came from an oval, scallop shell-like object that was wider than the  |
| road and resting on legs. It was about 40 feet wide, 15 feet high,    |
| and made of a dull metal with four square circumferential windows     |
| three feet wide, out of which light was pouring. They could hear a    |
| dull sound, like wood rubbing on wood at regular intervals. Mrs.      |
| Chiasson approached the windows and let out a scream when she         |
| confronted a large face in the window with big round eyes. The sight  |
| made Mr. Chiasson feel like vomiting. All four family members ran     |
| back to their car, which still could not be started. After a few      |
| minutes the two youths again walked through the thinning fog toward   |
| the object, followed by their father. When they had got to within ten |
| paces they could see that the light inside had gone out. Two beams    |
| of blue-green light appeared, coming from behind the UFO toward the   |
| witnesses. Mr. Chiasson felt sick, his eyes watered, and he vomited.  |
| Then the light rays went out, and they saw two beings standing or     |
| floating beside the object. They were about seven feet tall, bald,    |
| and looked very ugly to the witnesses because their appearance filled |
| them with feelings of terror. They wore brown khaki uniforms, like a  |
| police officer's but closer fitting, and were holding tubes about a   |
| yard long. The beings were stocky with wide shoulders, which were     |
| “too high” and round bodies. Their square-chinned, straw yellow faces |
| had big, round eyes without eyelids and thick red lips. Neither Mr.   |
| Chiasson nor his sons saw noses or ears, and they may not have had    |
| any. They stood still, but turned their heads as if examining the     |
| witnesses. After this confrontation which seemed to last for minutes, |
| the three male witnesses fled back to the car, where Mr. Chiasson     |
| vomited again. After this there was a burst of light in front of them |
| followed by another wave of unbearable heat that made them all crouch |
| down in the car. This intensified for a short while, and then         |
| gradually passed. When they got up they could see that there was      |
| nothing ahead of them, and the fog had practically dissipated. The    |
| car could be started at this point. At the place where the UFO had    |
| been there was a slight luminous vapor. For about ten hours           |
| afterwards, all four of the Chiassons suffered from intense itching.   |

| 2006 - A man was driving in a remote area of Tapiola, Michigan at     |
| 11:30 p.m. when a square metallic craft overtook and hovered above    |
| his vehicle. The witness sped up to 80 mph but his car kept slowing   |
| down. He came to a sharp curve and the craft was still over him, so   |
| he tried to drive faster after taking the turn, but the car continued |
| to slow down until it finally came to a complete halt. He and his dog |
| got out of the vehicle and ran into some bushes to hide. He next saw  |
| many lights shining through the brush that were maybe a thousand      |
| yards distant, and there were about 50 “figures” moving about among   |
| the lights. There was a "cocoon"-shaped object about 12 feet long,    |
| and there were body lights on this object. The activity reminded him  |
| of an ant colony. Apparently the creatures noticed him, because he    |
| saw three creatures coming toward him into the brush. These were      |
| somewhat human-like with normal sized heads, but had very long legs   |
| and very long arms and large torsos. He did not see the eyes, for     |
| they were back lit by the light coming from behind them. The man and  |
| his dog ran further from the area and hid again. The beings appeared  |
| to search for him but gave up. From his new location he saw two more  |
| cocoon-like crafts, with numerous creatures moving around them.       |

| 2013 - A West Coast man was “freaked out” after coming face to face   |
| with a UFO that was parked on the road outside the entrance to        |
| Shantytown. Matthew Robert, a mechanic from Rutherglen, New Zealand   |
| reported that at 8:45 p.m. he and three other cars were confronted by |
| a night-time visitor on Rutherglen Road, south of Greymouth.          |
|                                                                       |
| When the car-shaped object suddenly lifted into the sky in a blinding |
| light, he and the other drivers left in such a hurry they left skid   |
| marks on the road. "I was changing a CD as I was driving and when I   |
| looked up, I saw what looked like a car without its lights on,        |
| stopped in the middle of the road outside Shantytown. I slammed on my |
| brakes and my eyes were still trying to focus, when suddenly the      |
| thing just lit up and shot into the sky," Mr. Robert said. "When I    |
| came to my senses I noticed that there were three other cars that had |
| stopped on the other side of the road as well. It's weird that no one |
| else has come forward because those people obviously would have seen  |
| the same thing I did." He reports that immediately following the      |
| incident he lost all cellphone reception, his vision was blurry, and  |
| his eyes were watery for about an hour afterwards.                    |
|                                                                       |
| Mr. Robert was driving into Greymouth at the time to pick up his      |
| partner, Charlotte Rose, from work at the hospital. He arrived there  |
| wide-eyed and agitated. Ms. Rose said he was visibly shaken. "I just  |
| looked at him and I could tell something bad had happened, he was     |
| freaked out and his eyes were watery," Ms Rose said. Mr. Robert hoped |
| the witnesses from the other cars would also come forward and confirm |
| what he saw. One vehicle was a Mitsubishi Chariot, and another a      |
| Honda Accord. He did not have a description of the third vehicle. "I  |
| know people are going to think that it's crazy, but I know what I     |
