| 1903 - On this evening a father and daughter observed a glowing 100   |
| foot long cigar shaped object with two rows of four equally spaced    |
| windows. It was hovering just behind some trees over a farm in        |
| Helmer, Indiana. As the man ran toward the object it moved away, and  |
| zigzagged across the sky at great speed, accelerating away toward the |
| west. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen & Jim Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole     |

| 1950 - Six bluish white disc-shaped objects turned in the sky over    |
| Ankara, Turkey on this day. They next shot straight up into the sky   |
| and vanished from sight. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 211).  |

| 1950 - Six to twelve black octagon-shaped objects were seen from the  |
| air over Little Rock, Arkansas at 4:30 p.m. The object made a sharp   |
| sudden turn to the southwest. (Sources: Project Blue Book files       |

| 1966 - A glowing ovoid object descended slowly over Barra de Tijuca,  |
| Brazil at 1:50 a.m. It circled Pt. Marisco, and then flew off the the |
| west. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database)                      |

| 1966 - Mr. Ward saw an object 12 meters in diameter and 7 meters high |
| over Harrow, Ontario, Canada. It emitted a pulsating white light, and |
| landed in a field. It had a revolving section on it with portholes.   |

| 1966 - A police officer in Milan, Michigan observed an object in the  |
| southwestern sky at midnight. He thought it was a plane about to      |
| crash, although no sound was audible. He tried to contact the police  |
| headquarters, but his radio transmitter did not work properly. The 16 |
| meter wide object, which now had colored lights spinning around its   |
| periphery, came to within 25 meters of the patrol car, followed it    |
| for a kilometer, then flew off toward the northwest. The object was   |
| described as being like a "very huge pie" lighted with red, blue, and |
| white lights spinning completely around it. The witness had been a    |
| policeman for 10 years, and had never seen anything like it before.   |

| 1969 - At 2:45 a.m. a retired army general had become stranded along  |
| a dirt road near Barra da Tijuca, Brazil after his car engine had     |
| quit. Moments later he saw a light rising above a nearby hill and     |
| felt a strong compulsion to walk towards it. After a short walk he    |
| came upon an object with translucent walls that gave off a dazzling   |
| light. Despite the translucent appearance the object seemed to be     |
| made of some metallic substance. Part of the surface of the object    |
| flung itself back, and three human-like figures stood in the opening, |
| one a woman. The witness was invited inside by one of the men, who    |
| informed him that the other two were also humans. After a short ride  |
| in the craft he was told that time, as we conceive of it, doesn't     |
| exist. He was eventually released back to his vehicle, which could    |
| quickly be started again without any difficulty. (Source: Albert S.   |

| 1969 - Mr. Herbert Lancaster told police that a saucer-shaped UFO     |
| landed in front of his car at a crossroads in Lincoln, Nebraska on    |
| this night and "turned off" his car's engine. A human-appearing       |
| occupant, "an ordinary average guy," was seen peering out from a      |
| window inside the craft. After a short while UFO "took off at high    |
| rate of speed." (Source: Lincoln Star, March 18, 1966; David F. Webb  |
| & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1969-27,  |

| 1972 - On this night in Loveland, Ohio police officer Johnson's       |
| headlights picked up an animal lying on the road. As he opened his    |
| car door it rose up on its hind legs and showed itself to be a        |
| leathery skinned biped with a frog like face. It was three to four    |
| feet tall, like the creature seen by Officer Williams two weeks       |
| before. It stepped over the guardrail and went down the embankment of |
| the river. Officer Johnson took out his service revolver and fired a  |
| shot at it, but missed. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher,      |

| Mackey & Ron Schaffner).                                              |

| 1974 - At 3:30 a.m. Cristobal Munoz Romero, a driver for the          |
| President of the Cadiz, Spain City Council, was driving through a     |
| foggy area five kilometers from the Rota Naval Airbase near Sanlucar  |
| de Barrameda when he saw a metallic white light above and to the      |
| right of his car. It advanced to within 10 meters of the road and     |
| then, seconds later, he saw the silhouette of a human looking being   |
| more than 2 meters tall next to the road. The being appeared to be    |
| wearing a diver suit from which projected a bright, cylindrical,      |
| solid like coherent beam of light from the front part of the collar.  |
| The light could lengthen and shrink. As the car passed by the entity  |
| the engine began to fail and the automobile was "shaking like a leaf" |
| in a very strong wind. The witness sped up and, in fear, quickly left |
| the site. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |
| of Humanoid Reports, case 1974-08, citing Vincente-Juan Ballester     |
| Olmos, Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference,    |
| case 361).                                                            |

| 1992 - In Ipigua, Sao Paulo state, Brazil birds were seen fleeing     |
| from a farming area at 5:30 p.m. Next a 12-meter in diameter metallic |
| disc rose up from ground, and a palm tree was seen bending and        |
| swaying away from the direction of the UFO when it took off. A        |
| circular depression resembling a "saucer nest" was left in the        |
| vegetation. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 17660,    |
