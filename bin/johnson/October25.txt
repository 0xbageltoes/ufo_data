| 1953 - At 9:30 p.m. Jim Milligan, age 16, was driving through a park  |
| in Santa Fe, New Mexico when he saw something fall in front of his    |
| car. He stopped his car when the object landed in some bushes. He     |
| walked toward it and found a craft that looked like two ship hulls    |
| glued together, about three meters (10 feet) in length. When he tried |
| to touch it the object flew away. (Sources: Albuquerque Tribune,      |

| 1954 - At six o'clock in the morning Ulderico Cardinali saw a         |
| disc-shaped craft among the reeds of a swamp in northern Italy. It    |
| was two meters in diameter and near it stood a small being, 1.40 m    |
| (4.6 feet) tall, clad in yellowish-brown coveralls. This creature     |
| went inside the machine, which took off at very high speed, touching  |
| the tops of the reeds as it flew away. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,      |

| 1954 - At 6:15 a.m. a brilliant disc-shaped object was seen by many   |
| independent observers spinning over the city of Vienna, Austria. It   |
| left a trail behind, and the event lasted five minutes. (Source:      |

| 1954 - At 6:30 a.m. a luminous disc-shaped object with a glowing      |
| light was seen rising from a field nearby some beet scales in Calais, |
| France. It was absolutely silent.  (Source: Jean Sider, Dossier 1954  |

| Arraye-et-Han, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France saw a phosphorescent craft  |
| shaped like a chicken brooder, about two meters in diameter and one   |

| 1954 - Two twelve year olds, Giampieri and Santucci, were walking     |
| home next to a field in Colcerasa Di Cing, Marche, Italy at around    |
| 5:00 p.m. when their dog became agitated and started barking. One of  |
| the youths went ahead to see what was wrong and observed three very   |
| short, dark figures with huge flattened heads standing next to a      |
| large keg like object. They wore shiny black outfits. The first boy   |
| yelled for his friend to come and look, whereupon the short humanoids |
| ran into the object. It took off emitting a loud whistling sound,     |
| knocking the first witness down with a strong gust of wind. Another   |
| witness who was nearby saw the same or a similar object fly over the  |
| area. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of     |

| 1954 - A reddish disc-shaped object that emitted a luminous streak    |
| from its rear landed near a witness in Benabbio, Liguria, Italy at    |
| around eight o'clock in the evening. Two human like figures briefly   |
| emerged from the object, then went back inside. The object then took  |
| off at high speed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| 1954 - At 9:30 p.m. many observers on Terceira Island, The Azores in  |
| the Atlantic Ocean watched a four meter long cigar-shaped object fly  |
| through the sky for two minutes, making a noise and emitting smoke    |
| and fire. (Sources: Lourenco Victor, PORTUCAT - Portuguese UFO        |

| 1954 - At eleven o'clock at night in Jonquerets-de-Livet, Eure,       |
| France two 18-year-old farm workers, Jean Cheradame and Rene Marais,  |
| encountered a bright light source in a field. When they approached    |
| the light, two featureless illuminated humanoid forms emerged from    |
| the light source. They lacked both arms and legs, and essentially     |
| resembled "white plastic bags" lit from within. The figures emerged   |
| from the light source in the field and separated into two distinct    |
| forms as they approached. When they receded they again merged into    |
| one form before merging with the light source. They were about five   |
| feet tall. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue  |

| 1957 - In Petropolis, Brazil a girl suffering from cancer appeared    |
| near death when the house was suddenly illuminated by a strong light, |
| as if a searchlight had been aimed at her room. It came from an       |
| object whose top part was reddish yellow. Two figures emerged from it |
| and entered the house. They were about 1.20 meters (4 feet) tall, had |
| long reddish-yellow hair, slanted small green eyes, and wore white    |
| gloves and glowing white uniforms. Before the astounded family and    |
| another witness astounded witnesses they used a device producing a    |
| bluish-white light and another instrument, in what appeared to be     |
| radiation treatment of the patient. After 30 minutes they left,       |
| leaving her completely cured. The report was filed by an anonymous    |
| source. (Sources: Flying Saucer Review, September-October 1967;       |

| 1959 - On the Trans-Canada Highway west of Fort William, Canada four  |
| hunters (Douglas Robinson, Ray Disguiseppe, Victor Arnone and John    |
| Defilippo, of Port Arthur) saw an oval, luminous object follow their  |
| car about 13 meters above them. The object was spinning, stopped when |
| they did, and was white in color. It paced their car and remained     |
| with them for nearly 50 km. (Source: Passport to Magonia: A Century   |
| of Landings, case 499, citing Flying Saucer Review, January-February  |
| 1960).                                                                |

| 1967 - Clive Robinson and Richard Corben, both age 14, and a third    |
| boy, reported that they had witnessed the landing of a dome-shaped    |
| object with a smaller hump on top in Malvern, England at 8:45 p.m.    |
| The object came down 200 meters away from them, and it took off       |
| diagonally, leaving behind some traces. (Source: Jacques Vallee,      |

| 1973 - At around nine p.m. 15 people observed a very large red        |
| spherical object hovering low in the sky near Uniontown, Pennsylvania |
| which began to descend towards a pasture. The incident began when the |
| principal witness and two boys proceeded up a hill in a field and     |
| observed a white, dome-shaped craft on the ground that illuminated    |
| the area. It was making a loud whirring sound. It was estimated to be |
| about 100 feet in diameter. They stood about 250 feet from the        |
| object, and about 75 feet from a fence line.                          |
|                                                                       |
| Walking along the fence line were two tall figures, from seven to     |
| nine feet tall, covered with hair, and with long arms hanging down    |
| past the knees. They displayed glowing green eyes. The witnesses shot |
| at the creatures, first tracer bullets were shot over their heads,    |
| and then regular bullets was used. The larger of the two creatures    |
| turned towards the other almost touching it, and at the same time the |
| object in the field disappeared and the sound stopped. The creatures  |
| slowly walked towards the woods. One boy had already run home, and    |
| the other two left the field and went to a neighbor's farmhouse and   |
| called the state police. When the state trooper arrived he and the    |
| main witness went to the site. Where the object had landed there was  |
| a glowing area that was about 150 feet in diameter. He said he could  |
| read a newspaper from the light. The farm animals refused to go into  |
| the area. One witness reported that before they left the field the    |
| larger of the two creatures was seen in the woods about 10 feet from  |
| them. He shot at it and it struck the fence that stood between them.  |
| Later that night an investigation team arrived in the area. Radiation |
| levels were normal and the glow was now gone, but the animals still   |
| wouldn't go near the spot. Strange events now began to take place.    |
|                                                                       |
| Some in the party saw a farmhouse several hundred feet away suddenly  |
| light up like daylight for several seconds. The main witness, a       |
| rather large man, suddenly began growling, and he threw his father    |
| and investigator George Lutz to the ground. The man ran into the      |
| field growling and screaming near inhuman screams. His own dog        |
| approached him as to attack, then ran off whimpering. He then         |
| collapsed onto the ground. Two of the investigating team started to   |
| complain they were having trouble breathing, and the air became       |
| filled with a strong odor like rotten eggs. As the main witness came  |
| out of what appeared to be a trance-like state, he began talking      |
| about visions he had seen of the end of the world. (Source: David F.  |

| 1973 - On this night Brian Scott saw an object with blinking lights   |
| on the bottom surrounded by haze. He drove to his home in Buena Park, |
| California to get someone else to see it and returned with the        |
| teenage babysitter of his children. Both witnesses felt as if their   |
| minds had somehow been lifted up to the craft, bathed in green light, |
| and returned. Scott saw short humanoids, but felt that this vague     |
| encounter was unplanned, and with different humanoids than in his     |
| earlier experiences. A period of an hour and a half could not be      |
| accounted for. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:         |

| 1974 - Carl Higdon, an oil driller by occupation, was out hunting in  |
| the Medicine Bow National Forest in southern Wyoming in the late      |
| afternoon, and when he fired his rifle at an elk the bullet went only |
| 50 feet and then fell to the ground. Next he saw a man standing in a  |
| shadow. He was human-like, about 6.2 feet tall, but he lacked a chin  |
| and his hair stood straight out. He wore a black uniform with a belt  |
| and insignia. Mr. Higdon could not remember what happened next, but   |
| he knew he had a two hour period of missing time. Under hypnosis by   |
| Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle of the University of Wyoming, he recalled an      |
| abduction experience that involved three short humanoids who gave him |
| a medical exam. (Sources: Rick Kenyon, CUFOS case files, report dated |

| 1975 - Two close encounter incidents occurred within an hour of each  |
| other in the same community in Ceara state, Brazil. At around 6 p.m.  |
| a young woman with the surname of Dira had bathed in a lagoon in Sao  |
| Gondolo do Amarante on the river and was washing clothes when she     |
| felt a heat wave and saw an oscillating blue light in the sky nearby. |
| ing in river felt burning, saw oscillating blue light in sky.         |
| Frightened, she took cover in some undergrowth, but the light         |
| increased intensity. When the blue light approached even closer she   |
| ran home. She managed to escape inside her house, but she had a high  |
| body temp, bloodshot eyes, and her skin looked like it had a sunburn. |
| Within the hour a local man was struck by a blue beam of light,       |
| reputedly from a disc. He subsequently died. Several other witnesses  |
| reported being attacked and terrified by the experience. Some         |
| reported being paralyzed by a blue light. (Sources: (1) Claude        |

| 1975 - On the same night in Happy Camp, California three men, Harris, |
| Gayer, and Jackson had a humanoid encounter involving ground traces   |
| and the levitation of their car. On the previous night they had seen  |
| a large reddish orange light take off. This evening at 7 p.m. they    |
| found three imprints arranged in a triangle, 18 inches x 24 inches    |
| and 20 feet apart. They heard a high-pitched screeching sound. They   |
| directed their spotlight in the direction of the noise and saw two    |
| large eyes five feet above the ground and a black outline. (Sources:  |

| including two deaf 14 year olds, Johny Myhr and Frank Sverre Mandt,   |
| sighted a disc-shaped object some ten meters in diameter that hovered |

| into the air again. The boys ran to the nearby Alm school. They       |
| noticed the object ascend at a 40-degree angle, and saw several       |
| windows in the craft. There was what appeared to be a human-looking   |
| person behind one of the windows. Tracks were later found in the      |
| newly plowed field. Each track was rectangular shaped with rounded    |
| corners, and measured 14 cm by 36 cm with a depth of 10 cm. The       |
| tracks were arranged in a triangular shape. (Sources: GICOFF Sweden,  |

| 1978 - Around five o'clock in the morning a 51-year-old farmer name   |
| Giovanni was searching for a stray cow in the hills near his home in  |
| Tagliocozzo, Abruzzi, Italy when he came to an open field and spotted |
| a large light brown object shaped like a shoeshine box on the ground. |
| Lighted windows surrounded the craft. He approached to within three   |
| feet and saw six to seven humanoid beings inside. These were          |
| described as small and human like, both male and female. The women    |
| were blonde and had beautiful pink skin and smiled at him. The men    |
| were uglier, had darker skin and appeared elderly, and they ignored   |
| him. (Source: Roberto Pinotti, International UFO Reporter, October    |

| Argentina two night-shift workers were surprised by a short dwarfish  |
| being (0.75 meters tall), who hopped on one leg and operated a        |
| complicated looking machine that levitated the workers and left them  |
| floating in midair when it vanished. (Sources: Jane Thomas, UFO       |

| 1998 - A 12-year-old boy in Victoria, British Columbia suddenly woke  |
| up for no apparent reason. His room was illuminated by a light from   |
| an unknown source. He looked at the foot of his bed and saw an odd    |
| figure standing there. The figure was hard to see because of the      |
| light, but it looked as if its hands were covering up his face. The   |
| witness attempted to look closer but suddenly fell asleep. He woke up |
| the next morning sleeping on the family sofa. (Source: Albert S.      |
