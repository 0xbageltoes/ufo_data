| 1957 - On or about this date a woman driving along a desolate road in |
| Ridgefield, Connecticut encountered a five meter long cigar-shaped    |
| object close to the ground on the left side of the road. It had       |
| several portholes about half a meter in diameter that were lit by a   |
| yellow light. Shadows could be seen moving around behind the windows. |
| It took off going straight up. (Source: Thomas M. Olsen, The          |

| he encountered a 40-foot wide oval-shaped domed disc with black marks |
| around the rim, 20-30 feet above the ground. The object seemed        |
| metallic, was white in color with portholes, and made no sound. The   |
| car's engine stopped when he was 20 meters away, but the headlights   |
| remained on. The incident lasted five minutes. (Sources: Richard      |

| 1966 - At 8:20 p.m. a glowing ovoid object hovered and made circular  |
| maneuvers in the sky for 15 minutes in Heytesbury, near Warminster in |
| Wiltshire, England. It changed colors as well, reported the witness,  |
| a man named Baldwin. (Sources: Arthur Shuttlewood, The Warminister    |

| 1967 - Police officer D. E. Swider was driving on Interstate 65 eight |
| miles south of Seymour, Indiana at 7:50 p.m. when he encountered a    |
| huge, round object that moved slowly, changing colors from white      |

| 1967 - At 8:45 p.m. Donald and Marie Guseman were driving on U.S.     |
| Highway 13 in Odessa, Delaware when they encountered a 50 foot wide   |
| disc-shaped object with a cupola and ports underneath, and forwardly  |
| placed light beams. It also had a green light on one side and a red   |
| light on the other. It hovered motionless over some trees, then       |
| emitted light beams that swung upwards at a 45-degree angle into the  |
| sky. The object began moving away, and then suddenly disappeared.     |
| Their close encounter lasted two minutes. (Source: Project Blue Book  |

| 1973 - At 3:00 a.m. three people driving in a car on the A414 highway |
| between Hemel Hempstead and St. Albans in Hertford, England           |
| encountered a bright yellow sphere hovering low over the road, about  |
| 20 or 30 feet above a viaduct. Their car engine stopped. The car      |
| engine restarted inself when the sphere rose vertically into the sky  |
| and departed. (Sources: FSR, March 1973, p. 32; Mark Rodeghier, UFO   |

| 1974 - At around 9:00 p.m. four people riding in a car traveling on a |
| highway north-northeast of Evansville, Indiana were levitated by a    |
| UFO and lost consciousness. When they recovered they had over two     |
| hours of missing time. One of the abductees recalled interacting with |
| an occupant of the UFO, who looked to be human, and who somehow knew  |
| the names of the four of them. (Sources: Francis L. Ridge, Regional   |

| 1974 - That same night David Swanner of Shores Community, Tennessee   |
| claims he was invited by two "men" to ride in a UFO. In a few moments |
| after accepting their invitation they flew over San Francisco, then   |
| the Hawaiian Islands. His round trip excursion took only 45 minutes.  |
| The purpose of their presence, he was told, was to warn of the        |
| "possible destruction of Solar System by atomic bombs." The UFOnauts  |
| were between four and five feet tall, wore white coveralls, and had   |
| long, pointed chins, with tall foreheads and small eyes, ears, and    |
| noses. They claimed that their lifespan was between 125-175 years.    |
| Mr. Swanner was instructed to inform the public. He claims to possess |
| proof, but it "cannot now be revealed." This was his third close      |
| encounter with the aliens. (Sources: Ted Bloecher, MUFON Symposium    |

| 1978 - At around two o'clock at night residents of Saline, Michigan   |
| saw a boomerang or triangular object hovering near their homes. Mr. & |
| Mrs. Sibson as well as an Air Force mechanic reported their sightings |
| to the Center for UFO Studies. According to them it made a slight     |
| humming noise, and was the size of three 747's with a "great          |
| intensity of light coming from the center fuselage area." It flew off |
| toward the west slowly. (Sources: CUFOS files, letter dated February  |

| 1979 - Over 50 UFOs surrounded the butane freighter "Tamames" in the  |
| Mediterranean Sea as it approached the Escombreras refinery in the    |
| Baleares Islands. The ship's log reports that clouds appeared at 3:00 |
| a.m., and the ship's radar showed the presence of many huge aerial    |
| objects. The presence of yellow lights in the clouds continued for    |
| six hours. The radar of a second ship also reported the presence of   |
| the UFOs, but not ground radar. (Source: Jane Thomas, UFO             |

| 1979 - A dark, beehive-shaped UFO was encountered by a 53-year-old    |
| man named Hathaway at 9:00 p.m. while he was driving near Liverpool   |
| Creek, Queensland, Australia. The failure of his car's engine and     |
| lights closely corresponded with a brilliant flash of light coming    |
| from the object. It rose vertically when it left. The witness         |
| experienced memory loss for some of the events surrounding his close  |
| encounter. (Source: Keith Basterfield, MUFON UFO Journal, December    |
| 1979).                                                                |

| 1988 - In Oswestry, Shropshire, England a 45 foot in diameter yellow  |
| cloud of something that looked like fog was seen straddling a         |
| hedgerow around 8:00 a.m. It glowed brightly and made a noise like    |
| rushing air. A dog ran into it and disappeared for a time. The two    |
| adult witnesses, a man and a woman, reported feeling a tingling       |
| sensation and smelling a sulphur smell. The dog was later found       |
| unconscious, wet and hot; its eyes were red and it seemed close to    |
| death. It died a few weeks later. (Source: Jenny Randles, Time        |

| 1993 - A young boy went outside at 7:25 p.m. in Colebrook, New        |
| Hampshire and saw a domed disc-shaped object approaching from the     |
| northeast. He went and got his stepfather, and both of them witnessed |
| two hovering discs. The discs appeared to be the size of a house,     |
| about four feet apart, and only 50 feet in altitude. They seemed to   |
| have a pink glow on the far sides. Their lights blinked, and then     |
| both discs disappeared. (Sources: Sandra Black, MUFON Field           |

| 1993 - On the same night Mr. C. Wagh was at the Bridge of Earn in     |
| Central Scotland when he sighted six white lights in a straight line. |
| He viewed then through binoculars as they hovered for the next 15     |
| minutes. They seemed to be about 6 to 8 feet apart. They suddenly     |
| went out. (Source: Ron Halliday, UFO Scotland: The Secret History of  |
| Scotland's UFO Phenomenon, p. 159).                                   |

| 1995 - La Canada, Avila, Spain - A 28-year-old security guard was      |
| fixing his guard dog's dinner at 9:55 p.m. The dog was tied to a      |
| heavy tonnage truck, and he suddenly began barking furiously and      |
| staring at the nearby railroad tracks. The man looked around but did  |
| not find anything unusual, so he fed his dog and went back to the     |
| guard shack. Fifteen seconds later the dog began barking again. When  |
| he stepped outside he was confronted by a bizarre looking, shiny      |
| white figure that floated quietly above the ground. The apparition    |
| was about 1.5 meters in length and floated horizontally just above    |
| the ground. At the same time the dog's food dish began to vibrate and |
| "jump around." The figure was wearing what looked like a flowing      |
| tunic, and a conical hat concealed its facial features. It advanced   |
| slowly towards the witness. The terrified man noticed the humanoid    |
| had long hair, resembling that of a woman's, and it carried that      |
| looked like a baton in one hand. The man fled from the area and       |
| didn't return until he had found some additional witnesses. When they |
| returned to the site they found bizarre symbols that had been traced  |
| on the ground with a sharp tool. One of the symbols resembled a       |
| six-pointed star and others were "STN", "BEL" and the letter "U".     |
| Superstitious locals attributed these symbols to be "demonic" in      |
| nature. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1995,   |
