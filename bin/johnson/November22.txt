| plowed field; it had a bright white light on each tip and the lower   |
| one was blinking. It also had square ports or windows along the side. |

| above their plane, made a slight wobble, then a sharp turn, and       |
| finally accelerated away to the southwest. The bright white UFO was   |
| seen above the Savannah River Nuclear Plant during this encounter,    |
| that lasted for 4-5 minutes. Jacksonville ATC confirmed three reports |

| 2000 - At 5:15 p.m. in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho a bright orange-yellow    |
| colored object, described as two stories high and with structure      |
| underneath, hovered above the observer and did not move away when the |
| witness got closer. The sighting lasted 7 minutes. (Source:Peter      |

| 2002 - At 8:50 p.m. several hundred witnesses observed the overflight |
| of a ring-shaped UFO over the port city of Santos, Sao Paulo State,   |
| Brazil. It had alternating yellow, white and blue lights. It flew     |
| toward the southwest. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell,   |

| 2002 - Tim Edwards reported that his daughter, Brandy Edwards, and    |
| their cousin, Sashay Rauter, first noticed a very bright tube of      |
| intense white light 30 degrees above the horizon, while driving four  |
| miles past Wilkerson Pass on Highway 24 in the South Park Basin,      |
| Colorado at 5:30 p.m. "The UFO was 2 to 3 times brighter than the     |
| illuminated vapor trails [by the setting sun] in the area, and        |
| clearly not diffused...the object didn't appear to move during the    |
| duration of the sighting, staying in a fixed horizontal position." He |
| then stopped and videotaped it from two locations: on Highway 24 40   |
| miles east of Buena Vista, Colorado, and again about 30 miles east of |
| it. It had the apparent size of something one-quarter of an inch long |
| held at arm's length. Other objects were observed around the main     |
| object, but they were not real clear with the naked eye and they      |
| didn't have binoculars. "As close as I could tell, the object was 40  |
| to 50 miles away, which would have put it over Buena Vista, Colorado  |
| or west of it. In the video it appears that a plasma field or         |
| something was surrounding the object and two barbell-shaped objects   |
| are with it and staionary in conjunction with it." The video did not  |
| show the intense white cigar in it, but rather a red and tan colored  |
| envelope. The object graduatlly diminished and disappeared before     |
| their eyes.  (Sources: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell, Filer's   |
