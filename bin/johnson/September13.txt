| 1948 - At seven o'clock in the evening a seminarian in Oristano,      |
| Sardegna, Italy watched as a domed disc-shaped object tilted in the   |
| air, so that two humanoid beings were visible inside its transparent  |
| dome. The object flew off to the east toward Madau. (Source: Larry    |

| 1952 - At around 8:00 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. George Snitowski and their    |
| little girl suddenly found their car stalled in Frametown, West       |
| Virginia. An unpleasant odor filled the air, similar to the smell of  |
| ether mixed with sulphur. Mr. Snitowski thought a chemical plant      |
| might be burning in the area and walked towards a strong light        |
| visible in the woods, in spite of the noxious smell. Coming near it,  |
| he felt a prickling sensation throughout his body, had to stop, and   |
| then lost his balance several times as he returned to the car where   |
| he found his wife terrified, pointing at a giant creature. (Sources:  |

| 1952 - On that same night in Allentown, Pennsylvania at 7:40 p.m.,    |
| private pilot W.A. Hobler was flying his Beech Bonanza airplane when  |
| he sighted a flying object shaped like a fat football, fiery          |
| orange-red in color, descend and then pull up in front of his         |
| airplane. This encounter was very brief, and lasted only two 2        |
| seconds. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official        |

| 1955 - At 2:10 a.m. a silent red sphere flew across the sky to the    |
| northeast in St. Louis, Senegal, curving and spiraling. It made an    |
| ascent to a higher altitude, flew to the southeast, and then shot off |
| to the west. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, November 1968).          |

| 1959 - At 1:05 a.m. Mr. R. H. Daubner of Gills Rock, Wisconsin        |
| observed a yellow ring of lights, with eight blue lights within it,   |
| and then five larger brilliant red lights. The object rose very fast  |
| vertically from a field three kilometers away, while making a         |
| pulsating jet noise. The tremendous pulsating noise hurt the ears of  |
| the witness. The encounter lasted ten minutes. (Sources: Project Blue |

| 1959 - Scott Mitchell was in the hallway of his home near Gills Rock, |
| Wisconsin at around two o'clock in the afternoon when he saw a being  |
| with dark gray, wrinkled skin standing at the opposite end. The being |
| communicated in a telepathic voice that went directly to the witness  |
| head, "Do not be afraid, we will not harm you." Frightened, he tried  |
| to run away but was paralyzed in his tracks, and time seemed to slow  |
| down around him. A greenish haze surrounded him and the being glided  |
| towards him. The witness then lost consciousness. His next memory was |
| of waking up in the house in a back bedroom. The witness subsequently |
| experienced further close encounters. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,     |

| 1959 - At four p.m. at least two control tower operators at Bunker   |
| Hill AFB, Indiana plus the pilot of a Mooney private aircraft sighted |
| a pear-shaped object, colored white, cream, and metallic, with a      |
| trail under it. The UFO showed little movement during the three hour  |
| sighting. An intercept was attempted by a USAF T-33 jet trainer, but  |
| it failed to find the UFO in time. (Sources: Project Blue Book files  |
| counted in official statistics, case # 6507; Don Berliner, Project    |

| 1962 - Overfield, England. Myra Jones was driving between Overfield   |
| and Norris Hill at 11:20 p.m. when she spotted a luminous, gray       |
| object, larger than a car, with a dome on top. It was flying just     |
| above the ground at the height of the telephone poles, spinning       |
| slowly. There were dark spots visible on the underside of the object. |
| It nearly touched the car, then gave a whistling sound and flew away. |

| 1966 - At 7:30 a.m. a 12-year-old boy, Randy Rotenberger, saw         |
| a silvery-gray ellipsoid object with a clear bubble dome protruding   |
| from its top; it hovered about a mile away, then landed with a        |
| falling leaf motion near a farm between Gwinner and Stirum, North     |
| Dakota within 300 yards of him. It made a low-pitched whine during    |
| the five-minute sighting. It had tripod landing gear, two red lights, |
| two white and one green light, and the transparent dome. A            |
| businessman from Gwinner and an Air Force Lt. Colonel went to the     |
| site and discovered three ground traces, apparently left by spherical |
| objects, 18 centimeters deep, which were very compact. The ground     |
| imprint marks were in the arrangement of an isoceles triangle 7.9 m x |
| 6.5 m x 6.5 m. Radiation measured at 0.1 milliroentgen (normal). The  |
| boy reported that the object "went away so fast that it vanished."    |

| 1966 - The two astrononauts on Gemini XI, Dick Gordon and Pete        |
| Conrad, during their 18th orbit of the Earth, took a photograph of a  |
| unknown object in outer space while over the Greenwich Time Zone at   |
| 18.25 hours. (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, August 1977, p. 1;     |

| 1967 - A very bright strobe light was seen, and then six red lights   |
| in a row appeared at the same spot and hovered over the Haddam Neck,  |
| Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant at 8:45 p.m. It was seen by    |
| Mrs. Rarey and her two children from their home across the            |
| Connecticut River in Haddam, Connecticut. The sighting lasted 15      |
| minutes. (Source: Donald A. Johnson field investigation case files).  |

| 1972 - A rural family in Burlington, Colorado, who police said were   |
| responsible people, reported that a UFO "as big as a house" flew      |
| parallel to their car as they were driving down a country road at     |
| night. One of the witnesses said the object landed and took off twice |
| in a nearby field. The object was round and  had "rays" or beam of    |
| light coming out of it. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, October      |
| 1972, p. 3).                                                          |

| 1973 - While driving toward Ijui, Brazil at about 1:30 a.m., a group  |
| of motorists saw a luminous yellow egg-shaped object approach their   |
| car near the town of Gravatai and begin pacing them on the left side, |
| some 2-3 kilometers away. When the driver blinked the headlights off  |
| and on, the object reproduced the same signals. The driver stopped    |
| the car and he and some passengers then got out, waving their arms.   |
| The object was very close to the ground and appeared to be about to   |
| land. They resumed their trip and after awhile the object, which      |
| continued to pace them, beamed a light in their direction. One of the |
| passengers said she had the impression something or someone was       |
| trying to contact her mentally. (Source: Inforespace, August 1975,    |

| 1986 - On this night, during a rash of UFO sightings in the region,   |
| Mrs. Lourdes Altamirano watched a huge luminous object descend and    |
| hover above a large tree in Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potosi State,     |
| Mexico. Several gigantic figures descended from the object and        |
| inspected the surroundings, at one point they showed interest in a    |
| large ceramic jar near the witness's house. She attempted to wake her |
| husband but he remained asleep. After awhile, the beings reboarded    |
| their craft, which took off at high speed. (Source: Albert S.         |

| 1988 - At 10:45 p.m. a 39-year-old witness stepped outside his house  |
| in Chiloquin, Klamath County, Oregon and saw a multicolored, oval     |
| object moving away. He got his wife, daughter, and a telescope. They  |
| watched the object in the sky for more than an hour. They saw the     |
| same object "at distance" for the next two nights. (Source: Hernandez |

| 1990 - At around 1:00 a.m. a mother awoke to tuck her young daughter  |
| under the blankets in Rudnyi, Kustanay region, Kazakhstan when she    |
| saw a luminous sphere through the balcony door on the upper level of  |
| house. A bright yellow beam, surrounded in a greenish glow, shone     |
| into the room from the sphere. The woman covered the young girl with  |
| the blanket and then heard a strong ringing in her ears and           |
| developed a strong headache. At this point she lost consciousness.    |
| After an hour or so she woke up, feeling a burning sensation on her   |
| stomach. She found a spot about ten centimeters in length and two     |
| centimeters wide on her stomach that appeared to be a burn scar.      |

| 1990 - At 8:12 p.m. a local woman named Irina M. was returning home   |
| from work in Mahachkala, Dagestan, Russia when she looked at the sky  |
| and saw a fast moving yellow light, which was flying from the         |
| southwest to the east. It was moving faster than a normal aircraft,   |
| and she immediately thought it could be a UFO. The object began to    |
| descend at a high speed, noticeably increasing in size. It was round  |
| and silvery, and hovered in midair not too far away from the witness. |
| Astounded, she next saw a humanoid figure floating next to the        |
| object. The figure was human-like, tall, slender, and with a pale     |
| young face without wrinkles. He also had what appeared to be very     |
| kind, blue eyes. The alien was dressed in a loose-fitting tunic,      |
| silver-white in color. The being stood in mid-air, gazing at the      |
| witness intently, and seemed to be encased in a bright halo of light. |
| She became concerned, fearing that she might be abducted by the       |
| alien, and she rushed home to her children as fast as she could. Near |
| her front door she looked back and saw the UFO departing, decreasing  |
| in size and vanishing in a few seconds. Apparently the only other     |
| witness to this event was a stray dog that frequented the area.       |

| 1990 - On the same night as the CE-3 encounter in Dagestan, witnesses |
| in Samara Province, Russia reported seeing a small luminous, white    |
| triangular-shaped craft flying above their rooftops. The object       |
| appeared to be transparent, and inside three dark human-like figures  |
| with large round heads could be seen. One figure was standing up,     |
| while the other two were seated behind what looked like a control     |
| panel. The object later became dark and landed outside a perimeter    |
| fence of the Volga-Ural Military Air Defense Radar Station. At around |
| midnight, as armed guards approached the object, without warning it   |
| fired a powerful beam of concentrated energy that destroyed the radar |
| antenna on top of their communications building. The steel in the     |
| radar unit was burned from a distance of 430 feet. A wristwatch       |
| reportedly slowed, and other strange physical effects were noted.     |
| Some of the sentries went missing temporarily, and could not account  |
| for their whereabouts. (Sources: Paul Stonehill, The Soviet UFO       |

| 1992 - In Albertville, Minnesota a 5-6 foot wide disc-shaped object   |
| with portholes was seen at 100 feet altitude, only 100 yards away. It |
| had an estimated thickness of 1-2 feet. (Source: Joni Astrup, UFO     |

| front of their van's windshield. They were four to six feet           |
| in length, six to eight feet apart. They crossed the highway at       |

| 1999 - Witnesses in Blanchardville, Wisconsin reported a shoot-out    |
| between Air National Guard F-16s and six maneuvering balls of light   |
| (BOLs) at 2:15 a.m., with one light emitting a ray that took out one  |
| of the jets. The jet reportedly crashed, and the pilot who ejected    |
