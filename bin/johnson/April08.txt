| 1897 - A dark bulk with a narrow, rectangular shape and illuminated   |
| windows flew over a dairy farm in the western part of Iowa after      |
| midnight. It was 30 to 35 feet long and 6 or 7 feet wide. Over the    |
| rectagular shaped was a cigar-shaped bag, about the same length but   |
| 10 feet thicker in width. The two horses of a carriage being driven   |
| by a dairy farmer spooked at the sight of the craft and bolted,       |
| throwing the man into a ditch. The object rose vertically on its      |
| departure. (Source: Philip Rife, It Didn't Start with Roswell, p. 5). |

| 1950 - At 2:00 a.m. Mr. Earl Baker, a metal worker in Kokomo, Indiana |
| was awakened by his dog and observed an object outside his bedroom    |
| window only 60 meters away hovering at a low altitude. It was a gray  |
| metallic disc, five meters in diameter and 15-feet thick. It was      |
| shaped like a top with a kind of "conning tower" turret on top. It    |
| had three ports on the rim giving off a blue light. It was            |
| oscillating, spinning slowly, and had three portholes shining with a  |
| blue-white light. It hovered for about 2 minutes and then left toward |
| the north at high speed. (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in  |

| 1950 - Later that day shortly before noon near Amarillo, Texas, David |
| Lightfoot, age 12, and his brother Charles saw a disc land behind a   |
| hill. They were able to walk up to it and touch it. It was the size   |
| of a car tire, about 30 cm high, with a rounded top that rotated. It  |
| had a pivot between the base and the top. It took off very fast. The  |
| faces and arms of the boys later became red with welts. (Sources:     |

| 1950 - On the same day two disc-shaped objects buzzed a house in San  |
| Francisco, California. They stopped in mid-flight, then went up and   |
| around like playing a game of tag. (Source: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A   |

| 1952 - A CBS-TV staff engineer named Smith saw a copper red disc with |
| sharply defined edges fly "unbelievably fast" between Pear Blossom    |
| and Big Pine, California. It made no sound as it flew and left no     |
| contrail. (Source: Edward Sullivan, Civilian Saucer Intelligence--Los |

| 1953 - At 7:55 p.m. Lt. D. J. Pichon, pilot of a USAF F-94B jet       |
| interceptor, watched a bright blue light descend, accelerate, and     |
| then fly parallel to his F-94 over Fukuoka, Japan. The object         |
| increased its speed and blinked out after 45 seconds. (Source: Don    |

| 1954 - In Chicago, Illinois Lelah Stoker sighted a white, domed disc  |
| with a humanoid suspended beneath it over Lake Michigan at 4:30 p.m.  |
| It skimmed above the surface of the lake in all directions. She       |
| called in another tenant of the building, Mr. Boruszak, who also saw  |
| the object. She called the Coast Guard to report it. The object       |
| diminished in size till it was no bigger than a piece of newspaper,   |
| as it descended and landed. The human figure, now on the ground, was  |
| short and wore a tight-fitting, green, one-piece suit that covered    |
| even the head. He walked up and down the lakefront until the Coast    |
| Guard search boat had passed. Then the UFO enlarged and rose up       |
| again; the suspended "pilot" entered it, and it took off very, very   |
| fast with no sound. The sighting lasted 30 minutes. (Sources: Don     |

| 1956 - At 11:45 p.m. near Exauroux, France two brothers, ages 18 and  |
| 20, saw a red ball of light come down to their left and hover at tree |
| height. It then left at fantastic speed. Three additional witnesses   |
| reported it independently. The object was a disc about 7.5 meters in  |
| diameter, with a red dome, and rotating fins under it. It emitted a   |
| yellow-orange glow. It moved away extremely quickly. (Source: Jacques |

| 1966 - At 11:40 p.m. at Daniels Park near Denver, Colorado six        |
| teenagers heard footsteps on the roof of a park shelter where they    |
| were sitting and talking. They next saw a big humanoid figure pass in |
| front of a landed light in a nearby field. Four domed football shaped |
| objects maneuvered around in the sky, making a pulsating sound. When  |
| they tried to flee the area in their car the car's engine wouldn't    |
| start. (Source: Timothy Green Beckley, Flying Saucers, March 1967, p. |

| 1967 - Four college students saw a greenish fluorescent glow on the   |
| ground 180 feet away from their car while driving in the morning      |
| eight miles outside of Banner Elk, North Carolina. Their radio        |
| experienced interference and their car's engine quit. The glow came   |
| from an object, apparently on the ground, which flew up and passed    |
| nearby and then flew away. Three imprints in the shape of an          |
| equilateral triangle were found in the ground. (Sources: Ted          |

| 1968 - At a hospital in Magill, South Australia the hospital staff    |
| saw a circular craft in the sky that was flashing red, white, and     |
| green lights. The hospital's ship-to-shore radio was effected during  |
| the sighting. (Source: Michael Hervey, UFOs over the Southern         |

| 1972 - In Talavera la Real, Badajoz, Spain at 12:30 a.m. four people  |
| watched an orange ball of light in a 1.5 meter column of white smoke. |

| 1977 - A domed disc-shaped object flew around two witnesses in Cedar  |
| Springs, Michigan at two o'clock in the morning, hovering and         |
| flashing over some nearby trees. Ring ground marks were found on the  |
| ground. (Source: CUFOS files, report dated April 10, 1977).           |

| 1978 - A low flying oval-shaped object with an estimated diameter of  |
| 3.5 meters hovered over a garage at around 6:00 a.m. for 15-20        |
| seconds in Saint-Laurent, France at a distance of 500 meters from the |
| witness and an altitude of 50 meters. (Source: Pierre Delval,         |

| 1981 - The complete failure of an aircraft's electronics, including   |
| the transponder, DME, navigation equipment, and two-way radios,       |
| occurred when a bullet-shaped UFO passed within 500 feet of an        |
| airplane being flown by Mr. Dennis, a flight instructor, while flying |
| over San Luis Reservoir, Merced County, California at 3:00 a.m. The   |
| electronics recovered after the UFO had gone. The object was          |
| described as 35-50 in length, with a pulsating orange front end, and  |
| having a blue ring perpendicular to the craft. The object was said to |
| be whirling, and made an instantaneous 90 degree turn. (Sources:      |

| 1993 - A cloud of dust was seen in the desert near Interstate 15 in   |

| 1994 - On an overcast dawn at 6:10 a.m. a saucer-shaped object rose   |
| from the ground of a farm in Melbourne, Florida, then temporarily     |
| hovered at 30-50 feet before flying off. It had twelve white lights   |
| and six red lights on it, which had the appearance of headlights,     |
| except that these soft lights did not cast beams. There was one red   |
| light between every white light. The object was five times larger     |
| than a car. Its distance from the two witnesses, a man and a woman in |
| their seventies, was estimated to be 1200 feet. the UFO made no       |
| sound. (Source: Melvin H. Tennis, MUFON field investigation database, |

| windows and big red lights crossed Route 20 in Quiet Dell, West       |

| 1996 - A 39-year-old man in Thomasville, North Carolina had a close   |
| encounter with a disc-shaped object on a partly cloudy night at 9:15  |
| p.m. The object had a bluish-green, cone-shaped beam projecting from  |
| it. The beam was narrow at the top, but had a three foot diameter at  |
| the bottom towards the ground, although it did not seem to be         |
| illuminating the ground. The bottom of the disc had an inner circle   |
| of many red lights. Inside were four rocket-like cones, giving off a  |
| red glow. The UFO came within 10 feet of the witness. The UFO made no |
| sound. (Source: Robert Hair, MUFON field investigation database, case |
| 970408E).                                                             |

| 1999 - A brilliant sphere some three meters in diameter flew over     |

| wobbled, then vanished. (Source: UFO Magazine (USA), July 2000, p.    |

| 2004 - There were multiple reports from Rochester, Indiana on this    |
| night to the National UFO Reporting Center. One report was of a very  |
| large disc-shaped object with six lights that went on and off in 20   |
| second intervals. The other report was of an independent sighting of  |
| yellowish orange lights in the southern sky. The object in question   |
| may have been around 200 feet in width. At about the same time, at    |
| 10:00 p.m. in Leiters Ford, Indiana another report came in of a UFO   |
| with yellowish beams of light. The beams were peculiar because the    |
| never seemed to touch the ground. (Source: Peter Davenport, National  |
