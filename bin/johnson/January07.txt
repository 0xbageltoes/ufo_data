| 1948 - A very large saucer-shaped object descended over the Clinton   |
| County, Ohio Air Force Base at 7:20 p.m. It was witnessed by several  |
| including the control tower staff, who viewed it through binoculars.  |
| It came so close to the ground that it may have landed. It then       |
| ascended and shot away to the southwest. (Source: Wilmington (OH)     |
| News Journal, January 8, 1948).                                       |

| 1952 - A dot appeared in the western sky over the Apple Valley        |
| Airport in San Bernardino County, California that grew to a golden    |
| shining disc, 100 feet in diameter. The UFO cavorted for several      |
| minutes, made 90 degree turns, and flew away at twice the speed of a  |
| jet. It also was completely silent. The witness was a 57-year-old man |
| named Mattern. (Source: Edward Sullivan, Civilian Saucer              |
| Intelligence--Los Angeles, letter from witness dated April 13, 1952). |

| 1958 - At 2:15 p.m. two human looking figures again appeared to Mrs.  |
| Appleton in Aston, Warwickshire, England and spoke to her in a        |
| mechanical form of English. Their message stated that "our images are |
| projections." Her first encounter occurred the previous November      |
| 18th, when a man appeared next to her fireplace while a whistling     |
| sound was audible. He was tall and fair, wore a tight fitting plastic |
| garment, and seemed to communicate with her through telepathy.        |

| 1966 - An 18-year-old high school student in Georgetown, Alabama was  |
| returning home from school when he observed a large silver ball about |
| 15-20 feet in diameter. The ball was only 15 feet from his car at its |
| closest approach. As it hovered near the car the engine died. The     |
| object was making a whining sound. It then moved behind the car and   |
| left. The car could then be restarted. The witness's watch also       |
| stopped working. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving       |
| Vehicle Interference, case 158, citing Schopick).                     |

| 1967 - At 5:45 p.m. a domed disc with lights on the dome appeared     |
| over St. Louis, Missouri. It hovered silently, then sped away. The    |
| entire sighting lasted ten minutes, according to the witness Mr.      |
| Siebel, who wrote and account of his sighting to the National         |
| Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (Sources: NICAP files,   |
| letter dated January 21, 1967; Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence,     |

| 1970 - At 3:45 in the afternoon two cross-country skiers, Aarno       |
| Heinonen and Esko Viljo, heard a buzzing sound and saw a round, ten   |
| foot wide metallic object with a flat bottom and a dome in the sky    |
| outside of Imjarvi, Finland. It was wrapped by a reddish-gray mist.   |
| The UFO descended to within ten feet of the snow-covered ground in a  |
| forest clearing and the buzzing sound ceased. It was described as     |
| being so close to Heinonen that he could have touched it with his ski |
| pole.                                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| The two men next saw a beam of light come from an opening in the      |
| bottom of the craft. It created an illuminated area three feet in     |
| diameter on the snow beneath it, edged with black. A red gray mist    |
| descended again, and when it cleared both men could see, only 10 feet |
| away, a three foot tall little man on the ground standing in the      |
| illuminated area. He had thin arms and legs, a pale waxy complexion   |
| with a hook nose, and wore a light green coverall uniform with darker |
| green knee boots, white gauntlets, and a conical metallic helmet.     |
|                                                                       |
| He held a small black box at his chest level with a pulsating yellow  |
| light from which a beam was emitted. Then the mist descended again,   |
| and long red, green and purple "sparks" floated out from the lighted  |
| area. A flame of sorts rose from this spot and the being entered the  |
| UFO. Then the mist vanished along with the UFO. After this            |
| experience, Heinonen found that his right leg was numb. He vomited    |
| and he passed urine that was black in color. Viljo also suffered      |
| severe physiological effects. Aarno Heinonen would go on to           |
| experience other close encounters, two years later, in a series of    |
| contacts with a fair skinned female being. (Sources: Sven-Olof        |

| 1971 - In Dennis, Massachusetts a metallic cylindrical object was     |
| seen descending over a frozen lake at 7:10 a.m. The leading edge of   |
| the object tipped forward, and a trail of flames issued from the      |
| rear. The investigating witnesses, two teenage boys, found an         |
| elongated hole in the ice and steam rising from the agitated water.   |
| The UFO made no sound. (Source: Walter N. Webb case investigation     |

| 1974 - Driving toward Warneton, Belgium along the French-Belgian      |
| border, the witness experienced the failure of the lights, engine,    |
| and radio of his car. He saw a landed object 150 meters away in a     |
| field to his right. The UFO was shaped like a World War I British     |
| helmet, was 7 to 10 meters wide, and stood on tripod landing gear. It |
| had patches of orange luminescence on top with a white light          |
| underneath. Two beings were seen coming from the direction of the     |
| object, walking slowly and stiffly toward the car. The shorter entity |
| wore an outfit with horizontal rings around the torso and a round     |
| helmet with a large, circular face plate showing a pear shaped,       |
| grayish head with no hair, round "marble like" eyes, a rudimentary    |
| nose, and a slit-like lipless mouth. He held an object like a short   |
| thick ruler with a pointed tip, aimed at the car. The taller entity   |
| wore a cubical helmet transparent in form, showing a face identical   |
| with the other's but with a small rectangular box under the chin. His |
| suit was a dull metallic gray one-piece coverall, including gloves    |
| and heavy, pointed boots. He wore a black belt with a luminous disc   |
| in front and a diagonal "Sam Browne" strap from belt to shoulder,     |
| with a vertical row of "buttons" on each side of the chest. Both      |
| beings had long arms. The interior of the helmets appeared to be      |
| illuminated. A third entity was seen standing guard near the object.  |
|                                                                       |
| The two beings approached to within four meters of the car and the    |
| taller was seen opening and closing his mouth. The witness felt a     |
| slight shock on the back of his head and heard, simultaneously, a low |
| pitched, modulated sound. The two suddenly wheeled around and walked  |
| quickly back to the object, which now pulsated an electric blue color |
| on top. The three beings boarded, the landing gear withdrew, and the  |
| object rose slightly, hovered, then ascended rapidly at a 60 degree   |
| angle. A car was then seen approaching, whose driver said he had seen |
| the object and its occupants. As the primary witness drove off, he    |
| continued to get poor reception on his car radio. The duration of the |
| close encounter was about 20 minutes. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1974-1, citing  |

| 1986 - At a trailer court in the mountain community of Butler,        |
| Pennsylvania at 10:54 p.m. a UFO emitted six "solid" light beams      |
| towards the ground. About 20 minutes later in Pittsburgh a            |
| silver-grayish disc-shaped UFO with body lights hovered in the sky,   |
| with a mist forming around it. The object tilted and then moved out   |
| of sight. (Source: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A    |
| Thirty-Year Report, p. 29).                                           |

| 1997 - Ryan Chapman and two other witnesses were staying in a cabin   |
| at an undisclosed location in Florida when they saw strange flashing  |
| lights in the sky late on this night. Feeling apprehensive the        |
| witnesses decided to make a perimeter check of the area. Suddenly one |
| of them screamed when he saw a large disc-shaped craft hovering over  |
| the cabin. One witness loaded his gun and began firing at the craft,  |
| but when nothing happened they ran back toward the cabin. Their way   |
| was blocked by several short thin gray-skinned humanoids that were    |
| carrying long needle-like implements. The creatures grabbed the three |
| men who attempted to escape but were somehow overpowered. Ryan felt a |
| pain in the back of his neck as he fell to the ground and blacked     |
| out. The next day, after coming to, they found strange marks on their |
| chins, wrists and behind their ears. A scorched area was reportedly   |
| found on the roof and walls of the cabin. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, |

| 1999 - At six o'clock in the morning Lindsey Knott of Crawley, West   |
| Sussex, England reported seeing bursts of lights in her room and then |
| finding herself onboard a round object with low continuous windows.   |
| She saw control panels located at the center of the craft that were   |
| manned by two metallic robot-like creatures and two dark-hooded       |
| beings. She also met the apparent leader, who she described as as     |
| human-looking and tall, with shoulder length blond hair, pale eyes,   |
| very pale skin, and wearing a dark blue jumpsuit. The night after the |
| incident she awoke to find her room very warm and cloying. The air    |
| appeared distorted and fuzzy, and she also saw more flashes of light. |
| She suffered from headaches and toothaches after the incident. She    |
| also felt hypervigilant. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact |
