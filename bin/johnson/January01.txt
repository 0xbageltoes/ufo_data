| 1953 - At 9:45 p.m. in Lewis and Clark County, northwest of Craig,    |
| Montana a disc with illuminated windows was seen over the Missouri    |
| River for ten seconds. It was estimated to be about 10 meters in      |

| bright object hovered in the sky over the northwest horizon of        |
| Calgary, Alberta for ten minutes. It too shot away at a high speed    |
| with fantastic acceleration. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer         |

| horizon, and shooting beams of light in several directions. (Sources: |

| 1961 - Mr. Pisani, a government topographer, had just passed a truck  |
| on the Andean Highway between La Victoria and El Vigia, Venezuela on  |
| a clear day when he witnessed a flying disc of polished blue steel    |

| minor injuries to the driver. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen, Flying     |

| 1964 - On this day in 1964 many residents of Shanghai, China saw a large     |
| cigar-shaped object flying over the city. Chinese Air Force MIG jet   |
| fighter aircraft were scrambled to intercept the unknown object, but  |
| were unable to catch up with it. The populace were told by officials  |
| that what they had seen was a U.S. missile. (Source: John W. Spencer, |

| 1966 - At 6:23 a.m. thirty sky watchers in Tokyo, Japan sighted a     |
| huge bow-shaped, dark brown UFO, its length ten times the apparent    |
| diameter of the Moon. It hung over the northern horizon for eight     |
| minutes. At 6:40 a.m. a second huge stick-like craft was seen that    |
| blew forth a mass of white clouds behind it. A bright flash of light  |
| was seen high in the sky that day in Aitape, Papua New Guinea. It was |
| visible for five minutes and left behind a smoke trail. (Sources: Y.  |

| 1970 - From the second floor of the Cowichan District Hospital on     |
| Vancouver Island, British Columbia five nurses saw a silver metallic  |
| Saturn-shaped UFO. It was about 50 feet in diameter and hovered close |
| by with a "necklace of lights" around the rim. At 5:00 a.m. they      |
| could clearly see two tall male figures inside the craft wearing      |
| tight-fitting dark coveralls. (Source: APRO Bulletin,                 |

| 1971 - At 6:30 a.m. a mini-bus driver near Newport, Monmouthshire,    |
| Wales saw an object in the sky above the road. The cigar-shaped       |
| object turned at an easy angle and traveled toward Newport. One of    |
| her passengers also saw it. (Source: Mrs. K. Smith, BUFORA Journal,   |

| 1971 - A one hundred foot diameter spherical UFO, bright as the Moon, |
| wobbled as it hung in the sky south of Alamogordo, New Mexico after 3 |
| a.m. It sent out bright orange objects that then landed on the side   |
| of the Sacramento Mountains. "It kicked the objects out...fast...and  |
| they flew right to the ground." (Source: Alamogordo Daily News,       |
| January 3, 1971).                                                     |

| 1971 - At 11:00 p.m. in Kosice, Slovakia a woman reported being taken |
| aboard a UFO together with her friend and her cat. They were all      |
| brought from her apartment through a window in a trance-like state    |
| and delivered into an otherworldly environment where everything       |
| appeared to be made out of ice. There she met three beautiful female  |
| humanoids who wore silvery spacesuits. The beings paralyzed them and  |
| loaded them onto a wagon-like sledge. The woman awoke the next day    |
| with pain all over her body and with no further recollection of the   |
| event. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1971,    |

| 1972 - At 4:30 a.m. a 25 meter long cigar-shaped object hovered over  |
| a power station in the town of Nedre Leirfoss in Sor-Trondelag,       |
| Norway. It made a rumbling sound, ejected flames, and shot away.      |

| 1973 - At 12:15 a.m. on a highway in the state of Los Lagos, Chile a  |
| married couple had their car engine stall the moment a UFO flew over  |
| their car. The disc-shaped UFO had a green light and a flashing red   |
| light. Their car engine came back on by itself after the UFO had      |
| gone. (Sources: newspaper clipping, January 3, 1973; FSR, May-June    |

| 1975 - Four soldiers at a military base saw a luminous yellow-white   |
| cone-shaped object descend at a high rate of speed at 6:25 a.m. and   |
| hover near their car in Quintanaortuno, Spain. The object went dark.  |
| Soon four more UFOs appeared, forming a row "emitting jets of white   |
| light downward." Traces were found and photographed at the site.      |

| 1977 - There were several UFO reports on this day from France and     |
| Portugal. A pink glowing sphere hovered in the sky for six minutes in |
| Creysseilles, France at 1:30 a.m., then flew away to the east toward  |
| the Mezayon Valley. At seven p.m. a luminous yellow-orange ovoid      |
| hovered in the sky for five minutes over Saint-Donat in Drome         |
| department, France. It drifted toward the southwest and was gone by   |
| eleven p.m. At 7:50 p.m. in Chabeiul, also in Drome, France a         |
| lenticular metallic disc with flames coming from the bottom made a    |
| 180-degree turn and flew off toward the south. The witness's eyes     |
| were sore from the glare of the light. At 8:00 p.m. Mr. and Mrs.      |
| Perez had a close encounter with a ten-meter long ovoid object in     |
| nearby Valence, France that chased their car. They also complained of |
| eye pain and conjunctivitis as a result of the encounter, and a watch |
| of theirs had stopped working. The UFO made a reappearance 40 minutes |
| later. At nine p.m. in Leca de Palmeira, Oporto Province, Portugal a  |
| TV crew filmed a UFO. It made a sound like an electric motor. At ten  |
| p.m. a luminous hemisphere-shaped object, about .65 meters in         |
| diameter, maneuvered and glowed among trees in Eyragues, France in    |
| Bouches-Rhone department. Broken branches were found later in the     |
| area. (Sources: Michel Figuet and Jean-Louis Ruchon, OVNI: Le premier |

| 1977 - Late on this night in New Canaan, Connecticut a young witness  |
| remembers being floated through his house downstairs against his      |
| will. Terrified, he saw a being shorter than him that floated beside  |
| him at the same time. He tried to grab the wall and banister but      |
| could not get a firm hold. His next memory was of being in the        |
| driveway being floated down the road surrounded by several            |
| gray-colored figures. He tried to get away but his legs just cycled   |
| aimlessly in mid-air. He had vague memories of being in a dark room   |
| with a metallic floor with some "people" that were involved in a      |
| project, which calmed him down and made him feel good. This was all   |
| he could remember. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact       |

| 1998 - At four o'clock in the morning a man in Huelo, Hawaii, who had |
| earlier that night seen some lights moving out the sky over some      |
| nearby fields, was awakened when he felt some type of "knock" in his  |
| head, perhaps some form of telepathic communication. He looked out    |
| his window to see a multicolored UFO emitting multicolored light      |
| beams in his direction. He woke up his friend and they both saw a     |
| figure standing in the bedroom. Terrified, they hid under the covers  |
| and when they looked again a few moments later the figure had         |
| vanished. The craft, however, was still outside outside but a little  |
| further off, and stayed visible until sunrise. The figure was         |
| described as tall, with a huge head and large staring eyes. (Source:  |

| 2001 - At shortly after midnight several motorists reported sighting  |
| five discs flying along the western shore of North Island, New        |
| Zealand near New Plymouth. One of the UFOs paced a car, hovering 100  |
| feet overhead of the vehicle, causing radio static. The UFO changed   |
| color from orange to violet as it flew. After several minutes the     |
| UFOs formed into a linear formation and flew off rapidly to the       |
| south. A silent orange object was videotaped over Deception Bay,      |
| Queensland, Australia that evening, moving from the southeast to the  |
| northwest. The video appears to show a dozen windows on the object.   |
