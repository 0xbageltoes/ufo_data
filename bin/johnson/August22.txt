| 1909 - The night after a similar sighting, a torpedo shaped object    |
| with searchlights was seen again at ten p.m. in Colebrook, Tasmania,  |
| Australia. (Source: Keith Roberts, Australasian Ufologist, January    |

| 1949 - In Alaska, a scientist on Tigvariak Island sighted six         |
| disc-shaped object flying in a circular formation, making a whining   |
| sound. A seventh disc then was seen weaving through the sky. They     |
| went from the northeast to the southwest. (Source: Loren E. Gross,    |

| 1953 - On this day a silver cigar-shaped object descended from the    |
| clouds over East Bolton, Quebec, Canada. It stopped near the ground,  |
| making an odd noise, then shot up vertically. (Source: Larry Hatch, U |
| computer database, case # 3116, citing APRO Bulletin, November 1953). |

| 1954 - In East Chicago, Indiana on this day two refinery workers      |
| sighted a crescent-shaped object that darted all over the sky above   |
| the oil refinery were they worked for two minutes. It flew at an      |
| estimated altitude of 2,500 feet and left going south. (Sources:      |

| 1955 - Casa Blanca, near Riverside, California. At two o'clock in the |
| afternoon some children were playing in the garden of Mr. and Mrs.    |
| Douglas when they observed a hovering object that disappeared and     |
| reappeared as a spinning disc with curved lines radiating from it.    |
| Other objects, silvery and semitransparent, soon appeared and were    |
| seen by all of the children. They made musical sounds as they         |
| vanished and reappeared. One of them landed, and a creature the size  |
| of a four-year-old child, transparent and wearing a belt with a       |
| bright disc on it, was seen nearby. Another creature appeared and     |
| spoke to one of the boys. All the children experienced visions of the |
| object and the creatures, as well as "arms" which appeared to beckon  |
| to them. (Sources: Flying Saucer Review, September-October 1967, p.   |

| 1955 - One of the most famous humanoid reports ever, came to          |
| a conclusion on this date at the Sutton farm in Kelly, near           |
| Hopkinsville, Kentucky. After the police had searched the Sutton farm |
| and found no creatures, they left and at two a.m. the little “men”    |
| returned, with at least one of them putting its “little clawed hands” |
| up on the window screen. Again they were fired at with rifles without |
| apparent effect. The last of the creatures was seen about half an     |
| hour before sunrise. No ground traces of the creatures' presence      |
| could be found anywhere during the search that occurred later that    |
| same day. (Sources: Isabel L. Davis & Ted Bloecher, Close Encounters  |

| 1956 - From the bedroom a witness in Turlock, California saw an       |
| orange-red ovoid UFO fluttering up behind the garage at 10:50 p.m. It |
| went away quickly. (Source: APRO Bulletin, September 1956).           |

| 1957 - Cecil Naval Air Station, Florida. At 3:40 p.m. a black,        |
| bell-shaped object bearing two bright, white lights at the top and    |
| maeasuring 15 meters in diameter was chased by a civilian named       |
| Sheetz in his car until the car engine stalled. The object then       |
| started hovering just three meters away. The underside of the machine |
| resembled a disc with fins. When a jet aircraft took off from the     |
| nearby U.S. Navy airfield, the object went out of sight almost        |
| instantaneously. The car battery was found to be completely           |
| dead.There was no helicopter in the area, although the two witnesses  |
| compared the noise made by the object to that of a helicopter.        |

| 1962 - In Kingsford Heights, Indiana at 8:30 p.m. two families        |
| watched a hat-shaped domed disc that made a whirring noise. The seven |
| witnesses viewed the UFO for almost an hour. (Sources: Orvil R.       |

| 1966 - On this night the crew of a USAF F-102 witnessed a silver,     |
| dragon-shaped UFO that hovered over Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. |

| 1966 - A landing with ground marks occurred shortly after 6:00 p.m.   |
| in Leiters Ford, Fulton County, Indiana and was witnessed by two      |
| families, including the Brockleys. (Source: Flying Saucers, September |
| 1972, p. 36).                                                         |

| 1966 - On this night in Malvern, Arkansas local residents reported    |
| seeing an eight-foot tall creature. The "thing" was humanoid in       |
| shaped, and changed color from red to orange to yellow. A witness     |
| named Mr. Niles reportedly snapped a picture of the "thing" from his  |
| window as it passed by his house. This humanoid encounter occurred    |
| six days after several UFOs had been seen in the area. (Sources:      |

| 1968 - At 5:40 p.m. two men, Smith and Gardin, were flying in a Piper |
| Navajo for Murchison Air 130 miles east of Kalgoorlie, Western        |
| Australia when they spotted a luminous white UFO. It emitted six      |
| smaller cigar-shaped "satellite objects." When the pilot Capt. Gordon |
| Smith reported their sighting to the Kalgourlie communication centre  |
| their radio stopped working, but it came back after the UFOs gathered |
| together, and shot off at high speed.(Sources: FSR, March 1979, p. 9; |

| 1969 - After Mrs. Joyce Vellacca and her husband reported seeing a    |
| multicolored UFO maneuvering over South Akron, Ohio she decided to    |
| lie down on the sofa for a short nap. She had scarcely stretched out  |
| when a big gust of wind swept through a window and blew the curtains  |
| out. Mrs. Vellacca got up to close the window and became frozen in    |
| place, literally unable to move. Furthermore, standing on the other   |
| side of the window was a woman staring back at her. The woman was     |
| well proportioned with beautiful long dark chestnut hair. But the     |
| woman had no discernible features where her face would be. Oddly,     |
| when Mrs. Vellacca recovered from her frozen immobility, the visitor  |
| had vanished. She rushed outside and turned on all the floodlights to |
| illuminate the area, but could see nothing unusual. Then there came a |
| high-pitched whine similar to that of a motorcycle, except that when  |
| a motorcycle reaches its highest velocity there is a loud roar, and   |
| none was heard. Instead, the noise gained in shrill frequency until   |
| it was no longer heard. The dogs in the neighborhood were raising a   |
| great rumpus. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database   |

| 1972 - On this day or the day before, at 4:30 a.m. Mrs. Doris Muthwa  |
| and her 12-year-old daughter were drawing water from a river in       |
| Roosboom, Natal, South Africa when she looked up and saw what first   |
| looked like a man in a white suit, who appeared to be was smoking a   |
| cigarette, but then the smoke became a big fire. "There was a bright  |
| light shining from his chest which went pink and blue," Mrs. Muthwa   |
| said. She estimated that the figure was more than 11 feet tall. She   |
| felt an electric shock in his presence, and added, "He must have been |
| emitting some kind of electricity, because it felt just like when I   |
| touch the [electric] iron and my body goes all jerky." Suddenly, the  |
| giant apparition shot into the sky and disappeared. The woman and her |
| daughter ran from the spot, spilling the water in their flight.       |

| 1974 - A young woman, Kimberle Lenz, and her brother were abducted    |
| while driving on a road near Boulder, Colorado at about 1:30 a.m. The |
| abduction experience lasted two hours, and involved missing time and  |
| physiological effects. R. Leo Sprinkle investigated the case and      |
| performed the hypnotic regression on the witnesses. Some kind of      |
| levitation force was used which pulled the witnesses in the car       |
| forward. Grey humanoid beings approached their stopped car from a     |
| field. They were made to touch a black box, which caused them to lose |
| consciousness. Under hypnosis it emerged that the beings communicated |
| with them using telepathy; they were curious about human emotions.    |
| When the abductees attempted to engage in resistance, they            |
| experienced pain. (Sources: R. Leo Sprinkle, APRO Bulletin, May 1981, |

| 1975 - At 11:30 p.m. two young men were making a bulk newspaper       |
| delivery between Boulogne and Lille by motorbike when they were       |
| followed briefly by an unknown "vehicle" in the vicinity of St. Omer, |
| Pas-de-Calais, France. A short distance further they saw a light in a |
| field a few hundred meters from the road. They stopped to look, and   |
| they could see an ovoid object on the ground, lit from within by a    |
| yellowish white light. It was approximately 3-4 meters long, and to   |
| its right were two human forms about two meters tall that stood side  |
| by side. The figures were completely illuminated by the light from    |
| the object, so none of their features could be made out. The figures  |
| began walking very quickly toward the young men. Frightened, they     |
| took off on the motorbike and continued their journey. Several        |
| kilometers further on they saw the object ascend into the sky at an   |
| angle. Perhaps because of their astonishment and fear, they were      |
| unable to locate the exact site of their experience when they went    |
| back with investigators later. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, |
| HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1975-40, citing Joel      |

| 1975 - At 11:45 p.m., while driving between Castronuno and Pollos in  |
| Valladolid province, Spain three men spotted a white transparent      |
| light that hovered over the road ahead of them. The car's engine      |
| died, but the headlights continued to work. When the ball of light,   |
| which was four meters in diameter, finally moved slowly off the road  |
| to the left, the engine could be restarted. (Source: Gordon           |

| 1978 - Ten years to the day after the Kalgoorlie, Western Australia   |
| aerial encounter of 1968 another nearly identical incident            |
| transpired, again over Western Australia. Flying from Adelaide to     |
| Perth a Murchison Air Services airliner encountered a large           |
| cigar-shaped object that flew ahead of the airliner. An opening       |
| appeared in the object, and smaller UFOs emerged and maneuvered       |
| around it, then reentered, and the UFO finally shot off at tremendous |
| speed. When the large object emitted the smaller satellite objects    |
| the aircraft's radio failed until the small objects had re-entered    |
| and the parent object had sped away. (Sources: Dominique Weinstein,   |

| 1978 - On this night at 9:30 p.m. three hunters near Coronel Dorrego, |
| Buenos Aires Province, Argentina heard strange noises, then smelled a |
| sulphur odor. They next saw a circular UFO with a black center and    |
| white edges, and giving off blue reflections, only 100 meters away    |
| from them. They jumped in their car to drive away, but suddenly found |
| themselves 50 meters away, with the car facing the other way. This    |
| suggests that they experienced a period of missing time lasting at    |
| least several minutes, but from the account no one appears to         |
| have investigated this further. (Source: Jane Thomas, UFO             |
| Newsclipping Service, October 1978, p. 14, translating a newspaper    |

|                                                                       |
| 1978 - On the same night as the hunters' close encounter experience   |
| in Argentina, several guests were having dinner outdoors at a resort  |
| on top of a cliff in Southampton, Bermuda. They saw what first        |
| appeared to them to be a helicopter approaching. When the UFO got     |
| closer it shone a blood red spotlight on the witnesses, and they now  |
| realized that what they were seeing was really a 30-foot in diameter  |
| disc-shaped object. The craft had brightly lit rectangular windows    |
| around its perimeter. The main witness and several of the other       |
| guests could now see several Grey figures that appeared to be waving  |
| at them; one of the beings stared directly at one of the witnesses.   |
| After about a minute the silent craft flew out over the ocean and     |
| disappeared. At this point, several military jets appeared and        |
| appeared to give pursuit to the object. Later that night, at          |
| around 5:00 a.m., the wife of the main witness woke up and was        |
| startled to see a short figure standing in their room. The figure     |
| raised one hand, waved, then lept right out the balcony window, a     |
| distance of about 10 feet, never touching the rail. (Source: Albert   |

| 1980 - In eastern Texas a UFO abduction occurred when a car was       |
| levitated inside of a hovering circular craft. Meagan Elliott was     |
| driving at 12:40 a.m. with her young daughter Renee in the early      |
| morning hours, on a desolate road near Lake Fork Reservoir, Wood      |
| County, Texas when her car radio became garbled and she heard a loud  |
| electrical noise, then her car headlights dimmed. The vehicle was     |
| suddenly lifted off the road, and they found themselves in a bright   |
| circular room, still inside the car, which sat on the flat metallic   |
| bottom of the hovering craft. A voice in her head told her to get out |
| of the car, but she refused to move. Next, a small putty colored      |
| humanoid being with a large bard heald, his feet encased in           |
| mist, appeared and forced open the car door. He then forced Meagan    |
| and Renee to follow him. He was described as having huge oval eyes,   |
| no body hair, a broad flat nose, and a small slit for a mouth. Both   |
| of them were then clamped down on metallic tables, and their bodies   |
| were probed by two humanoids using different types of tools and a     |
| scanning device. Before being returned to the car and lowered to the  |
| ground, they said they were fed various colored pills. Under          |
| hypnosis, Meagan recalled extensive communication with the beings.    |
| They made the disturbing statement that the Earth "was a fearful      |
| planet with a tendency for annihilation." She also recalled being     |
| shown seven characters, which represented the name of the place they  |
| came from, it sounded like "Asterisk", but she said she could not     |
| pronounce it correctly. (Sources: Richard Hall, Uninvited Guests, p.  |

| 1988 - At around one o'clock in the morning an abduction experience   |
| occurred at a campsite near Athens, Maine. Two people were tent       |
| camping when a disc-shaped object landed nearby and emitted a white   |
| light. Next, a red ball exited the object and seemed to scout around  |
| their campsite. After that, a "veil of lights" entered their tent,    |
| and they experienced 45 minutes of missing time. Reportedly the event |
| has caused a profound change in their philosophy of life. (Sources:   |

| 1999 - At 4:30 a.m. an 87-year-old woman saw a large, delta-shaped    |
| object buzz over her home in Lake Charles, Louisiana. A blue beam     |
| came down, illuminated her yard. She then experienced a three minute  |
| period of missing time. (Source: George A. Filer, Filer's Files,      |

| 1999 - On this afternoon Michelle and a friend were hiking on a       |
| remote trail called the Ice Age Trail near Lodi, Wisconsin when she   |
| became separated from her friend and went ahead. In a short while she |
| saw a flash of motion ahead, perhaps some 50 feet away. It was a      |
| blue-gray figure moving along the trail toward her. His first         |
| impression was that it was someone dressed in a blue jacket, but      |
| abruptly the blue figure glided off the trail to her right,           |
| disappearing behind some trees. It did not seemed to be walking,      |
| but displayed a smooth gliding motion. Before it glided away the blue |
| figure seemed to change directions. As it turned she noticed a long   |
| blue plume of something, waving from behind its head. Startled, she   |
| turned to her companion who had come up behind her, and told him what |
| she had seen. They both walked ahead to investigate the point on the  |
| path where it had vanished into the bushes, but found nothing         |
| unusual. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1999 Humanoid Sighting Reports   |

| 2004 - Driving home at 1:00 p.m. from her birthday party in Woodbury, |
| Connecticut a teenager with her mother saw a disc-shaped object with  |
| a slight dome on top hovering at a very high altitude; the sun        |
| gleamed off its metallic surface. Because her mother responded        |
| sarcastically to her statement that she had sighted a UFO, she turned |
| to argue, and when she looked back it was gone. (Sources: George A.   |
