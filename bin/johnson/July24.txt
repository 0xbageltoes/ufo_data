| coast, zigzagged, rose and fell, then shot away to the north.         |

| low frequency buzzing sound. Two men came into her bedroom, carried   |
| her outside, and loaded her into a waiting, large "military type"     |
| truck. The witness felt semi-conscious and groggy during the truck    |
| ride. The truck drove into an underground chamber located in the side |
| of a large hill, through a door that opened upwards. The interior was |
| dimly lit. A three-foot-tall Grey humanoid with slanted eyes, who     |
| wore a black hooded cape, met her there. The being had a greenish     |
| gray complexion and seemed to hover just above the floor, sometimes   |
| poking her with an unseen instrument. She sensed hostility from the   |
| being, which kept circling her in an attempt to force her to lie down |
| on a nearby metal table. The witness resisted and blacked out. She    |
| later she found herself back on her bed. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,  |
