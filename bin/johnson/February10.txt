| 1951 - A giant, bright orange-red disc was observed by the pilot of a |
| four-engine, U.S. Navy R-5D transport flying 90 miles from Gander,    |
| Labrador, Canada. The UFO maneuvered nearer to the plane, which was   |
| flying at 10,000 feet altitude at the time. The UFO sighting was      |
| dubbed the "Gander UFO case." (Sources: John R. Colombo, UFOs over    |

| 1955 - In Altamira, Venezuela at 9:30 p.m. a teenage couple saw a     |
| huge disc-shaped UFO fly from horizon to horizon. It had two pulsing  |
| blue lights on the bottom, and was in view for more than six minutes. |

| 1967 - Several people in Haliburton, Ontario witnessed a large        |
| yellow, glowing object fly over at treetop level at 2:30 a.m. It made |
| a loud roaring noise. At 3:42 a.m. an eight-meter wide blue disc was  |
| seen hovering very low over the NASA/AEC nuclear facility at the Plum |
| Brook Naval Air Station in Erie County, Ohio. It was seen by a male   |
| witness as it was about 1.5 miles away from his car. The disc moved   |
| toward the ground and heavy static came over the car radio as he      |
| tried to contact his headquarters at the Air Station. (Sources:       |

| 1967 - At 5:30 that same evening a dark, triangular shaped UFO flew   |
| blunt-end forward over North Woodstock, Connecticut and hovered over  |
| a farm. The object had a white light in each corner, and was quiet    |
| when hovering, but made a roaring sound when it moved off. Television |
| interference was also reported during the sighting. At the same time  |
| in nearby Worcester, Massachusetts a UFO with three bright lights     |
| hovered over a house. The refrigerator contents reportedly froze, and |
| the color TV set in the house had the color fade out of the picture   |
| during the encounter. After five minutes the UFO flew south, stopped  |
| briefly, and then sped away. Ninety minutes later two UFOs were seen  |
| circling low over a house in Mahopec, Putnam County, New York. Six    |
| human-appearing occupants were seen on board the craft, and one of    |
| them appeared to wave at the two witnesses, who drove their car       |
| following the UFO. Reportedly one of the witnesses received a         |
| telepathic message from the occupants. (Sources: The Hartford         |

| 1969 - An abduction occurred in the early morning hours of this day   |
| in Green Cove Springs, Florida. At around three a.m. two single       |
| adults, a man and a woman, "Francis" and "Wells", were driving by     |
| automobile along a highway when they had three unaccounted hours of   |
| missing time. Under hypnosis in 1977 they recalled being in a curved  |
| hallway, and seeing four short, Grey aliens who had large eyes and    |
| ears, no hair, small slit mouths, and wore tight coveralls. The       |
| aftereffects of their encounter included headaches, depression, and   |
| skin rashes. (Source: Paul Krutz, Fate, and HUMCAT: Catalogue of      |

| 1969 - Later that same night in Dartmouth, Massachusetts at 10:30     |
| p.m. a truck driver saw a fiery ball hovering over some snow covered  |
| trees. When he approached to within 200 feet with a flashlight it     |
| accelerated away at a 45-degree angle, causing the snow on the        |
| treetops to swirl through the air. (Source: Ray Fowler, UFOs:         |

| 1972 - At shortly after seven o'clock in the evening a dome-shaped    |
| UFO flew from north to south over Fort Duchesne, Utah and was seen by |
| three women hovering over a field for ten minutes. It then shot away  |
| to the north. (Source: Frank Salisbury, The Utah UFO Display, case    |

| 1975 - Later that evening at 6:00 p.m. a man in Poulderat, France     |
| Messr. J. Raphalan saw a red luminous rectangular object hovering     |
| over his farm. It shrank to a band of light, and then disappeared. At |
| 8:20 p.m. Messr. M. Fraisse, age 33, witnessed a dark,                |
| helicopter-shaped object hover silently over a field for ten minutes  |
| in Carces, France. It emitted beams of light, an caused TV            |
| interference at the time. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, March 1975  |

| 1975 - At 7:00 p.m. in Annandale, New York two 15-year-old teenagers  |
| saw a low-level, 20-meter diameter disc for ten minutes, then watched |
| it shrink away to nothing. At the site there were snapped tree        |
| branches and scorched earth. (Sources: CUFOS files, report dated      |

| 1976 - In Hamden, Connecticut on Denslow Hill two 14-year-old         |
| teenagers, Grey and Barnet, saw two very short humanoid beings        |
| shuffle rapidly across a road. They wore purple-colored luminous      |
| one-piece suits and their waists were 20-22 inches above the ground.  |
| When the boys followed them a bright white, lemon-shaped UFO blinked  |
| on, and took off into the air only 15 feet away from them. (Source:   |

| 1977 - From a window in her house Ms. Lois Stovall of Tucson, Arizona |
| saw a luminous object in the sky approach her house from the north.   |
| She and her grandmother, Mrs. Alice Buckner, went our to the yard at  |
| 7:30 p.m. for a better view and saw it hovering over a small tree     |
| less than 50 feet away. It was capsule shaped with a cylindrical      |
| vertical axis, and transparent on the side facing them with dark      |
| vertical bars. Through the transparent surface they could see a       |
| flame-like light and a human-shaped figure, gray all over gray, that  |
| looked puffed up like a balloon. It had ridges or rings running round |
| the appendages, like the Michelin Man. She could not see any hands or |
| feet. This figure in an inflated suit was about four feet tall and    |
| was standing crouched over in a space only barely big enough for him. |
| The light was coming from between his feet. Mrs. Buckner walked       |
| directly beneath the object and tried to touch it but it was hovering |
| two feet too high. She could see there was a faceplate in the being's |
| suit, and she could barely make out some sort of face behind it. The  |
| object began to ascend, and soon passed out of sight to the south.    |
| Ms. Stovall saw three helicopters with glowing red cabin lights       |
| flying very low over the adjacent school grounds. The investigators   |
| were unable to find any plausible source for these mystery aircraft.  |
| Mrs. Dessie Turner, a neighbor, also saw the object while it hovered, |
| and estimated that it was 6.5 feet high and 2.5 feet in diameter. She |
| thought she could see a shadowy figure inside. She also saw the       |
| helicopters. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:          |

| 1981 - The witness had parked her car in her apartment parking lot   |
| in Auburn, Washington at 11:35 p.m. when she saw a huge lighted       |
| object with a ring of flashing lights. The UFO left but a second      |
| smaller craft appeared and descended with a falling leaf motion. The  |
| witness ran to her apartment and apparently blacked out. Under        |
| hypnosis she recalled that a light shone on her and she suddenly      |
| found herself in a domed room with smooth white floors, walls and     |
| ceiling. The room contained a desk-like object with lights and an     |
| examination table. She undressed and two beings entered, held her by  |
| her arms and pressed her down on the table. A third being examined    |
| her abdomen. The beings were humanoid with light bulb shaped heads    |
| and with large unblinking eyes, small noses and ears, and slit-like   |
| mouths. They were thin with sloping shoulders, long hanging arms with |
| 4 long fingers and had grayish skin. They wore metallic blue coverall |
| uniforms with an insignia of a triangle inside a circle on the chest. |
| Another being wore a reddish orange colored uniform. They conversed   |
| with the witness by using telepathy. (Source: Thomas E Bullard, UFO   |

| 1982 - At shortly after midnight a UFO with an intense, lime green    |
| light hovered just six feet above the snow-covered ground in          |
| Willernie, Minnesota. Five spots of fire fell to the ground as the    |
| object rose, and melted holes in the snow. (Source: Joe Twohy,        |

| 1982 - On this day in the Black Sea six Soviet sailors discover and   |
| investigate a "disabled ship" in the fog. They are missing for five   |
| days. When they are returned they report that they had been pulled up |
| into a cigar-shaped UFO, and the beings onboard the UFO communicated  |
| with them by gestures. One of the men reportedly went insane, dove    |
| overboard, and was drowned. (Sources: Thomas E. Bullard, UFO          |

| 1982 - On the same day as the alleged disappearance of the Soviet     |
| sailors a close encounter occurred in Escanaba, Wisconsin. At 11:35   |
| p.m. on Highway C537 three seventeen-year-old young women were        |
| driving in a car near a river when they encountered a low flying      |
| domed disc. The mist from the rear of the object looked like "lit up  |
| snowflakes." The rim around the bottom of the UFO had red windows all |
| the way around it, and a red light shone through the windows. Their   |
| sighting lasted seven minutes. (Source: Kenneth Schellhase,           |

| 1989 - In Fyffe, Alabama a lighted triangular-shaped object with      |
| rounded corners flew around in the sky and was watched for more than  |
| an hour by four witnesses, including police. It flew over the police  |
| cruiser at an estimated distance of 1,500 meters at a steady speed,   |
| and made no sound. There were other sightings in surrounding          |
| communities, including De Kalb City, Dawson, Dog Town, and Lick       |
| Skillet. (Source: Rheta Grimsley Johnson, Commercial Appeal, March    |

| 1995 - Evan Canoose and two of his friends had been camping in the    |
| area of Larch Mountain Honor Camp near Vancouver, Washington. At 6:30 |
| a.m. Mr. Canoose was alone when he saw a strange creature about 30-40 |
| feet away. It had an peculiar "out of focus" quality. He said that he |
| and the creature stared at each other for 45 seconds. He described    |
| the creature as built like an orangutan, with a reddish-orange color, |
| a wide chest and waist, and a black, flat face with black chest       |
| markings. It occasionally moved its right arm and hand back and       |
| forth. The witness heard no noises nor detected any odors during the  |
| encounter. Evan estimated the creature's height at six feet four      |
| inches tall, based on where it stood next to a tree. Feeling uneasy,  |
| Canoose went to his car and did not see the "blurry" creature leave.  |
| He did not tell his companions about his encounter until their trip   |
| home. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1995,     |

| 1996 - The witness woke up at two a.m. in Huon Valley, Tasmania,      |
| Australia to find her bedroom lit up, and she had an overwhelming     |
| feeling to go outside. From the verandah she saw the source of light  |
| to be a bright long elliptical shape about 50cm away in the paddock.  |
| There was a brilliant bluish white light and a metallic smell you     |
| could almost taste. Standing in the garden was a tall thin figure     |
| over two meters tall. The figure beckoned the witness with its left   |
| hand. She walked down the verandah steps then suddenly became alarmed |
| and returned back home. She threw some furniture outside, and then    |
| everything went dark. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |

| 1996 - The witness was at an Italian restaurant in Alice Springs,     |
| Northern Territory, Australia when she noticed a short Grey,          |
| troll-like entity walk up to the restaurant, climb up the steps,      |
| stand still and stare briefly at the witness before disappearing      |
| around the corner. Others in the city reported seeing objects over    |
| the area and possibly other entity sightings. (Source: Albert S.      |
