| 1943 – In the late afternoon in Chauny, France many people witnessed  |
| several small brilliant metallic objects fly silently from the north  |
| to the south in groups of three. The UFOs moved faster than balloons, |
| and the procession lasted for a period of two and a half hours.       |

| 1951 – A group of three delta-shaped objects with wingspans of 15’    |
| flew over US Highway 81 south of Forth Worth, Texas at 10:45 p.m. One |
| passed overhead at a low altitude, and made a faint humming sound.    |

| 1956 – At nine o’clock in the morning on Robertson Island, Antarctica |
| a photograph was taken by the Chilean Antarctic Expedition of two     |
| cigar-shaped objects, hanging in a vertical position in the sky for   |
| 64 minutes. The objects were estimated to be 150 meters in length,    |
| and their presence was reportedly confirmed by radar. They shot away  |
| at an estimated speed of 40,000 kilometers per hour. (Source: Gordon  |

| 1959 – Shortly after nine a.m. on a clear day two MEc employee in     |
| Hobart, Tasmania saw a 2.7-meter long object disappear between        |

| Derwent. (Source: J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies case files,   |

| 1969 – A humanoid was spotted making repairs on a hovering            |
| disc-shaped craft for twenty minutes at ten p.m. in Edina, Missouri.  |
| He looked surprised when he saw the witness. (Source: Larry Hatch, U  |

| 1971 – At 3:00 a.m. in Dumfries, Scotland a Mrs. Bunn sighted a       |

| sky. (Source: newspaper clipping dated January 9, 1971).              |

| 1971 – At noon at Tafi Viejo, Argentina in the State of Tucuman two   |
| men in their thirties sighted a 3-meter in diameter Saturn-shaped     |
| saucer with two antennae. The UFO landed 30 meters away from them in  |
| a field of maize. It made a whistling sound as it took off and sped   |
| away. A tree in the vicinity subsequently died. (Source: Phenomenes   |

| 1973 – In Ellenboro, North Carolina a teenager named Gowen noticed    |
| his radio making a strange static noise. He looked outside and saw a  |
| one-foot wide box in his yard moving very slowly at a few feet above  |
| the ground. The snow on the ground in the area beneath the UFO had    |
| melted, and a greenish gunk was found on the ground. (Source: George  |

| 1974 - After leaving his job in Springfield, Ohio Mr. Justice, age    |
| 50, experienced the failure of his car lights and engine at 3:13 a.m. |
| He then saw multicolored blinking lights descend just meters in front |
| of his car, followed by the appearance of a blinding white oval of    |
| light approximately six feet in diameter, apparently showing the      |
| interior of a UFO. He could see five small occupants within, seated   |
| on high backed chairs and wearing bright colored robes. Each had very |
| long brown hair that reached almost to the floor. They appeared to be |
| three to four feet tall, but the witness could not recall their       |
| facial features. The UFO brightly illuminated the surrounding terrain |
| and his car's interior. After five minutes the interior light went    |
| out and the UFO ascended rapidly with another display of              |
| multicolored, flashing lights. A maintenance man on the workplace     |
| premises had noticed a failure of his "pager" radio four times        |
| between seven and eight o'clock earlier that evening although no UFOs |
| were seen. (Sources: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:          |

| 1974 – At 7:40 a.m. three men driving on a highway south of           |
| Enterprise, California saw a steady white light come down vertically  |
| from the sky. They said that it appeared to land some place near the  |
| Pacheco School in Shasta County. (Source: Redding Record Searchlight, |

| 1974 - On this afternoon In Zafferana, Italy a woman was working      |
| alone in a small room of her house when she felt a strong rush of     |
| wind. She turned around and was confronted by a very bright light,    |
| within the light she was able to see a tall man wearing a             |
| tight-fitting coverall outfit with gold colored boots. He had short   |
| light hair, light skin and large almond-shaped eyes. The witness was  |
| not frightened and said she felt a sudden sense of joy and peace. The |
| man smiled and suddenly vanished in a flash of light.

| Perhaps a coincidence, but on this date in both of the years 1974 and |
| 1975 a cattle mutilation report and a humanoid report occurred within |
| the same 24-hour period.                                              |

| 1975 – A cattle mutilation was reported to have occurred on this day  |
| in rural Texas. At 11:30 p.m. near a power station in Brookby, New    |
| Zealand a man and a woman saw an occupant inside a small domed        |
| disc-shaped UFO. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies case |

| 1979 – At three o’clock in the morning in Tunis, Tunisia a group of   |
| people witnessed a small disc, about 1.5 meters in size, hovering     |
| near a lake for 10 minutes. It then shot away and was gone in a split |
| second. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, February 1979)               |

| 1979 – At 5:30 p.m. in San Croce Sull’Arno in the Tuscany region of   |
| Italy a 40-meter wide domed disc with an antenna flew over a farm at  |
| only ten meters above the ground. The farm animals were panicked and  |
| a tree bent over as the object passed. (Source: Maurizio Verga,       |

| 1979 – In Rome City, Indiana at eight o’clock in the evening two      |
| people sighted a 15-foot long cylinder at a low altitude near a       |
| school. The UFO had an intense light, and shot away at a high speed   |
| after five minutes. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, December 1979).       |

| 1981 – Perhaps the best documented and most thoroughly investigated   |
| case of physical effects from a UFO occurred on this day in           |
| Trans-en-Provence, France. At five p.m. Mr. Nicolai, a gardener, saw  |
| a metallic disc-shaped object making a whistling sound land hard in a |
| garden. It was estimated to be eight feet by six feet in size, and    |
| had four openings on the underside. It also had a thick band around   |
| the middle section of the object. The case quickly came to the        |
| attention of the police and was soon investigated by GEPAN, the       |
| French government’s scientific team of UFO investigators. The         |
| physical traces included evidence of vegetation and soil heating,     |
| skid marks, and circular ground marks. The chemical analysis revealed |
| that the soil had been heated to temperatures not in excess of 600    |
| degrees Celsius. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Confrontations: A           |

| 1981 – At 11:00 p.m. on a boat near Flinders Island, Tasmania two men |
| saw two nocturnal lights exchange light beams. The sea was            |
| illuminated by the UFO display, and the batteries on board the boat   |
| were found to be dead. (Source: UFO Research Australia Newsletter,    |

| 1984 – At 3:00 a.m. EST in the witness’s bedroom in Framingham,       |
| Massachusetts a short humanoid pointed a beam at the witness in bed.  |
| The witness felt that the being could telepathically read her mind.   |

| straight up into the sky outside. (Source: MUFON UFO Journal, August  |

| three people driving in a van outside Cozad, Nebraska saw a 100-foot  |
| diameter disc hover 80 feet over the highway. It was blazingly        |

| rim. They heard an intermittent beeping on the van's CB radio.        |
