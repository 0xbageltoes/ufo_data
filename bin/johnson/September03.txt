| 1954 - At 1:00 p.m. many workers in the fields 12 kilometers south of |
| the town of Souk-el-Khemis, Tunisia saw an object apparently made of  |
| transparent plastic fly over the houses, stop on its edge, and swing  |
| like a pendulum just a few meters above the ground. It made several   |
| erratic jumps, then resumed its horizontal position and flew away.    |

| 1956 - At 10:00 p.m. many people on the beach in Higuerote, Venezuela |
| watched several silent disc-shaped objects with square windows on the |
| rim; one hovered over the sea, while another one landed on the        |
| surface of the ocean. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case |

| color varied from white to red. It shot up into the sky, and it left  |
| marks on the roof. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A   |

| 1965 - At midnight all the lights at Pease Air Force Base, New        |
| Hampshire went off for 30-40 seconds while an unknown, elongated      |
| flying object flew over. It had blinding headlights with other lights |
| perhaps in the rear, and flew at an altitude of only 300-400 feet. It |
| passed directly over the guard shack at the main gate. There were     |
| three military guards on duty, including the main witness, Robert     |
| Mark. (Source: UNICAT, case # 618, citing Lawrence Fawcett & Barry    |

| 1965 - At 1:30 a.m. Mr. D. Winters, a school teacher, was driving in  |
| Ipswich, Massachusetts when he saw a yellow UFO hovering over the     |
| golf course. It looked like an inverted saucer with white lights      |
| around the rim. The sighting nearly caused him to drive off the road  |
| for a moment.The hairs on the back of his neck rose during the        |
| encounter. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler, UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors, |

| 1965 - At 2:00 a.m. several independent witnesses as well as two      |
| police officers watched a dark object with a row of flashing red      |
| lights as it wobbled and descended in a falling leaf motion over      |
| Exeter, New Hampshire. Dogs howled and horses reacted by kicking and  |
| neighing during its presence. (Sources: Raymond E. Fowler case files, |

| 1965 - At 11:00 p.m. a football-field sized purple oval or            |
| cigar-shaped object, 40 feet high, approached a stopped sheriff's     |
| patrol car in Damon, Texas. The two sheriff officers in the car,      |
| McCoy and Goode, saw the huge illuminated object speed toward their   |
| patrol car, hover, and illuminate them and the surrounding terrain in |
| a purple light. They reported that there were bright lights on either |
| end of the object: a weak blue light was seen on the extreme right of |
| the object, which came out in two steps, and a purple light on the    |
| left, which lit the ground and bathed the car's interior.The UFO      |
| hovered within 30 meters of them, casting a huge shadow when it       |
| intercepted the moonlight . They felt a sensation of heat, and drove  |
| away in fear. Later they returned to investigate and had another      |
| close encounter. One of the officers reported that a skin lession he  |
| had healed rapidly after their UFO close encounter.Goode had been     |
| bitten by an animal before the sighting, and his left index finger    |
| swelled and bled freely. After exposure to the light from the object  |
| the pain was gone, and the wound cured unnaturally quickly. Later     |
| that evening, two men found him at a restaurant and described the     |
| object in detail, adding he should keep future encounters to himself. |

| 1965 - On this night Mrs. M. Gorzelle, age 45, had remembered going   |
| to bed, but suddenly found herself awake and driving on a rural       |
| asphalt road near Des Plaines, Illinois. Then she came to a spot      |
| where a man was standing on the road, waving a lantern. She stopped,  |
| believing there had been an accident, and got out. The man was tall,  |
| normal in appearance except for a very high forehead, and was dressed |
| in a white coverall with a metal buckle at the waist. She was led     |
| across the grass to an area that was suddenly brightly illuminated    |
| from a door opening in a craft, which she described as a large round  |
| mass sitting on legs, about 100 feet from the road. There were three  |
| more cars stopped along the road, and the occupants of these vehicles |
| were also being escorted into the craft. Their abductors were all     |
| over 6 feet tall, with very high foreheads, and bald. Inside the      |
| vessel were two “normal appearing” men, also in white coveralls, one  |
| with white hair. He was the only one who spoke during the experience, |
| and he did so in a language unknown to the witness. The other “human” |
| looked Italian, and was younger. The four tall occupants each         |
| appeared to be in charge of the four abductees and were identical in  |
| appearance. The room was filled with electronic equipment and control |
| knobs, and telepathically she was told she would not recall the       |
| incident. The next thing she remembered was being led outside again   |
| by her “host,” and being helped into her car. The other three men     |
| were likewise being assisted to their cars. Mrs Gorzelle made a       |
| U-turn, and drove straight home, where she went directly to bed.      |
| Self-hypnosis indicated that a medical examination had been           |
| conducted, and that this was actually her second abduction            |
| experience. (Sources: David F. Webb, Proceedings of the CUFOS         |

| 1966 - Two young teenage witnesses went outside when their TV set     |
| became blurred near Kelly AFB, Texas. They observed a fantastic       |
| spinning light illuminating the house. It came from an object         |
| hovering at the same location as a sighting earlier that month.       |

| 1967 - On this evening in Caracas, Venezuela Miss Paula Valdez, a     |
| young actress, came home from work with a headache. Lying down on     |
| bed, she soon became aware that someone else was nearby and she heard |
| a whistling sound. A small being with a large head and prominent eyes |
| (a Grey humanoid) was leaning over her bed. He said to her, "I want   |
| you to come with us, so that you'll know other worlds…". She screamed |
| and the being ran from room. Her family came into the room to find    |
| out why she had screamed. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen, Encounters     |

| 1967 - At 11:05 p.m. in Avon, Connecticut a motorist saw a            |
| "robot-like" being walking at the side of the road. The being wore a  |
| one-piece silvery garment that covered its hands and feet, and was    |
| wearing an opaque helmet. It moved its arms stiffly, as if trying to  |
| stop cars. (Source: Hartford Courant, September 5, 1967; ).           |

| 1973 - Many people witnessed the landing of a four meter long         |
| vertical cylinder that came down in the town of Feignies, Nord,       |
| France. The air surrounding the object was reportedly ionized.        |

| 1973 - At 4:30 a.m. Mr. & Mrs. Yothers in Whitney, Westmoreland       |

| 1973 - A motorist driving home in Athens, Georgia first experienced   |
| radio interference and then encountered an egg-shaped object that     |
| descended onto the road ahead of the car. Two small beings emerged.   |
| (Source: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II:  A Thirty-Year |

|                                                                       |
| 1974 - Late in August, while driving on her early morning paper route |
| in Duxbury, Massachusetts, the witness observed a red pulsating       |
| object at treetop level. When two beams of light emerged from its     |
| base to play across a nearby cranberry bog, her car engine            |
| "fluttered" and the car radio emitted static. The car interior became |
| extremely hot and she felt nauseated. On this pre-dawn morning while  |
| driving the same route as her previous sighting, the witness heard a  |
| voice "inside her head" telling her to turn left at the next          |
| intersection, which she did. Then her car radio went out and the car  |
| motor died. She next saw four short humanoid figures, each standing   |
| upon a "small surface vehicle" resembling a Roto Tiller, darting up   |
| and down the road a few inches above the road surface. One figure     |
| approached her and asked her, telepathically, to open the car door.   |
| When she did not, all four doors flew open at once. The humanoids,    |
| after inspecting the interior of the craft, requested that she make   |
| certain arm movements, then to bend her head forward. Looking at the  |
| back of her head, one being said, "Yes, you are different," and       |
| touched the spot with something that left five small puncture marks.  |
| He then told her telepathically that there were thousands of ships    |
| that have been visiting Earth for many years, and many people who     |
| have been examined by the aliens, voluntarily or otherwise. He told   |
| her they come from a planet whose name resembled "Omius" or           |
| "Omnigus"; and that there was a "mother ship" at that time in         |
| Scituate Harbor. In reply to her own questions, the examiner said     |
| that she was not permitted to touch them or to board one of their     |
| ships, but he promised that she would see a ship subsequently. She    |
| was advised that she would suffer headaches for some weeks, which     |
| proved to be true; he also said that she would "not like to look upon |
| their faces." The humanoids departed and she arrived home an hour and |
| a half later than usual. The figures were 4-5 feet tall, with small   |
| heads in transparent fishbowl helmets, through which she was only     |
| able to see "small, beady, very shiny eyes." The spokesman had two    |
| stripes on the upper part of his arm, while the other three had       |
| stripes that were longer on their sides, just above their waists. The |
| leader had a buckle on his belt upon which was a wavy line. She was   |
| extremely upset by this encounter, and told only her husband, who     |
| gave details to the investigator. On the night following this         |
| encounter, the witness again experienced E-M effects on her car as a  |
| large, disc-shaped object with multi-colored lights descended and     |
| extended three landing legs from the bottom. The craft passed barely  |
| inches from the windshield of her car, and she was able to see an     |
| insignia on the UFO that resembled "mathematical symbols." After      |
| hovering briefly, the object shot straight up and vanished. The       |
| witness refused to cooperate in any further investigation. (Sources:  |

|                                                                       |
| 1976 - The witness heard a very high-pitched whine in the early       |
| morning in Bethel, Alaska, and looked out onto the tundra where a     |
| small (3 inches in diameter) white "beach ball" seemed to be moving   |
| in the air, close to the ground. After a while it tilted so that she  |
| could see that it was a disc with a rotating, shiny, platinum-colored |
| area in the middle. The object arced upwards, then back down, and     |
| seemed to just disappear into the ground. As soon as it entered the   |
| ground, all sounds stopped. On inspection, she found no ground marks  |
| or evidence where it had disappeared. Following this incident by      |
| about a month, the same witness and a little dog were on her porch    |
| facing the area of the sighting. She went inside for a couple of      |
| minutes and the dog wandered off. She immediately began to search for |
| her dog, following its tracks in the fresh snow, but she couldn’t     |
| find her. “It was snowing. And her little tracks went out there and   |
| she just disappeared? She weighed maybe five pounds max, so possibly  |
| some owl or something could have gotten her, but there wasn’t,,,any   |
| other disturbance in the snow.” Since these events the witness feels  |
| that she has had a few very unusual light-projecting experiences,     |
| which have resulted in vivid dreams or out of body experiences. The   |
| contents of her experiences are difficult to describe. She has the    |
| feeling of movement, and there are these enormously huge, very bright |
| shining objects that are suspended in space, all around her. They are |
| all different kinds of geometrical shapes and forms, but they         |
| are immense. She also has had the feeling like being in an invisible  |

| 1976 - At around 1:00 a.m. a woman was alone at her home in Ravenna,  |
| Italy when she heard a noise outside. When she looked out she could   |
| see an red oval-shaped object on the ground between two houses.       |
| Nearby were four or five small spheres. Standing in front of the      |
| ovoid object was a tall being, dressed in what appeared to be body    |
| armor and a helmet with a protuberance in the center. She was         |
| distracted for a moment and lost sight of the being, and when she     |
| looked back she saw the object take off at high speed. (Sources:      |

| 1976 - At 9:00 p.m. a 63-year-old woman and her 18-year-old friend    |
| were walking past a waste storage area in Fencehouses, England when   |
| they saw a domed, oval-shaped object, resting on sledge runners, on a |
| mound of earth. It had a large glass like compartment in the center,  |
| and a bright orange dome on top. It was 5 feet long and 3.5 feet      |
| high. As the witnesses approached it, they noted that the wind and    |
| the traffic on a nearby road both seemed to stop, and they later      |
| discovered that their watches had stopped. One of the witnesses ran   |
| her hand over the object; it felt very smooth and warm. Suddenly two  |
| humanoid entities “the size of dolls” appeared beside it; they        |
| had long white hair parted down the middle, large eyes, and claw-like |
| fingers. Apparently frightened by the witnesses, they put both hands  |
| up to their faces. The witnesses were not sure what happened next,    |
| but after experiencing a period of missing time the next thing        |
| they remember is that the object took off at great speed with a       |
| humming sound.  (Sources: Jenny Randles, FSR, April 1977, p. 3; David |

| 1976 - At 7:00 p.m. local time, about two hours after the missing     |
| time close encounter in England, Joao Romeu Klein, age 19, was        |
| returning home after visiting his mother near Serra Do Mouro, Santa   |
| Catarina State, Brazil when he observed an approaching disc-shaped    |
| object from the south. The object had a rotating lower half and a     |
| bright light on top which seemed to change colors. The UFO flew over  |
| the witness, then came to a halt just ahead of him. It projected an   |
| intense beam of red light from its base. Inside this beam three small |
| beings levitated slowly to the ground. The three small humanoids took |
| up positions across the road, blocking Joao's path. The object then   |
| glided over to a clump of trees nearby. As the witness continued to   |
| walk, the three small beings spread out their arms in an obvious      |
| attempt to block him, while at the same time speaking in an unknown   |
| language. The witness threw a knife at the beings but it seems to     |
| strike an invisible wall. The being in the middle then pointed a rod  |
| like device at the witness from which a beam of bluish white light    |
| emerged. The witness apparently blacked out and was found later on    |
| the ground by his neighbors. The beings were described as heavy set   |
| and human like, wearing tight gray coveralls, and globular fishbowl   |
| helmets that covered their heads. (Sources: Walter Buhler, FSR,       |

| 1979 - Following a series of low level sightings in Gateshead,        |
| England by the main witness and her family, the woman awoke in the    |
| middle of this night to see a small metallic disc-shaped object       |
| inside her bedroom. A dozen small dwarfs now appeared. They were      |
| about three feet tal and had large heads and eyes and feminine        |
| features. They wore white uniforms and white cloaks. They walked up   |
| to her bed and examined her. The witness was paralyzed during the     |
| encounter. She later reported a subsequent incident with another      |
| entity. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1979,   |

| She looked out through an upstairs window and saw a multicolored      |
| rectangular object in the sky. She went downstairs and looked at it   |
| from another angle, then awoke a male witness, who also saw it. Both  |
| went outside, but the obj had gone. 2+ witnesses. It was estimated to |
| be eight feet in length, and 70 feet away over some trees. It had     |
| lights around edge, and was over the same field as 1976 UFO sighting. |

| 2003 - Near Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. At around 2:30         |
| a.m. the main witness's 12-year-old son woke her husband and her      |
| telling them that he had a nosebleed. They did not think much about   |
| it since the boy usually gets a nose bleed once a year and it just a  |
| persistent trickle. He then got into their bed with them, and the     |
| witness fell back to sleep  very rapidly and had an extremely vivid   |
| lucid dream. In the dream, her son and she were outside of a house    |
| and they ran to the other side to see a UFO in the sky. The UFO was   |
| not lit, but rather a dark shadow in the night sky, huge and in two   |
| parts that were connected. They somehow knew that this was something  |
| to be afraid of, and hid in the deep shadows of the house. As the UFO |
| came down almost noiselessly it transformed itself into a vast robot, |
| which started walking across the countryside. She believed they       |
| somehow "knew" this had something to do with electrical power, and    |
| that they would be forced to use some power they didn't want to use.  |
| She believed using their power would be a trick which would           |
| ultimately be used to imprison them. They ran inside the house and    |
| there the phone was ringing, and they again "knew" it was the power   |
| company calling them to force them to use this new power, so they did |
| not answer the phone. In the dream, there was a glassed-in room in    |
| the house, which had a number of people seated in it. These people    |
| were important to the experiencer, although they were not familiar to |
| her. She ran into the room to warn them of what she had seen. One of  |
| the people was a brown haired girl, about 20 years old, whom the      |
| witness recognized as her "daughter" (but not her real life           |
| daughter). She was crying, although the witness was not sure why.     |
| What was remarkable about her was that she was half human and half    |
| "android" or robotic. At one point the experiencer could see some of  |
| the skin on her back, and she believed could see that the skin was    |
| living tissue stretched over a metallic frame. The skin was red and   |
| sore appearing, like burned scar tissue. She was also pregnant and    |
| made a comment to the witness about how she had been to "animal       |
| control" (the witness could not quite recall the phrase but it was    |
| like going to a veterinarian instead of a human doctor), where she    |
| had been impregnated. The father of her child was also there, another |
| predominantly robotic person who has a face that looked as if a human |
| face had been grafted on. He appeared to be a sympathetic figure, and |
| she believed he understood what the experiencer was telling him.      |
| There were others in the room that were similar, but the witness did  |
| not have a chance to speak to them. The dream went blank for a bit,   |
| and then the witness found herself outside in a "neighborhood". There |
| was a huge wind blowing and she believed that this was due to changes |
| occurring to the Earth. She also "knew" that after the Earth changes  |
| the alien beings will come for us, and that would be terrible. In     |
| this vivid dream, the power company had set up a steel building that  |
| looked like the only thing that could withstand the wind. Everyone    |
| crowded inside, but the experiencer believed that it was trap. She    |
| pointed out to the father of her daughter's baby that the heavy       |
| stainless steel door only opened from the outside, and that if        |
| they let go of them they would all be trapped inside. Between them    |
| they managed to keep the doors from closing. The dream went on with   |
| dire predictions for humanity and coming Earth changes: a collapse of |
| society was coming. The witness woke up around 6:00 a.m. with a       |
| severe nosebleed, stiff arms and legs, and total physical exhaustion. |
| Other family members reported strange scratches and marks on their    |
| bodies. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2003 Humanoid Sighting Reports    |

| 2004 - On this evening around 10:00 p.m. two people watched a set of  |
| brilliant strobing lights through binoculars from Linton, Oregon. The |
| lights were hovering in the sky across the Willamette River. They     |
| distinctly saw four colors of lights: red, white, green, and blue.    |
| They flashed and rotated around the edges. They would shift position, |
| tilting from horizontal to vertical, then rotating slowly so that     |
| they could see the underside of a single multicolored object, and     |
| then flatten out. The witnesses also reported that they thought       |
| airliners taking off from Portland International Airport must have    |
| seen this object. (Source: George A. Filer & David E. Twichell,       |
