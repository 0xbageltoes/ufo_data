| Kimpo, Korea. Next it rose straight up for ten seconds, disappearing  |
| from sight. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official     |

| thin disc with a small dome on top, shimmering silver, hover about 30 |
| yards up and 100 yards away for 8-10 seconds. It crossed the road     |
| slowly, turned, and crossed the road again behind his car. It then    |
| suddenly shot straight up. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook   |

| Venezuela but stopped in midair. It came down between two hills, then |
| rose up and flew away. Also that evening, around 10 p.m. two friends  |
| out stargazing saw seven perfectly circular objects fly over          |
| Hicksville, New York. (Sources: (1) Flying Saucers magazine, February |

| 1964 - A reddish orange rectangular object with a lower appendage was |
| seen low over a road in Rio Choromoro, Argentina at 9:30 p.m. It had  |
| black stripes and two vanes rotating in a clockwise direction. It was |
| also surrounded by smoke or vapor. It absorbed a smaller object a few |
| meters above the road. (Source: FSR Case Histories, December 1973, p. |

| 1965 - Private aircraft pilot Mr. C. Adams, and a television          |
| cameraman Mr. Les Hendy, reported seeing four or five “mysterious     |
| objects” floating in the sea 3 miles east of Fraser Island, 150 miles |
| north of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia at about 11.30 a.m. Mr.      |
| Adams first noticed two of the objects from a distance of about 8     |
| miles while flying over Fraser Island. The weather was clear and the  |
| objects appeared to resemble two big dark-coloured logs. They were    |
| narrow and up to 100 feet long. As he steered toward them two or      |
| three similar but smaller objects appeared near the other two. They   |
| did not appear to move, but seemed to “sort of submerge" when the     |
| plane was about one mile away from them. From the air they appeared   |
| to be lying just below the surface and when “submerging” from sight   |
| seemed to do so without disturbing the surface. Mr. Adams was certain |
| that the objects were too big to be fish or sharks, and the wrong     |
| shape to be whales. Mr. Hendy regretted that they were too far away   |
| from him to film them. Several experts got their heads together and   |
| decided that the objects sighted were migrating whales. However,      |
| their explanation was soon squashed when part-owner of the Seabrae    |
| Hotel--Mr. G. Sampson--and Mrs. V. Grady reported that they had       |
| sighted a similar object on the very same day, half-a-mile out        |
| between Redcliffe Pier and Redcliffe Point. They watched it for 10    |
| minutes. It was long and black and there appeared to be a black       |
| balloon suspended over it. A Fisheries Dept. spokesman commented that |
| it was unlikely to be a whale, because they very seldom come into     |
| Morton Bay. (Source: H. J. Hinfelaar, “Submarine Craft in Australian  |
| Waters”, Flying Saucer Review, July-August 1966, p. 29).              |

| 1966 - At 9:30 p.m. in Spooner, Wisconsin Ms. Dorothy Gray sighted    |
| two domed discs with sparkling upper surfaces and square windows on   |
| their tops hovered revolved above a lake, causing a strange           |
| turbulence on the surface of the lake. The sighting lasted 25         |
| seconds. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official        |

| 1967 - At 1:30 a.m. a strange object buzzed a car near Itajuba,       |
| Brazil and the car's motor and headlights then failed. The object was |
| mushroom-shaped. The witness also saw the faces of humanoids through  |
| the transparent front of the UFO. It flew away and the car could be   |
| restarted. (Sources: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports Involving Vehicle    |

| 1967 - At 11:55 p.m. a silver disc flew twice as fast as the fastest  |
| jet over Pine Grove, Pennsylvania. It was in sight for three seconds. |

| 1969 - A bluish white oval shaped object hovered over Eden, South     |
| Australia then rose upward and passed overhead heading toward the     |

| 1972 - On this afternoon in Dayton, Iowa an ovoid object w landing    |
| gear was seen to touch down and humanoids were seen on board the      |
| craft. At 9:00 p.m. in Rouen, France a white metallic domed disc shot |
| four beams of red light, rose in three small jumps, then shot         |
| straight up. (Sources: Kevin Randle, APRO Bulletin, May-June 1974, p. |

| 1973 - At four o'clock in the morning a 12-year-old girl saw a UFO    |
| land in her backyard in Chevy Chase, Maryland. A diamond-shaped UFO   |
| was observed at a low altitude over Woodley, England at 10:05 p.m.    |
| (Sources: NICAP UFO Investigator, August 1973, p. 3; newspaper        |

| 1974 - The witness to an earlier report of humanoids in Warneton,     |
| Belgium from January 7, 1974 saw the same two entities again. At 8:40 |
| p.m. his car engine sputtered and the cassette player stopped         |
| working. He felt an electric shock, then heard a sound, and the       |
| beings vanished. At 9:30 EDT, less than seven hours later in          |
| Southampton, Massachusetts four men and women saw a domed object with |
| multicolored lights and a bobbing motion, descend near a road. The    |
| witnesses fled in fear. (Sources: Ted Bloecher, 1975 MUFON Symposium  |

| 1975 - At 1:30 a.m. a car driving between Marcenat and Moulet, France |
| encountered a 30-meter wide ball of light hovering only 15 meters     |
| above the ground. It gave off an unpleasant odor, and the witness's   |
| car radio stopped working. One half hour later a white luminous       |
| ovoid-shaped object was spotted near a farm six kilometers west of    |
| Meymans, France. A burglar alarm went off at around the same time.    |

| 1975 - At 9:30 p.m. that evening in Revigny-sur-Ornain, France a      |
| policeman took photographs of two luminous ovoid-shaped objects       |
| flying over some nearby trees. The UFOs made an S-curve maneuver,     |

| 1977 - A disc with red, orange, and green colored lights hovered for  |
| 20 minutes over the Wangara Valley, New Zealand. It had a white band  |
| across the middle, and vanished after several seconds.                |
|                                                                       |
| 1977 - Later than same night near Barnard Castle in England both a    |
| car and a motorcycle lost power in the presence of at least two       |
| purplish ovoid UFOs. A 16-year-old motorcyclist saw two purple        |
| objects for 30 seconds along the side of the road. A pinkish-purple   |
| object, shaped like an oval meat dish, suddenly appeared over his     |
| cycle and an approaching car. The engines of both vehicles began to   |
| lose power. Both vehicles were dragged twenty-five feet along the     |
| highway not under their own power. The motorcyclist also felt         |
| increased heat and the motorcycle's metal body became hot to the      |
| touch. The object then suddenly disappeared. The next day, the brakes |
| on the cycle were found to be abnormally worn. (Sources: FSR,         |

| 1979 - An alleged abduction experience by aliens occurred this        |
| afternoon near Dubois, Wyoming. While camping in a wilderness area    |
| the witness looked up towards a clear spot in the clouds and then     |
| lost trackof time. He found himself in a large room while a being     |
| surrounded by light stood at his side. He remembers looking back at   |
| his body and seemingly walking on air toward a network of wires. At   |
| that point someone placed a helmet on his head and he had a sensation |
| of expanded consciousness and a rushing in of information. He could   |
| look down and see the ground from his viewpoint in the air. A being   |
| nexted touched a small device to different points on his arm. He      |
| conversed with the beings about the nature of happiness and helping   |
| others. (Source: Thomas E. Bullard, UFO Abductions: The Measure of a  |

| cavorting over a backyard garage and shed in Little Rock, Arkansas.   |
| They came very close and the leaves on some trees were withered. At   |
| 10 p.m. several sentries in the Uigher Region of China watched a      |

| 1989 - On this day several school children near the river in          |
| Konantsevo, Vologda, Russia watched a bright sphere descend and land. |
| It rolled a short distance and then split in half. A headless         |
