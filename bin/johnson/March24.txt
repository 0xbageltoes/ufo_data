| 1954 - A U.S. Marine Corps pilot named Holland, flying a military     |
| transport, pursued a silver flying disc-shaped object with extreme    |
| maneuverability over Fresno, California on this day. (Sources:        |

| 1955 - At 2:30 p.m. a hat-shaped metallic disc with three windows in  |
| the top section flew in front of and under a Beechcraft airplane over |
| the Ryuku Islands, Okinawa, Japan. The plane's Instruments ceased to  |
| function, and the engine experienced interference. (Sources: Coral E. |

| 1966 - In the afternoon a trapper and a guide saw an oval object with |
| a dome approach them in the forest near Cook, Minnesota. It had       |
| flashing lights around its center, and made a loud noise like a       |
| generator humming. It angled downward and landed in the distance.     |
| When they got to the place where it had landed it had already left,   |
| but it left a large melted oval in the snow. (Sources: NICAP UFO      |

| 1966 - At 10:15 p.m. two women driving in Sheboygan, Wisconsin saw a  |
| glowing object on the road. As they came near to it they found that   |
| it was hovering and displayed two intense white lights, as well as    |
| one green and one red light. The object was bowl-shaped, and they     |
| lost sight of it when they drove away. They saw it again later,       |
| flying low on a south-north trajectory. (Source: Jacques Vallee,      |

| 1966 - That same night a police reservist in Monroe Township, New     |
| Jersey saw a saucer-shaped object flying low enough that he could     |
| distinguish two figures moving about inside it. He chased the UFO to  |
| police headquarters before it disappeared from sight. (Source: David  |

| 1967 - Numerous reports came from Belt, Montana including one of an   |
| unknown object landing. A truck driver named Williams spotted a very  |
| large dome-shaped object emitting an intense light that had landed in |
| a ravine. As he approached, it took off and settled back further      |
| away, hidden from the highway. At dawn, police and a Malmstrom Air    |
| Force Base helicopter made a search of the area, with negative        |
| results. (Sources: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence (Volume I), p. 158; |

| 1973 - Therines, Oise, France - At midnight M. Brechant, his           |
| 11-year-old son Patrice, and his brother-in-law Mr. Cosme, were in a  |
| car on a dark night on a UFO hunting expedition. In a field near      |
| Songeons, France and some 250-300 meters away from the road, they saw |
| a luminous ball whose light diminished in intensity. For a few        |
| seconds 4-6 white luminous rectangles appeared beside it. They tried  |
| to drive around the light and observe it from behind. A second        |
| luminous ball, likewise in the field, was about 200 meters away. A    |
| triangular beam of light emerged from its base, pointing toward the   |
| left. Through binoculars Mr. Cosme could see two luminous silhouettes |
| of humanoid beings, one behind the beam and one "sliding on it"       |
| towards the point, where it disappeared. They seemed to have          |
| elongated heads and enormously broad shoulders. He could not          |
| distinguish arms and legs but the one behind the beam seemed to carry |
| a sack on its left side. This silhouette gradually "evaporated." The  |
| beam then went out, and then the ball disappeared. On their way home  |
| their car was pursued by a ball of yellowish-white light that turned  |
| yellowish-green at treetop level. The first saw it 300 meters away    |
| and it later approached to within 50 meters. (Source: David F. Webb   |

| 1974 - A witness driving between Sanlucar and Barrameda, Cadiz, Spain |
| had his car engine die when he encountered a disc-shaped object       |
| hovering over the road. There was also a two meter tall being in a    |
| spacesuit. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case 11232,     |
| citing Lumieres dans la Nuit, March 1975).                            |

| 1978 - On this day a 16-year-old boy had gone out into the woods near |
| Penalva, Maranhao, Brazil and disappeared, and a search party failed  |
| to locate him. Eighty-one hours later a fisherman heard a shout for   |
| help and found the boy standing in a forested area, dazed and unable  |
| to stand up. He was taken to a local hospital where he was found      |
| incoherent and bleeding from the head where some of his hair was      |
| missing. Four of his teeth were also missing. He also seemed to be    |
| paralyzed. After three days later in the hospital he was able to talk |
| about what had happened to him. He said he had been gathering guava   |
| fruit outside a wooded area when he heard a loud siren like sound. He |
| looked up and saw a bright light coming from above the trees. He then |
| fell down to the ground unable to move, and was then levitated up     |
| into a hovering flying object that had three spheres on the bottom.   |
| He entered the object through a window and fell softly on the floor.  |
| Inside the craft he encountered three short beings that wore uniforms |
| with helmets and visors, and spoke in a loud, incomprehensible        |
| language. The boy was then taken on a journey to a strange land with  |
| no trees, no lakes, and no birds, and a darkness above him. He could  |
| only see a field with tall grass. He was then floated onto a stone    |
| table where he was examined. He felt liquid going down his throat and |
| he passed out. His next memory was that of coming to in the hospital. |

| 1983 - After a dramatic UFO sighting that occurred on this night in   |
| Mount Storm, New York a man given the pseudonym "Wright", a           |
| 16-year-old youth, and his 13-year-old sister had recurrent dreams of |
| being abducted aboard a UFO by Grey aliens, which included a physical |
| exam in a chair with a scan by some type of scanning equipment. There |
| were 30 other UFO reports on this night from Westchester, Putnam, and |
| Dutchess counties. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek & Philip J. Imbrogno,     |

| 1990 - A family driving home after visiting relatives near            |
| Heist-op-den-berg, Belgium were on a flat section of countryside at   |
| around 9:15 p.m. with scattered trees when the seven-year old son     |
| pointed out an unusual light in the sky to his mother. The mother     |
| described it as a very clear star surrounded by several lights. She   |
| pointed it out to the father who was driving. He stopped the car by   |
| the side of the road to get a better look. When he looks out of his   |
| left window he saw "many enormous lights" hovering only 100 meters    |
| above their car. The object was absolutely silent. The mother saw ten |
| orange lights through the windshield that appeared to be blinking in  |
| a certain set pattern. She then began to feel extremely sleepy and    |
| had no energy to leave the car. She then realizes that her twins are  |
| fast asleep, and the father then enters the car and they drive home.  |
| They got home at 11:20, and realized that the trip that usually takes |
| an hour had taken over two hours this time. The family has refused    |
| hypnotic regression because of religious reasons. (Sources: Lumieres  |

| 1990 - On the same night several locals in Chardzhou, Turkmenistan    |
| reported encountering a tall robot like creature in the outskirts of  |
| the city. The creature was close to two meters tall, massively built, |
| and had a bright circle of light on its chest from which bright beams |
| of light emanated. It walked in a strange mechanical way. It had a    |
| huge head resembling a flattened saucer, and two long blinking        |
| devices jutting from the head resembling antennas or horns. The front |
| of the robot's head emanated a sort of greenish steam that was very   |
| foul smelling. The frightened witnesses fled the area on foot.        |

| 2000 - A 40-year-old woman named E. King reported that she was        |
| abducted from her bedroom in Grimsby, Humberside, England in the      |
| predawn hours and taken to watch a surgical operation on a man. She   |
| was later returned to her home safely. All of her experiences were    |
| based on completely conscious recollections, with no hypnosis. There  |
| were three other UFO reports in Humberside and Lincoln counties that  |
| day. (Source: Lynn Picknett, Mammoth Book of UFOs, pp. 180-181).      |
