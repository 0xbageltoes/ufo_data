| 1947 - Two railway men, J. A. Martin and Kenneth Smith, working near  |
| Livingston, Montana saw disc-shaped machines traveling to the south   |
| in the sky just before sundown. Their speed was 40-60 mph; they       |
| glided smoothly and made no sound. They were plainly visible.         |

| 1952 - At 4:10 a.m. USAF Lt. H. K. Funseth, a ground radar observer,  |
| and two U.S. Navy men watched an unidentified pulsing amber light fly |
| straight and level for seven minutes outside of Akron on US Highway   |
| 224 in Atwater, Ohio. The object was pulsating in intensity from very |
| intense to normal. They reported observing a light only, and could    |
| not discern what the object looked like. It was described as          |
| amber-orange, round, the size of a car headlamp on dim, and traveling |
| at a speed of 200 mph. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO   |

| 1953 - At 12:30 a.m. in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada two          |
| witnesses experienced two hours of missing time after their car had   |
| stalled in the presence of a black, 14 meter in diameter circular     |
| object, which hovered overhead. During hypnosis it emerged that       |
| telepathy was used for communication. (Source: Don Ledger, Maritime   |

| 1954 - Outside of Vernon, near Paris, France a giant cigar-shaped     |
| object was observed standing on end at 1:00 a.m. It emitted a         |
| disc-shaped object, dropped in free fall, then slowed and swayed. The |
| disc was surrounded by a red halo. Over the next 45 minutes it        |
| emitted four more discs. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and    |

| 1959 - At 9:30 p.m. a student watched a bright, pulsating ellipsoid   |
| object hover in Midland, Michigan. It made a whirring sound, was      |

| 1965 - At one o'clock in the morning Casimiro Zuk was riding          |
| his bicycle near a railroad crossing in Apostoles, Argentina when he  |
| saw a luminous object above him that circled, then landed near the    |
| tracks. It was round, five meters in diameter, and 2.5 meters high. A |
| door opened and a man dressed like a pilot emerged, walked around,    |
| and then re-entered the object, which flew off in a spiral. (Source:  |

| 1966 - Columbus, Ohio. - At seven o'clock in the evening two           |
| witnesses, Broomall and Gilpin, reported seeing a circular, luminous  |
| white object split into five objects. All five objects streaked away  |
| toward the west. The sighting lasted 15 minutes. (Source: Don         |

| 1967 - Joyceville, Ontario - While driving from his home in Toronto to |
| Montreal at four o'clock in the morning Stanley Moxon, age 20, saw a  |
| green light in a field ahead of him, not far from the road. He turned |
| off his headlights and swung onto a side road to get closer. Turning  |
| his lights on again, he saw a huge greenish colored lens-shaped       |
| craft, and two somewhat bulky human-like entities about four feet     |
| tall, wearing white uniforms and helmets. They "seemed to be at work  |
| around the machine." When they were discovered, they quickly jumped   |
| into the craft, which took off silently at tremendous speed.          |

| 1967 - Two young men, Ricardo Hurtado and Antonio Piedra, in Caracas, |
| Santa Monica district, Venezuela heard a noise like "horses           |
| galloping" in their kitchen. They encountered two small beings who    |
| when discovered left hurriedly. There were no lights on in the room   |
| and their details could not be discerned very well, but they did not  |
| believe the visitors could have been children.(Source: APRO Bulletin, |

| 1967 - In Kolmarden, Sodermanland, Sweden a 15-year-old boy and girl, |
| Erik and Inga, were walking together in the evening when they saw a   |
| reddish glow descend into the woods at 8:00 p.m. When they reached an |
| abandoned cabin they saw a conical light beam cast onto its wall, and |
| the red light re-appeared. Alarmed by this, they walked to the home   |
| of the boy's sisters, where they found a round, brightly luminous     |
| object hovering about 13 feet in the air. Then they heard a whistling |
| sound and footsteps, and finally a little being jumped out from       |
| behind some bushes, 35 feet away. The being was 4 feet 4 inches tall, |
| and its face was at first completely in shadow. Then it jerkily       |
| raised its head and arms, holding a box from which a short tube       |
| protruded. Its head was very large, covered by hair or a helmet. It   |
| had large dark eyes, and a nose and mouth that together formed an     |
| "X." It was bowlegged, and around each ankle was a brilliant, white   |
| glowing wire. The witnesses ran for home. The next day at the site    |
| the boy found some apples that had been broken apart, some of them    |
| with the marks of five fingernails or claws on the broken surface.    |
| Other apples were coated with a foul smelling slime. Also found       |
| outside the house were deep, odd footprints, 6 inches long and with   |
| three-toe marks. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:      |

| 1967 - At 10:15 p.m. a 19-year-old teenager riding on a motocycle two |
| miles north of Lacombe, Alberta, Canada was chased by a red UFO with  |
| a vertical stripe down the middle.  It followed him two miles down a  |

| stall. He felt heat, and heard a loud whistle sound. (Sources:        |

| was disc shaped and also had red and white lights, and was four       |

| 1971 - At around 4 p.m. on highway D1 southeast of Verteillac,        |
| Dordogne, France a huge metallic disc-shaped UFO was spotted as it    |
| rose from behind some trees. It stopped in midair and dropped back    |
| down again. Nothing was found on the ground when the area was         |
| searched. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue 123).                 |

| 1976 - Dean Anderson was cutting grass on a golf course in Egg        |
| Harbor, Door County, Wisconsin at 4:15 a.m. when he saw a large       |
| orange craft drop down into a culvert behind the road. Anderson       |
| stopped his lawn mower. Two figures emerged from a door in the craft  |
| and floated down to the ground on a “band of light.” The craft then   |
| took off. Both figures carried flashlights 3 feet long. They came up  |
| to Mr. Anderson and one of the beings extended his hand, which the    |
| witness shook. He said, “We come in peace. I am Sunar from Jupiter.   |
| This is Treena; she comes from Saturn.” The witness shook Treena’s    |
| hand while Sunar allegedly explained that they were here on a         |
| scientific mission, gathering specimens. Treena took off her outer    |
| spacesuit, and appeared in a close fitting, light green one-piece     |
| suit; the top was of “some glistening metallic material,” but the     |
| pants were dull. She also wore slippers. Her skin was light tan, her  |
| eyes blueish gray, and she had shoulder length hair. She was 5’2”     |
| tall. Sunar did most of the talking; he had copper colored skin, and  |
| said he was over 200 years old. The witness was told that the man he  |
| had chased on a previous closer encounter was Muton, from Mars, and   |
| that Sunar had once met Baha’u”llah, the founder of the Baha’i        |
| religion. After about 20 minutes of conversation, Treena put her      |
| spacesuit back on, and gave Anderson an envelope made of yellow nylon |
| cloth, which she asked him not to open for nine days. The craft       |
| returned, and the two UFOnauts ascended to it on a beam of light. The |
| craft was estimated to be 30 feet wide at the bottom, and 60 feet     |
| high. As soon as daylight allowed, the witness photographed the       |
| footprints of Treena and Sunar in the dirt. Later, upon opening the   |
| envelope, the witness found a gold-colored, engraved amulet inside.   |
| There is no mention of what he did with it, or whether he still has   |
| it. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of      |
