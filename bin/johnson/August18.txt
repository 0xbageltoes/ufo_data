| looking like "skeet targets", passed beneath a United                 |
| Airlines transport plane flying at 8,000 feet near Mountain Home Army |
| Air Base, Idaho at around noon. The objects flew off to the south, at |
| a speed estimated at 900 miles per hour. There were two witnesses on  |
| board the aircraft. (Sources: Boise (Idaho) Statesman, August 20,     |

| 1953 - In the early evening on or about this day Salvador Villanueva, |
| a taxi cab driver, was trying to repair his broken down car out in    |
| the country near Ciudad Valles, Mexico when he was joined by two      |
| short, human looking men. They were only about four and a half feet   |
| tall, and they wore one-piece gray garments made out of corduroy      |
| that covered even their feet. They also had on wide, shiny black      |
| belts, metal collars, and small black shiny boxes connected to the    |
| collars on the back of their necks. Under their arms they carried     |
| football-style crash helmets. Because it was raining he invited them  |
| to shelter inside his taxi, where they had a conversation that        |
| lasted all night. They spoke Spanish with a strange accent. The       |
| spokesman eventually told him they were from another planet, which    |
| Villanueva scarcely believed, but he accompanied them to their craft. |
| While walking there he noticed that the mud puddles did not get their |
| feet wet, and that their belts glowed whenever the mud was repelled.  |
| The UFO was disc-shaped and looked like two soup plates joined at the |
| rim, with a shallow dome on top with portholes. It rested on the      |
| ground on three spheres that acted like landing gear. He was invited  |
| inside, but declined to go. The two men climbed up some stairs to get |
| aboard. Glowing white, the vessel zigzagged upwards, and then shot up |
| vertically, making only a faint whistling sound. A 40-foot circle of  |
| broken bushes was left behind at the landing spot. It's possible the  |
| presence of the UFO may have caused his car to malfunction. (Sources: |

| 1954 - A brilliant metallic sphere was witnessed at 6:30 p.m. by a    |
| witness while driving between the towns of Coire and Chur,            |
| Switzerland. The sphere maneuvered in the western sky toward Ilanz at |
| three kilometers altitude, making sudden turns. It finally shot       |
| straight up into the sky and was gone. At 8:00 p.m. a reddish yellow  |
| disc seen over the town of Stein-Saeckingen, Switzerland for 12       |
| minutes. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, cases # 3518 &    |

| 1963 - A silvery disc-shaped UFO was seen by two young boys in Fort   |
| Kent, Aroostook County, Maine at 12:30 p.m. The boys' parents agreed  |
| that they must have seen something unusual. The disc passed from      |
| north to south, emitting a hum intermittently. (Sources: St. John     |

| 1964 - Major D.W. Thompson and First Pilot Lt. J. F. Jonke were       |
| flying a U.S. Air Force C-124 transport plane 200 miles over the      |
| Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Dover, Delaware. At 12:35 a.m. they   |
| sighted a round, blurry, reddish-white object that appeared to be on  |
| a collision course with their C-124 from ahead and below. The         |
| airplane evaded the object. The sighting lasted two minutes.          |

| 1965 - In Noblesville, Indiana at 10:50 p.m. the engine and radio of  |
| a car with two occupants inside died when a top-shaped object with a  |
| dome and body lights hovered over the car. The close encounter lasted |
| for four minutes. (Source: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume  |

| 1966 - Three hunters, E. Beucomo, J. Zapata and J. Ramos, observed a  |
| strange glow in the forest near Barinas, Venezuela and discovered a   |
| very large, egg-shaped object, hovering stationary two meters above   |
| ground. It had large, circular openings emitting a multicolored       |
| light, and it made a whistling sound. The hunters ran away. (Source:  |

| 1968 - At 13:23 p.m. in a forest 47 kilometers west-southwest of      |
| Cluj, Romania, three photographs were taken of a silvery hat-shaped   |
| object, 42-50 meters in diameter, with a structure similar to the Rex |
| Heflin photographs from Santa Ana, California in 1965. The            |
| photographer was a 45-year-old man, along with his girlfriend, and    |
| there were two other  witnesses. It flew overhead at an estimated     |
| height of 600 meters, moving from northeast to southwest, and then    |
| reversed direction. The object finally accelerated and shot upward    |
| out of sight. The sighting lasted two minutes. (Sources: Florin       |

| 1971 - At 6:40 a.m. a glowing white cigar, the size of a railroad car |
| and tapered at one end, flew over in Sutherlands, South Australia. It |
| had no wings or protuberances, and flew to the east on an even course |
| at an estimated speed of 200 mph. (Source: A. Jenke, Australian FSR,  |

| 1972 - Raimundo Alvarez and Pancho Torres, two masons, were working   |
| on a roof drain at around two o'clock in the afternoon in Istapalapa, |
| Mexico when they heard a humming sound. Next they noticed that all    |
| ordinary daytime sounds had eerily ceased, creating a "stifling"      |
| silence. About 50 yards away from them Alvarez saw two strange,       |
| eight-foot tall figures, dressed in bright silvery clothing           |
| resembling fish scales. When they got closer the two men could see    |
| that the beings were unusually broad shouldered and slender. They had |
| round heads that were bright silver in color, with two round bumps in |
| place of eyes, small ears, no visible mouths or noses, hands with     |
| four digits, and large webbed feet like those of ducks. They "seemed  |
| to float in air" while walking. The beings started to approach the    |
| witnesses, but just then a woman carrying a milk can came around the  |
| corner of the house, and the two creatures "flew" toward her. A great |
| deal of dust arose from the ground; the two entitiesvanished into it  |
| and were not seen again. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, November-December   |

| 1975 - Two men, Bernard Gregory, age 19, and Patrick Labonne, age 22, |
| were camping in a clearing in Villeneuve Loubet, Alpes Maritimes      |
| Department, France. At around 2:30 a.m. Bernard suddenly felt uneasy, |
| and saw four luminous "forms". He called Patrick, who also saw them.  |
| Both men felt they were being observed. Afraid, they woke the rest of |
| their friends. Suddenly all six of them saw a huge light and then a   |
| red cloud that ascended into the sky and transformed into a black,    |
| compact cigar-shaped object. The being-like forms were described as   |
| about 1.75 m in height, each with two eyes in the upper part. The     |
| forms were white in color, and they moved very slowly, like on        |
| rollers. As the witnesses walked away they looked back, and saw two   |
| of the forms in a tree. At this point the witnesses attempted to      |
| approach the beings, but were prevented by an "invisible" barrier.    |
| After the gray compact cigar-shaped object left, the grass at the     |
| site was found to be desiccated, and matted down in a spiral fashion. |
| A white, oval-shaped stain resembling chalk was also found, but       |
| disappeared with the morning daylight. During the incident the        |
| witnesses noticed there was an unusual silence in the area, but dogs  |
| were heard barking in the distance. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit,  |

| 1975 - At 6:50 a.m. in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin a silver           |
| domed-disc with a transparent cupola on top, hovered 10 feet over a   |

| 1978 - A large glowing disc-shaped UFO was seen in a forest near      |

| 1993 - At 11:00 p.m. a young Hispanic woman phoned her neighbors and  |
| asked them to come over to her house outside Dallas, Texas            |
| immediately, because there were something strange going on in the     |
| house. One of her neighbor's, Jill, grabbed her camera and headed for |
| the house. When Jill arrived the entire family was in a state of      |
| terror and extreme agitation. Two of the young females in the         |
| household were cowering in a corner of the living room, holding on to |
| each other. The friend who called her sat in a chair curled into a    |
| semi-fetal position, rocking back and forth. She then pointed to the  |
| backyard. Jill looked out through a sliding glass door that led to    |
| the backyard and saw a creature with glowing red eyes, only 15 feet   |
| from the door. The being seemed to be scanning the house from left to |
| right and top to bottom. Jill began snapping photos through the       |
| sliding glass door. At the same time the Hispanic woman heard a long  |
| ringing sound in her ears. Eventually the being disappeared. Another  |
| family member reported seeing similar beings going through doors,     |
| windows and walls the same day and two days prior. An anomalous image |

| 1999 - At 4:10 a.m. in Izmir, Turkey a man first observed a huge,     |
| oval-shaped craft, almost one kilometer in length, over the city; it  |
| suddenly vanished. Then a small gray egg-shaped object with small     |
| windows landed in his garden. Several small Grey humanoids exited the |
| object and stared at the witness. One of them approached him and      |
| slowly took his hand; the being’s skin felt very soft. The humanoid   |
| then tried to pull the man's hand gently, in an attempt to escort him |
| onboard the landed craft, but the witness refused to go. However, he  |
| reported that he felt at peace during the encounter. (Sources: Peter  |

| Washington at around 1:00 a.m., a man who had previously seen a       |
| multi-colored UFO many times in the area late at night took out his   |
| binoculars and sighted an oval-shaped disc with blinking red, blue,   |
| and green lights. It was making a low-pitched, humming sound, and was |
| hovering over a small clearing on the ridge. Through the binoculars   |
| he saw what appeared to be a porthole, and through the porthole he    |
| could see a humanoid being wearing some sort of a helmet. Frightened, |
| the man decided to climb down off the ridge and go home. (Source:     |
