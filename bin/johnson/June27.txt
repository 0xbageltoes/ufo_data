| 1947 - At 10:00 a.m. a shiny disc-shaped object streaked by Capitan,  |
| New Mexico and landed on a nearby hill. At 10:30 a.m. John A.         |
| Petsche, an electrical worker, and another person independently       |
| witnessed a disc-shaped object, which seemed to land near Tintown,    |
| Arizona. The disc had a mirror-like surface. (Sources: (1)            |

| 1949 - A brass domed-disc with a transparent clear dome was seen at   |
| only 10 meters altitude in Albera Ligure, Italy at 8:20 p.m. It       |
| emitted a gaseous cloud of vapor, then flew away over a hill.         |

| 1952 - A military pilot named Kelly saw a UFO hover at 6:50 p.m. and  |
| pulsate a brilliant red over Topeka, Kansas. The shape of the object  |
| varied from circular to oval in the vertical dimension as the object  |
| pulsated. A Project Blue Book "unknown." (Sources: Project Blue Book  |

| 1956 - Two ball-shaped objects were seen hovering over Mahonoy City,  |
| Pennsylvania at 8:15 p.m. They glistened brilliantly at the height of |
| normal aircraft height, when suddenly they shot straight up           |
| vertically, leaving behind short vapor trail in their wakes. One of   |
| the witnesses was a newspaper reporter. (Sources: Loren E. Gross, The |

| 1959 - Twenty-four hours after their previous sighting, a UFO         |
| re-appeared in the same position in the sky over the Boianai Mission  |
| on Milne Bay, New Guinea, only a little further off. Four men were    |
| again seen occupied with some activity on top of it. Father William   |
| Gill waved, and one of the men on the UFO did the same; then all the  |
| observers waved, and all four UFO occupants appeared to wave back.    |
| Flashlight signals were answered by movements of the object, which    |
| oscillated and then came somewhat closer. After this there was no     |
| further response. After about 90 minutes of visibility some low       |
| clouds obscured the object. (Sources: Rev. Norman E. G. Crutwell,     |

| 1966 - Cistella, Spain - Three Spanish witnesses named Masso, Crous,   |
| and Arajil watched two clearly defined, hexagonal cylinders rise into |
| the air, approximately 1,800 feet apart from each other. A            |
| disc-shaped UFO flew into view and positioned itself between the      |
| cylinders as if to link them. Dense smoke arose, drying the mouths    |
| and noses of the witnesses the whole day, and one witness felt a wave |
| of heat. The strange, three-part structure was visible for several    |
| minutes before departing at blinding speed. Over an area some ten     |
| meters across in a potato field all the leaves were brittle and       |
| yellowish. A branch of a nearby pear tree was newly broken off,       |
| thrown some distance, and twisted around. (Source: Antonio Ribera,    |

| 1968 - Three children, Hugo Cesar Messina, Oscar Crespo, and a third  |
| boy were bicycling in Cerro de las Rosas, Cordoba, Argentina at 5:30  |
| p.m. when they were surprised by the appearance of a silvery colored  |
| object. The UFO had on its lower part a kind of helix, where lights   |
| of white and sky-blue were revolving. It hovered about 20 meters up   |
| and 50 meters away from the boys. On the upper part of the object     |
| appeared a couple, a man and a woman, who floated in the air. They    |
| were of enormous stature with long white hair, and they wore luminous |
| close fitting garments. Holding hands, they began to descend slowly,  |
| disappearing into the object without any door opening. The luminous   |
| helix began to rotate at greater speed, and the UFO went away at      |
| great speed. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:         |

| 1970 - At 1:30 a.m. a bright orange disc-shaped object dropped down   |
| from the sky near some power lines in Galston, Strathclyde, Scotland. |
| It emitted a bright beam of light, then flew off to the east.         |

| 1970 - At 11:40 a.m. Mr. And Mrs. Aristeu Machado, their five         |
| daughters, and Mr. Joao Aguiar of Leblon, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil      |
| watched a grayish metallic object 12-18 feet wide land on the ocean   |
| 700-1000 yards away, throwing spray up on all sides. It floated 100   |
| yards closer to shore and they could see that it had a transparent    |
| cupola, outside of which were two short, thickset figures wearing     |
| dark gray metallic coveralls and helmets. After 30-40 minutes the     |
| object took off nearly horizontally. Underneath it showed red, green, |
| and yellow lights. It left behind it a white, floating hoop shaped    |
| object and a yellow ball, both of which were lost from view as they   |
| floated toward the shore. (Sources: Walter Buhler, "UFO on the sea    |

| 1975 - A 25 meter in diameter metallic disc hovered just 15 meters    |
| above a gasoline service station in Pont-a-Mousson, France at 3:30    |
| a.m. It illuminated the ground as bright as day. That night at 11:20  |
| p.m. a vertical cylinder hung in the sky at only 10 meters altitude   |
| in Bouillancourt-la-Bataille, Somme, France. It had two antennae.     |

| 1982 - A mechanical engineer on an airliner flying northwest of       |
| Launceston, Tasmania watched a metallic sphere pace the Boeing 737    |
| aircraft for two minutes, then ascend, flying off toward the north.   |

| 1992 - Two witnesses in a mobile home in Raeford, North Carolina were |
| rattled and shaken up when a disc-shaped object landed in a field     |
| nearby. The grass was crushed down where the object had touched down. |

| 1994 - Around four o'clock in the morning at least five witnesses     |
| heard a loud hissing sound in Arad, Romania, and a nearby wheat field |
| became lit up by a very bright light. Traian Crisan, a 48-year-old    |
| shepherd, approached the site and saw a light gliding towards the     |
| field. He ran to his hut and watched from inside, but then the walls  |
| and roof of his house began to shake. He then ran outside and         |
| encountered a strong wind. He next noticed a round hovering object,   |
| and through a small opening he could see two short men who appeared   |
| to be holding a tube. Both men had beards--one a long white           |
| beard--and both had slanted eyes. They also wore headphone-like       |
| devices on their heads, and held instruments in their hands. The      |
| nearby sheep panicked and ran when blue flames shot from out of the   |
| bottom of the craft as it accelerated straight up and disappeared.    |
| Later that day a flattened circular area of wheat was found at the    |
| site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1994,     |

| 1994 - An "airplane" landed on a jagged peak in Parc de la Mouliere,  |
| Alpes-Maritime, France in the early afternoon. It was joined by two   |
| ovoid flying objects. When a witness attempted to videotape the       |
| event, his camcorder failed to work. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,  |
| issue # 327).                                                         |

| 1994 - A large dark triangular shaped craft with no lights flew over  |
| Moffat, Colorado at 11:00 p.m. It flew slowly from the east to the    |
| west at an estimated 1,000 feet altitude. One witness stated, "It was |
| so big, it blotted out the stars!" A smaller craft soon followed the  |
| first one. (Source: Christopher O'Brien, The Mysterious Valley, p.    |
| 246).                                                                 |

| 1998 - On this night teenager Marisa Pearsall from Cassopolis,        |
| Michigan found herself on a metal table. She was not afraid and she   |
| was surrounded by bright lights. She saw three short humanoids around |
| her. They were about four feet tall and gave off a white light, but   |
| no additional features could be discerned. One of the humanoids       |
| approached her and held out two fingers forming a "V" or peace sign.  |
| Marisa reported later finding several anomalous scars on her body.    |
