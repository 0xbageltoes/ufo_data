| 1946 - At 6:00 p.m. three military witnesses including the pilot      |
| named Puckett, flying in a twin engine C-47 transport 40 miles north  |
| of Tampa, Florida at 4,000 feet altitude, sighted a cylinder-shaped   |
| UFO with luminous portholes that flew in front of the plane. The      |
| cylinder was about twice the size of a B-29, and approached to within |
| 1,000 yards. It covered 75 miles in three minutes and appeared on a   |
| collision course with the aircraft. The stream of fiery exhaust from  |
| the craft was about half the length of the unknown object. (Sources:  |

| 1947 - At 8:30 p.m. three dark metallic domed discs flew over the     |
| mountains of Areches, Savoie, France heading east-northeast. They     |
| made no sound, and had rotating rims. (Source: Phenomenes Spatiaux,   |

| 1948 - On this morning everyone on a Air France airliner flying over  |
| the South China Sea from Hong Kong to Saigon, Vietnam saw a huge      |
| metallic cigar-shaped object flying south, and then make a 90-degree  |
| turn into the clouds. Later that day at Clark Field in the            |
| Philippines American military observers also sighted a wingless       |
| cigar-shaped object with a row of lights. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,   |

| 1951 - Three witnesses including police from Beausoleil, France in    |
| the Alpes-Maritime viewed a transparent bubble in the sky at nine     |
| o'clock in the evening. Two human-looking occupants of the            |
| transparent sphere watched the street and the crowd below. The bubble |
| flew off towards the north-northeast. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, |

| 1952 - At 1:14 a.m. two brilliant red lights hovered together and     |
| maneuvered for five minutes over Lancaster, California. Witnesses     |
| included sheriff deputies. One light swung in a pendulum motion, the  |
| other shot off to the southeast. (Sources: Don Berliner, Project      |

| 1952 - At ten o'clock in the morning in Afton, New York UFOs first    |
| appeared near the position of the Sun and then dispersed across the   |
| sky. Scattered disc-shaped objects were seen in the skies for the     |
| next two hours. At 10:10 a.m. a large group of UFOs described as      |
| looking like "70 white ping pong balls" passed across the sky in      |
| Sidney, New York flying from the southwest to the northeast.          |

| 1955 - Joseph Whaley, age 20, was cutting the grass along Highway 118 |
| in Bronwood, Georgia when he saw a six-foot “gorilla” come running    |
| towards him. It was covered with shaggy gray hair and had tusk like   |
| teeth, and it grunted like a pig. Whaley struck at it with his scythe |
| and then ran to this jeep, but it pursued him and clawed at him,      |
| ripping his shirt and scratching his shoulder. It moved “in a         |
| lumbering and slow moving” manner. (Sources: Atlanta Constitution,    |

| 1955 - Mr. Sheneman had just driven home from Willoughby, Ohio and    |
| was preparing to go into his house at around 9:00 p.m. He got out of  |
| his car and saw a circular object with a red light on it. The UFO     |
| came down fast, hovered, and emitted two beams of light. The witness  |
| fled toward his house while the object appeared to pursue him less    |
| than 70 meters above the ground. The domed disc was estimated to      |
| measure about 30 meters in diameter. His wife and their two children  |
| saw it fly away. (Sources: Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence (Volume I), |

| 1955 - On this night two tourists in a car in Salon, near Arles,      |
| France saw a lighted object dive toward them and hover 30 meters      |
| above the road. The disc-shaped object flew around the car and flew   |
| away without making a sound. The witnesses went straight to the Arles |
| police. (Source: Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 250). |
|                                                                       |
| 1962 - A large metallic oval-shaped object surfaced 300 meters away   |
| from three fisherman in two boats off of Le Brusc, France in the      |
| Mediterranean Sea. They first believed it was a foreign submarine.    |
| About a dozen "frogmen" emerged from the water and climbed aboard.    |
| The fishermen called out but the figures ignored them, except the     |
| last three, who turned to look at the fishermen. The very last one    |
| waved. Then the craft rose out of water, and suspended itself         |
| effortlessly above the waves, as red and green lights came on and a   |
| white light beam like a searchlight played toward the witnesses. The  |
| beam was extinguished, the red and green lights went out, and the     |
| object, now glowing an orange color and clearly oval in shape, rose a |
| further 20 meters into the air and began to rotate, its light         |
| becoming more intensely red. At last, it moved silently in a graceful |
| arc above the fishermen, and disappeared rapidly into the night       |
| sky. (Sources: Lumieres dans la Nuit, January 1971; FSR Case          |

| 1965 - At around seven p.m. a 15-year-old boy named San Roman Nunez   |
| in Lima, Peru watched a saucer-shaped UFO descend and land nearby. A  |
| 3.5 foot tall being emerged from the object. It was "greenish" with   |
| hair covered with green lights, and "looked like a toad." The boy     |
| fled. (Sources: Gordon Creighton, The Humanoids: FSR Special Edition  |

| 1966 - At 12:30 a.m. EDT citizens and police in College Park, Lanham, |
| Bowie, Seat Pleasant, and elsewhere around Prince Georges County,     |
| Maryland saw maneuvering, fast-moving lighted objects. When a police  |
| officer approached a hovering object that had pulsating red, green,   |
| and white lights, it began a series of maneuvers, descended almost to |
| the ground, then sped away "like a shot." Before it sped away, the    |
| object emitted a strange multi-colored light beam that moved rapidly  |
| to the ground, which was also observed by another police officer.     |
| Andrews AFB denied to a County police dispatcher that they had any    |
| unknown objects on radar, but the dispatcher said a control tower     |
| operator had acknowledged seeing a fast-moving lighted object, and he |
| later learned that Andrews did indeed have a UFO on its radar but     |
| would not admit it officially. (Source: NICAP UFO                     |

| 1966 - At 12:30 a.m. CDT Kathy Palmer, age 14, looked out the window  |
| of her home in Springfield, Missouri before going to bed and saw a    |
| luminous object bearing red and blue lights on the lawn. It was about |
| six feet long, ovoid shaped, and four feet wide by four feet high,    |
| and it made a "rattling" sound. From a square hatch two 5-foot tall   |
| slender occupants emerged, who either had "large heads" or wore       |
| helmets. They walked about for three minutes, apparently              |
| communicating with each other, and examined some bicycles. Then they  |
| returned to the craft and it took off. The total duration of the      |
| encounter was about 30 minutes in all. At the landing site the grass  |
| was matted down, and there was a white substance which proved to be   |
| calcium phosphate. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:    |

| 1966 - At 7:45 p.m. several young witnesses in Rushville, Indiana     |
| reported seeing an unidentified object at low altitude. (Source:      |

| 1967 - The wife and daughter of a pastor in Chester, Pennsylvania saw |
| three red, metallic, saucer-shaped objects with domes and portholes   |
| at 9:00 p.m. Two were in the northern sky, and a third approached     |
| from the north, brightened and changed color to white as it neared.   |
| It then flew at tree-top level and hovered at low altitude close to   |
| the witnesses. Finally, it climbed fast and disappeared. The object   |
| was estimated to be about the size of a two-engine plane. (Source:    |

| 1968 - At 1:57 a.m. a cigar-shaped UFO flew by Fribourg, Switzerland  |
| and a disc exited from a square doorway in the craft. It flew around  |
| and then re-entered the larger craft. Both a camera and a tape        |
| recorder experienced EM interference effects during the sighting.     |

| 1971 - At 11:35 p.m. a married couple driving in a car between        |
| Gladstone and Rockhampton in Queensland, Australia witnessed a circle |
| of lights near a river. What should normally have been a two hour     |
| trip took them only 40 minutes. They have amnesia about what happened |
| after sighting the lights in the sky, and an unusual oily residue and |
| marks were found on their car. A possible UFO abduction involving     |
| time loss, a probable translocation, and levitation are suspected.    |
| Hypnotic regression failed due to the main witness having a violent,  |
| shaking, fearful reaction to re-envisioning the event in memory.      |

| 1971 - At ten p.m. local time a domed oval-shaped UFO, illuminated by |
| lightning flashes during a nighttime thunderstorm west of             |
| Westminster, Maryland, was seen by a family of seven people           |
| maneuvering over the countryside for 20 minutes. It had a             |

| 1974 - At 2:30 a.m. a four meter long, luminous ovoid object flew     |
| fast over the beach at Canet-Plage, France. It stopped and hovered in |
| place for three hours. It had portholes through which figures could   |
| be seen inside the craft. It left by shooting off toward the west. It |
| was witnessed by a married couple named Rassin. (Source: David F.     |

| 1974 - John E. Justice had just left his job at the Ohio Masonic Home |
| for the aged in Springfield, Ohio and was driving home when he heard  |
| a voice tell him "let go the steering wheel." Justice ignored this    |
| instruction and the order was repeated, calling him "friend." Justice |
| did so, and the car continued down the long drive of its own accord.  |
| The voice, somewhat guttural in tone, came from the passenger seat to |
| his right, and Justice could see the seat was depressed, as though    |
| someone was sitting in it. He asked if he would be harmed, and was    |
| told, "Friend, I would not harm a hair on your head." Justice then    |
| asked what he wanted and got no reply. He was told that the voice was |
| that of a "spaceman," and he had been in the UFO Justice and another  |
| witness had seen a few nights earlier. Justice was then told that he  |
| would be able to see him when he left the car, and was told to look   |
| above the power lines ahead. He then observed a figure suspended ten  |
| feet in the air in front of his car. It was perfectly human in        |
| appearance, a male figure of large build, about 6' 6" tall, holding   |
| its arms outstretched in front. The being wore a tight fitting,       |
| silvery outfit with a belt, gloves, and short boots. He was very      |
| handsome, and illuminated by a strange light. Justice was told that   |
| he would be visited again. The figure passed from view and Justice    |
| took control of the steering wheel and continued home, very shaken by |
| the experience. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:        |

| 1976 - At 4:30 a.m. a 20-year-old woman heard a noise and looked out  |
| her bedroom window in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to see two beings of       |
| average height. She could not see any facial details. A white light   |

| 1976 - In New Haven, Connecticut around 6:00 p.m. a man told police   |
| he had been buzzed by a round silver, dish-shaped object, which froze |
| his car as he was driving on Route 63 between Bethany and New Haven.  |
| When the UFO passed overhead the engine of his car died and the car   |
| came to a stop. When he tried to leave the vehicle, he said, the door |
| wouldn’t budge and he began to feel “tingly”. Eventually he too       |
| became paralyzed. While this was going on, an object which he felt    |
| might have taken his picture, appeared below the low flying disk.     |
| Finally it flew off. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact     |

| 1977 - At around two o'clock in the morning, a man and a woman in     |
| Steuben, New York who had been involved in a previous UFO encounter a |
| week earlier had another encounter with aliens. They watched six or   |
| seven humanoid beings with glowing green belts, similar to those they |
| had seen the week before. Two of them had glowing gray belts, and one |
| of the witnesses saw two normal sized human figures that glowed a     |
| silvery white instead of green. After observing them for an hour they |
| woke a third witness, who saw only blue-green lights. When they shone |
| a flashlight beam on one of the figures it disappeared, but           |
| re-appeared when the light beam was removed. It gradually became very |
| foggy, so at 4:30 a.m. they went to bed, but the first two witnesses  |
| thought they could hear the sound of a woman screaming three times,   |
| and then a door slamming. They experienced headaches and ringing in   |
| their ears. The third witness, who heard a noise like someone         |
| chiseling rock and a high-pitched chirping sound, did not suffer from |
| a headache. They saw no UFOs that night, but there were               |
| other reported sightings in the area on subsequent nights. (Sources:  |

| 1978 - A six-month-pregnant woman in Clarksville, Tennessee had been  |
| taking a nap around 10:00 p.m. when she woke up to see a large craft  |
| hovering outside the upstairs window, over a nearby wood shack. Her   |
| husband saw the object too. She fainted but then heard a voice in a   |
| thick Middle Eastern accent that told her to open her eyes. When she  |
| did eyes she was confronted by a tall creature resembling an insect,  |
| thin and white in color, wearing a dark outfit. It communicated with  |
| her by using telepathy. There were several other similar creatures    |
| wearing jumpsuits standing in the room. Their heads were large and    |
| rounded. The witness conducted a mental conversation with the leader, |
| and asked it several questions about its origin. The witness suddenly |
| panicked and screamed and began to faint, and some of the creatures   |
| began backing away. But moments later a long needle was painfully     |
| inserted into her belly. She then passed out, and awoke later to see  |
| the taller creature talking to the others. At one point the witness   |
| claimed she saw several helicopters flying around the hovering craft. |

| 1983 - Two young men were driving a truck in Urbanopolis, Minas       |
| Gerais State, Brazil at eight o'clock in the evening when they felt a |
| sensation of cold and increasing atmospheric pressure, heard buzzing, |
| and saw a small reddish ellipsoidal light beam strike their truck     |
| from above. It dragged the truck back from accelerating when the      |
| driver attempted to drive faster. (Source: Antonio Silva Faleiro,     |

| 1986 - At 10:30 p.m. two men in their thirties, Long and Jandura,     |
| were fishing from a boat on Banksons Lake, Michigan when they had a   |
| close encounter with a completely silent 300 foot long triangular     |
| object that was only 200 feet above the lake. The object had a        |
| brilliant steady white light and three blinking red lights, and there |
| was some type of movement between the lights. The men felt heat       |
| coming from the object and became very shaky and scared. They         |
| also experienced some temporary physiological effects: eye damage,    |
| conjunctivitis, and a swelling and discoloration of the skin. The UFO |
| flew off to the north-northwest after 15 minutes.(Sources: MUFON UFO  |

| 2001 - At 6:00 a.m. EDT a farmer in Wayne, West Virginia encountered  |
| a square flying object, about the size of tire (3 feet wide), that    |
| was hovering inside his barn. It was black with gray markings, and    |
| floated for a few seconds before it flew out the barn door. A cow had |
| been poked by a needle in one of its ears, and its eye had a broken   |
| blood vessel. (Source: George A. Filer, MUFON UFO Journal, October    |

| 2001 - Five geography students camping oin a deserted beach in        |
| Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil, including Luis Carlos Prima, reported       |
| seeing a large disc-shaped object about 10 meters in diameter land on |
| the beach at around two o'clock in the morning. The students had been |
| sleeping when a very strong wind suddenly woke them up. The wind was  |
| so strong that it began to disconnect the ground ties of their tent   |
| from the sandy ground. Thinking it was a storm, they ran out and were |
| confronted by the huge disc, which had numerous bright lights on its  |
| top and windows in the center. A small door quickly opened and two    |
| short humanoids came out. The UFO and the humanoids were about 200    |
| meters away from the witnesses. The little men seemed to be           |
| collecting ground samples when they became aware of the presence of   |
| the students. They ignored them and after several minutes reboarded   |
| the craft, which took off at high speed. Deep ground traces were      |
| found at the landing site. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |
