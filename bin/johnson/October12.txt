| 1954 - A railroad employee, Mr. Laugere, saw a torpedo-shaped,        |
| metallic craft on the ground near a gas/oil tank in Montlucon,        |

| were not understood. The witness went to get his friends, but the     |
| thing had disappeared in the meantime. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying  |
| Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery, p. 167; Jacques Vallee,        |

| 1954 - Jan Marty, age 42, a mechanic, was in his shop in Leguevin,    |
| France when he saw a luminous disc land. It was about 6.5 meters in   |
| diameter and 2.5 meters thick. He tried to approach it, but the craft |
| rose vertically and silently at an amazing speed. (Source: Jacques    |
| Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 226).          |
|                                                                       |
| 1954 - Ste.-Marie d'Herblay, France. Gilbert Lelay, age 13, saw a     |
| phosphorescent cigar-shaped UFO in a pasture and a man standing near  |
| it, wearing a gray suit, boots, and a gray hat. He held a flashing    |
| sphere and told Gilbert in French not to touch it. He went back       |
| inside the craft, which flew in loops and then vanished. (Source:     |
| Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 226).  |

| 1954 - Dompierre-les-Tilleuls, France - Mr. Vielle, a businessman, was |
| on Route N471 between Frasnes and Pontarlier when he saw a circular   |
| flying craft that gave off a yellowish and a purple light. Losing     |
| altitude, the craft came very close to the ground, changed its course |
| to southwest, and then rose again in the sky. (Sources: Aime Michel,  |
| Flying Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery, p. 167; Jacques Vallee, |
| Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 227).                  |

| 1954 - Roger Ramond, a night watchman, saw a great light and noticed  |
| an oval object land 300 meters away in Vielmur, France. It looked     |
| like a fiery orange ball, illuminated the vineyard for nearly 3       |
| hours, then assumed a vertical position, rose slowly, hovered 30      |
| meters above the ground for a few seconds, and took off at fantastic  |
| speed. (Sources: Aime Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight Line    |

| 1963 - At 3:30 a.m. Sr. E. Douglas, while driving a truck through a   |
| violent rainstorm, had to stop when he encountered a large, blinding  |
| object, 35 meters high, from which three giants, three meters tall    |
| emerged. They wore luminous clothes and strange helmets. Douglas took |
| out a gun and fired at them, as a red beam burned him. He ran away    |
| and found shelter in Monte Maiz, Argentina. He suffered burns similar |
| to strong ultraviolet exposure. Very large footprints were found at   |
| the site. "A truck driver was travelling along a lonely road at night |
| during a violent storm when he was suddenly blinded by a vivid white  |
| light which enveloped his vehicle. Simultaneously, he felt a burn on  |
| his face. He then braked but the vehicle skidded, left the road and   |
| became bogged down in the mud. The driver found himself in the        |
| presence of three strange beings with the gait of robots. Nearby he   |
| saw an oval-shaped object with portholes emitting a harsh light.      |
| Picking up his revolver, he fired four shots at the beings, who fled  |
| to the object. It then took off and flew around the truck several     |
| times, each time causing the driver to feel burns all over his body.  |
| Examination by a doctor revealed that the burns were 'curious         |
| lesions' of undetermined cause." (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport   |

| Vehicle Interference Catalog).                                        |

| 1979 - On this night two glowing humanoids about 1.20 meters in       |
| height, that appeared not to have eyes or arms, were seen moving      |
| around in a field in Goiania, Brazil. They moved about with jerky,    |
| mechanical movements. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact    |
