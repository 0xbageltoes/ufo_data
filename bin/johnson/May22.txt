| 1951 - A bluish-white object circled around and paced an American     |
| Airlines flight 100 miles southwest of Dodge City, Kansas at 3:20     |
| a.m. (Source: Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO Encounters, p 13).    |

| 1961 - Over 20 high qualified witnesses including several doctors     |
| watched a 30 meter long metallic ovoid object maneuver at low         |
| altitude in Ocumare del Tuy, Venezuela and then land at 10:30 a.m. A  |
| total of three objects were seen, manuevering silently in and out of  |
| the nearby hills and dodging trees and a low speed. Flattened grass   |
| was found at the landing site. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, September     |

| 1961 - That same afternoon in Texas a stationary silver disc hung in  |
| the air over Tyndall Air Force Base. It was seen by two married       |
| women, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Davis, at 4:30 p.m. The object appeared to |
| be revolving as it hovered. After 15 minutes it finally rose higher   |
| and higher into the air and disappeared. A Project Blue Book          |
| "unknown." (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official      |

| 1962 - Several luminous discs were seen four times in 35 minutes      |
| during an Argentine Navy aircraft flight from Espora Naval Air Base   |
| in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The plane's radio failed         |
| completely during the close encounters. (Sources: Robert Enrique      |

| 1963 - Four pink wheels spun in the sky while flying from the east to |
| the west very fast in succession. They were witnessed by a civilian   |
| named Jackson in Pequannock, New Jersey at 10:50 p.m. (Sources:       |

| 1964 - (1) High School cafeteria employees watched the landing and    |
| take-off of a round UFO from the school grounds in Hopkinsville,      |
| Kentucky at nine o'clock in the morning. The object emitted four      |
| beams of light. The grass had been flattened at the landing site. (2) |
| On that same day a UFO was tracked by radar at the White Sands        |
| Stallion Missile Range in New Mexico. (Source: (1) George D. Fawcett, |

| 1965 - A silent gray object that looked like a blimp or dirigible     |
| hovered low over the New England Power Plant in Salem, Massachusetts  |
| at 5:00 p.m. (Sources: Raymond E. Fowler, case file investigation,    |

| 1967 - On this evening Mr. Tyrode, a 45-year-old school teacher, saw  |
| a glow and then an object shaped like an inverted plate emitting a    |
| greenish-blue light in Evillers, France. It flew less than 20 meters  |
| above his car at at estimated speed of 40 km/hour. (Source: Jacques   |

| 1968 - Sr. T. Banescu of La Florida, Argentina was walking home early |
| in the morning around 3:00 a.m. when he observed a luminous sphere    |
| coming down rapidly from the sky. It landed about 300 meters away.    |
| Shortly after that he heard footsteps behind him but noticed nothing  |
| strange about then. When he got to the house he encountered a         |
| creature no more than 39" tall, with big ears and luminous green in   |
| color. He had his arms crossed and was rocking his body slightly back |
| and forth. Mr. Banescu became frightened and attempted desperately to |
| unlock the door of his house to get away, and when he looked back     |
| again the little man had disappeared. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted  |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1968-27, citing |
| Carlos Banchs).                                                       |

| 1973 - Sr. Onilson Patero, a 40-year-old salesman, was driving home   |
| to Catanduva in Sao Paolo, Brazil during a rainstorm. He had given a  |
| lift to a young hitchhiker and had dropped him off at Itajobi. At     |
| around 3:00 a.m., about seven miles from Catanduva on Highway 321,    |
| his car began to lose power and his car's radio filled with static    |
| interference. He noticed a circle of light moving about inside his    |
| car and he pulled over to the side of the road, thinking a truck was  |
| about to pass. He then saw a hovering object about 50 feet ahead and  |
| 40 feet above the road, and at the same time the interior of his car  |
| began to heat up. Patero felt a lack of air so he opened the door and |
| stepped out. A "curtain of light" began to form around the object,    |
| and the heat and lack of air diminished. He could now see that the    |
| object was not a helicopter. He next saw a "tube of light" hit the    |
| car and, as it did, the car became transparent. He fainted. About an  |
| hour later two young men found Sr. Patero laying in the mud and rain. |
| He recovered consciousness, crying out "they were trying to get me!"  |
| He was taken to a hospital in Catanduva and later released. Over the  |
| next several days he suffered physical ailments of an unknown cause.  |
| Eleven months later Patero became the principal experiencer in an     |
| abduction event in which he vanished for five days, turning up again  |
| in Colatina 700 km away. Under regressive hypnosis he described one   |
| of his abductors as the same individual he had given a ride to in     |
| this case. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue |
| of Humanoid Reports, case 1973-12, citing Dr. Walter Buhler, Dr. Max  |
| Berezovsky, APRO).                                                    |
| 1973 - At eight a.m. Manuel Angle Gonzalez was driving a six-ton      |
| truck loaded with asbestos sheeting, cement, and steel, and he was in |
| the vicinity of the town of Cintalapa in the State of Veracruz,       |
| Mexico when he noticed five little figures standing in the road ahead |
| of him. They had their arms raised in the air, and they seemed to     |
| have appeared from nowhere. He slammed on the truck's brakes and came |
| to a stop only a short distance away from them. At first he thought   |
| they might be children, but close up he could see that they were      |
| perfectly proportioned adults but only two feet tall. They had light  |
| brown skin and black hair, but he couldn't recall any details about   |
| what clothing they were wearing. As he got out of his truck the       |
| little figures began to scatter to the sides of the road,             |
| disappearing into the underbrush along the highway. When he turned to |
| go back to his truck he saw it suddenly engulfed in blue flame, and   |
| in a matter of 30 minutes the truck and its normally non-flammable    |
| contents were reduced to ashes and fused metal. Two other motorists   |
| stopped to witness the conflagration. According to the witness, two   |
| days after the fire metal fragments that had been collected from the  |
| site spontaneously burst into blue flames and were likewise reduced   |
| to ashes. The witness compared the appearance of the little beings to |
| stories of little people from Mexican folklore, called the Chaneques. |
| Investigators later learned that two more trucks were similarly       |
| destroyed and that in one case, UFOs were seen. (Source: David F.     |

| 1996 - Ipswich, Queensland, Australia - At 2:00 a.m. a woman was       |
| walking her dog when she noticed two short glowing beings with no     |
| apparent clothing, and dark eyes. The beings seemed to reassure her   |
| mentally, then faded from view. Possible missing time involved.       |
