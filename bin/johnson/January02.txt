| 1957 – At nine o’clock in the evening in the South Yorkshire town of  |
| West Melton, England two witnesses saw a domed disc-shaped UFO        |
| spinning and rising into the sky. It reversed course and passed       |
| overhead. (Source: Loren E. Gross, The Fifth Horseman of the          |

| 1959 – In Calhoun County, Alabama at 7 p.m. a silent silver globe     |
| hovered and maneuvered over the Anniston Army Ordnance Depot. The UFO |
| made several quick circles in the sky then flew off toward the        |
| southwest. (Source: Project Bluebook files counted in official        |

| 1968 – In Castle Rock, Colorado 12 people saw a transparent bubble    |
| with 12 lights. It hovered fifty feet above the ground, and then shot |
| straight up into the sky, shooting out two balls of flame while doing |
| so. The lights were the color of car headlights covered over with     |
| mud. (Source: Project Bluebook files counted in official statistics). |

| 1968 - Two snowmobile drivers in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada  |
| observed a pulsating, orange-yellow object nearby at 4:00 p.m.. This  |
| object was extremely bright. One of the snowmobile's engines stalled  |
| during the sighting and its driver felt a sensation of increased      |
| heat. The object moved out of sight shortly thereafter and the        |
| snowmobile could be restarted. (Source: Mark Rodeghier, UFO Reports   |

| 1971 – In Valencia, Spain at 2:30 p.m. three silver discs flew        |
| silently in a linear formation at a low altitude. They then tilted    |
| and separated, flying toward the south. Less than three hours later,  |
| at 4:15 GMT, two independent witnesses in Corfton, England saw a      |
| reddish-orange light about the size of a car flutter from side to     |
| side as it descended, leaving behind a black trail of smoke. It       |
| continued to descend vertically, and stopped burning just before it   |
| hit the ground. No traces were found at the site. (Sources: Lumieres  |

| 1973 – In Nowra, New South Wales, Australia at nine o’clock in the     |
| evening five people saw a large disc make a 180-degree turn in the    |
| sky and follow their car. Figures could be seen through windows in    |
| the craft. The craft flew off to the east and out over the sea.       |

| 1975 – At 11:30 p.m. in Arguedas, Spain 30 military witnesses saw a   |
| domed-shaped object on the ground at an Air Force Base. Body lights   |
| were visible on the craft, and the ground was illuminated as the UFO  |
| took off. The sighting lasted four minutes, and ground traces were    |
| found. (Source: Ted Phillips, Skylook, December 1975, p. 16, citing   |

| 1975 – Two hours and fifteen minutes later, at 2:45 p.m. on the       |
| eastern shore of Kauai, Hawaii a married couple took three            |
| photographs of a 25-foot square UFO, flying below the clouds. Mr. and |
| Mrs. Lindstrom reported that the UFO flew off slowly to the           |
| south-southwest. The photographs are regarded by CUFOS as of          |
| excellent quality and reliability. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek Center    |

| 1978 - Four young men were driving home on an isolated road in a flat |
| boggy area called Simonswood Moss in Rainford, England when they      |
| realized they had taken a wrong turn onto a narrow dirt road          |
| bordering a ditch. Suddenly a seven foot tall figure appeared in the  |
| glare of the headlights, eight meters ahead. The being was wearing a  |
| white fluorescent one-piece suit with boots. It had no discernible    |
| facial features and it had very short arms ending in claws. It also   |
| had a box with two flashing red lights on its chest. The figure took  |
| two steps towards the witnesses and stopped. The witnesses panicked,  |
| left the area and drove to a nearby farm where they notified the      |
| authorities. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database    |

| 1978 - A man was sitting in his front room in Gomez Palacio, Mexico   |
| reading late at night when he suddenly looked up to see a tall blond, |
| blue-eyed man in his room. The witness asked, "Who are you?" When he  |
| received no reply he asked, "What are you doing here?" At this point  |
| the stranger, whose body was surrounded by a strange glow, turned     |
| around without touching the floor. The visitor floated through the    |
| doorways of two other rooms and onto the patio at the rear of the     |
| house, followed by the witness. The glow around the man's body        |
| increased and he flew up into the air and out of sight. (Source:      |

| 1979 - Mr. L. M. went to open a window inside his house in Nuoro on   |
| the island of Sardinia, Italy because of the intense humidity when he |
| noticed two short human like figures "floating" ten meters above the  |
| ground outside the building. Startled, he watched the two figures     |
| from his balcony. The two humanoids wore transparent coveralls, like  |
| plexiglass, and under that gray metallic outfits that emitted a       |
| bluish glow. They wore white-colored helmets on their heads with      |
| clear visors. He could see that their faces were normal; very         |
| handsome with large eyes. They also wore white tight-fitting boots    |
| and had a dark cylinder shaped "container" around their waists.       |
| During the encounter the witness felt chills. As the beings           |
| approached the house they smiled at the witness and were soon lost    |
| from sight in the distance. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid      |

| 1995 – At around midnight in Durham, England a woman driving on a     |
| highway noticed her car lose power. At the same time, a short         |

| oval-shaped eyes. It crossed the road in an “odd” way, only six feet  |
| away from her car. (Source: UFO Newsclipping Service, June 1995).     |

| 1997 - On this afternoon in Campina Grande do Sul, Brazil a woman     |
| waiting for a bus heard a loud roaring sound resembling that of a     |
| lion. Moments later she heard what sounded like "heavy steps          |
| splashing in water." She next saw a dark round form that flew right   |
| over her street. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact         |

| a road in Corralito, Argentina in the early morning hours. The UFO    |

| car headlights by “turning off.” A local power failure was reported   |
| at the same time. (Source: UFO Magazine (USA), April 2001, p. 20,     |
