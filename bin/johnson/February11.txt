| 1972 - On this evening two 13-year old boys named Akkan and Green in  |
| Loughborough, Leicester, England noticed a square object in the sky   |
| with a central red light and four white corner lights, as their train |
| pulled out of the railway station. It hovered over a nearby field,    |
| and directed powerful light beams down onto the field. (Source: Mrs.  |

| 24-year-old credit manager was driving near the shore in Apollo       |
| Beach, Florida when a 16 meter wide disc flew 30 meters ahead of his  |
| car at just 120 meters altitude. It was about 50 to 60 feet in        |
| diameter with a series of windows about the size of a door around its |
| girth. The windows were lit and the light behind them was revolving.  |
| It flew off toward the west. (Source: NICAP UFO Investigator, April   |

| 1980 - At around 4 p.m. a woman in Bisuschio, Italy went outside to   |
| hang some linen to dry and was looking towards a nearby hill when she |
| saw a strange dwarf creature in a tree about 50 meters away. He was   |
| about 30-40 cm tall, and was wearing black clothing. She went back    |
| inside and looked at the creature again out a window, at the same     |
| time calling her son to come see. She also called her mother in-law   |
| on the telephone. The boy observed the tree with a pair of binoculars |
| but was unable to distinguish any additional features. The being      |
| appeared to move from branch to branch, and then seemed to stand on a |
| very thin branch that appeared incapable of supporting his weight.    |
| The humanoid looked to be trying to conceal his face with his hand.   |
| He soon disappeared from sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |
| Contact Database 1980, citing Denys Breysse, Project Becassine).      |

| 1980 - In Botafuegos, Spain later that same night five witnesses,     |
| including Rafael Tobajas, spotted a low flying whitish-orange         |
| luminous object lifting off from some nearby woods. Minutes later the |
| object divided into three separate luminous sections, then re-united  |
| again into one luminous spot. Using a pair of binoculars, they        |
| watched the lighted object descend in a falling leaf motion. Near the |
| ground two huge man-like silhouettes appeared in front of the lights. |
| They were grayish in color and over three meters in height. They made |
| huge leaps and strides over the ground, jumping easily over           |
| obstacles, but they seemed to move in slow motion and stayed in front |
| of the luminous orbs of lights. According to Tobajas, the humanoid    |
| forms stopped briefly by a small creek and seemed to bend down        |
| several times. The humanoids suddenly began running at witnesses, who |
| became terrified and drove away frantically from the area. The tall   |
| gray humanoid forms persisted in chasing the witness's vehicle for    |
| several minutes. Tobajas reportedly encountered similar humanoid      |
| figures at night, one year later. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,         |
| Humanoid Contact Database 1980, citing Dr. Jimenez del Oso and J. J.  |
| Benitez).                                                             |

| 1980 - At 10:00 p.m. Carlos Vommaro, age 22, was driving home from    |
| dinner at his girlfriend's house westbound on Route 22 between the    |
| towns of Ingeniero Huergo and Cervantes in Rio Negro province,        |
| Argentina when he noticed a strong glowly light over a field 200      |
| meters away, on the left side of his truck and at about 30 meters     |
| altitude. He described the object as having two big "L" structures    |
| with a luminous rectangular form inside. The edges of the luminous    |
| "L's" seemed to be covered in a diffused vapor that seemed to reflect |
| the light. Perplexed, Vommaro watched the object as it came parallel  |
| to him. Vommaro then decided to escape, speeding up to about 60 mph   |
| when suddenly everything around him became dark and he blacked        |
| out. When Vommaro woke up he found himself leaning over the steering  |
| wheel. The light was now on top of the vehicle, and suddenly from the |
| area of the luminous rectangular area a beam of light shot out, which |
| seemed to spread out in width the further away it got. The beam of    |
| light covered the vehicle, but not its interior; it seems to be       |
| stronger at the point of origin. Terrified, Vommaro jumped out of his |
| vehicle, running for help but the road is completely deserted. A      |
| couple of minutes later he saw a car approaching from the direction   |
| of General Roca, and he frantically tried to flag down the car. The   |
| car slowed down briefly, but then sped away. Perhaps the approaching  |
| driver had seen the luminous object still hovering above the road.    |
| After coming to his senses Vommaro now realized he was outside of the |
| town of Cervantes, located more than 15 km away from were he had      |
| been, and he has about an hour of missing time he can't account for.  |
| When he got home his dogs reacted strangely, did not seem to          |
| recognize him, and attempted to attack him. The next day he suffered  |
| from lack of appetite, weakness, lumbar back pain, and leg pain.      |
| There was also some damage to his car. There were numerous other UFO  |
| reports that evening from Argentina and Chile. (Sources: Jane Thomas, |

| 1988 - Beginning at 6:09 p.m. the pilot, Simplicio Pinto, and crew of |
| a LAM Boeing 737 airliner witnessed a hovering object with intense    |
| lights like searchlights arranged in a triangle, off the coast of     |
| Beira, Mozambique. The object seemed to be a huge box-shaped craft    |
| with three lights, which hovered for more than an hour, and then      |
| climbed vertically out of sight. The object was tracked on radar.     |

| 1989 - Two men were recording music in their apartment in Levittown,  |
| New York at around 9:00 p.m. when they began to hear strange noises   |
| coming from outside. Going to a window, they saw two US government    |
| helicopters hovering overhead. They then saw two more flying in       |
| tandem, and between them was a huge, shiny metallic object with       |
| multicolored lights. Both witnesses ran outside, jumped into their    |
| car, and began following the UFO and the mystery helicopters. Once on |
| the expressway the helicopters left and the giant object turned into  |
| a ball of fire before their eyes. Both witnesses then suffered a      |
| blackout. When they recovered they realized they were now driving     |
| towards the entrance of a bridge. Later, one man recalled being in a  |
| room with several short humanoids with large black eyes. He also      |
| claimed seeing numerous symbols resembling hieroglyphics. (Sources:   |

| 1989 - A woman at home on a foggy evening in San Antonio, Texas was   |
| attracted by a humming sound she heard outside at 11:15 p.m. She then |
| saw a hovering orange, oval-shaped disc that emitted a strong blue    |
| beam of light. The beam of light extinguished the closest street      |
| light. The next odd thing that happened is that a firetruck appeared  |
| driving down her street. (Sources: Robert E. Morgan, MUFON field      |

| 1995 - At around 4:00 a.m. four companions who had gone on a fishing  |
| expedition had stopped on the roadside near San Antonia Oeste,        |
| Argentina after becoming too sleepy to continue driving. They woke up |
| with sketchy memories of being visited by several short, hairless     |
| beings who wore luminous white suits and had apparently taken them    |
| away for physical examinations. The primary witness felt pain in her  |
| left arm. They also realized that their vehicle was parked at a       |
| different spot than it had been parked, that was miles away from the  |
| original site. Under hypnosis one of the younger witnesses remembered |
| the little men had been accompanied by a tall, heavyset being, with   |
| large eyes, a baldhead, long arms, wearing a gray outfit. The tall    |
| being was the one apparently in charge, and directed the activities   |
| of the little men. Another member of the group remembered being       |
| floated out of the vehicle into a dark place. The primary witness     |
| also remembered several tall female beings performing some type of    |
| operation on her left arm. Locals reported seeing luminous objects in |
| the sky around the same time. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |

| It looked like a formation of triangles going in the same direction   |
| with a hazy, "flag like" outer shell waving like a flag in the middle |
| of the ocean, with air distortion due to heat. At first one witness   |
| thought it was a flock of birds, but dismissed the idea because his   |
| friend, who lived there, said"there aren't any birds out here at this |
| time of night". It went behind a small cloud, but didn't come out the |
| opposite side. (Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting       |

| 2011 - At 7:14 p.m. two witnesses driving in Elkton, Kentucky saw a   |
| flying object that first looked like a radio tower with a flashing    |
| light in the middle of two other lights. As they got closer it looked |
| like a cigar-shaped object. However, when it started to move it       |
| changed shape into an oval shape, then it turned and came straight at |
| them. As it flew over they saw three lights on the object, one        |
| flashing, and it again changed its shape into a diamond. At this      |
| point there were there were four lights on the bottom of the object,  |
| which appeared to be 15 feet wide and about 10 feet long. As it       |
| hovered and flew away it again changed shape into a flying disk.      |
