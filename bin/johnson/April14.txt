| 1897 - This was the day before the peak date in a wave of "airship"  |
| sightings around the United States and Canada. There were 48 reports  |
| of "airships" on this day, including 13 in Michigan alone. Below are  |
| summarized two of the more interesting cases involving occupants.     |
|                                                                       |
| 1897 - At three o'clock in the afternoon in Gas City, Indiana an      |
| object landed two kilometers south of Gas City on the property of     |
| John Roush, terrifying the farmers and causing the horses and cattle  |
| to stampede. Six occupants of the ship came out and seemed to make    |
| some repairs. Before the crowd could approach the object, it rose     |
| rapidly and flew toward the east. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport   |
| to Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 182, citing Chicago Chronicle,  |
| April 15, 1897).                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 1897 - Joseph Singler, captain of the "Sea Wing", was fishing on Lake |
| Erie near Cleveland, Ohio with S. H. Davis, of Detroit, Michigan when |
| they saw what they thought was a ship, about 13 meters long, with a   |
| canopy. A man, looking to be about 25 years old, wearing a hunting    |
| jacket and a cap, was fishing from the deck of the object. Near him   |
| were a woman and a 10-year-old child. When the "Sea Wing" came close  |
| to the craft, a large, colored "balloon" rose from the object, which  |
| flew up with it to an altitude of about 150 meters and circled "like  |
| a hawk" before flying away. (Source: Jacques Vallee, Passport to      |
| Magonia: A Century of Landings, p. 182, citing the Chicago Tribune,   |
| April 16, 1897).                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| 1967 - At 9:00 p.m. a motorist driving near Melville, New York saw a  |
| glowing object overhead. Suddenly his car engine stalled and a        |
| smaller circular metallic object landed besides the road. His car     |
| radio, which had been turned off, began broadcasting in a strange     |
| language. A tiny metallic robot-like figure appeared in the doorway   |
| of the object. It came out and dug up some dirt and then placed it    |
| inside the craft. The doorway then closed and the object turned a     |
| bright red color as it rose into the sky, emitting a whirring sound.  |
| It appeared to join the large glowing craft overhead. (Source: Mark   |

| 1971 - At around 8:00 p.m. Marion L. and Dennis D., an engaged        |
| couple, were driving near Evans City, Pennsylvania when they saw a    |
| yellow white light drop behind a nearby hill. They drove to the       |
| location on a dirt road and found a luminous object hovering just     |
| above the ground over a ploughed field, 80 yards away. It was 25-30   |
| feet in diameter and shaped like a large bowl inverted over a smaller |
| one. It had a series of rectangular, vertical windows in the upper    |
| half and round portholes below the rim. There was a red flickering    |
| glow from one of the upper windows, and Miss L. perceived two human   |
| like figures silhouetted in them. The figures appeared to be very     |
| tall, perhaps about 10 feet in height. Frightened, they drove away    |
| quickly. (Source: David F. Webb and Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue   |
