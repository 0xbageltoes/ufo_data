| 1954 - On this night near Caracas, Venezuela Sr. Emelino Martinez was |
| walking back from hunting in the hills outside of the city when there |
| was a sudden movement in the nearby bushes. Martinez stopped and      |
| stood motionless, shotgun at the ready, when the thrashing noise      |
| happened again. He waited briefly before resuming his walk toward his |
| parked automobile. He next heard a blood curling guttural noise.      |
| Terrified, he dropped his day's catch and ran for his car. An         |
| unintelligible shout behind him indicated that whatever creature it   |
| was, it was close to him. He stopped for an instant to glance back    |
| toward his pursuer. He then saw two bizarre creatures running after   |
| him. They were short, and looked like a half man, half monkey. They   |
| were covered with dark hair. Martinez reached the car fumbling with   |
| his pockets for the keys. He dropped the keys and picked them up and  |
| attempted to open the car. He was then suddenly grabbed from behind.  |
| He fell together with his assailant into a ditch besides the road. He |
| dropped his shotgun as two powerful arms closed over his throat. He   |
| managed to break free and scrambled towards the car. The creature     |
| jumped on top of him, screaming, growling, and biting like a mad      |
| animal. He could not reach his shotgun, so he grabbed a large rock    |
| and repeatedly smashed his attacker on the head. Screams of pain      |
| slashed through the dark night.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| Martinez saw his attacker move backward, blood spurting from his head |
| wounds. He then dashed to his car. He snapped the door locked as the  |
| two creatures lunged against the car, pounding their hairy fists      |
| against the windows in frustrated rage. He managed to start the car   |
| and drove away at very high speed directly to the police station. The |
| next day, Martinez and some friends returned to the site and          |
| recovered his shotgun they also found some blood stained leaves. They |
| questioned locals and were told that strange disc shaped objects had  |
| been seen in the area and that; cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, and two    |
| young farmhands had disappeared on the mountain. The farmers have     |
| also seen black, bristly haired dwarfs that hid in caves and          |
| kidnapped both livestock and humans. Martinez never returned to the   |
| area to hunt again. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact      |

| 1968 - At 9:00 p.m. two groups of three bright lights flew in a       |
| triangular formation over Ipswich, Massachusetts. They swung in a     |
| pendulum motion and changed colors from red to blue to green to       |
| white. They made no sound. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler Raymond, UFOs:  |

| 1969 - At ten o’clock in the evening, in the midst of a flurry of UFO |
| sightings in various regions of Brazil, student Marco Antonio von     |
| Kruger in Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais state, Brazil noticed interference |
| on his TV. He looked out his window and saw a “vague shape in         |
| movement” and also heard garbage cans being overturned. The next day  |
| he found that someone or some creature had been rummaging through the |
| garbage cans. At about the same time that Marco reported his          |
| observation, a worker returning home not far from Marco’s home        |
| observed an enormous round UFO hovering near the ground from which    |
| came “strange measured, muffled sounds.” (Source: David F. Webb and   |
| Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1969-30,    |
| citing FSR Case Histories # 6).                                       |

| 1973 - A woman driving along US highway 1 in southern Rhode Island    |
| saw a reddish-orange object move toward her car, then pass directly   |
| overhead. He car lights dimmed and the engine faltered. The object    |
| was estimated to be 42 feet in diameter, and was surrounded by a      |
| green haze. (Source: Donald R. Todd, APRO Bulletin, May-June 1973, p. |
| 9).                                                                   |

| 1974 - The witness, Mr. Smith, had just left work shortly after       |
| midnight and was driving toward Waterville, Ohio on Rte. 64 when his  |
| motor and lights died near the town of Whitehouse, Ohio. He got out   |
| of the car and noticed a car behind him stop. The driver, normally    |
| dressed and with gray hair, approached and offered the witness        |
| "proof" of his extraordinary powers by dematerializing a rock with a  |
| small, hand held device. He then told the witness to he should save   |
| his marriage, and promised subsequent "contacts." (Sources: Ted       |

| 1978 - A police officer at a stakeout for animal mutilators sighted a |
| silent, 12 foot long red-glowing cylinder at 5:20 a.m. in Goochland,  |
| Virginia float away from a pasture. It flew sideways at 20 feet       |
| altitude. (Sources: MUFON UFO Journal, April 1988; Larry Hatch, U     |

| 1980 - At 9:30 p.m. a hovering red disc-shaped object searched the    |
| ground in Lincolnton, North Carolina with a beam of light, then took  |
| off at a 45 degree angle, making an intense humming sound. A red      |
| sphere was seen later south of town at treetop level. There were      |
| three witnesses. (Sources: Richard Hall, MUFON UFO Journal, September |
| 1980; Richard Hall, The UFO Evidence, Volume II: A Thirty Year        |
| Report, p. 25).                                                       |

| 1989 - On this night in Dibich, Bulgaria the witness of a previous    |
| UFO close encounter was visited at home by an undescribed "evil"      |
| being who was accompanied by a fireball-like object and a huge hairy  |
| humanoid. The visitor allegedly wanted to "take possession" of the    |
| witness's soul. She resisted but was visited several more times after |
| this date by the same beings. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid    |
| Contact Database 1989, case # 719, citing Richard F. Haines, Joint    |
| USA-CIS Aerial Anomaly Federation Report).                            |

| 1998 - At 9:07 p.m. a triangular-shaped UFO was seen in the           |
| southwestern sky in Pueblo, Colorado. It zigzagged in flight, and     |
| then scanned the area with a beam of light. It circled passenger jet, |
| then changed shape, dividing into different colors. (Source: Curt     |
| Sutherly, UFO Mysteries: A Reporter Seeks the Truth, p. 203, citing   |
