| 1922 - John Morris and William James in Barmouth, Wales saw an object |
| fall into the ocean so slowly that they thought it might have been an |
| airplane. A boat was sent out but nothing was found. (Source: Jacques |

| 1966 - At 9:00 p.m. a man in Franklin Springs, New York saw a solid   |
| object, larger than an Army tank, descend from a cloud bank, slow     |

| described a close encounter with a UFO at Itaipu Beach near Niteroi,  |
| Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. It was a disc-shaped craft emitting     |
| orange light, and it made several low-level passes over the beach     |
| before briefly landing. One witness, Professor Sohail Saud, said he   |
| saw occupants inside the object, who were wearing helmets. Others     |
| said the object hovered 10 meters above the water, emitting a soft    |
| hum and spinning on its axis. (Sources: Walter Buhler, FSR Case       |

| 1973 - Mr. and Mrs Ron McClure and seven others were watching for     |
| UFOs on Cradle Hill, in Warminster, England. At around 2:00 a.m. they |
| saw an orange ball descend behind a copse. Walking toward the copse   |
| they encountered a man between 6.5 and 7 feet tall. He was wearing a  |
| two-piece garment of dark green denim like material with an "anorak"  |
| type hood that almost completely covered his face. He held a silver   |
| object resembling a flashlight. The man shouted in a resonant voice;  |
| "Move on! Go away!" McClure shouted, "Will you harm us?" There was no |
| reply, he then asked, "Will you come back?" The answer was "Yes."     |
| Another member of the group followed this man into the copse, where   |
| he vanished while the witness attention was diverted for a moment.    |

| 1978 - There were three reports from Benevides, Para State, Brazil on |
| this evening. At 7:20 p.m. a reddish-yellow light flew southwest to   |
| northwest at 12,000 feet altitude, 400 km/h, with a curving           |
| trajectory; it went out 2/3rds of way across the sky. At 8:25 p.m.    |
| another reddish-yellow light flew southwest to northeast at 9,000     |
| feet altitude, emitting blue light rays; when overhead the light went |
| out. At 9:10 p.m. a third reddish-yellow light was seen zigzagging    |
| from the southeast to the west at medium speed, 4000 feet altitude;   |
| it emitted two very strong flashes of blue light, and then went away  |
| at great speed. (Source: Bob Pratt, Operacao Prato, p. 55).           |

| 1979 - "Gee, that looks like a flying saucer," thought the            |
| 38-year-old witness in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois when he         |
| observed a silver disc moving directly overhead at 4:30 in the        |
| afternoon. His neighbors and the members of his family agreed. The    |
| silver disc had a black center on the underside and was distinct      |
| against the clear blue sky. Its angular size was about half that of   |
| the full moon. There was no noise as it moved south to northeast at   |
| high altitude. (Source: Allan Hendry, International UFO Reporter,     |

| 1994 - On his way to work at 2:55 pm, driving 45 mph on highway 54    |
| between Sharkey and Bloomfield, Indiana and with no other cars on the |
| road, a 56-year-old man saw a gray, disc-shaped object pass           |
| silently in front of his vehicle from left to right. It "made a wide  |
| sweeping turn to the east" and went out of sight in 5 seconds. He     |
| estimated in flew at 300 mph, at only 300 feet altitude, and came     |
| within 500 feet of him. Later, military jets came over the area.      |

| witnesses driving on US Highway 36. It emitted smaller luminous       |

| 1997 - At eleven o'clock at night a woman stepped out of her mobile   |
| home onto her lattice-enclosed patio in Marshalltown, Iowa to get     |
| some fresh air. She sighted an object that was either landed on or    |
| hovering above her nextdoor neighbor's mobile home roof. She could    |
| see a large curved window with a thin strip down the middle, and      |
| there was a bright spotlight shining from the lower front of the      |
| object. She heard no sound. She then noticed a "pilot" with something |
| like a form-fitting hood over his head, motionless. She could not     |
| distinguish any features. Two doors then swung open in the craft and  |
| several small entities exited. She could not see their shapes or how  |
| they moved. The bright light was directed at her and she thought she  |
| was being watched. Frightened, she went back inside her house and     |
| noticed that the beam was now illuminating the interior. She          |
| continued to watch the UFO as it moved around the trailer court,      |
| occasionally stopping, hovering, and shining its light on various     |
| mobile homes. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database   |

| 70 centimeters tall and had a large head, large glowing eyes, and big |
| ears. Over 10 residents of Huay Nam Rak Village in Mae Chan           |

| morning in a rice paddy outside the village, and that he levitated or |
| floated up into the sky when discovered. They insisted that what they |

| conjectured by the news media. (Sources: The Nation (Bangkok,         |
