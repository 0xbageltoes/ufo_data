| Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean, including Second Officer A. H. Raymer,  |
| saw a huge, dark object bearing two lights in the sea ahead. It was   |

| 1949 - At six o'clock in the morning several independent observers in |
| Montecarotto, Italy watched an eight meter long cigar-shaped object   |
| as it flew 100 meters overhead towards the north-northeast. Tree      |
| branches thrashed about as it passed by. (Source: Solas Boncompagni,  |

| 1956 - A bright red-orange object was seen by a B-52 crew flying over |
| North Dakota. At same time a missile maintenance man at Minot AFB saw |
| the same or a similar bright orange-red UFO. The B-52 was vectored    |
| closer by the base which was tracking the object on radar, some 30    |
| miles to the northwest of the base. The search for the UFO, which may |
| have landed, was complicated by a period of unexplained radio         |
| interference. (Sources: J. Allen Hynek, Hynek UFO Report, p. 137;     |

| Adelaide, South Australia with her three children at 7:30 p.m. when   |
| an ovoid object with windows surrounded by a luminous rim landed near |
| the road on three legs. A six foot tall man emerged from the object   |
| and descended some steps to the ground. He was wearing a uniform,     |
| helmet and gas mask. She watched him for 40 minutes, and reported he  |
| seemed to be working on the landing gear. He then put some plants     |
| into a silver colored box and carried them back onboard. The object   |
| made a vertical takeoff when it left. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,       |

| next red lights, and then two rings of red flashing lights on the     |
| object. It hovered at a low altitude, flattening the high grass and   |
| bending over small trees. It was less than 75 feet from them. The     |
| craft was estimated to be between 30 to 50 feet in diameter with      |
| luminous white panels around the circumference and lights on the top  |
| and bottom. (Sources: APRO Bulletin, September-October 1969, p. 1;    |

| 1971 - At 5:45 p.m. several people on a bus in North Montreal, Quebec |
| saw an ovoid UFO that followed their bus, going north. It stopped     |
| near a power station, and a power outage resulted. At 8:30 p.m.       |

| 1971 - On this night Sally Pike was on a UFO watch on Cradle Hill,    |
| Warminster, England when she suddenly and inexplicably became         |
| apprehensive. Upon turning around, she saw, very clearly, the outline |
| of a tall male figure striding up the road in the bright moonlight.   |
| The figure was about seven-foot tall, with extremely long arms, which |
| hung limply at his sides. He seemed to have no neck, and his head     |
| appeared to rise directly from his shoulders. The body itself was     |
| almost transparent, with only the outline being solid. Later that     |
| same night, Neil Pike also was on watch near some white metal gates,  |
| and looked over to the road leading up to a military vedette post. He |
| became aware of three giant figures standing in a line near the       |
| opposite hedgerow. His description was similar to his wife's, except  |
| that the bodies ended at the mid-section and he could not discern any |
| legs. Startled, he shone the beam of his flashlight at one of the     |
| tall figures. Immediately it vanished, only to reappear at another    |
| spot nearer to him. He flashed the flashlight on the other two and    |
| the same thing happened. They were now much closer to him. Alone on   |
| the hill, he panicked and ran to his car, got in, and quickly sped    |
| away. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 1971 Humanoid Sighting Reports      |

| encountered a multicolored, humming domed disc at his military base   |
| on Isla de Lobos, Rocha province, Uruguay and pointed his gun at      |
| three entities he saw on the ground. The entities were wearing        |
| rubber-like black diver suits, and the backs of their heads were      |
| elongated, as if they were wearing hoods. He was paralyzed when he    |
| did this. A blinding flash occurred when the object took off, then it |
| flew away silently. (Sources: UNICAT database, case # 454, citing     |

| 1973 - Dionisio Llanca, age 25, was changing a tire along a deserted  |
| road at 1:15 a.m. near Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina |
| when he became aware of a yellow and blue light behind him, and three |
| human-like beings. He then began to feel weak and barely able to      |
| move. One of the beings approached and pulled him to his feet, and a  |
| second one drew a blood sample from his finger with a device that     |
| looked like an electric shaver. Afterward, the witness lost           |
| consciousness and suffered trauma to his head and forehead. Under     |
| hypnosis and sodium pentothal Llanca recalled being transported onto  |
| a hovering, plate-shaped craft via a beam of light. He saw a room     |
| with a window and various instruments, including a screen showing a   |
| display of the stars. His abductors were two men and two women,       |
| between 5 ft. 6 in. and 5 ft. 8 in. (about 1.7m) tall. They had blond |
| hair, wide foreheads, and elongated eyes. They were dressed in gray,  |
| tight-fighting uniforms, yellow footwear, and gloves. The beings      |
| spoke among themselves in a "squeaky" language, resembling the sound  |
| of buzzing bees. A technical device communicated with him in Spanish, |
| or by telepathy, to reassure him and tell him that they had been      |
| coming to Earth since 1950. They told him he was chosen for contact   |
| because he was simple and good. They warned that the current course   |
| of mankind would lead to catastrophe. Later, they said, they would    |
| come back and take him with them. Llanca regained consciousness       |
| between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., some 10 km (6 miles) from where his truck  |
| was. He wandered around with no memory of his own identity until a    |
| passerby took him to a hospital, where he remained for several days.  |
|                                                                       |
| Llanca had nightmares and severe anxiety for a prolonged period,      |
| followed by personality change. He changed jobs frequently and        |
| finally stopping working altogether, became engaged to be married and |
| then cut off all contact with his fiancee. His parents rejected him,  |
| and he subsequently was sentenced to prison for swindling.            |
| Afterwards, there were rumors that he had fabricated the story to     |
| sell a book, and that the doctors were a party to the hoax (which     |
| seems highly unlikely). (Sources: Richard H. Hall, The UFO Evidence,  |

| 1973 - In the early morning hours Ms. Proctor went to the window in   |
| her home in Reno, Nevada and saw three "very large," saucer-shaped    |
| objects hovering across the street. A "ground crew" of 10-12 figures, |
| wearing dully glowing "cube type" uniforms, were milling around, as   |
| if searching for something. A very low-pitched hum was heard, but no  |
| barking by the witness's dog, or others in the neighborhood. When two |
| of the men approached her driveway, the witness took alarm and        |
| returned to bed, where she fell asleep immediately. There was no      |
| confirmation of anything unusual from any of her neighbors, and no    |

| 1976 - On this evening a 600 foot diameter aerial craft allegedly     |
| settled over a small mountain near Guadalajara, Mexico causing cars   |
| in the area to experience electrical failure. When the cars stopped,  |
| the drivers got out and stood watching the craft making various       |
| maneuvers. After the UFO sighting a person who claimed to be from the |
| "spaceship" asked for a medical examination at the clinic of an       |
| eminent and respected 43-year-old doctor. The doctor did perform the  |
| exam and was shocked at his appearance. His skin was milky white, and |
| apart from a few black strands on his head there was no other hair on |
| his body. He insisted that humans on our planet were very low on the  |
| scale of evolutionary development, and that we had yet to discover    |
| the three more planets that exist in our solar system.  (Sources:     |

| 1976 - From the porch of their house Richard Britt and his            |
| 12-year-old son Richie saw a luminous domed disc-shaped object flying |
| horizontally over some woods in Lake View, near Dillon, Florence      |
| County, South Carolina at 10:30 p.m. It began hovering close to the   |
| ground. It went out of sight for a short while and Britt went         |
| indoors, but his son Richie continued to watch. The object            |
| reappeared, rotating and emitting red, green, and blue lights. Then   |
| it flew down towards Richie and stopped near the porch. Now it began  |
| to give off a white light. The craft was aluminum colored, about the  |
| size of a large automobile, and had a set of small triangular windows |
| above, which formed one large triangular window. In this window stood |
| a being with pale white skin, apparently unclothed,with no other      |
| facial features except two large dark eyes. It had no neck, and its   |
| hands were claw-like. Richie began to scream for his father, but when |
| his father rushed out there was nothing left to see. Richie had to be |
| treated for hysteria, and he could not talk about what he had seen    |
| until the next morning. In the morning Mr. Britt noticed a 15 x 20    |
| foot area in front of the porch where there was no frost on the       |
| grass. (Sources: Florence (SC) Morning News, November 11, 1976; David |

| 1989 - At 2:30 p.m. several young students, among then Vova Startsev, |
| saw a large pink sphere that flew over a local park in Voronezh,      |
| Russia. The sphere kept changing it shading, and it had two antennae  |
| on its left side. The sphere pushed out four legs and landed. A hatch |
| opened and a ladder came down. Soon two beings and a robot like       |
| entity came out. The two beings carried the robot, set him down on    |
| its feet and appeared to give him mouth-to-mouth respiration. The     |
| robot then began walking like a normal human. The robot walked up to  |
| one of the young witnesses, followed by the two other aliens. The     |
| robot stretched out its hand towards the witness but he ran up a tree |
| and hid, shaking with fear. The robot was just under six feet tall,   |
| and had a large head with three eyes in a row. Another witness,       |
| Sergei Makarov, got a close look at the other two aliens, whom he     |
| described as wearing silvery suits, silver waistcoats, with silver    |
| buttons and boots. Their faces were dark, and their skin was very     |
| smooth. When the door of the object opened there was a blinding light |
| that came out. As the young witnesses watched, the legs retracted on  |
| the object, it, and then rose up, hovered briefly, and finally flew   |
| away quickly. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database   |

| from a fog. As it hovered, one of them mentally called to it to come  |
| closer, and it approached to within 50 feet. The second man, however, |
| panicked and "freaked out", shooting his rifle at the object. The UFO |
| then went overhead, and as it did it levitated the pickup truck and   |
| dropped it in a bar ditch. (Source: Christopher O'Brien, The          |

| England at 1:00 a.m. and was walking along Duckworth Street when he   |
| heard a sound like a moan and then saw a flash of light that          |
| temporarily blinded him. When his vision returned he was inside a     |
| capsule-shaped craft. The inside of the capsule was dull and          |
| featureless. Inside he was met by a tall being who had no ears nor    |
| mouth and a metallic gray hue, but otherwise humanoid in appearance.  |
| It had tiny eyes that seemed to penetrate the witness's mind. On one  |
| side there was a control panel with shiny knobs, which flashed        |
| silver as he approached them. There were no windows or door seals.    |
| There was also a constant vibrating hum in the air. In the center of  |
| the capsule the abductee saw a large rotating silver cube that seemed |
| to defy gravity. The cube changed color to red, and then some strange |
