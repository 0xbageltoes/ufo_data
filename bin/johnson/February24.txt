| 1950 - At 1:15 p.m. 16 A.E.S.S. inspectors watched an aluminum        |
| colored, round UFO hovering over Los Alamos, New Mexico. It moved     |
| around for 20 minutes as if observing the nuclear facility,           |
| zigzagged, and shot straight up in the sky. At 1:55 p.m. two          |
| Albuquerque, New Mexico Municipal Airport Weather Observers, Luther   |
| McDonald and Harrison Manson, watched a white, slightly elongated     |
| oval-shaped UFO for 90 seconds through a theodolite while it flew     |
| straight and level. (Sources: (1) Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History.    |

| 1952 - A bright blue cylindrical object approached a B-29 flying over |
| Antung, Korea at 11:15 p.m. It had a pulsating exhaust trail three    |
| times the length of the object. When it came within 3,000 feet it     |
| emitted a luminous beam of light. (Source: Project Grudge Report #4,  |

| 1953 - On this evening Warrant Officer and Mrs. Alden saw two bright  |
| red, round objects with big halos fly in small circles over Sherman,  |
| Texas at 7:43 p.m. The UFO climbed and then faded out over a 3-7      |
| second interval. (Source: Don Berliner, Project Bluebook UFO          |

| 1955 - On this morning a cyclist riding his bicycle in Broadlands,    |
| Hampshire, England saw a man wearing blue coveralls signal him to     |
| stop. The man then grabbed the witness by his hand, and using         |
| telepathy invited him to board a UFO hovering above a nearby field.   |
| The man accepted the invitation and was allegedly flown on a trip to  |
| see the pyramids in Egypt. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |
| Contact Database, case # 858, citing Flying Saucer Review).           |

| 1958 - In the early morning predawn hours Dr. C. da Costa and two     |
| others were traveling by car in Conceicao Almeida, Brazil when their  |
| engine stalled near Santo Antonio de Jesus. It could not be           |
| re-started, and although they got out of the car to check the engine  |
| they could find nothing wrong, so they decided to sleep in the car. A |
| short while later, at 3:05 a.m., a very large blue silvery            |
| disc-shaped object appeared with a flat ring spinning at high speed   |
| around the middle of the craft. It descended towards the ground a     |
| pendulum motion. Two of the men walked toward it, at which point it   |
| rose up to about 600 feet in altitude. The UFO then began a series of |
| high-speed maneuvers, finally disappearing at 4:35 a.m. The car still |
| would not start. At 6:30 a.m. the UFO appeared once more, looking     |
| silvery in color and hovering at a low altitude. It then shot away,   |
| vanishing almost instantly, and the witnesses' car could be started   |
| easily. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of   |

| 1959 - At 8:45 p.m. American Airlines pilot Capt. Killian on Flight   |
| 937 sighted three bright yellow-orange maneuvering lights, changing   |
| colors, above the cloud layer while flying over Philipsburg and       |
| Bradford, Pennsylvania. His co-pilot also sighted the lights, and up  |
| to 37 other witnesses from Pan American and United Airlines flights   |
| also reported seeing the unusual lights. (Sources: NICAP UFO          |

| 1959 - At 9:10 p.m. in Victorville, California two young men reported |
| that a red egg shaped object made five passes over their house, which |
| is located eight miles from George AFB. Their pet dogs began howling  |
| and ran to get inside the house. They also reported that the UFO      |
| caused radio interference. and made a humming sound. (Sources: Loren  |

| 1963 - A luminous bluish-silver colored ovoid UFO was seen over       |
| Invercargill, New Zealand at 1:00 a.m., making a whine and humming    |
| sounds. One witness attempted to chase the object in a car. (Source:  |

| 1975 - Two young men witnessed a 60-foot wide disc-shaped UFO         |
| hovering over a nearby field in Enfield, Connecticut at 9:50 p.m. The |
| UFO effected their TV reception, and their dogs howled in the         |
| presence of the object. (Source: E. Jahn, field investigator, CUFOS   |

| 1976 - A six meter in diameter domed disc hovered over a road in      |
| Stratham, New Hampshire at 9:37 p.m. There were four legs on the      |
| bottom of the craft, and it was silent. (Source: Raymond E. Fowler,   |

| 1977 - At 3:00 a.m. Lothar Schaefler saw a cigar-shaped object        |
| carrying four very bright lights land about 150 feet away in          |
| Langernargen Bodense, Germany. The object emitted an extremely        |
| high-pitched, piercing tone of constant intensity. Lothar ran along   |
| the outside wall of his kitchen and threw himself on the ground       |
| behind some small bushes in front of the backyard fence. The whole    |
| area was brilliantly lit now. Next Lothar heard a short whistling     |
| sound, and felt a slight draft of air. He saw, appearing from         |
| nowhere, two strange alie- looking beings directly behind him. The    |
| figures were no more than 1.10 to 1.30 meters tall. The beings had    |
| somewhat human-looking bodies, but their long arms reached almost     |
| below their knees. Also conspicuous were their oddly cramped-looking  |
| fingers, reminiscent of those of spastic children. They wore somekind |
| of frill around the neck - somewhat like a harlequin - with some 6-7  |
| light green "star like serrations," but he could not make any other   |
| clothing. Their skin appeared to be paler than human skin. Their      |
| hairless heads were completely round, as were their clearly defined   |
| mouths. No nose or ears could be seen, and neither did they appear to |
| have necks. The strange figures were rocking their torsos slowly back |
| and forth. Their eyes were slanted and large like those of a cow, and |
| they stared unflinchingly at the witness, who was now paralyzed with  |
| fear. He was so terrified that he beat upon the glass of the closed   |
| door, instead of opening it. Abruptly, the UFO and the entities then  |
| vanished "like a light being switched off." At least six other        |
| independent witnesses saw mysterious lights and objects over the area |
| on the same date. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:      |

| 1982 - At 6:30 a.m. a bright round, lighted object flew over a car in |
| Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. Its passage was accompanied by radio         |
| interference effects. (Source: Richard H. Hall, MUFON UFO Journal,    |

| 1989 - A multi-colored triangular shaped object flew over the town of |
| Butler, Pennsylvania making a roaring sound a 8:00 p.m. (Source: Stan |

| 1992 - At 7:50 p.m. an observer in Porto Alegre, Brazil saw a glow in |
| the clouds, then a saucer-shaped object descending through the cloud. |
| The object directed a beam of light towards the ground. Several       |
| figures were visible inside the object, who also shone beams of light |
| at the witness. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database |

| 1993 - At 10:30 a.m. a silent bell-shaped object, the color of        |
| brushed aluminum, buzzed a car being driven by two women between      |
| Mosca and Hooper, Colorado on Highway 17 in the San Luis Valley. It   |
| headed off toward the sound flying at 100 feet above the highway.     |

| 1997 - A 50-year-old grandmother was sleeping with her grandchildren  |
| in a room in Brigantine, New Jersey and had left several lights on to |
| comfort them. At 1:00 a.m. she awoke and noticed that the lights had  |
| been turned off. Her eyes slowly became accustomed to the dark and    |
| she felt a presence in the room. She then saw two short figures       |
| standing near her bed.                                                |
|                                                                       |
| She was then startled as one of the beings moved aggressively and     |
| grabbed her. She jumped up and punched the being in the face, and his |
| skin felt like hard plastic. She struggled some more, grabbing the    |
| figure by the throat, noticing that the neck appeared horribly        |
| wrinkled. The being was about five feet tall and thin. She then bit   |
| the being; she said it felt like biting a cold piece of ham. After a  |
| few more minutes of struggling the being dropped to the floor. Next a |
| third figure appeared in the room, and the two aliens who remained    |
| standing moved towards her. One brushed against her face and grabbed  |
| her wrist. He seemed to be stronger than the first. She suddenly      |
| fainted. When she regained consciousness the figures had gone. The    |
| children had apparently been left untouched. She suffered from a      |
| severe headache afterwards and found three puncture wounds on her     |
| neck. (Source: George Filer, New Jersey MUFON; Albert S. Rosales,     |
