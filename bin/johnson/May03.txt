| 1945 - In the predawn hours a US Army Air Force B-24 bomber flying    |
| over Fala Island in the Truk Atoll, the Pacific Ocean encountered     |
| two objects with red circles of light, changing color from cherry-red |
| to orange to white lights, and then back to cherry again; they        |
| followed aircraft for over an hour while the bomber performed evasive |
| maneuvers; there were no airborne radar returns picked up from the    |
| objects. On this evening five orange spheres flying in a triangular   |
| formation were sighted by a 415th NFS fighter pilot east of           |
| Pfalzerwald, Germany. (Sources: (1) Dominique Weinstein, Aircraft UFO |

| 1950 - At 3:00 p.m. several girls in Savoyeux-Haute, Haute-Saone      |
| department, France saw a large cylindrical object fly rapidly from    |
| the south to the north shooting silvery rays. At 4:30 p.m. four discs |
| were sighted by numerous observers in Neuville-sur-Sarthe, Sarthe     |
| department, France flying at a low altitude slowly toward the the     |
| horizon. They left a trail of smoke. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit,  |

| 1952 - At dawn in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia at least 13      |
| witnesses, including pilots and the RAAF, witnessed a huge "flying    |
| submarine" with flashing lights. It was reported to be huge, three    |
| times larger than an airliner. (Sources: Michael Hervey, UFOs over    |

| 1952 - On this day two bright discs played tag in the sky over        |
| Warragul, Victoria, Australia. They then joined together, merged into |
| one object, then vanished. (Sources: Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History. |

| 1952 - On this evening three men in Chestertown, Maryland heard a     |
| strange whooshing noise. Looking up, they saw a black speck, high in  |
| the sky, moving back and forth. It went straight up out of sight.     |

| 1961 - On or about this date a hemispherical craft with portholes was |
| sighted resting on a road in Union Mills, Indiana. The time was ten   |
| o'clock in the evening. It took off when a car came close to it. Its  |
| estimated diameter was four meters, height 2.5 meters, and it bore    |
| "fluorescent lights." (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia:  |

| 1965 - On this day in Monte Grande, Entre Rios, Argentina a           |
| 37-year-old man named F. Martinez claimed to have had a visitation by |
| and communication with two small alien beings, about three feet tall. |
| The witness was transformed intellectually, with subsequent psychic   |

| 1967 - At 6:30 a.m. EDT in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania a gray          |
| metallic-appearing disc paced ahead of a car being driven by a Mrs.   |
| Smyth on the Schuylkill Expressway near Roxborough. The top section   |
| of the craft was revolving and a row of windows was visible around    |
| the center. A vapor stream was produced, which changed to red sparks. |
| The object shot up into the overcast, and when it did so the witness  |
| experienced jaw pain at that moment. (Source: APRO Bulletin, May-June |

| 1968 - During the evening hours of the night of May 2nd-3rd Miss      |
| Shane Kurz, a 19-year-old woman, had watched a luminous cigar-shaped  |
| object in the sky for two hours from her home in Westmoreland, New    |
| York. It moved in her direction, stopped, then shot straight upward   |
| into the sky, turning red in color as it did so. At four o'clock in   |
| the morning her mother came into her room and found her lying on top  |
| of her bedsheets with her robe and slippers on; both were covered     |
| with dried mud, as were her legs. Earlier in the night her mother had |
| found her missing from her bedroom and the door open.                 |
|                                                                       |
| Ms. Kurz stayed out of school for the next two days because of        |
| depression and recurrent nightmares. Her eyes were causing her pain,  |
| and two reddish ring-shaped marks appeared on her lower abdomen. Her  |
| menstrual cycle stopped after this incident and did not return again  |
| for a year. Later under hypnosis she remembered that she went         |
| outdoors in response to hearing her name called, and saw a saucer     |
| with windows and a revolving rim hovering close to the ground. It     |
| approached her and lifted her inside with a beam of light, after      |
| which she found herself in a bare white room. A man shorter than her, |
| with no nose, wearing what looked like a dark "motorcycle jacket" and |
| another being, a "doctor" in a long coat, forced her onto an exam     |
| table. He inserted a long needle into her navel. A third being, the   |
| "leader," next entered the room. The UFOnauts all had very            |
| "penetrating" eyes with no pupils. They said to her, "We've watched   |
| you. You're the one. We want you as a mate." He also said that they   |
| came "from very, very far." The others went out and the leader        |
| proceeded to undress her and then rape her. He told her she would not |
| remember. She was floated down to the ground again by a light beam.   |

| 1969 - On this day in the city of Osasco, Sao Paulo, Brazil a man     |
| photographed a saucer-shaped object. It made rapid maneuvers in all   |
| directions; a door on the craft opened and a strong beam of light     |
| came out. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, case # 8834,     |

| 1973 - On this night at 9:45 p.m. Mrs. Sigrid Karlsson and her son    |
| Robert saw an object illuminated by a red light hovering over their   |
| neighbor's house in Mantorp, Ostergotland, Sweden. It looked like two |
| saucer plates, separated by a row of broad windows, and it made a     |
| loud hissing sound. Robert thought he could see two men inside. As it |
| got closer, its light became yellow-white. (Sources: UFO Information  |

| 1975 - While flying over Lake Tequesquitengo at 1:34 p.m. near Mexico |
| City, Mexico Antonio Santos Montiel, the pilot of a Monteil Piper     |
| PA-24, felt a strange vibration, and saw a domed disc three meters in |
| diameter pacing him to his right. There was another identical looking |
| craft on his left. A third disc approached his airplane head on, and  |
| he felt a jolt, as if his plane was being lifted. The Mexico City Air |
| Trafffic Control radar showed the UFOs making sharp turns. (Sources:  |

| 1975  - At 9:15 p.m. Alois Olenick, 48, was driving westward on       |
| Mogford Road to a nearby store in southern San Antonio, Texas when he |
| saw an amber-colored object rise up from a grove of trees 900 yards   |
| away. It then approached his 1959 Chevrolet pickup truck, dropping in |
| altitude, and the main light on the front of the object changed from  |
| amber to a blindingly bright, cherry-red light. When it was directly  |
| over him it beamed a spotlight on him, and at the same time his       |
| truck's lights and engine died, and his truck was nearly buffeted off |
| the road by a strong wind. "When the craft got directly over the top  |
| of my pickup," Olenick said, "my lights went completely out and my    |
| engine was dead."                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| He got out and saw a globular craft with two conical protrusions on   |
| either side that could have been a central ring (making an overall    |
| Saturn shape). The bottom was of "highly polished metal" with a       |
| reddish glow. When the UFO tipped at a 37-40 degree angle toward him, |
| he could see that the top half was transparent and that it contained  |
| two humanoid occupants, visible by a reddish internal light. They     |
| were 5-feet tall or less, with bald heads, large pointed ears, long   |
| noses, and slit-like eyes. Their skin appeared smooth and grayish in  |
| complexion. They seemed to be handling controls. He said, "They       |
| appeared to be just as interested in me as I was in them. One of the  |
| occupants, the one farthest away from me, appeared to be the pilot    |
| and had his hands on what looked like controls. He was looking up and |
| away from me. The other occupant looked directly at me...and appeared |
| to be observing me. I got a good look at both of them. They weren't   |
| human beings like we see here."                                       |
|                                                                       |
| There was no sound of a motor coming from the object, but there was   |
| a shriek of wind like a cyclone below the craft. Then the UFO turned  |
| its lights off and took off staight up, with a gust of wind that      |
| buffeted his pickup, and vanished almost instantly. There was an odor |
| "like burning copper or electrical wiring" (he was a sheet metal      |
| worker) that persisted inside the truck for some time. His eyes were  |
| affected, and he had to wear dark glasses after the effect for some   |
| while as a result. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher, HUMCAT:    |

| 1975 - At 11:00 p.m. on the highway N165 west of Quimper, Finistere,  |
| France a 6-meter diameter sphere with portholes followed a car        |
| west at 200 meters altitude. It hid when the car approached towns but |
| came back. It tracked the car for 20 minutes. (Source: Larry Hatch, U |

| 1977 - At 3:55 a.m. police in Hainault Forest, England took an        |
| emergency telephone call. The caller said that some strange UFO was   |
| over the forest near the small lake. Two policemen were directed to   |
| the scene. Arriving, they proceeded along the lake road and noticed a |
| "large bright red light" across on the eastern shore. They stopped,   |
| exited their vehicle, and then observed a "bell tent" shaped thing,   |
| about 300 yards distant. This object pulsated continuously from dull  |
| to very bright red for the next 2 to 3 minutes. The UFO seemed to be  |
| hovering silently. Then, as they watched apprehensively, the object   |
| appeared to "dissolve on the spot". Because the thing was no longer   |
| visible, the officers somewhat reluctantly decided to go across the   |
| lake and investigate the spot. As they were doing this, one of them   |
| looked up and briefly saw a thin, large, white crescent shape hanging |
| in the sky. This "apparition" also dissolved on the spot. Reaching    |
| the location of ground zero, as best they could tell, they found      |
| nothing at all, except a strong smell of burning. No cause could be   |
| determined. A report was immediately made to the local UFO            |
| investigator [The Essex Hotline], and field investigator Barry King   |
| came out and interviewed the officer that very night. In daylight,    |
| one large bush was found to have damage: it was flattened in the      |
| center and slightly burned. The gorse bush appeared to have had a     |
| very heavy weight set on top of it, and the result was to break       |
| almost all of the limbs, including snapping off the central branch.   |
| The pattern of breakage was to displace the branches into an outward  |
| radiating splay. No radiation nor magnetic anomalies were found.      |

| an oval-shaped object in Undenas, Karlsborg Municipality, Vastra      |
| Gotaland County, Sweden at 9:00 p.m. It was first seen weaving in and |

| toward her house, and then shot straight up at very high speed,       |
| making two dull explosions like sonic booms. (Source: Acke Svensson,  |

| 1990 - On this night the public in Chester, England reported seeing   |
| strange lights in the sky to police. At 1:00 a.m. two police officers |
| in Backford, near Chester, saw a multicolored (green, red and blue)   |
| UFO wobbling in sky, and they watched in amazement. (Source: Gary     |

| 1992 - At around midnight three witnesses, members of the Boggs       |
| family, in Fordland, Missouri had a close encounter with a dark       |
| flying object (estimated to be 8 feet wide by 20 feet long in size)   |
| with square windows. At first, 14-year-old Robbie saw a line of       |
| bright lights that hung over a slight rise in the pasture, less than  |
| 100 yards from their farm house, and maybe ten feet above the ground. |
| Both ends of the line appeared to curve away, giving the impression   |
| that the lights were attached to an oval structure of some sort. It   |
| flew slowly but directly over their heads at no more than 25 feet.    |
| Although they could see the outline of the lights, the object itself  |
| was invisible. The UFO then moved on away from the house, passing     |
| between two trees with only a few feet to spare. The trees were       |
| undisturbed by the proximity of the object. A pole light on the far   |
| side of the driveway went out as the UFO approached, the              |
| photoelectric switch apparently triggered by the brightness of the    |
| object's lights. The object was just beyond this yard light when all  |
| of its own colored lights went dark, to be replaced by a single white |
| light shining from the rear. At this same moment the sound that had   |
| been coming the the UFO ceased. Surprisingly, the family did not stay |
| outside to watch the UFO depart. They expressed surprise themselves   |
| at that fact, that when the colored lights went out they only could   |
| recall turning away and going back into the house. (Source: Francis   |

| 1995 - At 4:05 a.m. a trucker driving on Interstate 90 near           |
| Amsterdam, New York sighted a domed disc while driving. It had a very |

| 2000 - At 2:54 a.m. Rene Ruiz, a 55-year-old man from Orlando,        |
| Florida, found himself inside a huge craft surrounded by blinding     |
| lights and looking at something resembling an X-ray machine. He also  |
| encountered several 6-foot tall humanoids, who had large oval-shaped  |
| heads and skin that was grayish in color. However, there was one      |
| being who was different; Rene described him as short with a huge head |
| and light blue in color. After lossing recollection of what happened  |
| next, Mr. Ruiz found himself back in his home. Subsequently, his body |
| turned a sickly yellow jaundiced color, and he suffered from constant |
| nausea with frequent vomiting. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, 2000       |

| 2002 - In Alvear, La Pampa Province, Argentina several young men were |
| walking home at midnight along a deserted road when out of nowhere a  |
| female figure with long black hair appeared in front of them, wearing |
| a light flowing gown. The strange figure was very pale and appeared   |
| elderly. It repeatedly asked for assistance from the men in an urgent |
| tone. Terrified, the men ran from the area and later returned with    |
| other witnesses, but could find no trace of the strange apparition.   |

| 2003 - At 3:30 a.m. a man was sitting on his back porch in North      |
| Richland Hills, Texas looking out at the horse pasture behind his     |
| home. The pasture held several horses but he could not see them       |
| because they were at the other end of the field. He heard what        |
| sounded like the horses kicking a metal sheet and squealing loudly.   |
| He also heard dogs barking in the distance. Just as he strained to    |
| look over to the horse shed everything became completely quiet. The   |
| witness started to feel scared by the eerie silence, and as he        |
| stepped off his porch he started to hear a low whirring sound. He     |
| next saw a light beam flash on the ground in the middle of the        |
| pasture. The source was a black craft, hovering about 100 feet above  |
| the ground. It was shooting flashes of light at the ground from a pod |
| on the right end of the craft. The craft had a multicolored mist or   |
| hot looking gas on the bottom of it, on the left side was what looked |
| like a red rectangular window. Inside he could see movement, but at   |
| that moment he began to feel sick. The craft appeared to be about 50  |
| feet long with a dull blue light on the top. After five minutes the   |
| whirring sound faded and the craft hovered silently for another two   |
| seconds before it zipped straight up and out of sight without a       |
| sound. He then noticed that the electrical power seemed to be off in  |
| the neighborhood. (Sources: Albert S. Rosales, 2003 Humanoid Contact  |

| 2004 - At 8:30 p.m. a witness and son in Dijon, Côte-d'Or, France saw |
| for the second time several yellow and green balls moving in the sky. |
| The BOLs were ten times larger than a star, and were coming together  |
| fast. The sighting had a 15 minute duration.(Source: GEIPAN, case     |

| 2006 - At 10:35 p.m. a woman coming home from work on rural roads in  |
| Franklin, Indiana sighted a triangle shaped object with three lights, |
| one on each apex, and one in the middle, hovering over the Union      |
| Elementary School in Union Township. She stopped the car and got out  |
| to observe. It was estimated to be 1500 feet in the air, and made     |
| absolutely no sound as it hovered. It appeared to be a deep black in  |
| color, darker than the night sky, and almost seemed to absorb any     |
| light; the lights did not appear to illuminate anything under it. It  |
| was near the restricted military airspace for Camp Atterbury, located |
| 20 miles south. She watched until the craft slowly moved off to the   |
| northwest. (Source: Peter Davenport, NUFORC, May 2006 webpage,        |
