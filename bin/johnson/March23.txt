| 1905 - On or about this night a small red sphere of light,            |
| accompanied by two white lights which danced about it, paced in front |
| of an automobile being driven by a man named Jones in Egyryn, Wales.  |
| There was also a female passenger in the car, also with the last name |
| of Jones. (Source: Roger Sandell, FSR, March-April 1972, p. 31,       |

| 1950 - A Mexican newspaper, El Universal, reported that at least 300  |
| disc-shaped UFOs were sighted zooming around the sky above the city   |
| of Jalapa Enriquez, in the State of Veracruz, Mexico on this night.   |
| In Yuma, Arizona a UFO hovered over the park at 20,000 feet for two   |
| minutes during the day, then left at high speed to the east. (Source: |

| 1954 - A disc at very high altitude was seen hovering over Norwich,   |
| England at 4:00 p.m. The edges glowed while the center of the object  |
| was dark. It flew off to the west at 6:30 p.m. (Source: Loren E.      |
| Gross, UFOs: A History. 1954: January-May, p. 60).                    |

| 1956 - While walking along the river bank in Grand Ledge, Michigan at |
| three o'clock in the morning a 27-year-old lab technician named       |
| Bassett "felt the presence of something" and looked up. He saw a      |
| rapidly descending metallic sphere that gave off an orange glow, then |
| stopped just ten feet away and only four feet above the ground. It    |
| made no sound. He "lost all track of time" and felt the UFO had tried |
| to make contact with him. There was possible missing time associated  |
| with this case. (Source: Jerome Clark, The Anomalist, April 2000, p.  |
| 21, citing the Lansing State Journal, March 23, 1956).                |

| 1957 - At 12:22 a.m. Civil Aviation Agency radar tracked a UFO over   |
| Oxnard Air Force Base, California. Visual reports of the object were  |
| made by a GOC observer, police, and Oxnard AFB personnel. (Sources:   |

| 1957 - At 6 p.m. a huge ball of fire rose up from behind a barn in    |
| Puyallup, Washington. It emitted two strong beams of light. It rose   |
| vertically, then flew off quickly to the north. (Source: Tacoma News  |
| Tribune, March 28, 1957).                                             |

| 1959 - Two men, Briggs and Elio, saw a strange, domed disc-shaped     |
| object apparently on or near to the ground, then later in the sky     |
| over Adelaide, South Australia. It was in view for 10 minutes.        |

| 1960 - At 3:35 a.m. Mr. & Mrs. Larsen sighted an object over their    |
| residence in Indianapolis, Indiana that looked like a kite made up of |
| little metallic balls. The object or objects moved in an arc through  |
| the sky to the west, then made a 180-degree turn, and finally rose    |
| and departed vertically. It made no sound. Listed as a U.S. Air Force |
| Project Blue Book unidentified report. (Sources: Project Blue Book    |

| 1966 - Two young men, one name Hallonquist, were walking through a    |
| wooded area in Fort Pierce, Florida when they saw a bright object     |
| that they thought at first was a balloon covered with fluorescent     |
| paint. However, it became so intensely bright that they could not     |
| look at it directly. As they walked closer to it, it exploded,        |
| leaving no trace. (Sources: Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A    |
| Century of Landings, case 733; George D. Fawcett, Flying Saucers,     |
| September 1970, p. 7).                                                |

| 1966 - An electronics instructor who was driving to work at a local   |
| Air Force Base at 5:05 a.m. observed an object blocking the road in   |
| Temple, Oklahoma. It was shaped like an airplane fuselage, 25 meters  |
| long, with a "bubble" on top resembling the canopy on a B-26. It      |
| rested on legs, and had very bright aft and forward lights. There was |
| a door and a short stairway to the side of the object, and a man in   |
| coveralls appeared to be examining the craft which bore the           |
| identification "TL 4768." When the witness approached, the "pilot"    |
| went back inside, and a sound resembling that of a high-speed drill   |
| was heard and the object rose. No engine was observed. The witness    |
| was familiar with all conventional military aircraft. (Sources:       |
| Jacques Vallee, Passport to Magonia: A Century of Landings, case      |
| 734).                                                                 |

| 1966 - At shortly before 5 p.m. two domed discs were seen by five     |
| witnesses over a forest in Trinidad, Colorado. They tilted, and       |
| bobbed up and down in flight. (Sources: Coral E. Lorenzen, Flying     |
| Saucers: The Startling Evidence of the Invasion from Outer Space, p.  |
| 270; NICAP UFO Investigator, April 1966, p. 8, citing James E.        |
| McDonald).                                                            |

| 1966 - At 11:45 p.m. John King, 22 years old, was driving his in      |
| Bangor, Maine when he saw some lights nearby. When they came closer   |
| he saw they were part of an elliptical UFO with a dome on top that    |
| was glowing yellow, blue, and white. It had a bluish light at one end |
| and a white light at the other. The UFO then landed. As it moved      |
| closer through the underbrush, the witness leaned out of his car,     |
| which he had stopped for a better look, and fired his pistol at it    |
| when it was less than 100 feet away. King fired four shots at the     |
| 60-foot long ellipsoid object. He believes that one bullet hit the    |
| craft. His car lights immediately dimmed and the radio stopped        |
| playing at this point. The UFO stopped at a distance of 50 feet, and  |
| emitted a slight humming noise. After a few more moments, it glowed   |
| brighter and took off quickly, shooting straight upward. (Sources:    |

| 1974 - At 12:20 a.m. a middle-aged man named Vallentuna was walking   |
| home in Lindholmen, Sweden when at a crossroads he mysteriously felt  |
| compelled to take an alternate route. Suddenly a brilliant light      |
| blinded him. He threw himself in the snow but something lifted him up |
| to a height of 30 to 45 feet. He next found himself at home with no   |
| recollection of how he got there. Under hypnosis he recalled seeing   |
| four "transparent" beings who had grabbed him, and he then was        |
| apparently studied by these beings inside a UFO. He suffered from     |
| severe shock after the incident. (Source: David F. Webb & Ted         |
| Bloecher, HUMCAT: Catalogue of Humanoid Reports, case 1974-11, citing |
| Carl Axen Jonson & Joseph Brill).                                     |
|                                                                |
| 1974 - On this night a young man known as "Anders" was walking along  |
| a dark road in Gustavslund outside Stockholm, Sweden when he heard a  |
| voice in his head instructing him to cross the road. Next a blinding  |
| light knocked him to the ground, where he lay unconscious until he    |
| came to, on his own doorsteps. His wife, disturbed by his condition   |
| and baffled by a mysterious burn on the side of his face, sent him to |
| the local Danderyds Hospital. There hypno-therapist Dr. Ture          |
| Arvidsson put him under a hypnotic trance and regressed him to the    |
| time of the incident. He related how a beam of light had floated him  |
| up into the air, then some tall hooded figures touched his head with  |
| somekind of unknown device, saying that they would meet him again in  |
| the future. (Sources: UFO Information Sweden, May 1976, p. 10; Lynn   |
| Picknett, The Mammoth Book of UFOs, John Wallace Spencer, World Atlas |
| of UFOs, p. 103).                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 1987 - A woman in Concord, North Carolina heard a crash outside her   |
| home in the evening and went to the window to investigate. Though     |
| partially obscured by a tree and its limbs, there was no question     |
| that she was looking at a domed disc parked in her backyard. The dome |
| was about six feet in diameter and the whole craft was about 25 feet  |
| high. From the dome came the brightest orange light that she had ever |
| seen. It was so bright that she could only look for a short while,    |
| turn away, recover, and look again. The light created shooting pains  |
| in her eyes, so that her eyes didn't fully recover for two to three   |
| days. The orange light filled the back of her yard so thoroughly that |
| it seemed almost tangible. "It was so dense that my outside light     |
| looked just like a small light bulb, [and I] couldn't see the post at |
| all." Her neighbor heard the noise and told her that everything down  |
| by her house looked very orange. All around the object it looked just |
| like a thick orange fog.                                              |
|                                                                       |
| The lower part of the craft looked blue-silver, especially what       |
| seemed to be an extended 18-20 foot wide ramp. The object was about   |
| 75 feet from her. Her eyes were hurting and so she didn't see it      |
| leave. No ground marks were found the next day. Two days later her    |
| grandson visited and was told the story. He walked the area and held  |
| up some keys to the fence gate at the dog lot, which was close to the |
| sight. The keys swung over on their own and hit the metal post,       |
| indicating that the post had been magnetized. (Source: Michael        |
| Swords, International UFO Reporter, Summer 2002, p. 23).              |

| 2000 - On this night a factory worker driving in County Antrim from   |
| West Belfast, Northern Ireland saw an egg-shaped light in sky, that   |
| started pacing his car. Panicked, he sped along road, but then was    |
| inexplicably overcome by the urge to stop the car. His last feeling   |
| before blacking out was of he and his car being lifted. He awoke six  |
| hours later and his next memory was of driving home. (Sources: Lynn   |
