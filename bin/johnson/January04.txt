| 1913 - An airship with lights was spotted by three witnesses          |
| including police as it flew over Dover, Kent, England                 |
| southeast toward the sea; "motors" were heard. (Source: Lucius        |

| 1949 – At 2:07 p.m. in Hickham Field, Honolulu, Hawaii Captain Paul   |
| Storey sighted a large, round, flat disc-shaped object that "blinked" |
| and flew silently with a type of whitish reflection. The top of the   |
| craft looked dark. It flew at 3,000 feet altitude and circled the     |
| airfield, blinking once per second, finally flying away climbing into |
| the northeast sky. The sighting is listed by the Air Force as an      |
| “unknown.” (Sources: US Air Force Project Blue Book files counted in  |

| 1954 - Mr. Chesneau, a fireman at the Marignane Airport in France,    |
| saw a round luminous object slowly coming down and called the control |
| tower to report it. When he came out again, the object had            |
| disappeared. (Source: Jimmy Guieu, Les SV Viennent d'un Autre Monde;  |

| 1958 – A woodcutter in Stavanger, Norway saw a UFO land in a forest   |
| at 2:30 in the afternoon. A very tall man with a tan face got out.    |
| The being wore a helmet as part of his uniform. After a few minutes   |
| he got back in the craft, and it took off without making any noise.   |

| 1959 – At 1:30 a.m. five people saw a luminous globe make sharp       |
| maneuvers in the sky about ten miles south of Clines Corner, New      |
| Mexico. It then hovered over a highway intersection for fifteen       |
| minutes. (Source: Project Blue Book files counted in official         |

| 1963 – A domed disc with tripod landing gear landed in a park in      |
| Rome, Italy. It was estimated to be five meters in diameter. The man  |
| who witnessed the landing said he felt a gust of wind as the UFO took |
| off vertically and vanished into the sky. (Sources: Jacques Vallee,   |

| 1966 - Three witnesses riding in a truck in Concepcion del Urugruay,  |
| Argentina had a close encounter on this night with a luminous green   |
| object surrounded by haze. The EM effects on truck caused the engine  |
| to slow and flip over. No serious injuries were reported. (Sources:   |

| 1973 - In Londrina, Parana State, Brazil Joao Marques, age 31,        |
| observed a UFO hovering over the road near his home at 2:30 a.m. A    |
| door in the craft opened, and a human-like figure in white descended  |
| on a rope to the ground. The being then picked up a bit of grass and  |
| put it to his nose or mouth, then discarded it. He next picked up a   |
| hydrangea plant, which he took with him. He ascended the rope and     |
| entered the craft, and the UFO left. The height and other features of |
| the being were not given. (Sources: David F. Webb & Ted Bloecher,     |

| 1974 – Two woman driving in a car in the suburbs of Chicago followed  |
| a low flying UFO in Berwyn, Illinois at around 5:15 p.m. The object   |
| had two bright lights and a red tower-shaped structure. It flew at an |
| estimated 75 feet above the ground, then hovered over a high school   |
| athletic field. It turned off its lights when it flew away. At        |
| shortly after 7:00 p.m. a UFO hovered over Legler Lake, Minnesota. At |
| eight p.m. in rural Lake county Minnesota police officers Haugan and  |
| Dufresne of the Waldo Township Police saw four “unbelievably bright”  |
| lights, the color and hue of a burning log, from their patrol car.    |
| The lights flew to the west, then banked and flew off toward the      |
| southwest at an estimated 800 feet altitude. Their sighting lasted 30 |
| seconds. (Sources: MUFON Field Investigation files, report dated      |

| 1977 - At 12:30 a.m. man was training his German shepherd dog in a    |
| pine grove in Carapito Beira Alta, Portugal when the animal suddenly  |
| became agitated and sat next to him. He then saw hovering 10 meters   |
| from the ground a dark metallic domed object that was emitting a      |
| beeping sound. Near the object was a very tall, heavy set figure,     |
| human like. The object suddenly emitted a silvery lighting flash and  |
| disappeared, and so did the bulky figure. The witness suffered from   |
| severe headaches soon after the incident, and his dog died with no    |
| obvious cause of death in August of the same year. (Source: Albert S. |

| 1978 - The witness was lying in his bed in Wrose, England on this     |
| night when a short silvery transparent figure suddenly appeared       |
| hovering above the bed. It seemed human like and was wearing a monk   |
| like robe. It also appeared to have some short wing like protrusions  |
| and a bright halo type light around its head. It vanished in plain    |
| sight. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1978,    |

| 1979 – A group of four farmers saw a small glittering sphere float    |
| about in the sky over Jitra, Malaysia at 6:45 a.m. (Source: Ahmad     |

| 1979 – That same morning at around seven a.m. in Rowley Regis in the  |
| West Midlands, England, Mrs. Jean Hingley had waved goodbye to her    |
| husband on a bitter cold morning when she saw a light in the garden.  |
| Thinking he had left the light on she went to investigate, but it was |
| turned off so she returned to the kitchen. She put down some food for |
| the family Alsatian dog and called him from the garden, but he        |
| flopped down as if drugged and gazed at the ceiling, glassy-eyed.     |
| Then, with a "zee---zee-zee" noise, three weird creatures flew past   |
| her into her lounge. They were only one meter tall and had waxy white |
| faces, coal-black eyes with no eyebrows, and very thin mouths. They   |
| wore silvery clothes with transparent fishbowl-type helmets over      |
| their heads. These humanoids also had transparent “wings” or wing     |
| attachments. Jean clung to her sink paralyzed but then, she says, she |
| also suddenly floated towards the lounge.                             |
|                                                                       |
| Jean noticed that the aliens were inspecting the ornaments on the     |
| Christmas tree with interest. They also probed into her mind with     |
| telepathy—“It was like a light or an X-ray penetrating.” They told    |
| her she would not be harmed and, when she asked where they were from, |
| one said, “We come from the sky.” When she explained the house was    |
| decorated to celebrate Jesus’s birthday, they claimed “We know all    |
| about Jesus.”                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| They said they would return. “We come down here to talk to people but |
| they don't seem to be interested.” Finally, when she showed them how  |
| to light a cigarette they fled as if in terror, taking a mince pie    |
| each with them. Outside in her garden was an egg-shaped object with   |
| windows. They floated into it, and it took off, emitting a bluish     |
| flash and pulsating twice before disappearing with a flash. The dog   |
| returned to normal, and Jean called the police. The electric clock in |
| the house had stopped, and all her cassette tapes were magnetized and |
| unplayable. In the snow where the object had sat was an oval outline, |
| which the local UFO group was able to photograph before the snow      |
| melted. She also suffered from a case of conjunctivitis as a result   |
| of her close encounter. (Sources: Alfred Budden, Fortean Times, June  |

| 1988 – Two 35 centimeter red spheres maneuvered low over a field in   |
| Vetterslev, Denmark starting at 6: 45 p.m. and continuing for two     |
| hours. Melted snow and small footprints were later found in the       |
| field. During that same time there were at least eight UFO sightings  |
| reported throughout parts of Yorkshire, England. At 8:10 p.m. a       |
| torpedo-shaped object, resembling a World War II V-1 German           |
| “buzz-bomb,” flew over the city of York. It reportedly emitted smoke, |
| flame, and debris, and was followed through the sky by a brilliant    |
| ball of light. At 8:45 p.m. a thin, pencil-shaped UFO with red and    |
| blue running lights was sighted in Selby. At 9:10 p.m. a ex-RAF man   |
| saw flashing lights around a 400-foot diameter, layered disc that     |
| glowed orange in Leeds. In Dewsbury at 11:30 p.m. a disc flew back    |
| and forth in the sky, making a swishing sound. It either extinguished |
| its lights, or vanished, because its disappearance seemed to be       |
| instantaneous. (Sources: Scandinavian UFO Information Newsletter,     |

| 1990 – Several people in Mauriac, France at 12:40 p.m. witnessed a    |

| 1992 - A farmer in Saga Prefecture, Japan, who had been experiencing  |
| cattle mutilations heard his dog barking at night and went out to his |
| barn to check. He saw a small white object floating in his barn, like |
| a jellyfish with things like tentacles hanging from the bottom. It    |
| drifted outside and vanished. When he investigated further he found   |
| he had a cow with a broken leg. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid  |

| 1994 - At five minutes after midnight in Tronville-en-Barrois, France |

| field, illuminating the entire area. Three figures are seen inside a  |
| doorway, one of them exited from the door of the craft. (Source:      |

| 1994 - In Maplethorpe, England at 11:25 p.m. a huge, silent           |

| Isuzu Trooper in Campo Rico, Puerto Rico with the windows rolled      |
| down. They were driving on Route 185 near a horse track called El     |
| Comandante at seven p.m. when she smelled something pungent, like     |
| sulfur, which irritated her throat. She kept driving and suddenly saw |
| a creature with glowing red eyes. It ran across the road in front of  |
| her SUV and disappeared. Frightened, she returned home to tell her    |
| husband. He went back to the area and noticed the pungent odor but    |
| did not see the creature. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid        |

| 2003 - In Fulton, Missouri Bob Simon, age 25, awoke at three a.m.     |
| while he was being dragged towards the bedroom window by an unknown   |
| intruder. He looked up to see a very tall thin humanoid with red      |
| eyes, no mouth, and a gray body. It had huge hands with very long     |
| fingers. Recovering his senses, Simon struggled with the alien and    |
| managed to grab a small knife next to his bed and stab at the alien.  |
| The alien seemed to have been hurt, and relaxed his grip on Simon.    |
| There was a sudden blast of bright light and the creature vanished.   |
| Simon claimed to have scratch marks on his body. (Source: Albert S.   |

| 2004 - At 8:30 p.m. an Aer Lingus Boeing 737-400 with 135 people on   |
| board was damaged by near a miss with a UFO while flying 15 nautical  |
| miles offshore of Ashbourne, Ireland. The UFO caused a power drain    |
| and a purple glow around the 737 as the triangular UFO flew in front  |
| of the airliner. It also caused a huge turbulence in its wake. A      |
| second aircraft encounter occurred on the same night at 10:30 p.m.    |

| 10:00 a.m. PST in Hayward, California. It was five feet in diameter   |
| at the thiner dimension. The two witnesses then saw two more objects  |
| about three-fourths the size of the first, also egg shaped, gray in   |
| color, but not metallic. A white object changed shape slightly into   |
| a smooth diamond 200 feet up. The sightings lasted five minutes.      |
