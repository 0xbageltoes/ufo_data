| 1952 - At 9:00 p.m. EDT aeronautical engineer Paul R. Hill along with |
| his wife Frances saw two amber lights in the sky make a U-turn over   |
| Hampton, Virginia and then revolve around each other. They were       |
| joined by two more amber lights, then all four sped off toward the    |
| south at an estimated speed of 500 mph. They moved jerkily when       |
| flying slowly. (Sources: Edward J. Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified    |

| 1970 - Five people driving in a car in Brindisi, Italy stopped when a |
| domed, luminous UFO descended below some nearby treetops. An intense  |
| silence seemed to fall over the area, as if all sounds had been       |
| masked. (Source: Larry Hatch, U computer database, citing CISU).      |

| 1972 - In Odendaalsrus, Orange Free State, South Africa a flat        |
| rotating disc was sighted high up in the sky by more than eight       |
| witnesses, giving off a bright yellow light. It was estimated to be   |
| about one meter in diameter. It descended suddenly and hovered just   |
| above a police cruiser. The entire incident lasted 15 minutes. In     |
| Malmesbury, Western Cape, South Africa an object that changed color   |
| moved up and down at great speed south of the town at 8:30 p.m. There |
| were 10 witnesses and the event lasted 15 minutes. (Sources: Charles  |

| 1978 - At nine p.m. in Farningham, England a metallic gray            |
| cigar-shaped object descended over a highway, causing a car on the    |
| highway to stop. The witness reported that the car was then levitated |
| inside a beam and brought up inside the craft through an opening.     |

| 1979 - A flat metallic disc with rivets visible was seen by two men   |
| fishing on Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territory, Canada at around     |
| 11:00 a.m. They were able to take 12 photographs of the object as it  |

| 1980 - At 10:30 a.m. a Civil Air Patrol cadet along with several      |
| other witnesses observed a dull metallic, circular object maneuvering |
| near Pecos, New Mexico. The cadet got closer to the object after it   |
| landed in a nearby clearing and took some photographs. He then        |
| observed a human looking figure dressed in a metallic suit emerge     |
| from the object and walk a few feet away from it. Moments later the   |
| figure returned to the object and it quickly took off and flew        |
| towards the northwest. The cadet was later approached by a mysterious |
| man who wanted him to turn over the photographs to him. (Source:      |

| 1989 - Sudden light appeared over New Harmony, Indiana at 8:15 p.m.   |
| and a silent disc-shaped object, six feet in diameter, appeared less  |
| than 100 feet overhead. It had rods or beams of light of different    |
| colors and lengths protruding from it. The witness was a 61-year-old  |
| woman, and the encounter lasted two minutes. (Sources: Francis L.     |

| 1994 - A large black disc, making a beeping sound, flew over a police |
| radio tower in La Chapelle-la-Reine, France at 11:40 p.m. It flew     |
| away toward the west. Ten minutes later a bright illumination was     |
| seen ahead of two witnesses driving on Route D16 south of La Vaudoue, |
| France. A domed disc-shaped object was the source, and it flew away   |
| toward the southeast. (Source: Lumieres dans la Nuit, issue #327).    |

| 1996 - A 66-year-old retired farmer named Dionisio was walking        |
| through a field around noon in Los Villares, Jaen, Spain. He had just |
| sat down on a rock next to a tree to rest when he noticed a very      |
| strong and pungent odor in the air and heard a low humming sound. He  |
| next noticed an object hovering near the ground next to some nearby   |
| power lines. The craft was shaped like a dome and was a shiny         |
| metallic color. It had several black glassy oval shaped windows. It   |
| was about three meters in length and a meter and a half in height. On |
| one side he noticed some inscriptions, part of which resembled        |
| "IOIO." From the top of the object there were also some cables that   |
| were apparently connected to the nearby power lines.                  |
|                                                                       |
| Dionisio also noticed a curious fact. If he moved back about three    |
| meters he could no longer see the object, but when he moved forward   |
| again he was again able to see it. Suddenly he saw three figures      |
| standing next to the object. Two were men and one was a woman, and    |
| they stood about six feet tall. They were wearing tight fitting,      |
| one-piece silvery outfits. Their faces were Asian in appearance, with |
| high cheekbones, very pale skin, and slanted eyes. They had large     |
| hands with five long, well defined fingers and their mouths were      |
| slit-like. They also wore silvery boots. Suddenly he felt something   |
| strike his chest, and glancing up he noticed that the woman was       |
| signaling him, and one of the men was kneeling down next to the       |
| craft. He began hearing voices in his head. Frightened, he tried to   |
| hide behind some rocks, and then heard the humming sound and smelled  |
| the pungent odor again. When he emerged from behind the rocks he      |
| noticed that the humanoids and the object were gone. Investigators    |
| found ground traces at the site. A mysterious looking rock was also   |
| found at the site. During the same time others in the region saw low  |
| flying lights and objects. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid       |

| 1998 - Several local residents of Valentin Letelier, Chile reported   |
| encountering a strange little creature about 50 centimeters tall on   |
| this night. The being had a full head of hair and was spotted walking |
| around the local plaza for several hours that night. Two of the       |
| witnesses have reported talking to the dwarf, who spoke in a gruff    |
| voice and told one of the witnesses that he was hungry. (Source:      |

| 2000 - The 17-year-old witness reported encountering a large glowing  |
| sphere in a field in Columbus, Nebraska at 11:40 p.m.. The object had |
| small protrusions on the bottom. Stunned and unable to move, he stood |
| watching the object when a five-feet tall Grey humanoid with huge     |
| pitch-black eyes approached him. The being stared at him intensely    |
| and seemed to analyze him. It had small holes for ears, no nose, and  |
| a small slit for a mouth that never changed position. After about     |
| five minutes the figure and the object disappeared. The witness       |
| remained paralyzed for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. (Source:       |

| 2003 - At around 8:30 p.m. two teachers in their fifties had gone for |
| a short evening walk across the fields of Barnoldswick, Lancashire,   |
| England and were almost back home when they looked up and saw the     |
| figure of a man in the sky. He was dressed in what looked like black  |
| overalls, and he was descending as if by parachute. He came down      |
| about 50 yards away behind the last house in the row, so they thought |
| he was going to land in the meadow beyond. But when he was only about |
| 15 feet from the ground he leveled off and began to slowly            |
| accelerate, climbing gently and heading off in a northerly direction. |
| They watched as he crossed the valley and disappeared into the        |
| distance. They did not see any means of propulsion on the man.        |
| Nothing visible was attached to his back and he made no sound, at     |
| least nothing they could detect. Visibility was excellent that        |
| evening. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 2003,  |
