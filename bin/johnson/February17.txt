| 1949 - Alain Berard saw a large, bright object land near his farm in  |
| France with a flash of green lightning. It then became dark. As he    |
| approached the craft, the witness saw three figures with stocky short |
| legs, apparently without heads. Frightened, he fired a gun at them    |
| three times. A moment later the object took off vertically. (Source:  |

| 1953 - At 10:04 p.m. five airmen of the US Air Force 754 AC&W Squad   |
| in Port Austin, Michigan picked up a clear and steady radar return at |
| a distance of 9 miles. The slow moving light changed color from red   |
| to pink to pale white to white and then back to red. An explanation   |
| of the sighting was changed to "Venus" in the Air Force files in      |
| 1963. (Sources: Project Blue Book files counted in official           |

| 1956 - Multiple radar sets at Orly Airport, Paris, France tracked an  |
| unknown blip for four hours beginning at 10:50 p.m. It was twice the  |
| size of and airliner, and made 2,000 mph bursts of speed. A visual    |
| sighting of the object was briefly made by a pilot landing at the     |
| airfield. (Sources: Alexander Mebane, Civilian Saucer Intelligence-NY |

| 1956 - In Anderson, South Carolina at 4:15 p.m. several thousand      |
| frantic birds took off and flew off >S, some died in the process. A   |
| silvery wheel-shaped UFO was sighted by a separate witness. (Sources: |

| 1960 - A grayish black Saturn-shaped disc with exhaust cruised the    |
| tops of the hills in New Martinsville, West Virginia. A               |
| lighter-colored ring on the object emitted smoke from rear end.       |

| 1967 - At 1:05 a.m. in Dorchester, Massachusetts a metallic domed     |
| disc-shaped object with 4-5 purple lights around its perimeter        |
| hovered at treetop level over a rest home for the elderly before      |
| moving away. At 6:55 p.m. in Lawrence, Massachusetts a dazzlingly     |
| bright V-shaped object, with a variety of body lights, hovered low    |
| over the interstate highway for three minutes. The witness drove      |
| under it. There were a series of other, similar reports close by at   |
| Methuen and Andover at about the same time. (Source: Raymond E.       |

| 1969 - A woman in Flinders Park, South Australia heard a whirring     |
| sound coming from outside that woke her at 2:50 a.m. She looked out   |
| the window and saw an unusual object in a nearby field. A man emerged |
| from the shadows and walked around the object. The figure was very    |
| tall and lean with light colored hair. He wore white coveralls. He    |
| walked several times around the object. The witness then ran to get   |
| other witnesses but when she got back the UFO and tall figure were    |
| gone. (Source: Albert S. Rosales, Humanoid Contact Database 1969,     |

| 1974 - At ten p.m. a 10 meter long cigar-shaped object appeared over  |
| a vineyard in a rainstorm in Montreal-d'Aude, Aude department,        |
| France. It had four blazing lights on display as it moved up a road.  |

| 1975 - At 9 p.m. Sheriff Richard Egebakken, as well as four other     |
| Wheatland County and state officials, observed a bright round object  |
| hovering near the Harlowton, Montana nuclear missile base. The object |
| made rapid darting movements, and bobbed up-down. (Source: Richard H. |

| 1976 - A truck driver driving between Tarraleah and Berridale,        |
| Tasmania saw a bright cigar-shaped object ahead and to his left at    |
| around four o'clock in the morning. It was low to the ground. The     |
| light had maintained its position relative to his truck for some      |
| time, so the driver woke up his companion. The driver estimated the   |
| object was about one kilometer away and 300 meters in altitude. The   |
| two men tried a transistor radio, but it emitted only static until    |
| the end of the sighting. They estimated the object to be 10 meters in |
| diameter with a dome on top. After being paced for 60 kilometers,     |
| they stopped to change drivers. When they did this the UFO dropped    |
| down to within 300 meters of their truck, then hovered nearby. As     |
| they started driving again, the UFO moved across the road and paced   |
| them again at varying distances until sunrise. A small orange light   |
| accompanied the main object during the latter half of the sighting.   |

| 1977 - During the day a teacher and two canteen workers at Broad      |
| Haven school in Pembrokeshire, Wales watched a silvery yellow         |
| cigar-shaped object glide over a field emitting a loud humming sound. |
| Before it left the area, a human-like figure was seen briefly to step |
| out of the object and then go back inside. (Source: Albert S.         |

| 1978 - Three school teachers, Mr. Moreno, Mr. Aguilar and Mr.         |
| Coronado were on their way back to the town of Cocula, Mexico from a  |
| late dinner, when around 2:00 a.m. they noticed bright flashes of     |
| green, red and white light coming from a nearby hill. They stopped    |
| their vehicle and got out to get a better look. They walked towards   |
| the lights, which appeared to be about 300 meters away. The light     |
| seemed to dim the closer they got to it. When they were about 20      |
| meters from it, they noticed that it was now an opaque egg-shaped     |
| object, about 15 meters in length. It appeared to have three          |
| antenna-like protrusions on top. The UFO now gave off a fluorescent   |
| white glow. Curious, the three men continued to approach even closer, |
| and began to surround it. Suddenly, one of the men noticed something  |
| moving very close to him and signaled the other two. All three of     |
| them then saw a short "robot like" humanoid in a freshly dug ditch,   |
| and it appeared to be still digging. The being was wearing a tight    |
| fitting silvery outfit with a round helmet. The little man simply     |
| ignored the trio and kept digging. Frightened all three men ran       |
| across the field, got back into their vehicle, and drove away at high |
| speed. The next day they returned to the site and found numerous      |
| ground traces, including the ditch. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,       |

| 1994 - A 10-year-old boy in Barking, London, England witnessed a      |
| domed object with reddish-orange lights underneath at 11:30 p.m. It   |
| hovered silently at 300 feet altitude. (Source: UFO Newsclipping      |

| 1997 - At 9:00 p.m. a 68-year-old woman was outside saying farewell   |
| to her son-in-law in La Grange, Georgia when she noticed a            |
| disc-shaped object in the southern sky.  As it got closer, she saw    |
| three white objects moving in unison and "floating." No one else was  |
| outside or driving by while objects were in view. Ten minutes later   |
| three female witnesses in Franklin, Georgia were outside when they    |
| saw a multicolored spherical object approach at a rapid (but not      |
| incredible) speed, then slow down near one house, then speed up again |
| and depart out of sight.(Source: John Thompson, MUFON case files,     |

| 1997 - A 46-year-old man in Biloxi, Mississippi was cleaning his      |
| carport 1t 2:30 p.m. when he heard the sound of jets and looked up.   |
| He also saw three disc-shaped objects in the sky. He went and got his |
| binoculars, and when he returned there were now four objects with     |
| multicolored lights. The UFOs slowly moved across the sky and went    |
| out of sight. The sighting lasted seven minutes. (Source: J. R.       |

| 1999 - In Campinas, Sao Paolo state, Brazil Gley Freitas observed a   |
| large oval-shaped object on the ground. Next to the object stood two  |
| tall humanoids, wearing tight-fitting outfits and helmets. Afraid,    |
| the witness did not get any closer. (Source: Albert S. Rosales,       |
