Near Newcastle, on the early morning of Friday, October 3rd, around 3:00 AM, Raymond \"Spud\" Jones was awakened by a \"high-pitched whine, like a jet turbine starting\". Neighbors heard it, too. Other neighbors reported to Jones later that day that they had noticed a cow of his lying in a pasture. On Monday, Oct.6th, Jones found the carcass, which had been mutilated. He notified Sheriff Willis Larson. Then, on the night of Tuesday, October 7th, Larson had just returned from delivering specimens from the cow to a crime lab in Cheyenne when, at 8:45 PM, a woman called to report an object that looked like and sounded like a helicopter was hovering over a ridge NE of Newcastle. The sheriff knew the local airport mgr., John Bockman, had a helicopter. But a phone call to Bockman was answered by him; he said he would go out to look for the craft. Larson drove to the top of an adjacent ridge. He told the Univ. of Wyoming BRANDING IRON (10-14-75): \"I reached the top of the ridge and saw an object to the west, near Highway 85 North,\" the sheriff said. \"It was an orange, wedge-shaped object, resembling a helicopter in appearance. The tapered end had a bright red light. I was confused and looked at it through the binoculars,\" he said. \"It was making sudden, jerky 'Z' movements, very fast, I thought. I called my wife and asked her to call Bockman to look at it.\" Bockman was already looking at the object, however. He reported it in the same position as the sheriff. The object descended and Larson lost sight of it. Bockman continued to observe it and saw it go down and its lights go out. \"I called for a special deputy to take my position and dispatched another deputy to the south so we could bracket the object in a triangle,\" said the sheriff. \"I then went to the airport. The mail plane was landing at the airport just as I arrived. Bockman pointed the object out to me. Thirty seconds later it went up and disappeared, just like shutting out a light. Later, as we were returning to town, a sudden bright flash lit the sky, like a flashbulb.\" An hour and a half later, the same lady called and reported the object in the same location. \"I went out to check on it again, and the sky was split by five sudden flashes, in very quick succession, centered in the northeast,\" said the sheriff. Later, a glowing light would appear in the eastern sky, and would be viewed by many residents. Lights rising over trees were reported by campers, brilliant flashes were reported by a motorist, and home owners saw strange lights. Obviously, something strange was happening in the sky around Newcastle on the night of October 7. (Ref. 138)\"",
