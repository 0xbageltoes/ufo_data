April 29 — 11:45 p.m. A woman and her daughter are driving north of Oxford, Ohio, when a white light begins pacing their car on the left about 180 feet away. They speed up and pass it after 3 minutes. The mother only sees a light, but the daughter perceives a “saucer with a vertical cone.” (“Case 2-6-34,” IUR 2, no. 6 (June 1977): 3)

May — [Leonard H. Stringfield](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_H._Stringfield&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106565403&usg=AOvVaw1ybdkyt9NwOmScU1PEjRIm)’s Situation Red: The UFO Siege! is published, supporting the thesis that the US military has acquired extraterrestrial hardware and possibly bodies. The book immediately prompts dozens of alleged first- hand witnesses of crashed UFOs or alien bodies to contact Stringfield with their stories. One of his informants is a medical doctor (“Doctor X”) who says he has conducted medical tests on alien cadavers at a major medical facility in the eastern US. Stringfield is later able to visit Doctor X and a colleague of his, Doctor Y, who has examined an alien tissue sample under a microscope. The aliens are said to be 3.5–4.5 feet tall, weighing 40 pounds, with large heads. They have slender torsos and long, thin arms. Their skin is tan or gray, elastic, and reminiscent of reptilian skin. A colorless liquid is present in the bodies; there are no red cells. The eyes are slanted without pupils, and they have heavy brow ridges, apertures in place of ears, small noses, and slitlike mouths. They have no teeth. Doctor X avoids Stringfield’s later questions.

May — A young radio technician is lying in bed during a power blackout in Gloggnitz, Austria. Suddenly a hollow globe about 1.6 feet in diameter and made up of separate red bars of light appears over the bedroom floor. It begins moving slowly and silently toward a glass door. The witness jumps out of bed, bumping into the ball of light with his leg. He feels nothing and there are no aftereffects. The bars of light begin to shrink in diameter, causing the ball to dim and disappear. No traces are left behind. (Michael D. Swords, “A Trick of the Light,” IUR 31, no. 2 (June 2007): 9)

May 1 — 2:00 a.m. Amateur astronomer Lev Boethin sees a red-brown oval object 10 times the size of the moon near Mudeng, Philippines. It moves silently from the southeast to the northwest parallel to the ground 20° above the horizon. He estimates it is only 300 feet away and moving faster than an aircraft.

May 3 — 3:55 a.m. A caller tells police in Hainault, northeast London, that a strange object is above the small lake in Hainault Forest Country Park. Two policemen are dispatched, and they see a “large bright red light” on the eastern shore. They exit their vehicle and notice an object like a “bell tent” about 900 feet away that continuously pulsates from dull to very bright red for the next 2–3 minutes. The UFO seems to be hovering silently. Then the object appears to “dissolve on the spot.” The officers decide somewhat reluctantly to go across the lake and investigate. Then one of them looks up and briefly sees a thin, large, white crescent hanging in the sky. This also dissolves on the spot. Reaching the location of ground zero, they find nothing except a strong burning smell. They make a report to the local UFO group, the Essex Hotline, and investigator Barry M. King interviews one of the officers that night. The next day, one large bush is found damaged: flattened in the center and slightly burned. A gorse bush appears to have borne a heavy weight, because almost all the limbs are snapped off the central branch and displaced in an outward-radiating splay. No radiation or magnetic anomalies are found. (Barry M.

May 20 — 11:00 p.m. Three 14-year-old boys are in a field near Bayview Avenue and Willow Pass Road, West Pittsburg \[now Bay Point\], California, about a half mile from Suisun Bay. They see a saucer-shaped object surrounded by a row of white, rectangular windows that flash on and off. A blue light zigzags near the object. It is hovering near the ground between railroad tracks and the bay, then it shoots across the water in a matter of seconds and returns equally fast, moving silently toward them and stopping about 150–300 feet away. One minute later, they see three figures advancing toward them from near the lights. They are dark human forms, about 5-foot-6 to 6 feet tall, surrounded by mist and moving with a stiff, limping walk. The boys run across the street and look back in time to see the figures fade from view. (“UFO with ‘Dark Figures’ in California,” IUR 2, no. 7 (July 1977): 4)

May 26 — 1:15 a.m. The crew of an RAF Avro Vulcan B.2 bomber piloted by Flight Lt. David Edwards is flying at 28,000 feet over the Bay of Biscay off the coast of France at a speed of Mach 0.86 when they observe bright lights coming from the west. The lights resemble aircraft landing lights, but they soon blink out leaving a large orange glow with a bright-green fluorescent spot. An object emerges from the glow, moving to the west, climbing at an angle of 45°, and leaving a thin contrail. The radar operator reports jamming-type interference. Camera film from the aircraft’s radar records a “strong response” from the direction of the sighting, consisting of three separate radar returns at varying distances, the third made up of three targets all 600 feet wide. On the film the UFO appears as an “elongated shadow.” (Good Need, [pp. 305–307](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/needtoknow00good/page/304/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106576223&usg=AOvVaw1cktDPA7jo8fNmjJ1hN2P8); UFOFiles2, [pp. 92–94](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/the-ufo-files-the-inside-story-of-real-life-sightings-david-clarke/page/n153/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106576607&usg=AOvVaw1PiElXT3e-88nDLtFwKxyR))

May 26 — 8:45 a.m. Two witnesses in Detroit, Michigan, see three blue teardrop-shaped objects moving in a V- formation.

Dunn is on K-9 security patrol at the Weapons Storage Area at Loring AFB \[now Loring International Airport\] near Limestone, Maine, when he gets a call from a sergeant at Entry Control about a bright light above his truck. He sees an intense light, which is directed onto the truck at a 45° angle. The interior of the truck cab seems to glow with a greenish hue. About 5 seconds later the light goes out. Dunn talks to the sergeant, who seems a bit stunned. A few minutes later, two F-106 interceptors shoot above the WSA, apparently looking for a radar target. (Nukes 373–375)

June 6 — 11:30 p.m. Mark Henshall is riding his motorbike home at Lartington, Teesdale, England, in the pouring rain when he sees two purple lights to his side. He notices he is losing power as he rides up a small hill. A car is just starting to pass him, and it too is slowing down. Suddenly, both bike and car are enveloped in a nearly blinding, fuzzy, ultraviolet light. Henshall feels his bike being pulled up the incline and notices steam pouring off his back and legs, which are getting unbearably hot. The motorcycle and car stop just as the misty violet glow overhead vanishes. The car driver tells Henshall that he lost all engine power for 30 seconds and yet was pulled forward. The metal side of the motorbike is far hotter than normal and impossible to touch without risking serious burns. The brakes are found to be so badly worn that they need a complete resetting.

June 17 — 12:00 noon. José Francisco Rodrigues is flying a Portuguese Air Force Dornier Do 27 light plane over the Castelo de Bode dam in central Portugal. When he emerges from the clouds, he sees a dark object against a backdrop of white stratocumulus clouds, slightly to the right of his plane. Thinking that the object is a cargo plane, he banks to the left and immediately radios to ask if there is any traffic in the vicinity. Air controller Sgt. Jose Vicente Saldanha replies in the negative. As Rodrigues completes a turn to port, the object suddenly appears at his 11 o’clock position no more than 20 feet away. It is definitely not a cargo plane. The upper section, partially concealed by cloud, is black, and on the lower section there are four or five panels. The object is about 42–50 feet

in diameter. Suddenly it accelerates and vanishes from what the pilot believes is an initial stationary position. The Dornier begins to vibrate violently and goes into an uncontrolled dive. Struggling to regain control, Rodrigues pushes the control column forward. Air speed increases to 160 mph then 207 mph as the ground comes nearer. He regains control when almost “touching the tree tops” and the plane lands in one piece with a badly shaken pilot.

During the encounter the directional electric gyroscope (connected to a magnetic compass) rotates wildly, and by the time the plane lands it has deviated by 180° relative to the magnetic compass.

June 17 — Dusk. Five individuals—Dale Schexnaider and his wife, their two daughters, Jena, 14, and Krissy, 11, and a close family friend—are breaking camp and preparing to go home from the Cotile Lake Recreation Area, Louisiana. Just before they reach the clearing that leads to the road, the male friend begins feeling a “low frequency vibration” in his bones. Looking upward, he sees the outline of a huge, disc-shaped UFO hovering completely still, surrounded with points of light. The friend estimates it is about 75 feet across and 50 feet tall. The two daughters have been talking, but they too notice the humming noise and see the UFO. The object then floats almost directly above them, and the middle of the craft starts to glow. Several rays or beams of blue light shoot from the UFO, striking them in the solar plexus. It is an intense, electric, silver-blue, thin beam. They hear crackling sounds in the air and they can’t move. Slowly they force their heads down to see their arms glowing with electric blue light. Movement is difficult—as in a dream, slow and heavy. After about 10 seconds, all the lights vanished instantly, along with the force field. The craft begins to glide away over the treetops. The children are frantic, and the male friend is inwardly terrified. The parents are back at the camp and see none of this. The case is reported to [J.

The committee members are divided about the existence of true UFOs, but they agree that the UFO theme can be used in psychological warfare.

June 25 — A man is driving on the A303 with his partially sighted fiancée near Warminster, Wiltshire, England, when they see a triangle of white lights ahead of them. When the lights get near to the car, they break away, one to the side of the road, and the two others on either side of the witnesses. They dance in the air for a while, then an orange globe emerges from the center of each. All the lights move to the rear of the car and disappear behind it.

June 27 — 11:00 p.m. A woman and three children in Genesee, Wisconsin, drive toward a structure composed of three parallel cylinders until they are underneath it. The hovering object looks as big as the full moon, with two steady white lights in front and a red light on top. When she stops her car, the object moves off to the southeast.

June 28 — Night. A man with a flat tire is stopped on the highway between Abadan and Ahvaz, Khuzestan, Iran, when he suddenly feels heat from a nearby “huge, bright object” that changes from red to green to purple to blue. Its lights go off, and as the witness sits in the car to sleep, the light returns, even closer. When he turns off his car headlights, the UFO extinguishes its lights.

July–December — Numerous UFOs are reported in Colares, Pará, Brazil. Residents claim that scars on their bodies are caused by lights in the sky that they call “Chupa Chupa” (literally “sucker-sucker”).

In late 1977, several photos of the lights are recorded, but the military remains skeptical. After approximately four months, the operation is closed after the Air Force can identify no unusual phenomena. The official documents can be seen in the Brazilian National Archives.

Two other base personnel, a Cpl. Torrington and a Sgt. Graham, watch the objects with Wood for almost 2 hours. They are tracked on base radar and at RRH Staxton Wold.

July 1 — 3:00 a.m. Electronic alarms suddenly sound at NATO’s Aviano Air Base north of Pordenone, Italy. Something has set off the magnetic and motion detectors in the high hurricane-type fence protecting the compound.

Simultaneously a power outage occurs at the Victor Alert facility that houses fighter aircraft, and though a back- up system immediately kicks in, minor power fluxes go on for the next 15 to 20 minutes. An American soldier named James Blake sees a large bright light hovering at a low altitude above a soybean field about 600 feet beyond the fence line of the compound. Many soldiers see the object, which appears to be domed, spinning, and changing colors. It is 150 feet in diameter and making a noise like a “swarm of bees.” USAF security and a unit from the Italian National Police are dispatched, but the object moves away before the units arrive.

July 21 — 10:05 p.m. Witnesses in Glenview, Illinois, watch a light move from the north to the southeast in about 3 seconds. It stops for 1 second, hooks backward, and stops again. When the witnesses look back, it has disappeared. (“Case 2-9-19,” IUR 2, no. 9 (September 1977): 3)

July 23 — 12:45 a.m. A 26-year old woman and her 13-year-old niece look out their bedroom window in Lindley, New York, before retiring and see 11 or 12 white lights in a dipper-shaped formation that are moving about in the sky. One bright light appears on a hill 900 feet away. They hear a whooshing sound, then two lights rise into the air. They next hear footsteps from Morgan Creek about 300 feet away and see two small figures floating up and down in front of a tree. Then they see several more figures at various spots carrying what seem to be flashlights. They wear tight-fitting, “skin diver” suits with glowing green belts. One of the witnesses sees a luminous red rectangular object that approaches the creek and then backs away. At this point both witnesses develop severe headaches. Then a figure on a distant hill on a neighbor’s farm shines a light on a tombstone there, and the stone

seems to rise up into the air and move back and forth. A figure taller than the others, who are less than four feet tall, stands near the light on the hill and calls out an “ooh, ooh” signal. The others all approach him and, 5 minutes later, deploy back into adjacent fields. One of them approaches the house. He comes under the second-story window and drops to the ground, as if to conceal himself, then approaches the door and rattles the handle. By this time, 3:45 a.m., the older witness has called her mother, who notifies the state police. All of the lights and figures disappear just prior to the arrival of the police, the lights in the sky indistinguishable from stars. Both witnesses believe only an hour has passed but in fact more than three hours has elapsed. They complain of burning eyes and headaches that last for two days. The witnesses find three footprints in the powdery dust of their driveway.

Further incidents occur on July 25 and August 1. (Allan Hendry, “The Lindley Episodes: CE III’s in New York State,” IUR 2, no. 9 (September 1977): 5–7)

July 26 — 10:10 p.m. Astronomer Zhang Zhousheng and others watch a strange spiral object in the air above a northern suburb of Chengdu, Sichuan, China. At its center is a yellowish light, with the arms of the spiral blue and greenish. The object is 60° in the air and moving in a straight line at a constant speed. It is visible for about 5 minutes before it is covered up by clouds. The object is visible to other witnesses in localities along a 110-mile, north-to-south line, for as long as 10 minutes.

July 30 — Early morning. Airmen on the night shift at RAF Boulmer in Alnwick, Northumberland, England, are alerted by a call from a civilian who is watching two bright objects hovering above the North Sea. Duty controller Flight Lt. A. M. Wood and others on the base can also see them, hovering close to the shore at about 4,000–5,000 feet. They move apart slowly as they climb into the sky. The object on the west side is conical with its apex at the top. It seems to be rotating and changes its shape to an arrowhead. It is apparently 4–5 times the size of a Whirlwind helicopter. After the objects move away out to sea, radar at RAF Boulmer picks up two targets 20–30 miles out, corroborated by radar at RAF Patrington in Yorkshire.

August 3–18 — Italian researchers Giovanni and Piero Mantero of the Centro Internazionale Richerche e Studi sugli UFO in Genoa hold a 15-day skywatch on Monte Verrugoli west of La Spezia, Italy. The mountain is known for reports of strange phenomena. During the skywatch a total of 108 nocturnal lights are observed, 82 appearing as points of light, 7 oblong in shape, 7 spherical, one like a tilted plate, 3 discoid, one like a half-moon, and 7 other miscellaneous forms. Most are yellow, but some are reddish or blue. Occasionally the unidentified lights seem to increase in luminosity in response to signals made with a flashlight. During their presence, dogs in the neighborhood bark almost constantly. The objects disappear when conventional aircraft appear in the sky. Sounds of breaking tree branches are heard, unidentified voices are registered on a tape recorder, wristwatches malfunction, and areas of flattened grass are found. On one of the last nights of the project, Giovanni Mantero claims to have seen a strange aerial entity with a transparent face.

August 4 — 9:10 p.m. A man in Teddington, southwest London, England, is outside watching the sky when he sees a small light traveling fast to the right of a well known Heathrow Airport flight path. Watching it through binoculars, it looks like a metallic submarine shape with five portholes. It hovers for 20 seconds almost on the flight path. It moves away quickly when an aircraft approaches. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 6 (June 1978): 2)

August 6 — 8:55 p.m. A young woman close to Port Columbus Airport \[now John Glenn Columbus International Airport\] in Columbus, Ohio, stops her car to watch two cylindrical objects with bulbous ends approach her from the southwest. They are dark gray or green and have bright white lights on opposite ends. They appear to bank and twist for 10–15 seconds. One ascends, stops, and vanishes; the other does the same maneuver one second later, all “too fast for airplanes.” (“Case 2-9-81,” IUR 2, no. 9 (September 1977): 8)

August 7 — A nearly perfect circular ring, 12 feet in diameter and 8 inches wide is discovered in someone’s backyard on an island in the Mississippi River near Galena, Illinois. The ring is caused by a substance composed of tiny beads that discolors the grass and leaves on the ground. A similar ring is found near Chesterton, Indiana, on August 12. Analysis by the University of Chicago shows that the rings are caused by slime mold. (Allan Hendry, “A Physical Trace Doth Not a CE II Make,” IUR 2, no. 9 (September 1977): 4)

August 9 — 2:00 p.m. A witness in Wheaton, Illinois, sees 8–16 pinpoints of light “like magnesium burning” silently maneuvering in and out of the overcast clouds. They appear to be approaching very fast from 60° in the north. Looping and swooping, they move apart after about 15 seconds. (“Case 2-9-85,” IUR 2, no. 9 (September 1977): 8)

A blue-gray light in its center turns on and they can see its disc-like shape and size, which is about 65 feet in diameter. The object shoots north like a bullet, then stops a short distance away. Keeping it in view, they drive home and call the police. The woman sees the UFO circle around them three times and land. A second object comes out of the hills to the northeast and stops directly above the first object at about 400 feet. The lower object rises up to join the other briefly, and they can see a blinking red light on top. The objects accelerate to the south and vanish from sight. Total duration is 5 minutes.

August 13 (approximately) — Night. At Nocero Umbra, Perugia, Italy, several witnesses, including Bruno Vitali, see a cone-shaped object “more than a meter high.” Vitali tries unsuccessfully to hit the object with his car because as he speeds forward, the object maintains the same distance. Students who investigate the site later find a stone that is intensely hot 2 days after the encounter.

August 15 — The Big Ear Radio Telescope in Delaware, Ohio, in searching for signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, detects a strong, intermittent signal lasting for 72 seconds that stands out distinctly from the background noise.

The team quickly rules out a terrestrial origin or a broadcast from a satellite. Nevertheless, the signal is so powerful and unusual that Jerry Ehman, the astronomer who analyzes the data print out, annotates the signal with the word “Wow!” The Big Ear team continued to observe the same part of the sky, as have others, but the Wow! signal never returns. In 2020, using the Gaia 3D star database developed by the European Space Agency, amateur astronomer Alberto Caballero identifies a Sun-like star in the region of the sky where the Wow! signal originated.

August 17 — 2:00 p.m. James R. Leming is driving on Interstate 70 westbound about 15 miles west of the Nebraska– Colorado state border. He sees a strange object moving swiftly in the sky and pulls over to watch. It moves to the

north, then veers back to the highway and runs a parallel course along the interstate. Directly over the road it remains stationary for 3 minutes, and Leming is able to take three photographs, only one of which is not blurry because the object began speeding away. He estimates it was 600 feet away, its altitude at about 500 feet above the road, positioned at a 40° angle above the horizon, and 40–45 feet from tip to tip with a downward curve at each end. Ground Saucer Watch explains the photo as a chip in the glass of Leming’s windshield, but Leming contests that.

August 28 — 12:10 a.m. For more than 20 minutes, police (including PC Ian MacKenzie, PS James Trohear, PC Alexander Inglis, and PC David Wild) and citizens in Windermere, Cumbria, England, watch a large lighted object in the shape of a “stingray fish” (triangular). It flies slowly at 1,500 feet altitude, hovering occasionally. All witnesses describe it as silent, except for one, who hears a “quiet hum.” (Nick Redfern, A Covert Agenda: UFO Secrecy Exposed, Simon & Schuster, 1997, pp. 131–133)

August 28 — 8:40 p.m. The same couple in Hayden, Alabama, who saw a UFO on August 11 see a similar bright object 2 miles away from the previous site. It has several beige lights, and it darts toward their car in seconds when they stop to look. All the lights go out and come back on at the same time. (“Case 2-10-37,” IUR 2, no. 10 (October 1977): 3)

August 31 — 12:30–3:15 a.m. A total of seven witnesses see a lighted cylindrical object at the top of a disused quarry on the road between Sturno and Frigento, Avellino, Italy. Near the object is an entity about 7 feet 10 inches tall. It has two red-orange lights in a spot where its eyes might be and is wearing metallic-looking coveralls, a possible helmet, a metallic belt, and a black box on its arm. At one point the entity shines a bright beam of light at them. The duration of the sighting is due to the original two witnesses going back and forth to a nearby village to collect additional observers. A triangle of depressions is found that indicates something as heavy as 40 tons has landed there. Some of the witnesses are regressed hypnotically and recall the same narrative.

Fall — 5:20 p.m. A female police constable in Isfield, Sussex, England, sees a silent object flying at 300 feet altitude while waiting for a bus. On an impulse, she waves at the object, which then approaches her. It seems to be made of light greenish-gray metal with a moderately reflective surface. On top of its dome is a blue-green light, and underneath the object is a dense, black, circular section. At its closest approach, it is no further than 50 feet away. Her memory is unclear after this, but when the bus arrives, she feels numb and uncoordinated and seems to have lost 20 minutes of time.

September — Lt. Gen. Akira Hirano, chief of Japan’s Air Self-Defense Forces, admits that UFOs are seen frequently in Japan and that they are quietly investigated. However, the following day his staff denies that he intended to comment on official investigations.

September 4 — 3:30 p.m. Farmer Luis Sandoval, 74, is resting in a hammock near Corozal, Puerto Rico, when he decides to get up and move to another spot. He hears some popping noises and sees an object like an elongated, bright blue candle. It moves toward him, making an increasingly loud roaring-engine noise, then drops down beside him. The object abruptly turns into a 3-foot-high dwarf, dressed in jacket and tie, with an ugly face. He speaks encouragingly, says he is an extraterrestrial, and gives Sandoval a complete physical examination. The dwarf steps away to admire the scenery and says, “How nice Puerto Rico is.” He then turns into a flaming blue candle and vanishes upward in a flash. Other dwarf sightings take place in the area.

September 15 — 2:15 a.m. A 33-year-old bus driver named Antonio Bogado La Rúbia leaves his home in Paciência, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to catch a bus. As he is walking by a deserted field, he sees a UFO “like an enormous hat.” He takes two steps back and is grabbed by two men. Suddenly he is floating inside the UFO, surrounded by two rows of a dozen men each, about 5 feet 5 inches tall. They are wearing football-shaped helmets with a wide band running across the broad portion and are cut into mirror-like sections from which blue flashes are emitted. They seem like robots, but La Rúbia can hear them breathing. A typical abduction scenario follows.

Late September — 1:00 a.m. A witness working as a receptionist at the Paralela 45 Motel on Highway 1 north of Ploieşti, Romania, sees a large object 3–4 times as large as the Moon, which is visible in another part of the sky. It has an orange-red core with a yellowish-red halo at the edges. It stands motionless for 3–4 minutes, then descends slowly toward the southwest before shooting away at an nicredible speed. (Romania 42–43)

September 17 — 2:00 a.m. A couple driving near Kargowa, Poland, notice two unusual lights in the sky. They drive a half mile further, then the lights approach them at incredible speed and hover above the car. The driver stops to look at them and notices that one light is bigger and whiter than the smaller yellowish light. When he drives away, the lights continue to pace them for 6 miles, keeping 10–30 feet away from the car until they reach Wolsztyn, where they rise up and speed away. (Poland 32–33)

September 20 — 3:00 a.m. The watch officer of an Alfa-class nuclear submarine in the White Sea off Severodvinsk, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, notices an object moving swiftly to the southwest. It seems to stretch out, turning into a long, glowing ribbon. As it flies over him, it looks like a cylinder with one of the ends becoming asymmetrical. The cylinder ejects small objects that fly off in different directions. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, pp. 13–14)

September 20 — 4:00 a.m. A large “star” sending out beams of light appears moving slowly over Petrozavodsk, Karelia, Russia. It is last seen as a semicircular glow, bright red in the middle and white on the sides. The total duration is 10–12 minutes. Scientist Mikhail Dimitryev describes it as a “giant jellyfish.” The phenomenon is seen over a vast territory, from Copenhagen, Denmark, and Helsinki, Finland, in the west to Vladivostok, Primorsky Krai, Russia, in the east.

Late September — 11:00 p.m. Ethel May Field is in her backyard in Parkstone, Poole, Dorset, England, when she hears a humming nose and looks up. A circular object with a dome on top is approaching from the south-southwest. Its surfaces are gray, and a brilliant blue-yellow light is streaming from the underside. It is about 20 feet in diameter, and Field can see two humanoid figures visible almost to the waist inside the dome. The object hovers above her garden, its light so brilliant that she puts her hands up to shield her eyes. She can feel the heat on her hands and a vibration in the ground for a second or two. The occupants have silver suits and headgear. The figure on the right appears to be operating controls, while the one on the left is looking directly at her, making a gesture as if pointing downward.

Two research commissions are set up: the Setka-MO, under the orders of the Ministry of Defense and composed mainly of military personnel, and the Setka-AN, under the orders of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and composed of scientists. The first group has the task of studying the military aspects of the problem, such as the possible influences of the UFOs on the malfunctioning of military devices and installations; the ministry names special officers in all military units who are tasked with the responsibility of watching out for unusual phenomena.

October 1 — 7:00 p.m. Leo and John Girardeau are hunting 3 miles west of Libau, Manitoba, when they see an object approaching from the west at an altitude of 500 feet. As it approaches, the witnesses go into their truck and turn on the lights. The object, about 75–100 feet wide and 25–30 feet high, reverses direction and moves westward. One of the men fires a shotgun to lure it back; when this fails, they pursue it in their truck. Running out of road a few miles later, they stop and watch it move out of sight.

October 4 — 2:45 p.m. A group of 10 children see a strange object hovering between two trees while they are playing at Upton Primary Junior School in Macclesfield, Cheshire, England. Their teacher, Mrs. Hindmarsh, immediately separates them and asks them to draw what they have seen. Their drawings are consistent, so she passes them on to the Cheshire police, who take the report seriously and check with the Manchester Airport, which reports that nothing unusual was detected on radar.

He says that he has seen a UFO and was “totally overwhelmed” by the experience. (UFOEv II 20)

October 7 — The Soviet submarine repair ship Volga is in the Barents Sea when its radar picks up an unknown target approaching at a distance of 60 miles. Captain Tarankin goes to the bridge and sees 9 bright discs moving in from the northeast. They arrive and circle around the ship’s masts for 18 minutes. During this time, all of the ship’s communications links no longer work. Captain Tarankin tells his men to remember the incident, so that no one will be able to say their captain is drunk or crazy. After the discs depart, communications is restored. The incident raises some concern in the Soviet Navy, and Fleet Admiral [Nikolai Ivanovich Smirnov](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Ivanovich_Smirnov&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106665939&usg=AOvVaw1-JVxVorNpoB81l5YSHdWR) issues a directive on mandatory reporting of UFO sightings by Soviet hydrographic, scientific research, and reconnaissance ships.

October 9 — 8:30 p.m. Holly Prunchak is working as a security guard at the French-Hecht plant east of Walcott, Iowa, when she sees flashing lights rising straight up from distant trees in the northwest. They level off and move toward her. They are blinding in intensity and flash on and off like a beacon, apparently surrounded by a dark oval shape. Her FM radio goes silent, and her walkie-talkie fails. All animal sounds go quiet when the object is in view. The object looms about 300 feet away, passing near a streetlight that extinguishes for at least one minute. The object drops down onto trees of an adjacent farm. At this point she hysterically calls for help on a telephone intercom system, but no one takes her seriously. (“CE II in Iowa,” IUR 2, no. 12 (December 1977): 4, 8)

October 11 — 7:55 p.m. A farmer in Fairfield, Vermont, hears an odd noise and looks out his window. He and his family watch a bright light source (a bright red light flashing next to a dimmer white light) hovering above a swamp. The object shines a light beam down into the swamp as if searching for something. A second red light approaches from over a nearby house and comes within several hundred feet of the first object; both continue to hover and circle. One vanishes at 11;30 p.m., while the other persists until 1:30 a.m. when the sky becomes cloudy. (“Case 2-11-53,” IUR 2, no. 11 (November 1977): wrap)

October 13 — 3:55 p.m. A retired police officer and ex-pilot in Toledo, Ohio, watches, along with other young men, a “star” in clear daylight rush from south-southeast to north-northeast, passing east of overhead in a straight path without sound or trail. The estimated speed is Mach 1, but it slows down and stops for the last 10–15 seconds before vanishing. (“Case 2-11-60,” IUR 2, no. 11 (November 1977): wrap)

October 13 — 10:15 p.m. S/Sgt Steven N. Haidinger is in his backyard at Chanute AFB \[now closed\] near Rantoul, Illinois, where he is looking at the moon through his telescope. He hears what sounds like wind passing around a building and looks straight up. About 500 feet in the air is an object slowly moving from the west-northwest. He trains his telescope on it and tries to follow it. The object looks rectangular, about 150 feet long, and 10 feet across. It has small, square indentations in patterns along its sides and it rotates as it moves, about once every 2 seconds. It moves out of sight in about 12 minutes.

October 17 — A woman and her children watch a blindingly bright red light from their first-floor porch in Uccle, Belgium. It is stationary and silent for one hour in the southwest at an estimated 1,000 feet altitude. Finally, the object moves toward the west, then north, and disappears in the distance. An independent group of witnesses several streets away also watch the light. A half-hour later, the daughter of the original family sees another pair of similar objects in the south about 400–500 feet off the ground. These circle for 30 minutes and then disappear to the south. One hour later, the family watches another bright light maneuvering in the southwest before disappearing.

October 20 — Several witnesses in San José, Costa Rica, see lighted objects around Pico Blanco, a mountain to the south of town. One physician sees a “squat, orange object” for 20 minutes until it ascends at great speed and disappears. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no 12 (December 1977): 2)

October 20 — 8:15 p.m. Keith Kilford and Philip Staff watch a small orange triangle over a house in Bromley, Kent, England, that grows to twice its size, shrinks again, and moves rapidly away until it disappears. It reappears about 10 minutes later and disappears again. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no 12 (December 1977): 2)

October 24 — 2:00 a.m. A musician watches a saucer-shaped object at Cerrillos, New Mexico, approaching at a low angle from the south. It moves across his view for 15–30 seconds, stops for 15–20 seconds in the southwest, and zooms away. (“Case 2-12-25,” IUR 2, no. 12 (December 1977): 3)

October 25 — 5:30 p.m. Three witnesses, including two deaf 14-year-olds, Johny Myhr and Frank Sverre Mandt, view a disc-shaped object some 33 feet in diameter that hovers and then descends behind some bushes at Åsbygda, Ringerinke, Norway. After about 10 seconds it rises into the air again. The boys run to the nearby Alm school.

They notice the object ascending at a 40° angle and see several windows in the craft. What appears to be a

human-looking person is behind one of the windows. Tracks are later found in the newly plowed field. Each track is rectangular with rounded corners, and measures 5.5 inches by 1.2 feet with a depth of 4 inches. The tracks are arranged in a triangular shape.

October 26 — 12:45 p.m. En route from Dyess AFB near Abilene, Texas, to Dallas, cruising at 15,000 feet in a T-38 jet trainer, 1st Lt Seth Bryant (instructor pilot) and 1st Lt Choate (student pilot) overhear transmissions from Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center to another pilot who has seen a red object he cannot identify. Choate then sees the red object and informs the pilot of its position. The object is flying at 10,000–12,000 feet and seems stationary. The distance is estimated to be about 23 miles away. Initially, the light is brilliant and appears to be closing rapidly. An evasive maneuver is considered but deemed unnecessary. The pilot contacts Fort Worth Center, giving the position of the object and asks if he is tracking anything on radar, but he isn’t. The size of the red light decreases, similar to a very slowly rotating beacon, and is lost to sight. The total duration is less than a minute. Choate recalls static over his headset at the time.

November 16 — 10:59 p.m. An alarm sounds at the Ellsworth AFB L-09 missile site 7 miles southwest of Nisland, South Dakota. Two security men, Airmen 1st Class Kenneth Jenkins and Wayne E. Raeke, are dispatched to the scene from Ellsworth. As Raeke is inspecting the rear fence line, he (allegedly) sees a helmeted figure in a glowing green metallic suit. It points a weapon at Raeke’s rifle and causes it to disintegrate, burning his hands and arms. Jenkins helps him back to their security vehicle. When Jenkins goes back to the rear fence line, he sees two of these beings. They ignore his command to halt, so he opens fire on them. His bullets strike one on the shoulder and the other in the helmet. The figures run over a hill and Jenkins pursues them.

The plot involves benevolent aliens who make their presence known to selected individuals and world governments

through escalating UFO waves. The film culminates in a spectacular landing and contact hidden from the public by an ingenious cover-up. (Jennifer Henderson and George M.

November 18 — 5:30 a.m. A hunter sees an object 4–5 times the size of the full moon ascending about 900 feet away in a wooded area near Richmond, Virginia. It is smoky-gray and egg-shaped with one white light at the top and two flashing lights on the bottom. Possible balloon. (“Case 3-1-12,” IUR 3, no. 1 (January 1978): 3)

November 18 — 9:17 p.m. A bright white light moving at a high rate of speed comes alongside a small aircraft flying at 13,000 feet between Vichy and Troy, Missouri, and paces the airplane for 3 minutes. The light then moves away at high speed. The pilot reports that while the light is abreast of his aircraft, one of his transponders stops working. After the UFO pulls away, the transponder resumes its normal operation. The object paces the aircraft for 3–4 miles at a distance of 17 miles and is fairly high above the aircraft. The pilot turns on his other transponder and nothing happens, then the object takes off on a 120°–130° heading and shoots out of sight. The second transponder recovers, but the pilot can never get the first one to work again. He has no trouble with the other instruments.

November 24 — 10:00 p.m. A polygraph examiner with experience as a pilot and sailor is sitting on her porch in Smyrna, Georgia, when she notices an object the size of a distant aircraft fly out ion front of the moon. The object is white, intensely luminous, and shaped like a hemisphere. It hovers for a few seconds, shoots straight up, hovers again, and then tilts back (showing its bottom portion with two Saturn-like rings of light) and flies back in front of the moon and disappears.

December 1 — 8:28 p.m. An electrician is driving east out of Elm City, North Carolina, when a large object drifts into view from the north. It has one intense headlight in front, 4–6 blue lights around the edges, and many red and white lights forming portholes along the sides. It is shaped like a torpedo with four swept-back fins at the back with a round band connecting them, and it is making a humming sound. (“Case 3-1-30,” IUR 3, no. 1 (January 1978): 3, wrap)

December 2 — Night. A farmer in the Waimata Velley of New Zealand wakes up when his dogs bark loudly in their kennels. He goes to the back door and sees a landed saucer-shaped craft in a paddock about 100 feet away. It is about 50 feet in diameter and bright red with two open doors in the side. By the kennels he sees two humanoid beings about 4 feet 8 inches in height with slim builds. They are carrying one of the dogs, which appears

comatose. The farmer shoots and hits one of the creatures, apparently startling them into dropping the animal. The being that is hit runs off into the bushes, and the other runs into the UFO, which then ascends vertically. The dog remains dazed for a few minutes and then becomes agitated.

December 6 — 7:30 p.m. Three people in a car near Tatapouri Point, New Zealand, see a red disc coming from the direction of the ocean. It seems to follow their car for about one mile until the driver stops. At that instant, the object veers off into the hills northwest toward the Waimata Valley. They note their car lights are much dimmer than usual, and on arriving at their destination discover that the car battery has no water in it. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 6 (June 1978): 2)

December 6 — 9:05 p.m. A man in Big Sandy, Tennessee, sees an unusual configuration of lights outside his bedroom window in the east-northeast.

December 17 — 3:34 a.m. Radar facilities in Colorado and South Dakota track two UFOs that give strong returns, moving at more than 1,000 mph. They are tracked for the next 30 minutes, during which time one of the objects makes a close head-on pass at an aircraft. A third radar station is unable to function while the unknowns are in the area.

One of the other facilities is put out of operation when the main shaft holding the radar antenna is severely bent by an unknown force. (MUFON UFO Journal, March 1983)

December 17 — 4:00 p.m. Marguerite Camp is in her pickup truck on State Highway 2 near Kenyon, Rhode Island, when she spots an “ovoid, plate-like” object that is tilted slightly to the west. She stops and gets out to watch the UFO, which is 3–4 times the size of a B-29 in diameter and glowing blue-white. She sees 4–5 dark windows and its bottom half is blurry. Another woman, driving an AMC Gremlin, pulls up behind her. While they are watching the object, the engines of both vehicles stall. The object turns up on its edge and climbs vertically, and hovers for 10 more minutes. The second woman gets back in her car, starts it up, and drives away. The object speeds off to the west, takes on a pinkish glow, and fades in the distance.

December 17 — 7:45 p.m. A red, luminous object is seen by Kenny and Carol Drake of Council Bluffs, Iowa, falling to earth near the northern city limits. At the scene, they find an area covered by molten metal that is glowing orange- red, igniting the grass. Police and firemen who arrive 15 minutes later all see the fallen mass, estimated at 35–55 pounds. An investigation concludes that it is not space debris, a meteorite, or a hoax. Two of the 11 witnesses to the fall describe a round object hovering in the sky, edged by blinking red lights. The retrieved material is composed of solid metal and slag with white ash inclusions.

December 27 — 10:54 p.m. Police officers Ron Arey and Howard Dellinger are flying in a Bell Jetranger police helicopter at 1,100 feet in Charlotte, North Carolina, when they see two lights approaching from the northwest. They pass the chopper to the right at an estimated 200 feet. Charlotte FAA air traffic controller Ray Bader confirms two unknown targets on radar. Later on, the object circles the helicopter at an estimated distance of 200 feet.

January — During the flight of a Yakolev Yak-40 airliner between the Medvezhye gas field and Nadym, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia, the crew notices a bright round object that approaches rapidly and sometime later appears in front of the aircraft, apparently much larger.

January — Night. Police Sgt. Tony Dodd and Constable Alan Dale are driving near Cononley, North Yorkshire, England, when the road in front of them lights up. They stop the patrol car, look up, and see an object about 100 feet away and moving silently at 40 mph. It has three large spheres below it, portholes around the perimeter, and a dome on top. The object passes overhead and seems to land in a wood on a distant hillside.

As the UFO passes about 6,000 feet to his left, Hallstrom is looking down on it an angle of about 30°–45° and its true form suddenly becomes clear to him. He is able to make out the complete form of a saucer and can see the dome, also very vividly clear, including all the windows, about 16–20 evenly spaced around the circumference of the dome, located just above the base. The dome appears to be a perfect hemisphere about 20 feet in diameter resting on the base, which is about 30 feet in diameter. The UFO continues on a course opposite to the pilot’s with no sign of rotation, oscillation, pitch, roll, or yaw. Neither is there any sign of a propulsion system. The sun reflects off the dome as a bright spot when the UFO passes. After about a minute, the object disappears from view behind the Cessna.

January 2 — 11:00 p.m. Four young men are driving through an isolated area known as Simonswood Moss, between Rainsford and Kirkby, West Lancashire, England, when they realize they have taken a wrong turn onto a narrow dirt road bordering a ditch. They suddenly see a 7-foot tall figure with red eyes appear in the glare of the headlights 26 feet ahead. The being is wearing a white fluorescent one-piece suit with boots, it has no discernible facial features, and it has short arms ending in claws. On its chest is a box with two flashing red lights. The figure takes two steps towards the witnesses and suddenly stops. The witnesses panic and leave the area, driving to a nearby farm where they notify the police. A later investigation suggests that they have seen a cow wandering down the lane, the car’s headlights reflecting in its eyes.

January 10 — 12:25 a.m. A 31-year-old paramedic is driving to pick up her husband (a policeman) from work in Chicago, Illinois, when her 3-year-old son draws her attention to a “moving star” nearly overhead. At her destination a few seconds later, she notes a silver disc-shaped object (“with teacups on top and bottom of saucer”) as large as a full moon moving forward with yellow-orange trail behind as it moved. The object stops, reverses direction, moves forward again, and moves off behind a building. The trail is only visible while the object is in motion. Duration is 1–2 minutes.

January 18 — 3:00–5:00 a.m. A security policeman at McGuire AFB \[now Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst\] in Burlington County, New Jersey, is called to help investigate a low-flying UFO over the neighboring Fort Dix army base. An Army MP pursues the object, but his radio transmission is cut off just as a grayish, 4-foot-tall being with fat head, long arms, and a slender body appears in front of his car. The MP fires five rounds into the being and one round into the object above. The UFO shoots upward and joins 11 others high in the sky, and the being runs into the woods toward the Fort Dix fence line. A security patrol finds its dead body near the McGuire AFB runaway, giving out a foul, ammonia-like stench; then AFOSI arrives and ropes everything off. Retired USAF Maj.

The object then moves off rapidly to the south and blinks out. (“Case 3-3-14,” IUR 3, no. 3 (March 1978): 3)

January 24 — The Soviet reconnaissance satellite Kosmos 954 reenters the Earth’s atmosphere while traveling on a northeastward track over western Canada. At first the USSR claims that the satellite has been completely destroyed during re-entry, but later searches show debris from the satellite has been deposited on Canadian territory along a 370-mile path from Great Slave Lake to Baker Lake. The effort to recover radioactive material from the satellite is dubbed Operation Morning Light. Covering a total area of 48,000 square miles, the joint Canadian–US team (consisting of the emergency Nuclear Emergency Support Team) sweeps the area on foot and by air through October 15. They are ultimately able to recover 12 large pieces of the satellite, 10 of which are radioactive.

January 27 — Early morning. Four men on the banks of the River Weaver see a silver balloon-shaped object land in a meadow near Frodsham, Cheshire, England. It emits a strong purplish glow that makes it hard to look at. Two entities of normal height emerge. They wear silvery suits and have miners’ lamps on their heads, and these glow purple. Cows on a nearby field seem to become paralyzed, unable to move. Using a metal cage, the entities pen in one cow and seem to measure it. The witnesses become frightened and run from the area, and as they run they feel a strange tingling sensation in their groins. One of the men develops sunburn-like marks on his leg.

January 27 — Cheryl DeSanctis sees a blinking red and white light hovering above some trees near Barry Drive in Vineland, New Jersey. She watches it for 5 minutes, then a red ball moves from behind it, descending to just a few feet above the rooftops where its light reflects off the houses. After 10 minutes, the red ball moves to the north and the first light departs to the south.

January 31–February 1 — 6:15 p.m. Four boys are playing on the ice of the Montvale (N.J.) Memorial Elementary School playing field. They notice an “airplane” that passes slowly over the field; moments later, another object arrives, shaped like a square with large yellow lights in each corner, with a slight dome on top and a red light underneath. It emits a red beam of light toward the ground but stops short before touching it. They next notice several humanoid figures moving around the school park, walking stiffly. They are about average height and bald-headed, dressed in bright yellow outfits with boots and gloves. One of them looks different, because he has a larger head that seems “creased” down the middle and has on a brown cape over the yellow suit. As the boys watch, they note an uncanny silence and an unpleasant sulfur-like odor. The figures walk away toward the nearby Public Works Garage. The boys then notice another figure, this one a woman standing in the parking lot. She has medium long brown hair and wears a dark suit with blue fur around her shoulders. She walks in slow motion and sits down on a low fence and raises her arm very slowly, pointing to the sky at another hovering square object. The woman then walks toward the Public Works building and at one point seems to appear and disappear as a police vehicle drives by near her. A similar scenario occurs the next evening.

February 1 — Night. Six teenagers are driving north on Hance Bridge Road in Vineland, New Jersey. They see a series of four large lights low in the sky approaching them. It swerves about 500–600 feet in altitude and a mile distant, and they can see that the object is triangular with a light in each corner. It returns the way it came, so they decide to follow it for 6–7 miles before pulling over and stopping the car. When they turn their headlights off, the object’s lights go out. When they turn the headlights back on, the UFO lights up again.

February 2 — 9:30 p.m. Brian Mosychuk is walking in a neighborhood of Edmonton, Alberta, when he sees a car-sized object with blue lights on front and back approaching from the northwest. It hovers above him making a rumbling sound, then a beam of light shoots toward him. Mosychuk leans back to avoid the beam, but it shines on his feet in the snow. He runs away, and when the looks back the object is flying away to the northeast, leaving behind a red trail. He tells his father, who goes out and finds a round circle in the snow. They call the police, who find a melted hole about 28 inches in diameter. Samples of snow, including some with carbon spots, are taken to CFB Edmonton for a contamionation check.

February 4 —3:30–4:00 a.m. A weird humming sound awakens Claire Semaza and her two children in Orange, California. The sound increases in volume until it hurts her ears, and the family dog barks frantically, punctuated by an odd pause for several seconds. Outside, they see an oval or cigar-shaped object not far above the trees about one half-mile away. Below and around it is a layer of gray haze. It begins slowly rising, leaving the haze behind. The object has a bright red light at each end that sends shafts of light toward the ground. Several bluish-white lights are visible between the two red ones. It rises higher, flashes a brilliant white light on and off for 3 seconds, then quickly disappears. Meanwhile, the dog has been taking her 7 puppies one by one and hiding them behind the drapes on the second floor.

March 17 — 11:30 p.m. Service engineer Ken Edwards is driving back from a union meeting in Sale, Greater Manchester, England, on Daten Avenue, Risley, past the UK Atomic Energy Authority site. As he is approaching the roundabout near the Universities Research Reactor building and the UKAEA fire station, he notices a 7-foot-tall silver figure coming down a steep embankment to his left. Stopping his van, Edwards watches the figure descend with an unnatural stiff-legged gait. The figure walks across the road only 15 feet from him. As he passes Edwards, the figure looks at him and two beams of light shoot from its eyes and dazzle him. It continues walking toward the security fence surrounding the UKAEA site. The figure raises an arm (one of two that seem to come out of its chest) and walks through the 10-foot-tall, barbed wire-topped, chain link fence, disappearing into the darkness. He later drives to the Pudgate police station to report the sighting. Police accompany him to the site where they find a group of UKAEA constabulary officers gathered at the spot, but since there is no hole in the fence, they discount his story. However, years later investigator Glen Vaudrey discovers that the tall figure was a 6 foot, 5 inch fireman dressed in a high-temperature fire suit who was trying to scare some students in an isolation building across the road.

March 22 — 7:00 and 8:45 p.m. Two waves of UFO sightings are reported over a wide area between Cumberland, Wisconsin, and Newport, Minnesota. UFO investigator Robert E. Engberg traces the first wave beginning around Chisago City, Minnesota, and moving east between Dresser and St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. The second wave originates near Cumberland and follows an 85-mile course to St. Paul, Minnesota. Witnesses see formations of red lights, single round objects with red body lights, and orange globes in straight-line and oblique formations.

Some disc-shaped objects are also reported with rows of body lights.

March 22 — 11:00 p.m. Gary Oickle, David Oickle, and two friends are sitting around a campfire in Patapsco Valley State Park, Maryland, near the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tunnel. They see a strange object in the southeastern sky that moves around for 10 minutes before it disappears behind a ridge. Another object soon appears over their campsite from behind a ridge to the north; this time it is a triangular shape about 150–200 feet on each side with large windows, three white lights at each corner, and a red light on top. Three of the witnesses think they see the silhouette of a figure in the windows. It moves very slowly, hovering at times, to the southeast. Another star-like object appears in the south after the triangle moves away. It changes colors repeatedly from blue to green to yellow to red.

March 24 — In one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI, an 11-month-old cross Hereford-Charolais bull, belonging to Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, is found mutilated. It displays “classic” mutilation signs, including the removal of the rectum and sex organs with what appears to be “a sharp and precise instrument,” and its internal organs are found to be inconsistent with a normal case of death followed by predation. The animal’s heart, as well as bone and muscle samples, are sent to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for microscopic and bacteriological studies, while samples from the animal’s liver are sent to two separate private laboratories. Los Alamos detects the presence of naturally occurring Clostridium bacteria in the heart but is unable to reach any conclusions because of the possibility that the bacteria represent postmortem contamination. They do not directly investigate the heart’s unusual color or texture. Samples from the animal’s liver are found to be completely

devoid of copper and to contain 4 times the normal level of zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. The scientists performing the analysis are unable to explain these anomalies. Blood samples taken at the scene are reported to be “light pink in color” and “did not clot after several days” while the animal’s hide is found to be unusually brittle for a fresh death (the animal was estimated to have been dead for 5 hours) and the flesh underneath is found to be discolored.

March 24 — Just after 12:00 noon. Luis Carlos Serra, 16, is picking guava in the forest just west of Penalva, Maranhão, Brazil, when he hears a sharp noise like a car horn. He looks up and sees a bright white light about 20 inches wide high above the palm trees. Suddenly he falls flat on his back, paralyzed. After a short time, he starts rising in the air toward a round UFO with four balls on the bottom, a dome on top, and three windows. He floats through one of the windows head-first. Inside he drops to the floor, still paralyzed, and sees three entities about 3 feet high and wearing “diving suits.” He is taken somewhere with no trees and tall grass and subjected to an examination. Soon he loses consciousness and wakes up three days later in a scrub forest. A nearby fisherman, José Ribamar dos Santos, hears his cry, finds and recognizes him, and takes him back to town. Serra is examined in the hospital by Dr. Linda Macieira, who finds that he has four teeth missing and is completely bald with his hair burned off. He has a general loss of motor control and a lack of sensitivity to pain. He does not eat, so he is fed intravenously for the 7 days he is hospitalized. On March 30 he is transferred to the Serme Hospital in São Luis, where 6 doctors examine him, including neurologist [Antônio Saldanha](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doctoralia.com.br/antonio-de-padua-saldanha/neurologista/sao-luis&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106766595&usg=AOvVaw15K4okIF7LgjX3iBz-rDIr)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doctoralia.com.br/antonio-de-padua-saldanha/neurologista/sao-luis&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106766897&usg=AOvVaw1f2oF3XMjyXyImDzLZC2ts) who finds that Serra still cannot speak and is generally unresponsive and in shock.

March 27 — During a 9-hour period near San Diego, California, an F-14 Tomcat aircraft loses control and makes touch- and-go landings; an A-4 Skyhawk crashes into the Pacific 50 miles to the west; and an S-3A Viking anti- submarine aircraft from Naval Air Station North Island explodes and crashes into the ocean 6 miles from the base. On March 28, a college art instructor and a shipping company owner are talking on the phone when they are interrupted by another conversation on the line.

March 28 — 12:00 midnight–1:30 a.m. Irene Bigelow is outside her home in Denver, Colorado, when she sees three bright-orange UFOs motionless in the air for more than an hour. She estimates they are as large as her garage’s double door. At 1:30, they break formation, with the light on the right moving to the right. The other two remain stationary at first, then all three ascend into the sky in different directions.

March 29 — 7:30 a.m. Christopher Kloppenborg and Geoffrey Kloppenborg are out mustering sheep near Albury, New South Wales, Australia. They see a very bright, stationary, chrome-colored light that is casting a shadow on a hillside. They use binoculars to watch it for 5–8 minutes. It appears to have black shapes along its side and is shaped like a short cigar. Geoffrey returns to the house to get a camera, and on his return he sees a second, smaller object, traveling over the hills toward the first object. It turns in front of the bigger object, and then both depart over the hills to the east. (Melbourne Herald, April 8, 1978; “Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 7 (July 1978): 2)

March 31 — 8:30 p.m. A young man is walking his dog in a field in Dublin, Ireland, when he spots a silver cigar-shaped object hovering about 45° above the horizon. For the next 20 minutes, a doorway repeatedly (about 20 times) opens, releasing a red light, the door closes again, the red light returns to the object, and the door opens and readmits it. The object remains motionless another 10 minutes, then shoots upward at fantastic speed. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 7 (July 1989): 2)

Smith looks out his window and sees a silent, grayish-silver disc slightly larger than the full moon. It moves straight up and down, in and out of the cloud layer three times for about 30 seconds. Each time the object comes out of the clouds it remains visible for about 10 seconds. Smith notices a large number of “lightning rods” that move in and out on its surface.

April 26 — 11:00 p.m. Debra Gairns, her husband, and a friend are driving in Welland, Ontario, when a triangular object with red, blue, and white blinking lights hovers briefly and silently above their car. It moves away and stops above a grove of trees. (Marler 102)

April 27 —Two witnesses near the Ciampino–G. B. Pastine International Airport in Rome, Italy, watch a small green object shoot out of a larger green object. The display moves smoothly from directly overhead to about 45° in 15 minutes. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 7 (July 1978): 2)

Late April — 10:00 p.m. A dog staying with a couple living on Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, Michigan, near the Ford Motor plant lets out an awful howl. The woman goes outside to see what the matter is and notices a large round object, perfectly silent, about 500 feet above the garden. It hovers a minute or two then moves toward the Ford plant. It is about 125 feet in diameter and has a row of windows circling the bottom that emit colored light. It stops every 2–3 minutes and never travels more than 25 mph. They watch it for a total of 15 minutes, and their landlady sees it as well.

April 29 — Night. Ten persons call the Aurora, Illinois, police department to report a UFO. One couple believes they have had a close encounter with the object, which they describe as a domed disc the size of a football field. The police alert the Center for UFO Studies and [Allan Hendry](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Hendry&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106783806&usg=AOvVaw08PPKTfFKq5rUXCqbJEuuR) interviews some of the witnesses. He learns that some connect TV interference and power failures with the UFO’s appearance. An 11-year-old boy is so frightened that he hides behind the back seat of the family car. However, Hendry identifies the source of the sighting as an advertising plane owned and operated by a Chicago firm.

May — Red Army officer Anatoly Malishev is allegedly confronted near Pirogovskoye Reservoir, Mytishchinsky District, north of Moscow, Russia, by two entities wearing dark suits who communicate with him by telepathy and take him on board their craft. He is given a salty-tasting drink, but requests an alcoholic drink, only to find that the entities do not imbibe. He asks why, and they reply, “Perhaps if we did, we would not be such an advanced civilization.” They take him on a trip to the dark side of the Moon (where they have a base) and to their home planet 3 light years away then back to Earth, all taking about 40 minutes. Malishev reports his experience to his superior officers, who threaten a court martial. However, he is subjected to hypnosis and passes a lie detector test and apparently does not go through a trial.

May 6 — 4:15 p.m. An object crashes into the southern slope of El Taire mountain on the Rio Bermejo along the border of Bolivia and Argentina. It produces a sonic boom that is heard 120 miles away and shatters windows in villages 30 miles away. Argentinian border police search for wreckage, while reporters visit the town of Aguas Blancas, Bolivia, to interview witnesses. Velez Orozco is one of the witnesses to the fall, and he thinks the object was 15 feet in diameter and conical. Border Patrol Cpl. Natalio Farfan Ruiz says the object “made the earth tremble” as it passed over. The Bolivian Air Force dispatches three airplanes and discovers the crash site on its side of the border. One of the flights includes a Bolivian astronomer, who sees a rockslide that may have been caused by the crash. On May 14, police from Tarija, Bolivia, find the object, a dull metallic cylinder 12 feet long with a few dents. A telex sent by US Ambassador [Paul H.

He refers Boeker to the 1973 Project Moondust order. The US military attaché in La Paz sends a message to Wright-Patterson AFB and USAF headquarters at the Pentagon, claiming that the Bolvian Army has found nothing, but would send two USAF officers to Tarija to investigate. Col. Robert Simmons and Maj. John Heise arrive with a Bolivian Air Force officer. On May 23, three Bolivian Air Force officers and a guide set out on horseback to the mountain, locating the rockslide on May 25.

Parallel to the slide is a 325-foot trench, 10–12 feet wide at the top. Some of the large rocks appear burned, and the grass around it is brown and withered.

May 10 — Early morning. Farmer [Jan Wolski](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/164596567/jan-wolski&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106789249&usg=AOvVaw22yoeg-MS04gzsKSHqv4bJ) is out driving a horse-drawn cart in Emilcin, Poland, when he is jumped by two “short, green-faced humanoid entities” about 5 feet tall. They jump onto Wolski’s cart, sit next to him, and start to speak in a strange language. At first, he mistakes them for foreigners because of their “slanted eyes and

prominent cheekbones.” Wolski drives his cart, with the two beings aboard, to a clearing where a large white object is hovering about 16 feet in the air. It is about 15–16 feet high and as long as a bus. Four black objects on the surface generate a humming sound. A platform descends to the ground, and he is taken on board by the two entities, along with two additional ones. There are about 8–10 benches situated around the craft, each for one person to sit in. There are some rooks in front of the door, one of which is moving its legs and wings but seems to be immobilized. Wolski is then examined with a tool that resembles two dishes or “saucers.” After this, he is ordered to get dressed again, and then he notices there are no lights or windows on the craft, only the daylight coming through the door. The entities eat and offer him something like icicles, but he refuses them. The UFO’s interior is black with a grayish tint, similar to that of the creatures’ outfits. Wolski returns home to his family and notifies them of what has happened, urging them to come see the floating craft. He tells his sons, who call to other neighbors, and together they go to investigate the site. The grass where the craft had been shows signs of usage, trodden down and “covered with dew and paths coming in all directions.” Wolski goes home, leaving the rest of the neighbors and family at the site. His sons claim there are footprints left behind by the beings, though they do not describe them well.

May 10 — Evening. Numerous people watch a moon-sized oval object with clearly delineated edges, no trail, and an intense white light in Clavarazza, Genoa, Italy. It remains stationary high in the sky for three minutes, pulsates for 7 minutes, then blinks out. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 9 (September 1989): 2)

May 13 — 3:32 a.m. Police officer Manuel J. Amparano is on the outskirts of Kerman, California, when he sees a reddish glow ahead. Getting closer, he observes an oval-shaped object, smaller in apparent size than the full moon, hanging silently in the sky. It is a very bright crimson-red color, which despite its brightness does not hurt his eyes. It shoots out a beam of blue light similar to a camera flash, then recedes and is gone. Amparano feels “a tingling sensation” in his body as he drives to the station, but he is not concerned. When he gets out, the 6 witnesses at the station note that he is sunburned “as red as a lobster.” His skin shows this condition for about 4 hours before returning to normal, even in areas underneath his uniform. However, no burn is present where the car door is between him and the flash. Also, he has no burn on his back, which is away from the car window as he peers out. Although the redness fades, there are areas where the skin is actually burned (arms, face, neck). These are noted on a visit to Fresno Community Hospital. These burns are visible for 2 days. The day following the encounter, “fever blisters” break out on his face and in places on his arms, and these last a week. Allegedly, doctors at the hospital tell the officer that the burns look like they are caused by microwave radiation.

May 13 — 10:45 p.m. A teen couple are sitting on a porch in Northport, Alabama, when they see an intensely bright pale- yellow light. It is oblong in shape and the size of the full moon. It hovers in the east for about 15 minutes, rocking slightly black and forth. They see three tripod legs on the underside. The girl’s mother comes out and notices her daughter is pale and shaking with fear. The object falls a short distance and remains stationary again for a few seconds before moving slowly away beyond trees on the horizon. (“Case 3-6-29,” IUR 3, no. 6 (June 1978): 3)

May 14 — 10:00 p.m. SK-1 Robert J. Clark, the duty officer at the US Navy Pinecastle Electronic Warfare Range in Ocala National Forest, Florida, receives a call from Rocky Morgan reporting an oblong-shaped UFO with an intensely bright, flashing light near Silver Glen Springs. Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center reports no aircraft in the area. Clark and the base air controller, Gary Collison, climb an observation tower and contact external security to alert radar technician Timothy Collins. They watch a cluster of stationary lights at an estimated altitude of 1,600 feet to the west-northwest perhaps 3 miles away. Collins activates the MSQ-102 Radar. After a 20-minute warmup, the radar detects an unidentified blip fluttering over the tower. The tracking computer is put on the target, which is showing very little movement. At 11:20 p.m., his radar locks on to it at treetop level. It seems to be as large as a jetliner. 10–15 minutes later it vanishes from both sight and radar, but at

11:40 p.m. he sees a similar object 15° to the north. Collins tries to train the radar on the object, but it disappears suddenly. Around midnight, another object is seen 3 miles to the northwest. For 5 seconds it moves at 575 mph, then accelerates for 2 seconds, and executes a hairpin turn in one second—a radical reversal of direction. Now the UFO is shooting northward toward the base, slowing to a mere 3 mph. Collins finally locks on this object. Shortly afterward, the target vanishes. A dozen naval personnel visually observe red, green, and white lights from the control tower for more than an hour. The captain of the Lisa C on the Apalachicola River also witnesses the lights at 10:30 p.m. (or 1:00 a.m.).

By the roadside he sees 2–4 men about 5 feet tall wearing tightly fitting black “diver suits.” The men have green faces, slanting eyes, and webbed fingers; they move in a jumping motion and invite him into a “bus-shaped” white rectangular vehicle hovering nearby. The interior looks like a completely black room outfitted only in benches. He is examined by an apparatus that looks like an X-ray machine, and the men offer to share with him a transparent substance that they are eating, but he declines.

June — GEPAN’s Scientific Council meets for the second time. This time, a five-volume report totaling 670 pages is prepared. The first volume is a synthesis written by [Claude Poher](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Poher&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106801927&usg=AOvVaw22E9Cv8G_2A0ilyPx92uE5). Volumes 2–4 contain 10 detailed field investigations and the fifth volume gathers other studies and less detailed cases. The reports are never published.

June 2 — 10:00 p.m. A married couple driving toward Hameenlinna, Finland, watch a formation of 7–9 bright lights in the eastern sky. After 8 seconds, they disappear behind trees. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 5 (May 1978): 2)

June 10 — 9:30 p.m. A dark, silent wedge-shaped object with a square formation of white lights in the back and a triangular formation of red and white lights in the front paces a car driven by two students, ages 21 and 19, as they

travel east on State Highway 299 near New Paltz, New York. The UFO turns south toward them and passes over their car. The male student gets out and runs underneath it, noting it is as large as his outstretched hand at arm’s length. It shoots off toward the southwest horizon in a few seconds. (“Case 3-7-121,” IUR 3, no. 7 (July 1978): 4)

June 11 — 10:30 p.m. Capt. Namdar, the pilot of a Boeing 707 flying from Shiraz to Tehran, Iran, is descending to 25,000 feet over Isfahan. He sees a huge, purple form passing below him at amazing speed. The Tehran airport cannot confirm a radar tracking. Suddenly the plane’s cabin is flooded with brilliant yellow light radiating from two sources. It feels as hot as “a sunny day in summer in Spain.” The purple light continues to follow the plane until a portion of the UFO separates from it and moves toward the southeast side of the witnesses. Then the original object vanishes. (“Review of Iranian UFO Reports,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 2 (Jan./Feb. 1981): 15)

June 11 — 11:28 p.m. After hearing reports of unidentified aircraft from two previous sentries, Gunnery Sgt. Brininger and PFC Johnny Johnson, go on sentry patrol at Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County, New Jersey. Standing outside on an 80-foot tower, the two men watch a distinctly outlined, illuminated white ball with a short conical tail approach from the south. Within 5 seconds, the object moves west of their position and 20°–30° up Briniger estimates that the ice-cream cone shaped UFO is as close as 300 feet away and 200 feet in the air, flying parallel to the fence line. He directs a spotlight at the object, which abruptly makes a sharp turn to the west. It is in sight for 8–10 seconds.

June 15 — Before 3:00 a.m. The Russian motor ship Novokuznetsk is departing from the Gulf of Guayaquil, Ecuador. The crew sees from the bow four rapidly departing bright white trails about 66 feet in length. At the same time, two other trails 33 feet long approach the vessel. Later, straight ahead of the ship, a white luminescent sphere rises up from the water, flies around the ship, hovers for a few seconds at an altitude of 60 feet, flies higher, zigzags, and dives back into the water, (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, pp. 66–67)

June 17 — 4:30 a.m. Patrolmen Robert Fiorentino and Amthony Puglio of the Maplewood (New Jersey) Police Department see a soundless triangular UFO, twice the size of the full moon, while on patrol.

June 19 — 1:30 a.m. Franck Pavia and Jean-Marc Guitard are stopped on the side of a road in Gujan-Mestras, Gironde, France, to repair a turn signal when suddenly all the lights in the town go out. A powerful rumble startles them, and they notice an oval, red object surrounded by white flames flying toward them at an altitude of 11,000 feet. Jean-Marc is unable to breathe and faints. The object then changes direction and shoots away. They knock on the door of a baker named Varisse to tell their story, visibly terrified. At about the same time, a restaurant manager named Bachère is driving toward Bordeaux when he sees a large orange ball, very bright, hovering above La Réole at about 1,000 feet before disappearing. It reappears at the same spot one minute later.

July — 1:00 p.m. A witness and his father are driving a U-Haul truck north on Interstate 65 near Ardmore, Alabama. Just after passing the welcome center, they look up and see a large silver ball on the tree line to the east. After disagreeing on whether it is a weather balloon, they stop the truck and get out to look. A door slides open in the bottom of the object and a smaller silver ball emerges and moves to their right, and a second comes out and moves to the left. They both hover for about 5 minutes, then return one at a time to the larger object, which stands motionless a few more minutes before slowly moving away to the northeast. Suddenly it shoots away at great speed. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Satellite Objects: A Further Look,” IUR 29, no. 2 (Summer 2004): 6–7)

July 4 — Two Italian Air Force sergeants (Franco Padellero and Attilio di Salvatore), an Italian Navy NCO (Maurizio Esposito), and Antonina di Pietro are driving in the Parco dell’Etna, Sicily, Italy, when they spot a triangular formation of three red pulsating lights above Monte Sona. They stop the car for a better look. One of the lights breaks away from the group and approaches as close as 980 feet before disappearing. They drive in that direction and stop by a ravine to look at a luminous disc that gives off a yellow light about 325 feet away. Five or six very tall entities are standing next to it. Two of them walk up the ravine to within 16 feet of the witnesses. They are dressed in tight-fitting white coveralls and have shoulder-length hair. The two smile, and one points to the disc, which is radiating multicolored lights. The lights go out temporarily when another car drives by. Duration is 35 minutes.

July 11 — 11:20 p.m. A man driving alone in a remote area on State Highway 100 three miles south of Waterbury, Vermont, sees a beam of light descend from the trees. It is about 1.5–2 feet in diameter but spreads out into a cone that covers the entire street and moves toward his car, illuminating the interior like “40 flash cameras.” The reflection off the car hood is dazzling. Petrified for 45 seconds, he finally sticks his head out the door and feels considerable heat. The light shrinks and dims, revealing the silhouette of a saucer darker than the sky and about 80–100 feet in diameter. The object is at treetop level and has small steady white lights on each side and a rib-like structure on the bottom. After hovering above the car a few seconds, it moves southwest about 200 yards and then takes off almost simultaneously. (“Case 3-8-129,” IUR 3, no. 8 (August 1978): 4)

July 14 — Dawn. A Spanish Army unit on an exercise in Mazarrón, Murcia, Spain, watches an unfamiliar group of lights for two hours above a road: a red light that vanishes occasionally, two greenish-white lights that shine sporadically, and four white lights that appear irregularly and fly without any specific formation. Their height over the terrain is estimated at 13–100 feet. The lights oscillate and move forward, leaving the road and moving around obstacles like houses and hills, then coming back to the road in front of the group of soldiers. A reconnaissance of the area the following night reveals nothing unusual, except the antenna of a meteorological station that probably was not the source of the lights. (Swords 434)

July 19 — 9:30 p.m. A teacher is driving with his wife through Hudson, New York, when they spot a motionless, amber- colored, curved object in the sky as wide as a full moon. It remains behind them as they drive to a friend’s house, where they join another couple to watch it. The light suddenly goes out, and 30 seconds later they hear a roar that moves off to the southeast. (“Case 3-9-19,” IUR 3, no. 9 (September 1978): 6)

July 20 — 1:20 a.m. A soldier on duty at the main gate of the military section of the Logroño-Agoncillo Airport in La Rioja, Spain, sees a strange object in the air. A second lieutenant and a corporal get to the gate in time to watch for 5 minutes an object moving slowly and noiselessly east to west some 3,300 feet above the ground. Two of the witnesses describe it as lozenge-shaped, while the other two say it has the shape of a triangle. All agree that there is an intense white light flashing at one-second intervals in the center, while other lights appear in various parts of the dark object. It continues to fly steadily until it disappears from sight. (Swords 434)

July 21 — 9:30 p.m. Chloene Bechdolt notices a bright red light near the ground in the north field of her farm near Uniopolis, Ohio. She goes inside and around 10:00 p.m. notices that the light is still there and larger in size. She goes back outside and approaches the light, thinking it might be poachers. She thinks she hears someone talking, so she shouts a warning at it. The object makes a hum and shoots straight up. On July 23, she and her nephew find a 100-foot circular area of cut beans in the field, and the timothy stubble looks like it has been scorched about one inch from the ground.

After about 90 seconds, the “rays” collapse inward in sequence, and the object slowly extinguishes itself. During the sighting, the couple notice with

some puzzlement that the normally busy street is strangely quiet and devoid of people and traffic. (Clark III 866; Jenny Randles, UFO Reality, R. Hale, 1983)

July 22 — 1:15 p.m. A retired couple in Ventura, California, is attracted outdoors by an odd noise and see a silver form moving overhead.

August 20 — 7:30 p.m. A 64-year old security guard is on patrol in downtown Toledo, Ohio, looking at a “large plane” approaching from the north. As it passes overhead at a uniform speed, about 1,500–2,000 feet up, it is seen as a cigar with small brackets. It is dull silver, distinctly outlined, and twice the angular size of the full moon. It then continues its straight path southbound to the horizon. (“A Daylight Urban ‘Cigar,’” IUR 3, no. 12 (December 1978): 14)

August 21 — 5:00 p.m. A witness sketches an oblong UFO over an open area near Banksville, New York. It is at least 150–200 feet long with while and blue colors, two lights in front, and silent.

August 21 — 5:30 p.m. A 33-year old housewife, in the company of her children, 8 and 10, watches a silver Frisbee-like object from their front porch 3 miles north of downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. Standing outdoors, they see the saucer in the southeast, much larger than a full moon would look, perhaps as large as a car. The Frisbee has a sharp outline and metallic appearance. No sound can be heard over the heavy traffic noise. According to the children, it then shoots over to the southwest in two seconds. Finally, it moves straight up out of sight in an instant. Duration is 5–8 minutes. (“A Daylight ‘Frisbee,’” IUR 3, no. 12 (December 1978): 14)

August 21 — Night. The Madagascar Interior Ministry announces that a UFO has crashed and exploded in the marketplace at Fort-Dauphin. Radio Madagascar says that the cigar-shaped object had lit up the ground before plunging downward. Locals rush out of bed to put out the flames.

August 22 — 7:03 a.m. Four men are driving in a carpool from Moscow, Pennsylvania, to work at the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Coolbaugh Township on I-380. They watch a small circular “cloud” descend suddenly in the south. It changes to a bright silver and hovers, rocking from side to side. It now looks solid and metallic. It rises slightly

and flies off to the southeast at an estimated 800–900 mph. (“A Daylight ‘Cloud,’” IUR 3, no. 12 (December 1978): 14)

August 22 — An oval-shaped translucent object ringed by a halo of light flies silently over the Andes Mountains in Neuquen province, Argentina, in a 300-mile path.

August 23 — 8:04 p.m. P. A. Hadden is on board the tanker MV Ficus in the Indian Ocean \[or the South China Sea\] 260 miles from the Malacca Strait. He watches an elongated triangle formation of three lights moving in from 60° above the northeast horizon. When they reach 75°, nearly overhead, the lights suddenly stop. He estimates them to be 100 miles high. The light in the right rear continues moving in the opposite direction of the ship and off to its left at great speed, disappearing in the distance; the light in the left rear shifts over to occupy the position in the formation it had occupied. After 5 seconds of remaining still, it shoots back to the left again and departs at high speed. The remaining light rushes forward, following the same path as the first light. Total duration of the sighting is 1 minute 20 seconds. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 10/11 (Oct./Nov. 1978): 2)

August 24 — 10:00 p.m. A 54-year old cook is driving north from her brother’s house about 10 miles south of Ottumwa, Iowa. She is on Cliffland Road alongside the Des Moines River in a wooded, rural area. A full-moon-sized red- orange light shoots silently from the east to the west in several seconds. As it flies across the front of her car, her windshield fogs up and the car stalls out to a stop. The interference lasts only a few seconds, and the car restarts without her turning the key; the window defogs as quickly as it had steamed up. She last sees the light against a background of trees up ahead, lower than the treetops. (“Car Interference in Iowa,” IUR 3, no. 12 (December 1978): 14)

August 24 — 11:40 p.m. Two 19-year old girls, driving west near tiny Ginghamsburg, Ohio, watch two oddly colored orange lights twice the size of aircraft landing lights. A humming sound can be heard both from the lights and from the car radio. The driver can’t get the car to go faster than about 20 mph. The lights are coming from the left, one directly over the other. They look away momentarily and the lights are gone; they look again, and the lights are moving above the car. From the south they have moved to the northwest over a field. A rod or a light beam comes down from one ball of light and shines a light at the witnesses for one second. The driver tries to flash the car lights at it, to no avail. They look away briefly and do not notice how the lights vanish. (“Car Interference in Ohio?” IUR 3, no. 12 (December 1978): 14)

August 27 — 1:40 p.m. Arthur Silva is flying a Cessna 150 about 10 miles north of Provincetown, Massachusetts, with Harold Johnson as passenger. Johnson sees a bright reflective object at the same altitude (2,500 feet) directly ahead about 4 miles away. It moves closer, picking up speed and shooting by them at about 600 mph, apparently missing the plane by 1,000 feet. It is a silvery-white, metallic sphere with no wings and about 18 feet in diameter. (“Daylight Sphere over Massachusetts,” IUR 3, no. 12 (December 1978): 15)

September 1 — After 8:00 p.m. Several villagers in Llanerchymedd, Anglesey, Wales, including some teenagers and a man hunting rabbits, watch a bright white light descend slowly behind a new housing estate. An egg-shaped object is seen hovering and illuminating the trees. Other independent witnesses see a large silvery sphere above a field and watch the cows panic and hear neighborhood dogs start barking furiously. A Mrs. Parry and her young daughter look out from an upstairs bedroom and see three tall men in gray uniforms with caps or helmets attached to their suits walking across a field. Some of the teens run to the village to alert the police, who upon their arrival find the village in an uproar, thinking it has been invaded. At 10:00 p.m., Vivienne Roberts sees a purplish object with a mass of yellow lights above the vicarage. Her horses begin to panic and sweat profusely. Later, UFO investigators triangulate the position of the supposed landing site and find a circular patch of flattened barley and a path leading up to it.

September 2 — 8:00–8:15 a.m. Roberto Pozzi, 14, hears a noise like ducks and hissing combined in a western suburb of Alessandrio, Piedmont, Italy. He sees an object over a nearby cornfield. It stops making noise, swings laterally, and shoots up into the air. He finds a 22-by-10-foot depressed area of cornstalks bent down halfway up the stalk. Two rows of stalks are bent to the east, a third row to the west. Other sightings take place in the same area around Alessandrio on September 3, 6, 7, and 13.

September 3 — 10:00 p.m. Edilia Cresta Gallo and three other women see a strip of white light descend between a road and a maize field in Alessandrio, Piedmont, Italy. The strip morphs into a bright fireball about 5 feet wide. It disappears and reappears twice more. The women complain of a burning sensation in their eyes.

September 4 — 12:15 a.m. A university professor in Gordon, Wisconsin, sees a flashing, pale-yellow ball of light as he is driving north on US Highway 53. It crosses the road in front of him only 50 feet away at an estimated 160 mph. It makes a sharp 90° turn parallel to the road, descending to about 15 feet, and travels parallel to his car at 60 mph about 150 feet west of the road. As he slows down to 20 mph for a better look, the light also slows down. When the light is 250 feet ahead, it goes out. (“A Professorial Witness,” IUR 4, no. 1 (July 1979): 11)

September 6 — 6:45 a.m. Juan O. Perez, 12, goes to gather a herd of horses near Venado Tuerto, Argentina. As he rides his horse, he senses something flying overhead. Several objects appear and begin maneuvering and shooting out beams of multicolored light. His horse panics, and Perez manages to ride home. His father berates him and tells him to go back. When he returns, he finds a large domed object with windows on the ground. A door opens and a 7-foot-tall being wearing gloves and a cylindrical helmet appears. It seems to be attached to the object by some type of breathing apparatus. It invites Perez inside the craft, so he ties his horse to a ladder protruding from the bottom of the object and climbs in. His horse is panicked again and keeps kicking the object, injuring its leg.

Inside, he sees a panel with buttons and some tables. A robot-like entity is cutting some animal bones into pieces. Perez tries touching the tall being and objects inside but is prevented by an invisible barrier. Perez jumps out the door and back to the ground. The tall being follows him outside. Perez asks for one of the giant’s gloves as proof of his experience. When it takes off the glove, Perez sees a green, claw-like hand with blue metallic nails. The tall being then pricks Perez’s right arm and apparently extracts some blood. As Perez rides home with the glove, two flying objects catch up to him and emit a small slab and sphere that descend and brush by the horse. They pull the glove up with a magnetic force. The wound on Perez’s arm stays open for many years and seeps a transparent liquid. A scar remains six years later when Perez has a medical check-up for military service; he is declared unfit because of the story he tells about its origin. After the event, Perez begins having premonitory dreams about unfortunate events.

September 7 — 8:40 p.m. Many people in the San Michele boarding house in Sassello, Savona, Italy, see a large luminous object hovering above La Carta to the east. The boarding house owner, Piera Viacava, switches on the TV, but the picture is distorted. The light moves south for a few minutes. Franco Viacava drives off in a Fiat with two friends toward the light, but their engine loses power and slows down. The radio and tape player also malfunction briefly. A French woman driving in the area has her car stopped as the object hovers suddenly above her. Her dog barks until the light goes away and the car resumes working.

September 13 — 9:30 p.m. Angelo Ciompi watches a reddish disc moving in the eastern sky above Spinetta Marengo, Italy. It stops abruptly, drops down, and is lost to sight behind some houses. A column of flames rises up from the spot. Ciompi and others rush to the area and see a fire burning in the brushwood-covered wasteland. Firemen put out the blaze, but the area is overflown by lights in the evening that descend and ascend at the site. (“UFO Flap 1978: Italian Style,” IUR 4, no. 3/4 (Oct./Nov. 1979): 15)

September 14 — 6:00 a.m. Hundreds of witnesses all over Italy, from Sicily to Florence, watch a luminous projectile moving northward. Italian ufologists are calling it a UFO rather than a meteor because a few accounts have it moving in a different direction or appearing to stop briefly. Probable meteor.

September 15 — 2:30 a.m. A 31-year-old woman is lying in bed awake for 30 minutes at her home in Delano, Tennessee, when a funny feeling makes her look outside. She stands at the south window looking out at fields and sees a bright moon and an object with lights in a long shape, red and pink as if on fire, in the southwest. Two “normal” men dressed in white suits can be seen about 300 feet from the window, but it is too dark for details. They start moving toward the house, but then stop and turn back. The UFO comes in fast at this point very close to the ground, then leaves quickly, climbing to the west.

September 15 — 4:00 a.m. A 26-year-old secretary is awakened in Carpentersville, Illinois, by a whirring sound. She goes to the bedroom window to look outside. The noise stops, but then she sees the figure of a 6-foot tall man. He is dressed in a silvery suit. Several feet away from him she sees a small, silver, domed disc (about 3 feet wide by 2 feet tall) sitting on the edge of the grass. It is opaque and smooth and the source of the whirring sound. The witness then screams at her husband to wake up, and her dog starts barking furiously. They both try to phone the police but the phone is not working. When the police arrive 15 minutes later, both the visitor and the UFO are gone.

lights and TV to go out. When Faralli is driving home at 9:00 p.m. on the Via Pié agli Orti, the engine and lights of his car die. He feels paralyzed as he watches a domed disc come near and float inches from the ground. The dome opens up and two 3.5-foot-tall beings emerge, floating 4 inches from the ground. They are wearing green one-piece suits; their helmets have clear visors and two small spiraling antennas. Their faces look like green- skinned skulls through the visors. Faralli watches them make a full circle around the car without noise or gesture, then return to the UFO, which rises up several yards, seemingly propelled by three red, orange, and blue-colored beams, and shoots off vertically. The car starts on its own. He returns to the site the following day and finds three burn marks in the unpaved road. Digging into the ground, he finds the earth carbonized to a depth of 8 inches.

Soil samples are taken to the European Atomic Energy Community labs at Ispra, which finds that the road material has been burned by a temperature less than 500° Celsius, and not by a bonfire or hydrocarbon fuels.

September 18 — 3:30 p.m. Giorgio Filiputti is fishing in the Corno river at the point where the Zumiel irrigation canal runs into it south of San Giorgio di Nogaro, Udine, Italy, when he hears a whistling sound, sees vegetation rustling, and feels a blast of air. Climbing up the riverbank to investigate, he sees a domed disc about 13–16 feet in diameter that is resting on a mudflat 66 feet away. The object is brassy or yellowish metallic with telescopic legs that terminate in flat pads. A figure about 3.5 feet tall appears from behind the dome, walking around the rim. It wears tight-fitting coveralls of scaly, silvery material that sparkles in the sunlight. It wears boots, has two containers at waist level, and white gloves. Its face is dark bronze with almond-shaped eyes and large pupils. The entity stares at the shocked Filiputti. After a few minutes it begins walking again, stoops down, and works on a horseshoe-shaped protrusion on the dome. Finally, it continues walking around to the other side. Filiputti hears a rumbling sound and a piercing whistle as the object begins to rise, withdrawing its landing gear. The underside looks like it has a grid pattern, and it emits a bluish glow like a tongue of flame. When it reaches an altitude of 33 feet, it turns on edge and speeds out of sight to the southwest. He has been watching it for about 6 minutes. Three circular imprints about 20 inches in diameter are found in the dry mud and sand.

September 20 — 3:40 p.m. G. W. Schoen is spreading fertilizer on a farm near Westminster, Maryland, when he notices a gray, pear-shaped object tilted at an angle and flying above the edge of a wooded area. He can see plates, girders, cylinders, and other structures on it. Schoen senses that it is exerting a mild “pulling” force on him. It is visible for 30–35 seconds before it passes behind a cloud. He estimates it is 340–350 feet long.

September 21 — 8:00 p.m. A young man walking near a yard in Cosenza, Calabria, Italy, sees the area illuminated as if by daylight. The surrounding blocks are lost to view. On a hill he sees an oval object and a human shape with two antennae. Frightened, he runs away but falls as four humanoids come closer to him by jumps. He faints, and when he comes to he is surrounded by four entities wearing buttoned jackets, a rucksack, and helmets with antennae.

Their hands look like pincers. He faints again and walks up at 8:30 p.m., but the UFO and entities are gone. (Paolo Fiorino, Gian Paolo Grassino, and Antonio Chiumiento, “Abductions in Italy,” IUR 14, no. 4 (July/Aug.1989): 15)

September 23 — 4:30 a.m. Carlos Acevedo and Angel Moya are driving a Citroën CG on the flat pampas south of Buenos Aires, Argentina, stragglers on the final leg of a 39-day stock car race. They notice a yellow and violet light shining in their rear-view mirror, approaching fast. Suddenly, the engine and headlights quit, then the car is lifted 15 feet off the road and set down again one minute later 75 miles north. The gasoline tank is also allegedly drained.

September 23 — 1:28 p.m. A man is driving past a cattle lot 2 miles north of Dexter, Iowa, when he sees a silver cigar- shaped object 150 feet above the ground. He jumps out of his truck and tries to get underneath it as it hovers, but it moves off to the northeast and is gone in less than a minute. (“Another Daylight Cigar,” IUR 4, no. 1 (July 1979): 12)

September 23–24 — Around 12:00 midnight. Two cable car technicians at the Bâlea Lake resort, Romania, are awakened by a red light visible through dense fog. It is apparently coming from an object some 30 feet outside their

window. The light disappears. At the same time, at a military barracks on the site where soldiers have been assigne dwork duties, Cpl. Ioan Dörr gets up and goes outside for a drink of water from a tap at the corner of the building and sees a dark, motionless silhouette only a few feet away. It persists for at least another 5 minutes. The next evening at 11:45 p.m., Sgt. Ion Radu notices a dark figure about 8 feet tall moving slowly on a mound some 65 feet away. Noticing that something had broken open the shutters of their barracks windows, some of the soldiers begin throwing stones at it. Radu approaches to within 4 feet of the figure and raises a club to hit it, but he feels a hot blast and falls backward into the snow. Two other soldiers with him remain paralyzed for a few seconds. The entity moves away with kind of a floating motion. Radu remains unconscious for about 10 minutes as the soldiers try to resuscitate him. Five soldiers see a “wreath of lights” at the spot where the figure had stood and others hear mysterious scratching at the window shutters. The next morning they find four parallel scratches on the shutters about 4 inches apart. The soldiers all decide to spend the next night at a nearby resort. (Romania 130–132)

September 24 — 5:30 p.m. Two witnesses see a silver oval moving from east to west in Vineland, New Jersey. (“Daylight Oval,” IUR 4, no. 1 (July 1979): 13)

September 26 — 12:05 a.m. A 19-year-old grocery worker is driving on Lunn Road in Strongsville, Ohio, when she sees on her left a flat-domed disc edge on. She stops her car, and the object moves closer. When it is right in front of her car over the road, her FM radio gets lost in static for 10–15 seconds and her headlights flash off for one second. Then the object slowly rises up and flies off out of sight to her right. (“Another EM Story,” IUR 4, no. 1 (July 1979): 13)

September 27 — 8:00 a.m. Katarzyna Kolińska is on her way to school in Przyrownica from Magnusy, Poland, when she sees a bright flash of light near a mountain. The children who arrive at the school before classes go to a small nearby grove of trees to play. There they encounter a strange man, 5.5 feet tall with a green face and dark costume, who is walking through the forest 30 feet away. He turns to face the children, and they panic and run back to school, one child losing his shoe in the rush. The teacher returns with some of the children to the spot, but student Anna Jarocińska goes in the wrong direction and meets only 480 feet from the school a being whose face is a “featureless mask.” (Poland 43–45)

September 27 — 1:00 p.m. Henryk Marciniak is picking mushrooms in the forest near Golina, Poland. He notices a strange landed object standing on four legs about 330 feet away in a clearing. When he rides over to investigate, a door opens and two small beings with unpleasant faces and greenish skin emerge, walking down some steps that have appeared. They approach him, one poking at the motorcycle and the other holding a device like a camera.

The first one takes his bag of mushrooms. Marciniak shakes hands with them and tries to indicate the mushrooms are edible and the bike is for riding. Suddenly a buzzing sound comes from the object. The two entities go back inside and the object takes off and disappears. Many years later Marciniak denies the story, possibly because he wants to be left alone. (Poland 45–46)

September 27 — 7:25 p.m. Two witnesses see a formation of lights above a suburban forest preserve in Gurnee, Illinois. One steady red light is on top, two steady yellow lights are below them, and one blue flashing light is seen briefly.

October — John Acuff’s mismanagement of NICAP (destruction of the reporting network, loss of members, paying himself a $20,000 contractor’s fee) leads to his resignation as director. Acuff remains on the board and keeps the case files in his personal possession. He is replaced by Alan Hall, a retired CIA employee who accepts the position after a number of other ex-CIA men are offered the job. Support for Hall on the NICAP board comes from Charles Lombard, an aide to Sen.

October? — 12:00 noon. Two Chilean F-5 aircraft piloted by Capts. Hernán Gabrielli Rojas and Danilo Catalán Farias are on a training mission near Mejillones, Chile. Both pilots see a radar target that gives a return equal to 10 aircraft carriers. Ground radar at Cerro Moreno airport \[now Andrés Sabella Gálvez International Airport\] in Antofagasta picks up the object and confirms its large size. The pilots continue to fly south between 30,000–35,000 feet. At a distance of 20 miles, they see an object “like a plantain banana” swathed in smoke. They approach it cautiously with their gun cameras on, but the UFO disappears at a huge speed to the west, heading toward Easter Island, vanishing from all three radar screens. Duration is 5 minutes.

October 2 — 11:15 a.m. Four students, ages 12–16, from Despatch, Eastern Cape, South Africa, are hiking in the Groendal Nature Reserve when they see a silver object on the ground. About 900 feet to the west of it are two beings in silver suits that seem to glide without walking. A third being joins them, holding a silver “suitcase,” and they glide along a fence along a steep incline a short way before vanishing. The silver object disappears too.

Later, three forest workers find 7-inch oval footprints about one mile from the site. On October 18, three South African police officers and two trackers visit the encounter site and find a large area of depressed grass with 8 symmetrical marks around its perimeter and 4 marks within the oval area.

October 6 — 3:00 a.m. Two witnesses driving west on US Highway 87 halfway between Capulin and Des Moines, New Mexico, see an octagonal object several times larger than the moon with light shining through sections of it. As it passes above their car, it seems to be metallic. (“The Octagonal Tank,” IUR 4, no. 1 (July 1979): 14)

October 7 — A woman is driving with her 13-year-old nephew near San Cataldo, Sicily, Italy, when one of her tires has a blow-out. She repairs the tire but cannot start the car again. Above at an altitude of 50 feet, she sees a silver object resembling a plate turned upside down, about 65 feet in diameter. It emits a strong light, and the bottom has a transparent door through which she can see three or four shadows passing behind it. The UFO leaves quickly with a humming sound after 5–10 minutes.

October 20 — Dusk. Kate Chmurny, an archaeologist at Plymouth State College in New Hampshire, watches a triangular object flying at 30 mph northward along Interstate 93 at a height of 100 feet above the Pemigewasset River floodplain in Campton, New Hampshire. It is about 20 feet wide and completely silent, moving by raising and lowering one side. The object has a single bright white light on the underside and rows of red and greenish lights along the edges that reflect against a metallic surface. (Joseph K.

October 21 — 7:06 p.m. Australian pilot [Frederick Valentich](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/90220097/frederick-valentich&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106880975&usg=AOvVaw0ZBfM1HVjWPGPTJba82lzb)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/90220097/frederick-valentich&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106881259&usg=AOvVaw36kXnf1FMPc5Jg8qTgEmLC) 20, is on a 145-mile training flight in a Cessna 182L light aircraft over Bass Strait between Moorabbin, Victoria, and King Island. He radios Melbourne air traffic control to report that an unidentified aircraft is following him at 4,500 feet. He is told there is no known traffic at that level. Valentich can see a large, unknown aircraft that appears to be illuminated by four bright landing lights. He is unable to confirm its type but says it has passed about 1,000 feet overhead and is moving at high speed. Then he says the aircraft is approaching him from the east, thinking that the other pilot might be purposely toying with him. The other aircraft is “orbiting” above him. It has a shiny metal surface and a green light on it. Then he begins experiencing engine problems. Asked to identify the aircraft, Valentich radios, “It’s not an aircraft.” His transmission is then interrupted by unidentified noise described as being “metallic, scraping sounds” before all contact is lost. A sea and air search is undertaken that includes oceangoing ship traffic, an RAAF Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, plus eight civilian aircraft. The search encompasses more than 1,000 square miles. Search efforts cease on October 25 without result. A Department of Transport investigation into the disappearance is unable to determine the cause, but it is “presumed fatal” for Valentich. In 1983, an engine cowl flap is found washed ashore on Flinders Island. In July 1983, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation asks the Royal Australian Navy Research Laboratory about the likelihood that the cowl flap might have traveled to its final position from the area where the aircraft disappeared. The bureau notes that “the part has been identified as having come from a Cessna 182 aircraft between a certain range of serial numbers.” which includes Valentich’s aircraft. At least 15 other UFOs are reported between midday and 9:00 p.m., six in Victoria, one on King Island, and others further away. Roy Manifold, vacationing at Crayfish Bay, Cape Otway, Victoria, inadvertently takes two photos of peculiar black objects just 20 minutes before Valentich reported his sighting.

October 25 — 5:00 a.m. Giuseppe di Giovanni, a 51-year-old farmer, is in search of a stray cow in the hills of San Donato di Tagliacozzo, Abruzzo, Italy, when he comes to an open field and spots a large light-brown object shaped like a shoeshine box on the ground. Lighted windows surround the craft. He approaches to within 3 feet and sees 6–7 humanoid beings inside. They are small and humanlike, both male and female.

October 26 — Night. RCMP Constable James Blackwood receives a report about a UFO hovering above Random Island across from Clarenville, Newfoundland. He heads down to the waterfront and sees an object about 200 feet above the sound. He observes it for nearly two hours with binoculars and a high-powered scope. It is soundless, oval, and has a fin on its tail. When Blackwood flashes the lightbar on his cruiser, the object mimics it by flashing some lights of its own.

October 28 — 10:45 p.m. Joyce Blackburn is putting out milk bottles on the step of her bungalow on the south side of Warrington, England. She sees a strange light hovering above the Fiddler’s Ferry Power Station. Her husband and two children also watch the UFO until it starts pulsating and moving away. Its glow is so bright that their eyes hurt in looking at it through binoculars. It vanishes, then reappears heading toward them at an angle. They can see it is a disc with a dome on top, tilted slightly toward them. As it passes over their heads, they hear a faint humming noise and can see three orange bumps in a triangular formation on its underside. It moves away to the northeast toward another power station. Total duration is 7 minutes. (Jenny Randles, “Fake Photographs, Real Sightings,” IUR 11, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1986): 10–11)

November 20 — 9:30 p.m. A female medical technician, her sister, daughter, and two housemaids experience a power failure in their home in a northern suburb of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. They see a bright light in the sky that shoots out bright blue rays. It moves off behind a hill, and two small lights, one yellow, the other reddish, approach from the same hill. The witnesses run upstairs and watch from a window. The lights stop next to a road, the Avenida de los Martires, as a car comes along and illuminates them with its headlights. The women now see that the lights are attached to the abdomens of two flying entities, which appear to be cone-shaped, twice as tall as a normal-sized man, and wearing white translucent sheets. Three silhouettes cross the car’s headlights, and all the lights (including the car’s) go out. The witnesses hear a metallic noise like a garage door. Then the two lights turn on again and fly off. The power in the house returns. The episode lasts 45 minutes.

November 21 — 5:30 a.m. A UFO appears over a Kuwaiti oilfield at Al-Sabriyah near the Iraqi border. An employee of the company takes photos of it as it passes a water tower and then hovers over the site for 30 minutes. Long- distance communications cease functioning. The internal phone system works, however, and workers are able to alert their boss, who steps outside and sees the object.

November 22 — 5:30 p.m. Elsie Oakensen is driving home to Church Stowe, Northamptonshire, England, on the A5 when she passes beneath a hovering object shaped like a dumbbell with red and green lights. As she turns onto Main Street, her foot is flat on the accelerator but there is no sound from her engine and her car coasts to a halt. Her car lights fail as circles of light dance around the road, illuminating a nearby farmyard. The car restarts, but she only drives about 300 feet when it stops again. She claims the “natural light” disappears and she is enveloped in pure darkness. Then suddenly a white circle of light approximately 3 feet in diameter shines on the road, as if someone has pressed on a switch, the normal light returns, and she drives the car normally. She estimates she has about 15 minutes of missing time. Later, at 7:10 p.m., she feels a tightening sensation around her forehead, one that she remembers having felt just prior to the encounter. At 7:20 p.m., four young women driving through the nearby village of Preston Capes see red and green lights and beams shooting out from clouds as their car engine temporarily loses power. After trying hypnosis with minimal results, Oakensen tries creative visualization at the

scene and recovers some abduction memories.

November 24 — 11:45 a.m. Angelo d’Ambros, 61, is out gathering firewood in a copse near Gallio, Vicenza, Italy, when he comes across two entities just a few feet away from him. One is about 4 feet tall, the other about 8 inches shorter. They are suspended in the air about a foot off the ground. They are extremely thin and have a yellowish skin that is stretched tightly over their bones. Their heads are bald, and at the sides are enormous ears that rise vertically and end in points. Their eyes are large and white, without eyelids. Their large noses extend down to the lower lip of a sizable mouth from which extend two tusks. They wear tight-fitting coveralls. The smaller one starts moving back and forth from right to left in very quick jerks. Its motion causes a stir in the air, and vegetation rustles as the tips of its ears touch the lower branches of nearby trees. Incomprehensible grumblings come from the mouth of the shorter entity. The taller being reaches one of its long hands to take away d’Ambros’s pruning knife. D’Ambros holds on to it tightly, but he feels a strong electric shock. He grabs a large branch and takes a swipe at them as they take flight. D’Ambros runs after them, and he watches them make for a domed UFO resting in a clearing 100 feet away on four landing pods. The entities climb aboard, and the object takes off horizontally at a dizzying speed in absolute silence and disappears behind high fir trees. The next day he returns to the clearing and finds a nearly circular area about 12 feet in diameter in which the grass appears black, pressed, and whirled in a counterclockwise direction. D’Ambros discovers two U-shaped traces about 8 inches long.

December 6 — 11:30 p.m. While patrolling at Marzano, near Torriglia, a village northeast of Genoa, Italy, 26-year-old night watchman Piero Fortunato Zanfretta notices four lights moving in a courtyard. He gets out of his car holding his pistol and flashlight, moving cautiously along a house wall. Something pushes him forward and he falls. When he gets up, his head hits something and he points his flashlight upward to see a 6-foot-tall creature with an ugly face. Terrified, he runs to the car and is blinded by a yellow, triangle-shaped object taking off from behind the house. He calls for help on the radio. When his colleagues arrive at 1:00 a.m., they find him lying in a nearby lawn in a confused state of mind. On December 23, Zanfretta is hypnotized by a medical doctor. An abduction scenario emerges in which he is taken to a bright room by giant entities who put a hot and painful helmet on his head. The humanoids are green-skinned and have yellow triangular eyes, red veins on their heads, pointed ears, and rounded fingers. Further abductions and memories emerge over time, finally ceasing in 1980.

As they near Christchurch Airport, Powell and his copilot Ian Pirie notice a return on their onboard radar. By the next sweep it has moved one mile closer, moving at about 8,000 mph. They cannot confirm anything visually, but the radar indicates the object has streaked off to the left and disappears. Then Powell and Pirie see a flashing light in front of them.

December 24 — 6:50 p.m. Benito Franchi, 45, is working in the power station at Pietracamela, Terama, Italy, in a room with two AC generators, one connected to power and the other disconnected, when he suddenly feels ill and faint. The working generator’s dial hands register an overload on the network, and the dial hands on the disconnected generator are also waving. This continues for about one minute, leaving the dials badly out of calibration. Franchi feels paralyzed and falls to the ground. Suddenly everything stops, and out of the window he sees three or four bright flashes coming from a ball of brilliant red light that hurts his eyes. The object takes off and disappears to the southwest. Franchi suffers from severe conjunctivitis, and the generator dials must be calibrated again. Shortly afterward, a large luminous UFO is seen hovering above the Gran Sasso massif to the southwest. (1Pinotti 259)

December 30 — 7:30 a.m. Erwin Vitelli sees a steely-blue object hovering in the southern sky above Zuchwil, Solothurn, Switzerland. It appears in the shape of three globes merging with one another, each one with a light source

William Startup and First Officer Robert Guard. While flying from Wellington to Christchurch, New Zealand, with David Crockett and his wife Ngaire as camera crew over the Cook Strait near the site of the Powell sighting, Startup and Guard see 6–7 bright, pulsating lights like Chinese lanterns above the sea off Kaikoura. They fade and disappear, then return to view. Crockett starts filming. Wellington is tracking a target a mile behind the aircraft that stays on the screen for about one minute without moving. Another, stronger target appears to the right of the plane. Fogarty manages to crack, “Let’s hope they’re friendly!” Twice, Startup vainly attempts a 360° turn to get a glimpse of the object.

After landing at Christchurch, Startup invites the passengers to accompany him back to Blenheim. Fogarty, Crockett, and another journalist, Dennis Grant, agree to do so. The plane flies out at 2:15 a.m., and within 2 minutes aircraft radar picks up a target 37 miles away. Startup turns toward it, but it moves to the right and vanishes almost immediately. Other radars pick up targets intermittently. The object returns in view of the plane, moving toward it, then drops out of sight to the right. Afterward, Fogarty notices a strange light that seems to be coming from the cargo hold. Two pulsating white lights soon appear on the port side of the plane. One settles into a rolling, turning pattern and falls at an incredible speed. This sequence Crockett captures on film.

December 31 — 4:00 a.m. Bobby Hines wakes up at her home in Demopolis, Alabama, because her dogs are barking outside. She sees a large, bright object hovering above the trees 1,800 feet from the house and wakes her husband. The UFO is the size of a small house and triangular in shape. It approaches the witnesses, moving in a zigzag pattern and hovering 50 feet off the ground for 30 minutes. Two police officers respond to their call and watch the UFO as well, which finally moves off to the southeast making a funny noise. (Marler 103–104)

December 31 — 7:00 p.m. Hundreds of people in the United Kingdom see a bright light with a long trail behind it streak across the heavens from northwest to southeast. RAF Fylingdales in the North York Moors, England, quickly identifies it as the reentry of a booster rocket that launched a Russian satellite, Kosmos 1068, into orbit on December 26. Jenny Randles examines reports of the reentry, which in general accurately reflect the event, and compares them to UFO reports, concluding that it is unlikely that all UFOs are IFOs in various degrees of exaggeration.

It is an account of a UFO encounter, as experienced by a man in Buckinghamshire, England; in its framing story Langford claims to have found the manuscript in an old desk (the story’s narrator, [William Robert Loosley](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/56241021/william-robert-loosley&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106928318&usg=AOvVaw0iCutnqTGISq8DE0vKbgNx), is a genuine ancestor of Langford’s wife).

Early January — About 6:00 p.m. A1C John W. Mills III is with a second lieutenant conducting a below-ground azimuth alignment procedure at the Ellsworth AFB Delta-3 missile site southwest of Cottonwood, South Dakota, when the security guard bangs on the ladder and tells them to come up. Going topside, they hear a loud, low-frequency hum permeating the launch facility. The guard leads them out of the gate where they see a dark object with straight edges in the sky. It seems to be shaped like a parallelogram, but they can’t tell how high it is. The guard is upset, but the other two men are oddly calm, even though they are not supposed to be outside the gate, and they return to the missile and descend the ladder to continue the alignment. Then the lights go off, the truck engine stops running, the radio goes out, and the missile site goes off alert. The hum is gone, but they can still see the dark object. Some 10 minutes later the lights come back on and they notice the object is gone. Targeting teams from two other launch sites report similar experiences. (Nukes 377–387)

January 4 — Just after 12:00 midnight. Meagen Quezet and her son André go looking for their dog that has just run barking away from their home in Krugersdorp, Gauteng, South Africa. Driving along a remote country road, they find the dog standing 60 feet away from a lead-colored, egg-shaped object with landing gear. Five or six dark- skinned entities are standing in front, wearing white or pink suits and shoes. One with a beard bows to Quezet and says something unintelligible. André runs to get his father, whereupon the beings enter the craft, which takes off making a purring sound. Quezet undergoes hypnotic regression by [Bernard Levinson](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://birthpsychology.com/person/bernard-levinson&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106938040&usg=AOvVaw3tFCZQxr-pDCc-L-BKjNjf) on June 21, where she remembers the “leader” cajoling her to come on board, which she does with her son, seeing lights, panels, chairs, and a table.

January 5 — 6:20 p.m. Anmarie Emery is driving near Auburn, Massachusetts, when she notices three, red-glowing, triangular objects flying over woods to her left. As she rounds a corner, she sees them hovering above the road directly in front of her. The radio goes dead, the car slows to a stop (although the engine continues to run), and she feels completely paralyzed. The closest object is only 30 feet away. She feels heat on her face and smells an unpleasant odor. When another car approaches, the three objects shoot straight up, one at a time, and everything returns to normal. When she returns home to Cambridge, Massachusetts, she notices her face is reddened. She develops a rash and peeling skin the next day. (Richard H.

January 18 — 11:30 p.m. A car driven by a 42-year-old woodcutter stops abruptly in Lusiana, Vicenza, Italy. Its lights go out and the doors open by themselves. An orange ball is sitting in the road ahead, and two 3-foot-tall, copper- colored humanoids emerge from a door. They are wearing metallic-looking, scaled coveralls. Their hands are long and end in pointed nails. They invite him on board by gestures and he follows them into a small room with electronic-looking gadgets and a screen. They begin undressing him, but he resists. The wall opens and an overall garment is shown to him. He refuses to wear it and he implores them to let him go. One of the beings gives him a small box with writing on it. A door opens and the man leaves. Suddenly the orange light disappears and his car lights come on again.

January 20 — The Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research committee releases its report on eight UFO sightings in Kuwait from November to December 14, 1978.

Late January — The Setka-AN group of the USSR Academy of Sciences publishes a skeptical article in the weekly publication Nedelya that tries to show that all UFOs are natural phenomena that UFO enthusiasts are popularizing through their inept investigations as anomalous.

February — A woman and her aunt in Shelby, Ohio, are just sitting down to watch television when a bright light shines outside their window. It is hanging in the air behind their dog kennel. When the woman goes out to investigate, two more lights appear and enter the original one. Then that light disappears and is replaced by red and green lights that resolve into a large number of lights of both colors on an object. As she approaches, the UFO begins to move toward her and passes overhead. It is as big as a jetliner, with bolts on its base as large as volleyballs. Her dog begins whining and cowering, and she gets a severe pain in her head that causes her to fall on her knees. As the object moves away with a soft whirring noise, she gets back on her feet. She estimates she was only outside for 5 minutes, but she and her aunt cannot account for an additional 45–50 minutes. Her headache persists for several weeks. (Michael D. Swords, “Unusual Experiences from the Timmerman Files,” IUR 27, no. 2 (Summer 2002): 22)

February 5 — 9:50 p.m. A man is driving on the Lyell Highway near Lawitta, Tasmania, when his car radio stops.

Seconds later, an intense white light envelops the car, and he cannot see beyond the hood. The car’s lights and motor fail at the same time. The next thing he knows, he is getting stopped in Hobart by police for driving his car without headlights. The police find that he does not know his name, where he has come from, or where he is going. He is taken to the hospital and examined, where he is found to be in a state of shock. It is only at the Royal Hobart Hospital that his memory of the preceding events returns. His vehicle, a Ford Cortina 71TC, is inspected and found to have a dead battery and low oil level. The cut-off switch on the alternator needs replacing, as does some wiring, especially for the headlights. Radiator water is also found to be low.

February 9 — 9:00 p.m. Peter Hathaway is driving on the Bruce Highway north of the Liverpool Creek bridge near Cowley Beach, Queensland, when he sees a “little white light” sitting on the edge of the asphalt. As he approaches within 100 feet, he notices a dark beehive-shaped object behind it, which now rises vertically off the surface about 3 feet. Hathaway is momentarily blinded by a flash of light. Opening his eyes, he sees that his car headlights and engine have stopped. He coasts to a truck rest stop, where his lights come back on and the engine starts perfectly.

February 22 — 4:00 p.m. Two 14-year-old girls, Lynsey Tebbs and Susan Pearson, are tobogganing down the slopes that surround their housing complex in Meanwood, Leeds, England. They are startled by a loud whining noise coming from an object that is descending nearby. After it lands, the noise changes to a hum, which then fades as it rests on the snow. It is gray and egg-shaped, with two fins on either side, and is the size of a small car. Frightened, the girls run up the hill but pause to take another look. The object rests on the ground for about 3 minutes, then starts humming and approaches the girls, landing again on the slope about 80 feet away. After another few minutes, it wobbles and takes off. Investigators from the Yorkshire UFO Society visit the site on February 25 and find odd indentations in the snow in two places.

March — 9:00 a.m. Two Republic of Korea Air Force F-4D Phantom II jets, piloted by Lt. Col. Seungbae Lee and Col. Byungsun Lim, are flying at 15,000 feet while returning from the annual Team Spirit military exercise to Daegu Air Force Base, South Korea. Near Palgong Mountain in the Taebaek Range, a star-like, stationary object appears in the distance that grows in size as the jets approach. Neither the aircraft nor the base can register the object on radar. When they reach within 15 miles of the light, it shoots away to the east and hovers again. The disc is as big as a jumbo jet and radiates bright golden light from top to bottom. Red and blue lights sparkle from its rim.

March 5 — Dusk. Many residents of the Canary Islands are captivated with the sight of a strange sunset. Multicolored concentric rings or bright zigzag trails are seen on the horizon towards the west, forming an enormous cloud. A few minutes after 8:00 p.m., a point of light is seen to ascend, leaving a luminous jet that appears to expand, developing into a huge, bright dome. Independent sets of clear photos are obtained from distant points of view. The phenomenon is even seen from Safi, Morocco. Maj. Pedro Ortega García and Capt. José Juan Abad Cellini investigate for the Spanish Air Force and conclude that the luminous cloud was 320 miles in diameter at an altitude of 40 miles.

March 13 — 11:00 a.m. An uncorrelated radar target is detected over the Mediterranean Sea north of Algeria by radar in the Pegaso control room at Torrejón Air Base in Madrid, Spain. It is traveling at 970 mph on a northwest course toward Spain. Three minutes later a scramble is ordered, and a Dassault Mirage III fighter takes off from Manises Air Base \[now Valencia Airport\] to identify the target, but the track soon vanishes from the radar. It has moved about 71 miles in that time. Four minutes later, the target reappears in another position, this time motionless. The Mirage is vectored toward the new position. When the fighter is about 9 miles from the target, it moves in a northwest direction, accelerating to 840 mph and climbing to more than 15 miles. Six minutes later, it changes course to the northeast, and in two minutes it is gone. The Mirage never gets a visual contact. (Swords 435–436, 527)

March 28 — 4:00 p.m. Reactor number 2 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, suffers a partial meltdown, resulting in a radiation leak. The accident begins with failures in the non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve in the primary system, which allows large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape, contaminating the containment building with thousands of gallons of radioactive water. The staff has no choice but to vent radioactive gases directly into the atmosphere.

The mechanical failures are compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and computer interface oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators. In particular, a hidden indicator light leads to an operator manually overriding the automatic emergency cooling system of the reactor because the operator mistakenly believes that there is too much coolant water present in the reactor and causing the steam pressure release. No one is harmed by the

released radiation, which is contained entirely in a cloud of short-lived isotopes of inert gases that drift out over the Atlantic Ocean.

April 12 — Early evening. A family is driving home from the grocery store at Brockton, Massachusetts. They see a piano- shaped object with lights all over it. A spotlight is beaming down, and there is one red light on top. They lose

sight of the object, but suddenly all four car windows go down and back up; then they go down halfway and back up. The same thing happens when they stop at a red light. They see the object again, which is now following them. They park near their house, and the UFO hovers across the street. The man shuts off Michael D. Swords, “Messing Around with the Force,” the engine and the windows act up again as the UFO moves directly overhead. The father and son get out of the car, and the UFO shoots a beam down at each of them in turn. It then moves down the street and away. (Michael D.

April 19 — 11:30 p.m. John Milroy and his mother are driving from Ardersier to Croy, Inverness, Scotland, when he sees headlights in the distance. The lights get larger and rise above the road. Thinking it is an airplane crash, they get out of the car and experience an abnormal silence; they can no longer hear the car engine or the door slam when they flee. Everything reverts to normal when they reach a ditch. The mother is so excited she needs to be sedated the next day. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 4, no. 2 (August 1979): 2)

April 21 — Late night. A helicopter pilot and a mechanic are returning by car to their unit in the Blonie area, Poland. A light descends rapidly and silently over the road, resolving itself into 4 large lights attached to a solid object more than 100 feet long. It stops and hovers at 300 feet and then shoots upward instantaneously. (Poland 68–69)

Attempts by the government to deny the reality of UFOs have all the hallmarks of a classic coverup, he writes.

May 1 — 4:00 a.m. YPF company engineers at the Vizcacheras oil fields in a remote area of Argentina’s Mendoza province accessible only to employees are awakened by goats bleating in a corral. When they go outside to investigate, they see a UFO hovering silently about 230 feet from the encampment and 65 feet above the ground. They wave a lantern and the UFO seems to respond by blinking a light, then slowly lands nearby. More light signals are exchanged, then the UFO takes off and disappears toward the Andes mountains at 4:35 a.m. After the sighting, the goats (about 1,500) refuse to return to their corral. The engineers go to inspect the landing spot and find a large circle in which the sand has been petrified or hardened into chunks. Soil samples are taken to a Professor Corradi for analysis. Corradi, identified as director of the Institute for Extrahuman Studies, says the samples are being analyzed by the Office of Mining. Corradi remarks that that the “permanent presence of the UFOs over the uranium mines of La Pintada and Cuesta de los Terneros in San Rafael and now in Vizcacheras, is not a coincidence.” (Richard H.

May 9 — Early morning. A fleet of 10–15 UFOs alarms people in Choconta, Colombia. Eight of the objects have lights that change from red to blue to orange and yellow. An electrical blackout takes place, and dogs, chicken, and cattle get disturbed and run away. The objects examine the Telecom satellite tracking station before ascending rapidly and disappearing in the clouds. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 4, no. 2 (August 1979): 2)

May 16 — 10:30 a.m. Arlindo Gabriel dos Santos is hunting with two friends in a forest near Baependi, Minas Gerais, Brazil, when he becomes separated from the others. He sees an object descend towards the ground in a clearing. He approaches to within 600 feet and sees that the object is shaped like a telephone booth about 3 feet tall. He takes a photo of the object before it abruptly disappears in plain sight. He walks to the clearing and sees another object shaped like a toy top and a little larger than the previous object, descending swiftly. It has a small propeller on top and a long, pointed protrusion on the bottom. As he tries to photograph the second object, he hears a whooshing sound, and the craft is quickly enveloped in smoke. He notices a third craft descending overhead. This one is barrel-shaped and hovers for a bit before landing. It also has a large propeller at one end and is covered with red stripes. It vanishes when he tries to approach. Dos Santos finally sees a huge, white, egg-shaped object descend. It has a pointed top and fin-like protrusions on each side. Next to the fins are several windows. As it descends it makes a horrific noise like a choking motor and puts out four landing pods. He approaches and tries to take another photograph, but there is a sudden flash that temporarily blinds him and leaves his eyes irritated.

Frightened, he drops the camera and runs, but is only able to get about 30 feet before he is can no longer move. Behind him he notices two men wearing helmets with transparent visors and gloves. They grab him, each taking one arm. He begs them to let him go in the name of God, but they answer, “In the name of God, we are all brothers; we don’t harm anybody.” The voice comes from a box-like apparatus on their backs. He is taken toward the landed UFO. As he gets near, he can feel an intense cold surrounding it. Another helmeted figure stands by a ladder extending from the craft, looking from side to side. The man asks dos Santos if he has seen a “Zurca.” Dos Santos thinks he is referring to one of the smaller objects. The man extends a gloved hand and pulls dos Santos inside the craft through a square doorway. The atmosphere inside the craft is pleasant and cool, and there is a smell like “baby powder” in the air. Other men wearing dark, tight-fitting outfits are sitting on seats. The men have large slanted eyes, thin noses, and large mouths, and they are operating some type of machinery. They stand up and begin conversing in an unknown language. Suddenly, a heavyset woman emerges from another room. She wears a white uniform, gloves, but no helmet. Dos Santos describes her as good looking, tanned, with long light fine hair. The woman and one of the men then take him into a corridor. He enters a room where he sees a square object in the middle. The man pushes a button on the wall and the object rises. It resembled a large piece of marble. The woman takes out a long wand and points it at the object. On the object dos Santos sees an image of the planet Earth and other planets. At this point, the man removes his helmet revealing short, light-colored hair.

When dos Santos leaves the craft, he is told to cover his eyes and not look as the object leaves. He follows these instructions and does not see the object depart.

May 19 — 2:27 a.m. Tailor Mike Sacks and his brother Ray are on the moors near Stacksteads, Lancashire, England, looking for the UFO that Mike had already seen twice the previous winter. They have staked out the hills with a camera and suddenly hear a muted howling noise echoing through the night. The noise is coming from a white, glowing light falling toward them. The glowing mass slows down and the howling stops. Now directly overhead, the object is hovering just feet above a stream. They see a dome on top that emits electric blue sparks, a middle section, and a rim with a translucent metallic glow. The object tilts to reveal intricate detail on its underside, then accelerates and disappears. The men take a dozen photos, but they only show black sky when processed.

Walking to within 10 feet of the object, he can see a third beam of light below it. Green geometrical shapes appear and vanish along the side of the UFO. A blinking red light shines out on the upper surface, in between the vertical bars of an H-shaped sign taking up almost the entire top. Suddenly the object shines with a white-blue light, and the man’s face feels like it is burning.

Frightened, he runs away and does not look back. The next morning, he feels as if something heavy is pressing on his head; two weeks later, sores containing dried blood break out on his face.

He claims the current concept of flying discs originated in Germany in the 1930s, with the unknown private group gaining control of them after World War II.

June — 3:00 a.m. A woman doctor is in the TV room of her parents’ home in Boardman, Ohio, suffering from insomnia.

She sees something flashing outside the window, illuminating the entire area outside. A cylinder-shaped light comes through the closed window and passes three feet from her face. It then comes to look more like a paperclip that flashes on and off, meandering about, apparently not interested in her. She runs into the bedroom and does not see it again. (Michael D.

It is silver on top and dark on the bottom and seems to have a band around the edge and triangular markings. After it passes silently behind the trees to the north of them after 1 minute, they jump into a car and drive after it. It seems to be traveling at 20–25 mph, and they are able to overtake it flying parallel to the road. It seems to be flying at an altitude of 1,000 feet, and disappears to the north.

An ovoid-shaped object, seen primarily by its lights, shines two bright yellowish-white beams of light. After hovering motionless for 2–5 minutes, all the lights fade except a blue light. The UFO moves off and is gone almost instantly. After about 5 minutes, a second object is seen hovering for 2–5 minutes to the right of the nuclear power plant and directing a beam of light at it. It flies off toward the northwest. No one at the power plant reports seeing anything unusual. (“Case 4-1-47,” IUR 4, no. 1 (July 1979): 10)

June 28 — Security guard Antonio Carlos Ferreira is allegedly abducted from his workplace, a furniture factory

in Mirassol, São Paulo, Brazil. He is approached by three humanoid figures who tranquilize him and take him aboard a small ship that ferries him to a larger craft further away. There he is put in front of a large TV screen and presented with a variety of images before being forced to mate with a female alien. He is tranquilized again and

returned to the ground. The aliens are approximately 4 feet tall with pointed ears, slanted eyes, and human-like mouths. They lack eyebrows or eyelashes and speak in a language that superficially resembles Japanese. Some have dark skin and red curly hair, while others have light skin and straight black hair. The ship is spherical with three legs protruding from the bottom, and the interior is lit by bright red and green lights. Ferreira states that he encountered the aliens again in 1982, with the craft supposedly landing close enough for him to see the female alien and a childlike alien observing him from a distance. He experiences a third encounter later in 1982 in which he is taken into the hangar of an alien craft by a green beam of light before being injected with a yellow substance. He is then taken to meet the two aliens once more, the younger of whom he is led to believe is his own child. Other encounters follow, to a total of 16 or 20 between 1979 and 1989.

July 1 — 3:40 p.m. A factory supervisor and his wife are driving in Crystal Lake, Illinois, when they see an aluminum- colored ellipse hovering in the north-northeast at an estimated 1,000 feet. It moves with jerky movements to the east-southeast, drops down to 500 feet, and remains stationary over a stand of trees about one mile away for 2–3 seconds. It ascends and descends about five times. (“Daylight Disc in Illinois,” IUR 4, no. 2 (August 1979): 13)

July 4 — 1:30 a.m. A Swedish man is walking along a dark road after leaving a tavern not far from Monastiri Beach, Poros, Greece. He hears a powerful buzzing or shushing noise overhead. Not more than 25 feet above the trees on the uphill side of the road is a black, disc-shaped object, about 25 feet wide, that is blocking out the light of the stars. Within seconds a bright light beams down at him from the center of the object. He feels an electrical sensation and a general lightness. The light blinks out and the man begins running away, but the disc is descending and following him. The beam of light blinks on again when it is 50–60 feet above him. Two backpackers witness this and come running to aid him. The light blinks out again and four blinking red and green lights appear at the edge of the disc, which moves ahead another 150–200 feet. The UFO then rises to 400–500 feet and flies steadily until it disappears behind a hill. (“High Adventure in Greece,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 6 (Jan./Feb. 1982): 15–16)

July 17 — 6:00 a.m. A couple in a rural area northeast of Des Moines, Iowa, are fixing breakfast when through their window they see a small, circular light source to the northeast. It hovers silently for 5 minutes. It starts moving slowly upward at a 70° angle, then breaks into two smaller objects that shoot out of sight. (“Iowa UFO Splits in Two,” IUR 4, no. 3/4 (Sept./Oct. 1979): 10)

July 25 — 11:30 a.m. Farmer Federico Ibáñez Ibáñez, 54, leaves the village of Turís, Valencia, Spain, to gather grapes from his vineyard. He finds an egg-shaped, white, metallic object resting on two feet in the access road to his field. Two small beings run from behind a carob tree on his left and enter the craft. They are wearing white outfits “puffed up with air” with protruding black tubes. The UFO suddenly ascends at great speed, stirring up a whirlwind. The case is investigated in depth in 1979 and reinvestigated in 2008. It features unique shapes for both the landed craft and its occupants. The one witness is apparently credible. Ground traces are found as circumstantial evidence. Spanish investigator [Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://independent.academia.edu/VICENTEJUANBALLESTEROLMOS/CurriculumVitae&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890106991029&usg=AOvVaw3e4yskWz7QEeYvP8FI_-04) concludes: “My considered impression is that the witness sincerely believes in the tangible reality of his experience, and I have not found any reasonable evidence of a lie or episode of fantasy, nor any proof that he embellished his account.” Ballester Olmos’s latest thought is, “Did the witness invent or hallucinate the event under the influence of the current publicity for the Star Wars movie?” (Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, “Imagination or Reality?

July 27 — 11:10 p.m. Gary Hull is on the patio of his in-laws’ home in Stamford, Connecticut, when he sees an orange light in the northwest. He calls his wife Kathleen and others, and they watch it move silently across the sky at treetop level. After 5 minutes, it stops and hovers. Four or five white flashes erupt from its right side, followed by 4–5 faint sounds like firecrackers. At 11:19, a commercial jet flies overhead and under the UFO, which accelerates almost straight up in 5–10 seconds, diminishing to a pinpoint. Other witnesses 3.5 miles to the north and a few miles to the west watch similar objects. (“Independent Witnesses in Connecticut,” IUR 4, no. 3/4 (Sept./Oct. 1979): 10)

August — Harry Griesberg and David Seargent form the Australian Centre for UFO Studies from the CUFOS Australian Co-Ordination Section. (Keith Basterfield, Vladimir Godic, and Pony Godic, “Australian Ufology: A Review,” JUFOS 2 (1990): 28)

August — Dusk. A witness in Halifax, Nova Scotia, watches through a telescope a round object with 12–18 lights around its base approaching from the southeast. It hovers for about 30 seconds. He calls to his wife to verify the observation, which has now moved directly overhead. The lights give off constant beams downward.

August — Evening. A resident of Człuchów, Poland, is rowing his boat on a lake when he sees a “dark oblong object” moving rapidly and soundlessly along the surface of the water without disturbing it. It disappears behind some lakeside vegetation. Another witness on shore sees it apparently land, so he calls his two dogs and heads toward the spot. About 65 feet from the shore he can see two entities in dark suits walking toward the forest. The dogs run toward them and they stop and turn around. The dogs stop in their tracks, bark, and retreat in terror. The witness watches the entities as they continue walking. They are about 5 feet tall and sealed in diving outfits. At the level of their eyes is a glass plate through which they can apparently see. Their hips are unnaturally wide and each has a hump between the back of the neck and the shoulders. The witness calls out to them, but they begin running into the trees. A luminous rectangular object floats up from the treetops about 325 feet away and hovers 100 feet from the ground. A blue-green light is along its sides, shading away into white in the middle. The UFO speeds away, leaving no findable landing traces. The witness claims his dogs’ front legs become paralyzed 6 months later and he has to put them to sleep.

August 1 — 1:35 a.m. Westchester County police officer William Shaughnessy sees apparently the same white ball of light at the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, New York, as that reported by several citizens of Lewisboro the same night. It passes southeast directly over his car, at 600–800 feet altitude. It stops above some treetops, makes a complete right turn, and disappears to the west. 12 minutes later, it comes flying back, hovers, shoots over his car again, and is gone quickly. During this time, Shaughnessy cannot reach his station by either low-band FM or portable radio. (“Cop Ridiculed for NL Sighting in New York,” IUR 4, no. 3/4 (Sept./Oct. 1979): 10–11)

August 2 — Morning. A teen who mows the lawn finds a strange design on the lawn of an 8-acre estate about 8 miles north of Chagrin Falls, Ohio. The owner waits a week before reporting it to the police, who alert the Center for UFO Studies, which investigates the marking on August 22. The trace is visible as flattened, yellowed grass in a semicircle between two straight lines forming a 120° angle. An analysis of the soil sample indicated nothing unusual in the chemistry, and no herbicides or petroleum.

August 4 — 10:35 p.m. Maria Artura and her grandson see a domed, disc-shaped object approach from the west over Canoga Park, Los Angeles, California. Two humanoid beings with oversize heads are inside. The object stops and hovers above an apartment building on the other side of the street. It tilts to one side, returns to horizontal, then flies behind a tree, stops, and tilts the other way. Finally, it flies away to the west.

August 10 — Two large metallic spheres are found in Bolivia, one near Enconada and another near Buen Retiro, just hours after reports of a fireball in Bolivia and northern Chile.

August 10 — 9:00 p.m. Two witnesses are on the shore of a lake near Czluchow, Poland, when they see an object gliding swiftly along the surface and vanishing behind some vegetation on the bank. One witness collects his dogs and approaches the spot, but before he gets there, he encounters two entities dressed in black who are moving toward the woods. The dogs run toward them barking, but the entities turn to face them and the dogs stop barking and go back. The beings are dressed in coveralls. They have wide hips, a lump at the base of their necks, and curved forearms, and they are gliding rather than walking. They vanish, and while searching for them the witness sees a rectangular object hovering about 300 feet away and flashing beams of white and blue-green light. It vanishes suddenly.

August 11 — 9:41 p.m. A graduate student and a friend are taking an evening drive in a semi-rural area in Northfield Township, Michigan. They notice two white stationary lights about 300 feet from the road and 500 feet in the air. They turn the car around and see another formation of white lights and a flashing red light to the west. A total of three sets of lights appear heading south. They follow one group, which hovers above some power lines. The couple continues to pursue and be pursued by the similar formations of lights for 30 minutes. At the intersection of Joy and Whitmire Lake Road, one set of lights flies directly above them at 1,000–1,500 feet altitude, making a noise like a jet or the wind.

August 11 — 11:00 p.m. Two 18-year-olds, a male college student and a female telephone company employee, are sitting in a car near Bergen Park, Colorado, looking at the homes at the base of a small mountain on Soda Creek Road off Interstate 70. They see a white light about two-thirds of the way up the mountain. It grows bigger, four times the brightness of the houselights at the base of the mountain. It seems to become a cluster of four lights with a dark space in the middle. After 3 minutes, the light silently rises over the mountain, hovers for 3 seconds, and drops down behind it. A glow remains over the mountain. (“Colorado Landing,” IUR 4, no. 3/4 (Sept./Oct. 1979): 12)

August 12 — 2:00 a.m. Engineer Y. Podvyazniy and two companions are on the shore of the Black Sea west of the microdistrict of Khosta near Sochi, Krasnodar Krai, Russia. They notice a brightly illuminated object approaching erratically from the sea. Suddenly it skips to within one mile of the witnesses, who take 9 photos, estimate its size as 165–330 feet, and notice four glowing lights that look like portholes. The object is only 16–65 feet above the water when it slowly moves away to a distance of 9 miles. A patrol boat uses its searchlight to illuminate the object, which appears to be spherical. When the object lights up and dims, the searchlight and the patrol boat’s lights also dim. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, pp. 133–134)

August 12 — 10:00 p.m. Two teenage brothers are driving 9 miles west of Rolla, Missouri, in an undeveloped area. A red light and a blue light appear over the car, apparently circling each other. The two lights seem to blend into one, forming a soft white color. Sparks shoot out, and the single light source arcs upward and vanishes in the western sky. Both feel strange sensations of both pressure and floating as this occurs. These effects, along with involuntary body movements and trouble speaking and breathing, last 10 minutes.

Mid-August — Night. Hospital administrator Jon Linnell and his wife are driving home from Northwood, North Dakota, to Warren, Minnesota, when they see bright lights over a field to the left. 15 seconds later the lights come toward them and hover above their car. Linnell slows the car down and the object takes off to the north. It is silent and too bright to look at.

August 16 — 4:22 a.m. A male nurse is driving south on US Highway 19 seven miles south of Washington, Pennsylvania.

Ahead of him on the left is a large, luminous object that looks like a football. It appears to be 60 feet up as he drives underneath it. It remains stationary as he drives away. (”Pennsylvania ‘Football,’” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 4)

August 16 — 4:30 p.m. A silver, pan-shaped object flies past an eastbound truck near Providence, Kentucky, at 2,000– 3,000 feet altitude. It tumbles in flight, turning over sideways before disappearing behind a hill. (“Kentucky Daylight Saucer,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 4)

August 17 — 9:00 p.m. Elma l’Abbe is flying above Saint-Jovite, Quebec, in a Piper PA-28 Cherokee Warrior piloted by a friend. She looks out the window and notices that both wings are turning red. The pilot says his controls are jammed, but both feel the aircraft being pulled upward. They then see a large red ball of energy nearly 300 feet in diameter and 50 feet thick close to the right wing. It speeds away rapidly and appears to have a white light on its tail end. The aircraft falls about 1,000 feet and levels out at 4,000 feet. The object disappears into a cloud, where it rotates, showing red on one side and white on the other. The ball of light disappears into the orange sky of the sunset.

August 20 — 7:30–9:00 p.m. Some 119 people in northern and eastern Poland observe several different types of cylindrical or spherical UFOs. Reports come from Sopot, Jurata, Gdańsk, Bydgoszcz, Malbork, Jastrzębie, Olsztyn, Świecie, and Warsaw. Vacationers in Sopot and Jurata see a cigar ejecting a smoky trail and flames. In Gdańsk, the objects are cigar-shaped or oblong changing into a sphere. Bogdan Śmiech from Malbork watches 9– 10 balls of light 3–4 miles above the ground. (Poland 72–73)

Late August — 10:00 p.m. Mrs. H. M. Dickinson and another witness see a small, transparent object shaped like a lightbulb moving west to east just outside the window of her home in Surry, Maine. Inside it is an entity sitting on a box and facing what seems to be a control panel. The object is lighted from within and blinks out after 5 seconds.

August 23 — 8:15 p.m. Two fishing boats belonging to the Szomborg family, the Hel-125 and Hel-127, are in the Baltic Sea some 46 miles off the Hel peninsula, Poland, when their radar malfunctions and the TV set reception fails. Lucjan Szomborg on the Hel-127 notices two bright-red lights in the air less than a mile away. Suddenly another larger, pulsating light appears abut 1,500 feet in front of the boat and the original two lights, which are apparently attached to a dark object, move silently toward it. A white light emerges from the two smaller lights, which then disappear in the distance. The pulsating light begins flashing erratically, emitting strong vibrations, and Szomborg steers his boat closer. The red light places itself directly in the Hel-127’s path three times, matching the boat’s course changes. The crew members begin to get nervous, some getting severe headaches, chest pains, and nausea. The navigator, Henryk Elwardt, is gripped with pain, affected by the pulsing vibrations. Szomborg, feeling symptoms of paralysis and temporary blindness, manages to change course and warn his father on the Hel-125 of danger. All the on-board equipment has suddenly stopped working. After 20 minutes, Szomborg notices that the red sphere has moved further away. The boats safely return to Hel by 4:00 a.m., and the equipment is working again. Doctors, neurologists, and psychiatrists examine the crew and find nothing physically wrong, but they are prescribed sedatives and the Polish Navy prohibits them from going out to sea for 3 weeks.

August 25 — 3:30 p.m. Three witnesses in a boat at Balsam Lake, Wisconsin, watch an object with a metallic surface move downward in an oscillating manner and maneuver for 6–7 minutes. (“Wisconsin DD,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 4)

August 27 — 1:40 a.m. Deputy Sheriff [Val Johnson](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/08/26/minnesota-deputy-squad-car-ufo-mystery&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107006930&usg=AOvVaw2oCmzuU2Rm_D22rEGh-0i5) is on duty in the west end of Marshall County, Minnesota, driving on County Highway 5 west of Stephen when he sees a light through his side window. The light is to his south, shining from a grove of trees standing along State Highway 220 near the Red River. He thinks it might be from a downed drug-smuggling airplane. He turns south on 220, accelerates to 65 mph, and moves closer. The light moves toward him, traveling so fast that it crosses the 1.5 miles separating them almost instantaneously. It makes no sound and still looks just like a blinding light. Johnson hears glass breaking and sees the inside of the patrol car light up. After the light hits, he loses consciousness. When he wakes up, his head is resting on the steering wheel and his eyes are staring at the red “engine” light on the dashboard. He looks out the window and sees the car has skidded sideways across the northbound lane and now faces eastward. The front tires are touching the gravel on the shoulder. He can see only with difficulty and feels like he is moving in slow motion. At 2:19 a.m., he radios headquarters and asks for assistance. Deputy Greg Winskowski arrives on the scene shortly. Johnson is still inside the car with a red bump on his forehead, so he calls an ambulance. At the hospital, Dr. W. A. Pinsonneault examines Johnson’s eyes, but the probe light hurts so much that Johnson cannot stand it more than a few seconds at a time. Pinsonneault suspects corneal flash burns and covers his eyes with bandages. Sheriff Dennis Brekke drives Johnson’s 1977 Ford LTD patrol car back to the garage. The inside light on the driver’s side is smashed.

On the hood, 4 feet 4 inches behind the smashed light and close to the windshield, is a flat-bottomed, circular dent, half an inch in diameter. A crack in the windshield on the driver’s side about 18 inches behind the dent runs top to bottom, with four apparent impacts; it looks as if a cluster of small objects, stones perhaps, have done the damage. The car’s battery-powered clock, set correctly at 7:00 p.m. when Johnson came on duty, is 14 minutes

late. So is Johnson’s wind-up wristwatch, set at the same time. The red plastic lens covering the roof light on the driver’s side shows a triangular puncture, and the lens is dislodged from the housing. A radio antenna shaft is bent over at a 60° angle. The large “bubble” lamp just inches in front of the antenna is unscathed. The trunk antenna for CB radio is bent at 90°. Brekke, after calling the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois, takes Johnson to Grand Forks, North Dakota, at 11:00 a.m. for an eye examination by ophthalmologist Leonard Prochaska, who finds that Johnson’s problems have cleared up.

Meridan French, a windshield expert with the Glass Division of Ford Motor Company, concludes that a flat-ended object had made a forceful impact with the hood and then tilted toward the windshield. A team of engineers at Honeywell’s materials testing laboratory indicates that flying particles were responsible for the damage to the headlight glass and lamp plastic.

August 27 — 2:30 p.m. Flying instructor Laurie Adlington has just left Blackbushe Airport in Yateley, Hampshire, England, with Lt. James Plastow from Sandhurst Military College for his pilot’s license test in a Cessna 150. They are at 2,000 feet heading toward Basingstoke when Adlington suddenly grabs the controls and throws the Cessna into a steep bank and descent to avoid a collision. An object suddenly speeds past the front of the aircraft, coming within a few feet of the windshield. The rotating object is about 12 inches in diameter, shaped like a doughnut, reflects light with a silvery glow “like a blob of mercury,” and has a honeycombed surface. They can make out the hint of an aerial on one side. The object begins flying around the plane for a short time before it flies underneath it and then streaks upward and away to about 3,000 feet. Possible early use of a drone.

August 27 — 11:00 p.m. A family in Smithtown, New York, watches a round object with a band around its equator and many small orange lights fly toward them from the north. They remain outside after it disappears, hoping it will return, and it does, flying from west to east and rising up sharply and silently.

August 29 — 2:00 a.m. Russ Johnson is driving on Highway 50 on the western outskirts of Vermillion, South Dakota, when he spots a blinding headlight in front of him. It is stationary for 2 seconds, then it streaks toward him and engulfs his car. Johnson closes his eyes and hits the brakes, skidding the car to a stop, spinning sideways until it faces east. He opens his eyes and sees the light heading away west. The next day, the still-shaken Johnson goes to the site with Robert Adams at the University of South Dakota, who sees the skid marks.

August 29 — 8:00 a.m. A woman is in her alfalfa field 10 miles north of Pasco, Washington, when she sees what appears to be a post sitting a half-mile away. It is about 4–5 feet tall. About 10 minutes later she sees that the object is now in the air, flying slowly in a horizontal position, land bullet-shaped, looking black on its flat end and silver on its rounded end. A neighbor also sees the object before it disappears in the west. (“A Flying Fence Post in Washington State,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 5)

August 29 — 7:30 p.m. A married couple is taking their dog on a duck hunt between Dziki and Ernestowo, Poland, when they notice a “strange orange ball” coming from behind a hill about 3 miles away. The husband studies it through binoculars, estimating its speed as about 95 mph. The ball proves to be the front of a huge steel-colored cigar- shaped object, which stops 1,300 feet away and hovers above some buildings for about 10 seconds. They can see five large, square windows with rounded corners; the three in the front glow with orange light, while the other two seem covered by a shade. The object moves forward about 40 feet and stops. Half a minute later, sparks shoot from the rear and the UFO vanishes over the horizon. An orange glow remains behind. Alojzy Pawlik sees the same object in Laskowice at about the same time. (Bronislaw Rzepecki, “Encounters in Poland,” IUR 12, no. 3 (May/June 1987): 17)

August 29 — 10:00 p.m. A 47-year-old housewife sees the lower corner of a gigantic “mothership” outside her living room window in a southwest suburb of Chicago, Illinois. The blimp-like UFO is so huge she can’t see the whole length or height. It extends the whole block of houses at treetop level. She reports four different kinds of humanoid creatures (7 in all) visible through the hull, which is luminous and yellow in color. She hears a loud humming sound. The duration is 45 minutes.

August 29 — 10:30 p.m. Charles Weeden and his father see an orange light moving erratically in the sky to the west over Sycamore, Illinois. They call the police, and Deputy Berna Van Vlerah looks outside the station 2.5 miles west of

the Weedens and sees the orange light to her southeast, low above the horizon. Using binoculars, she sees a flat- bottomed orange dome shape within the light. She watches it for 5 minutes, then drives to the Weedens and watches it there to the west. (“Orange NL in Illinois?” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 5)

August 29 — 11:15 p.m. Harry Joe Turner is driving a 1974 Kenworth tractor-trailer loaded with mustard and ketchup on US Highway 17 two miles from Warrenton, Virginia. His CB radio starts acting up, giving out a noise that gets louder and louder. Something grabs him tightly on his left shoulder. He sees a large object looming over his cab and hears two thumps. Even though he is going 70 mph, he sees a figure standing outside. When it throws open the door, Turner grabs his .32 automatic pistol and fires 8 rounds at it with no effect. He then blacks out. Turner wakes up in the passenger seat at 3:00 a.m. at his destination in a Fredericksburg warehouse but can’t remember how he got there. The odometer indicates he has only traveled 17 miles, not 80, yet he has used 114 gallons of fuel. The top 2 inches of the CB antenna are melted off, and 30 inches of the AM/FM antenna has broken off. A filmy substance covers the truck. He drives back home but is confused and his eyes are overly sensitive to light. Turner wakes up in a Winchester hospital diagnosed with a broken blood vessel in his left eye. He begins to remember more about the experience and recalls his truck being lifted into a UFO piloted by two humanlike figures dressed in white shirts and pants, one of whom is named Alpha La Zoo Loo. He seems to take a trip in space to a planet beyond Alpha Centauri. On September 3, after taking valium, Turner is arrested for speeding. He thinks aliens are chasing him. Turner continues to undergo anxiety attacks.

September 3 — 9:30 p.m. Two couples in Balsam Lake, Wisconsin, see a red disc hovering in the western sky as they are driving from their cottage. The dashboard and engine lights fail, so the driver pulls over. The lights come back on but go off again when the car moves forward again. This happens again 5–6 times in less than a minute. Once their view of the light is blocked, the lights come back on. The object moves on to the southwest at incredible speed. (“Car Interference Case,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 6)

September 5 — 3:40 a.m. Dr. Barbara Anaczkowska-Piazza, a driver, and a stretcher bearer are taking a pregnant patient in an ambulance from Żuławka Sztumska to the hospital at Sztum, Poland. As they are passing through Tropy Sztumskie, they notice a large orange-red ball on their left that seems to parallel them as they turn toward Kalwa. At one point it looks so close that the driver fears it will block their way. It seems to have two dark, horizontal bands across it. They turn back to a railway crossing and alert the guards to the object, which is now less bright and soon turns dark. The observation lasts 20 minutes. Although there are some discrepancies in the accounts of its movement, Wim van Utrecht and others are certain that it was the full moon setting. (Emma Popik, “Under

It approaches again, floating downward and growing brighter. Red and yellow spikes of light emanate from a bright white center. When she feels her face growing hot, she pulls sharply onto another street. Looking through her rear-view mirror, she sees the light make an abrupt turn to the left and disappear in the north in a few seconds. By noon, her face is sunburned and sore; the skin flakes off the next day and she quickly recovers. (“Case 4-5-4,” IUR 4, no. 5 (November 1979): 12)

It remains below the skyline for the most part, slowly moving in a number of different directions before fading from view. An hour and 15 minutes later, two more orange balls appear in the area of Simon Butte. Moving erratically. They are joined by a third light, and all fade away after 45 seconds. The third ball apparently makes another appearance 5 minutes later and is visible for 45 seconds. (“More NLs in Yakima,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 9)

Mid-September — 4:30 a.m. Teenagers Holly Travis and Debbie LaRose wake up at the Travis house in Sanford, Maine, and see through a window a huge, orange, round object whose underside is clearly visible as it slowly (10–15 mph) passes overhead, gently spinning on its axis, at about 500 feet elevation. It slowly descends behind the roof of the neighbor’s house. (Richard Sigismond, “Four Huge Orange Discs and the Case for the UFO,” IUR 8, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1983): 6–7)

September 16 — Night. Curtis Olson is mowing hay on his farm near Lake City, Minnesota, when he finds a circle of flattened corn 50 feet in diameter. The stalks are flattened in a pattern radiating from the center of the circle, and some are charred. He finds a path leading to another circle 18 feet away. At first, he thinks lightning caused it, but then he considers the possibility of a UFO.

They drive home to get two binoculars and another witness, then see the light approaching them from the east, now visibly attached to a boomerang-shaped object with the concave side toward them. It stops, tumbles end over end, and moves toward them again, slowly passing overhead, then shoots off to the east. (“Connecticut NL,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 10)

September 29 — 8:45 a.m. A screenwriter sees two bright silver spheres moving above Hollywood, California. Each is somewhat smaller than a full moon and are revolving counterclockwise around a common axis between them. (“A Different Kind of Hollywood Spectacle,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 10)

October — In a remote area near Melville, Saskatchewan, a CUFOS investigator is looking into a cattle mutilation when his truck begins swerving uncontrollably. He stops and gets out as he hears a low humming noise in the nearby bush. Walking toward it, he feels sharp pains in his back and his knees collapse. The hum becomes louder as he crawls back to the truck and drives away. He loses his sense of direction and hears a rapid clicking noise. The speedometer needle fluctuates wildly between 10 and 85 mph. Suddenly his disorientation leaves and he drives home.

October — Day. Cornel Alexandru Olteanu is gathering mushrooms in a forest near Valea Berii near the source of the Teleajen River in the Ciucaş Mountains, Romania. He notices a gray object like a car in a clearing under a high cliff about 320 feet away. He walks toward it and sees it looks more like a metallic disc with a turret and is sitting on 3–4 legs. Nearby are two little men about 4 feet tall who seem to be working on something. They have large eyes, bald heads, and yellowish skin, and they are dressed in a one-piece suit. Noticing him, they turn toward Olteanu, who is suddenly unable to move. The men turn around and climb up a ladder into the object. Flashing white lights come on and the object takes off into the sky and over some trees, which bend over as if they are going through a hurricane. After it is gone, Olteanu can move again. He notices a yellowish stain at the landing site. (Romania 132–133)

October 4 — 12:00 noon. A sales manager watches a silver, domed-shaped object with a black flat bottom from a 38th- floor window on Madison Avenue and 26th Street in New York City. It is seen by three others on the same floor and two others on the floor immediately below. It moves north and makes a sharp turn before apparently hitting the Empire State Building. It clears the Pan Am building and flies off along the Hudson River at a high altitude. (“The UFO That Almost Hit the Empire State Building,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 10–11)

October 6 — 7:30 p.m. A couple driving south on County Road 46 near Amery, Wisconsin, see two red, luminous globes, each as large as the full moon, hovering above the southeast horizon. They drive on another 2–3 miles watching them before the two objects join together and hovers 250 feet above the field to their left, bathing it in a pinkish glow. (“Red Globes in Wisconsin,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 11)

October 6 — 9:30 p.m. A couple are driving on Interstate 35 east of Barnum, Minnesota, when they see a ball of light 3–6 feet in diameter approaching low over some trees. It rolls and bounces silently over the top of the car in about 10 seconds. After driving another 500 feet, the car’s engine dies and the headlights malfunction. The battery is so dead that it can’t be jump-started. The alternator also has to be replaced. The mechanic who does the repair work says that the interior looks like a fire has gone through it (though not the exterior).

October 27 — Three Russian aircraft approaching Khatanga, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, encounter a large UFO about 850 feet long and only a half-mile away with three spheres attached to it. Each sphere has three portholes. The pilot of an Antonov An-26 transport cannot get his compass to work properly unless it is directed at the object, which paces the aircraft, flying over and around it. A similar object is seen shortly afterward at Alykel Airport near Norilsk, and the Messoyakha Gas Field. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, p. 95)

October 29 — In Hayden v.

November — During rocket tests at the Kapustin Yar site, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia, a Col. Gen. Sapkov and other officers see a bright-green elliptical object, occasionally changing hues, hover over the range for 30 minutes. Sapkov claims to see the same phenomenon in 1986 and is assured by officers that this is a common occurrence. (Paul Stonehill and Philip Mantle, The Soviet UFO Files: Paranormal Encounters behind the Iron Curtain, Quadrillion, 1998, p. 51)

November 8 — 7:00 p.m. Five teenage girls in West Palm Beach, Florida, watch a round object with multiple lights, a door, and a bubble roof descend to the east and hover there for 5 minutes. It rises again, flies over a store near the witnesses and disappears over the southern horizon. (“Palm Beach Puzzle,” IUR 4, no. 6 (December 1979): 13)

November 9 — 10:30 a.m. [Robert Taylor](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1546390/Bob-Taylor.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107029911&usg=AOvVaw2ffReDjRb9udcu7EJMJxOc), a 61-year-old forestry worker, is out one night working in the Dechmont Woods near Livingston, Scotland. Taylor and his dog are on duty when he spots a UFO hovering completely motionless and silent above the ground. Described as approximately 20 feet across and 12 feet high, the strange object is made of a “dark gray metallic material.” Taylor thinks the UFO is possibly going transparent from time to time in order to disguise itself. A ring or platform encircles the object with spikes topped with propellers. Two more small spiky spheres come from the craft and make a sound as their spikes move across the ground. Taylor is then grabbed by these two smaller objects and dragged to the UFO. As this is happening, he can smell a strong, sickening odor. Soon after this, he loses consciousness and remains passed out about 20 minutes. He is woken up by his dog, which is running around and barking in a panic. He hears a kind of hissing sound and realizes that the craft is beginning to leave. Seconds later the UFO disappears. Taylor is unable to walk or talk properly after the event. He suffers from a headache, sickness, and pain in his chin for some hours afterward. Authorities are appointed to investigate the site and find tracks where Taylor says the smaller spheres were dragging him.

November 11–12 — 11:00 p.m. Flight JK-297, a TAE Supercaravelle outbound from Salzburg, Austria, has just made a refueling stop on Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, before setting course toward Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. Pilot Francisco Javier Lerdo de Tejada and his crew notice a set of red lights that are fast approaching the aircraft. They appear to be on a collision course, alarming the crew. The captain requests information about the lights, but neither the Pegaso Defense Radar Center in Torrejón Air Base, Madrid, nor the flight control center

in Barcelona can provide any explanation. In order to avoid a possible collision, the captain changes altitude. However, the lights mirror the new course and stay about 1,600 feet away from the plane. Since the object is violating all elementary safety rules and the crew considers an evasive maneuver impossible, the captain decides to go off-course and make an emergency landing at the Manises airport in Valencia. The lights abandon the pursuit just before the aircraft lands. However, three new UFO targets are detected by the radar, each one with an estimated diameter of 650 feet. The objects are seen by several witnesses. One of the UFOs passes very close to the airport runway, and emergency lights are lit by the land crew in case the object happens to be an unregistered flight experiencing difficulties. Because the object answers no attempts to communicate, a Mirage F-1 takes off at

2:10 a.m. from the nearby Los Llanos Air Base in Albacete to intercept the object. The pilot, Spanish Air Force captain Fernando Cámara, has to increase his speed to 920 mph just to achieve visual contact with what he sees as a truncated cone-shaped object. Despite his initial efforts, the object quickly disappears. Cámara is told of a new radar target, indicating that another object might be near Sagunto. When he is close enough, the object accelerates and disappears again. This time, though, the UFO seems to respond, and the Mirage has its electronic flight systems jammed. At last, and after a third intercept attempt, the UFO finally disappears, heading for Africa. After 90 minutes of pursuit, the pilot is forced to return to the base with no results.

November 14 — 8:10 p.m. A witness near Killaly, Saskatchewan, sees a white light land in a field about a quarter mile to the south of her house and then go out. Her dogs keep snarling and barking all night long. The next morning her husband passes the field and notices that it is emitting a dense cloud of smoke. He finds a ring of smoldering grass some 30 feet in diameter, but with snow still visible in the center. The unburnt grass next to it is flattened.

November 15 — 5:00 p.m. A group of children playing in Chiraleș, Romania, see a milky-white object that looks like a mace head with protuberances moving silently from north to south about 50 feet from the ground. It appears to be 3 feet in diameter and lands at a nearby mound. The children run toward the mound but stop when they see two glowing objects land on it with tripod legs. Two little men 2.5 feet tall, dressed in metallic costumes with antennae, come out of one of the objects through a door and walk around with a bouncing motion. The children keep approaching, so the men run back into the craft, which takes off in a burst of red-orange flames. Small circular impressions are found, although they get disturbed by curious onlookers. (Romania 134–135)

November 15 — 9:00 p.m. Two teenage boys in Gadsden, Alabama, see a domed disc the size of a house approach them from the south until it is 900 feet away and 750 feet in the air.

November 17 — 4:20 p.m. The underground Pegaso Defense Radar Center at Torrejón Air Base in Madrid, Spain, detects an unknown target some 25 miles south of Motril, Grenada, and a Mirage F1 is scrambled from Los Llanos Air Base in Albacete, Castilla–La Mancha. By the time the jet arrives in the vicinity, the target has disappeared. At 6:16 p.m., the pilot is heading back to Los Llanos when he sees three powerful red-yellow lights in the shape of a triangle about 12 miles away. They do not register on radar. In spite of chasing the lights at 720 mph, the Mirage cannot close the gap. During his descent into Los Llanos, some childish, laughing voices break into the UHF-1 channel linking him to Pegaso: “Hello, how are you? Hello, hello,” they say in Spanish.

December 13 — 4:00 a.m. Two truckers (Wang Dingyuan and Wang Jianming) are driving separate vehicles on the Lanxi-Xin’angiang Highway near Longwangmiao, Zhejiang, China, when they see a bright beam of light ahead. When the lead driver sees two “unusual human beings” standing on the highway, he stops. They are short, perhaps 4.5 feet tall, and wear what look like spacesuits. The second driver also stops but does not see the beings,

which soon vanish. The drivers decide to switch vehicles. A few miles down the road, the new lead driver sees the same entities, and the men again stop the trucks. The drivers turn their lights off and on, but the beings remain.

When one of the drivers emerges with a crowbar, they disappear. (Paul Dong and Wendelle C.

December 27 — 11:15 a.m. Two construction workers are driving south on Knott Street in Coquille, Oregon, when they see a bright flash in the southern sky. It is caused by a reflection off a thin, metallic, domed object wobbling nearby. It is about 40–50 feet in diameter and 6–7 feet thick. The object descends to about 1,000 feet. The witnesses try to drive closer and look at it through inexpensive binoculars as it flies down the valley before it disappears to the south.

December 27 — Night. A car factory worker at Halewood, Merseyside, England, is walking home when he senses something behind him. Turning around, he sees a floating white sphere, several feet in diameter, heading silently toward him. He watches it pass, and the tingling at the back of his neck intensifies. When it is about 20 feet ahead, it stops and shoots to the southwest at a 45° angle. The man’s hair remains charged with static for two days.

January — 11:00 p.m. A Brazilian electronics businessman and 9 others see a disc-shaped object shine a light down on the water near the eastern bank of the Rio Tapajós 30 miles south of Santarém, Brazil. The man, his family, and some relatives are camping at a beach. Several teenagers are still awake, lying in hammocks and talking, when they see the UFO come across the river, stopping about 30 yards from the beach and shining a light on the water 60 feet below. The UFO hovers briefly then begins moving north, parallel to the shore. It travels more than half a mile, with the spotlight shining straight down before it disappears. The light beam leaves a trail of luminescence for several hundred yards.

January 13 — 9:00 p.m. Brenda Simanski and Janine Mattson quit their shift at the Seminary Nursing Home on Pioneer Road in Red Wing, Minnesota. Standing in the parking lot, they see a star making a bizarre zigzag pattern. It moves above them and they see it is a triangle 15 feet wide and 20 feet long with two white lights in front, blue lights in two of the corners, and a red light between the blue ones. Three other witnesses come out of the building and also watch the object, which leaves slowly and silently to the north-northwest.

January 14 — 6:05 a.m. Truck driver William Barrett is on an early delivery run from Burnley to Todmorden, West Yorkshire, England, when he hears a deep humming sound. Looking ahead, he sees a machine with flames underneath hovering at a lay-by off the roadside. He slows his truck to a near crawl and moves past the object, which looks like a “toast rack” with curved sides and three red glows emerging from the edge to create a misty fuzziness obscuring the base. Now only 25 feet away, he sees that it has a bell- or tortoiseshell shape with a metallic sheen and a tube sticking up from the top. The red glows emerge from under a rim that runs around the lower part of the object. He can now see two figures standing in front of the object, one standing erect and wearing a uniform with a peaked cap, and the other crouched forward, wearing a silvery-gray jump suit. As he passes, the arc lights on the object start flickering like a disco. His headlights go out, and his mind gets hazier and he loses consciousness. He experiences missing time until he jerks awake sometime around 8:30 a.m. (Jenny Randles, “Close Encounter in UFO Alley,” IUR 26, no. 1 (Spring 2001): 3–8, 28–29)

It is silent and resembles a satellite. He calls two other witnesses, during which time the object disappears. At 10:45 p.m., he sees a bright light moving slowly toward the zenith. Looking more closely, he sees it is actually a group of 30 objects in a V- formation. Each individual light of the group is pale white with a slight tint of yellow. The formation moves from

20° above the western horizon to about 20° above the eastern horizon before disappearing gradually. The duration is approximately 2 minutes.

January 21 — 11:40 p.m. Seven women are driving home in two cars from a bridge game near Council Bluffs, Iowa. The first car with six witnesses, including Marilyn Anderson, sees a cluster of lights in the western sky as they are driving on Pioneer Trail. The lights are hovering about 200–300 feet above a bluff less than a city block away.

When they stop the car to get out for a closer look, the lights speed away to the southwest. The seventh woman, in a separate car behind them, does not see the lights, but Anderson tells her about them when she pulls up. She continues driving home, but when she gets to Longview Drive, her car stalls, and the radio and lights go out. She restarts the car, but it stalls out another quarter-mile away. A bright orange light appears in a cornfield about 900 feet away with an intensity that hurts her eyes. Scared, she locks herself inside the car and passes out. When she wakes up, her car is turned sideways across the road, but she is able to drive it home. She can still see the orange light from her kitchen window, but she has some blotches and redness on her skin that fades by 4:20 a.m. (“Possible Abduction in Iowa,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 2, no. 5 (July/Aug. 1980): 13–14)

His two guard dogs are howling in fear. Outside he sees a yellow half-moon-shaped object about 25–30 feet long. It is 100 feet up in the branches of a 230-foot-tall cypress tree, branches bending under its weight. The trunk shows large gouges. Browne calls the police, but the object is gone by the time they arrive. For 2 days, Browne’s dogs refuse to go near the tree.

April 11 — 7:15 a.m. Personnel at the La Joya Air Base \[part of the Mariano Melgar Airport\], Arequipa, Peru, see a strange object flying in the vicinity. The base commander orders a Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bomber to destroy the target, assumed to be a Chilean balloon. Lt. Oscar Santa María Huertas commands the scrambled aircraft. As soon as the object is in his sights some 1,800 feet above the ground, he fires 64 rounds from his 30mm guns at it. The bullets seem to hit the object without causing any damage. The UFO then hurls skyward at tremendous speed.

Huertas follows, putting the Sukhoi into Mach 1.2. As he approaches, the object makes a sudden stop and the Sukhoi flies past it at 36,000 feet. Further maneuvering takes place, and Huertas finds the object chasing him at one point at 62,000 feet. He abandons the mission 52 miles away from the base. After he lands 22 minutes later, the object reappears at the base and remains visible nearly 2 hours. A Department of Defense information release gives an erroneous date of May 9, 1980.

April 13 — A witness is driving on the eastern outskirts of Halifax, Nova Scotia, when he sees an unusually bright light. As he drives 5–6 miles closer, it resolves into two lights side by side. After driving another 20 miles closer, he sees the two lights are attached to one object. When directly underneath, it appears to be 1,000–1,200 feet long and cigar-shaped with lights on the front and back and one side. A truck driver has also pulled over to watch the UFO.

April 20 — 9:00 p.m. A group of nine family members are on their front lawn in Hyderabad, India, and see a bell-shaped cloud forming at about 2,000–3,000 feet altitude. It remains stationary and they look away, but soon they see three smaller bell-shaped clouds forming evenly spaced below the first and forming an equilateral triangle. The smaller clouds then merge with the larger one and form an orange ball bright enough to throw a shadow on the roof near them. It shoots off at great speed toward the airport, then disappears after breaking into four smaller orange balls of light. The duration of the sighting is 15 minutes. (Herbert S.

May — Early afternoon. Thousands of base personnel and their families are congregating at Ellsworth AFB in Rapid City, South Dakota, to watch an SR-71 Blackbird take off after a refueling stop. A1C John W. Mills III and a few other airmen are on top of the barracks for a view. They see an odd, triangular object above the B-52 Alert Pad about half a mile away. It begins to move down the flight line, and they see it is a gray-black delta shape at an altitude of 500 feet. For some reason it is not visible through the pair of binoculars they have. It makes a right turn and suddenly disappears above a parachute-rigging building. The SR-71 does not take off. Later in the day, an official “flash” message goes out to base personnel telling them not to talk to the press in case they had seen anything. (Nukes 387–392)

May — The Chinese UFO Studies Association is established under the auspices of Wuhan University, with branches in Beijing, Shanghai, and the provinces of Guangdong, Sichuan, Shanxi, Hubei, and Guangxi. It is headed by Cha

Leping, a 26-year-old astrophysics student. The association later is incorporated into the China UFO Research Organization as an official branch of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

May — Late afternoon. Two witnesses are driving through Manlius, New York, when they catch a glimpse of a disc- shaped object the size of a football field hovering above a patch of trees. The driver stops the car and steps outside. Yellow, red, and green lights are rotating around its perimeter. A commercial aircraft and news helicopter are also visible in the sky. The object is still not moving and soundless. Then two jet fighters, apparently scrambled from Griffiss AFB \[now the Griffiss Business and Technology Park\] in Rome, New York, fly toward the object, which takes off like a bullet and disappears.

May 2 — 10:15 a.m. A Santa Clara County park ranger and another county employee are in the hills east of San Jose, California, when they see a shiny, mirror-like spherical object moving north to south. They take turns studying it through binoculars. The object has a blue-green band in the center and is orange at the bottom. It makes rapid up- and-down motions as it moves forward and spins faster as its speed diminishes. The object stops and spins toward Lick Observatory to the east of their position for 10 seconds. Then it accelerates rapidly and speeds away to the south. The sighting duration is 3–4 minutes. (UFOEv II 226)

It blacks out completely and she sees a huge object move beneath the cloud cover directly ahead of her car.

May 7 — 3:50 p.m. A Dutch KLM airliner is flying just over 30,000 feet above the Dachstein Mountains in the Austrian Alps. The pilot sees a gray spherical object flying overhead, which he reports to the Air Control Center in Vienna, which contacts the Austrian Air Force. Maj. Karl Schwarz orders three Saab 105 aircraft to intercept. Once they make visual contact, two of the jets attempt the intercept while the third takes film footage. The UFO’s erratic movements, however, make it impossible to follow, and the object is soon out of sight. At 5:50 p.m., a German Lufthansa airliner comes in close contact with a similar object, Schwarz orders two more fighters to scramble.

The Saab 105 pilots think the object’s variable speed means it is playing with them. It is flying some 9,800 feet above them, but they cannot maneuver well enough to catch it.

May 9 — 9:00 p.m. A woman is driving home with her daughter in Bargersville, Indiana, when bright red flashes of light illuminate the inside of her truck and the surrounding area. The flashes are caused by red balls of light about the size of lemons in the empty fields around them. The balls blink on and off in succession, climbing up one telephone pole. Moving down, and crossing the road to perform the same motion on another pole. They approach the truck, forcing her to back up the truck. Finally, the phenomenon ceases and she drives home. When they get there, her German shepherd dog starts whining and barking. Her husband steps outside to see what’s going on.

Suddenly, their two daughters start screaming as small red balls of light move across their mother’s back and behind her hair. She does not feel anything, but the dog runs to the barn and stays there all night.

May 16 — 3:00 p.m. A civilian pilot is flying a Pirat glider near a cement mill in Działoszyn, Poland, when he notices an object maneuvering across the fumes from factory chimneys below. Seconds later it moves in front of the glider, and he takes evasive action. It is an isosceles triangle shape with a side length of 30 feet and a dull brownish- green. At one point it turns up one of its corners at an angle of 45° in an apparent attempt to correct its flight.

Then it changes orientation to the horizontal, shrinks in size, and disappears. A similar object is seen the same day near Wielún. (Poland 69)

The animals have died of natural causes, he contends, and the mysterious aspects can be explained prosaically. He cites ornithologist Kenneth Sager: “The larger the animal, the more difficult it is for the scavenger to gain access to the food supply below the tough surface. \[Thus they attack the\] softer points of entry, namely the eyes, anal openings, and the soft underbelly areas, especially the udders of female bovines.” L. D. Kuttner of the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine says that many scavengers can make as clean a cut as “might be done by a surgeon with a knife.” (Wikipedia, “[Cattle mutilation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_mutilation%23U.S._governmental_explanation&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107109875&usg=AOvVaw2ovLsVFl1QtLiRPY3sxM_A)”; Kenneth M.

June 11 — An unknown cigar-shaped object passes close to a commercial aircraft near Venice, Italy. (Nick Redfern, A Covert Agenda: UFO Secrecy Exposed, Simon & Schuster, 1997, p. 162)

June 14 — Evening. Many residents of Moscow, Russia, see a huge, reddish-orange, horseshoe-shaped object accompanied by swirling luminous gases. Some 250 miles to the west, Lt. Col. Oleg Karyakin hears a low- frequency booming noise and sees a bright object less than 500 feet away. He runs toward it, feels some resistance, but continues until he is about 150 feet away. It gives off a high-pitched sound and briefly emits three white rays, then ascends rapidly, hovers for 2 seconds, then moves to the northwest and vanishes. Shortly afterward, he sees a large, reddish UFO above some treetops. Another bright object is accompanying the first, flying horizontally and leaving a fiery trail. Some 30 others witness this event. Soviet investigators conclude that the objects were the launches of two communications satellites, a [Gorizont](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorizont&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107116547&usg=AOvVaw23k2L5y9tzXIc-KDeiaJbd) and [Kosmos 1188](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1188&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107116869&usg=AOvVaw3eTwOVofetC5sYnjfyFy7d).

June 14 — 7:00–8:00 p.m. A flurry of UFO sightings by numerous witnesses takes place in Córdoba, Jorge Newbery and Ezeiza airports in Buenos Aires, and Rosario, Argentina, including airport personnel and meteorologists, with extensive newspaper coverage. Objects appear singly and in “fleets” and are described variously as “luminous oval-spherical,” “spinning top,” spindle-shaped, and a sphere that emits “an intense luminous ray that illuminated the surface of the river.” At Pajas Blancas Airport in Córdoba, a UFO causes operations to be stopped for several minutes after it follows the landing pattern of aircraft into the airport. Sightings occur around the same time in Uruguay, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay. CUFOS suspects many of the observations might be due to a high-altitude barium cloud produced by a rocket launch.

As it bobs about, a light comes on in the interior. Smith yells at it and the light goes out. (“Romance under a UFO,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 2, no. 5 (July/Aug. 1980): 14)

June 17 — 11:00 p.m. Two women driving with four young children north on Interstate 75 near Grayling Army Airfield in Grayling, Michigan, when they see two lights moving from right to left in front of their car. Two minutes later, three more lights (two blinking, one steady) appear to the right and pace the car at 85 mph, moving closer until they are about 100 feet directly above them.

June 21 — 1:30 a.m. Janet McLeod notices two large, orange, domed discs circling low about four blocks west of her home in Assumption, Illinois. They stop and hover at treetop level. The top one gradually fades out from top to bottom. The lower one turns on its side and shines a beam toward the ground for 5 minutes. Then it goes back to the horizontal and fades out in the same way. When she steps outside 5 minutes later, she notices it is dead quiet, the natural sounds resuming after 2 minutes.

It has several lights that flash on and off 2–3 times per second. The object itself is shaped like “two straw hats placed brim to brim” with a brilliant center line. It stops hovering and ascends vertically, disappearing in 3–4 seconds. (“The Chinese Connection…and Some Wholesome Chinese Philosophy,” IUR 7, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1982): 13)

August 8–9 — Before 12:00 midnight. Three security policemen on the eastern side of the Manzano Weapons Storage Area adjacent to Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, see a bright light descend in a restricted area about 3 miles to the north-northeast. It travels quickly and stops suddenly over Coyote Canyon. At 12:20 a.m., a Sandia guard observes a disc-shaped object with a bright light hovering behind a building. He approaches it with a shotgun and attempts to use his radio, but it has stopped working. The object shoots straight up. These and other incidents result in a report being filed with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations at Kirtland. The incident is subsequently investigated by agent [Richard Doty](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.exopaedia.org/Doty%252C%252BRichard&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107131163&usg=AOvVaw15_qBwcRRACKEwO7ExCX36)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.exopaedia.org/Doty%252C%252BRichard&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107131478&usg=AOvVaw3q42Gyq56i-zaXdxP_Lw6a) who files a preliminary report on the incident.

However, after Noah Lawrence at AFOSI Headquarters tells Maccabee there are no other documents on file, Doty begins to backtrack. Maccabee also meets Russ Curtis inside the Manzano

G. McNamara of the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Ottawa, Canada, which serves as a repository for Canadian UFO reports for the Canadian National Research Council. Klass characterizes New Brunswick ufologist [Stanton Friedman](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanton_T._Friedman&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107136200&usg=AOvVaw2XhDnC0MAfWQsC-lOYVOu_) as a snake oil salesman and UFO guru whose lectures are filled with falsehoods, disparaging his credentials, his ego, and his modus operandi. He warns McNamara that the astronomers at the institute will soon be the targets of Friedman’s coverup accusations. (Dolan II 221–222)

August 17 — 1:15 a.m. Security guard [Phil Battle](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/175585633/phillip-battle&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107136706&usg=AOvVaw1vIQOnEQsOAm5pRvS2yk47) is driving his truck in the parking lot of the Teledyne-Ohio Steel plant in Lima, Ohio, and sees an unusual bright light in the sky. He steps out and watches a round, silvery form about 270 feet away. It has little holes on the surface, a flashing yellow light, and white floodlights all around it. It hovers for about 5 minutes, moving back and forth. Battle’s CB radio does not work when he tries to alert others. Suddenly a yellow light shoots out at Battle, knocking him back against his truck, scarring his knee and hurting his back and kidneys. The beam also reddens his left eye. The UFO then takes off. He and other guard look for the object and see a light about 1,200 feet to the north, slightly larger than the moon, which drifts westward after 15– 20 seconds.

August 20 — 10:30 p.m. A college student is driving on a rural road about 5 minutes east of Mossy Head, Florida, when he becomes aware of an array of lights hovering above a hill ahead of him. They move low over the area from right to left, 300–600 feet ahead of him. It disappears, but another cluster of lights rushes by him on his left side with a quiet whoosh sound. Inadvertently he begins driving more slowly, slumped over the steering wheel. He continues driving to Jacksonville, where he notices his bare feet are red and inflamed. The redness fades away by the evening of the following night, leaving only some apparent bites marks that are sore to the touch.

September 4 — 1:15 p.m. Flight instructor Lloyd List is flying northbound at 138 mph in a Cessna 172 at 6,500 feet about 5 miles south of the airport in Red Bluff, California. His passenger, a school official, calls his attention to a shiny object ahead of them. For the first 5–6 seconds, the object grows larger in angular size. Then it stops getting larger, as if it has adopted the Cessna’s speed and direction. They close in on the object and watch it shoot right by the airplane’s left wingtip only 30 feet away. It looks like a metallic football no larger than 3 feet in size. It is silent and the surface has a mirror finish. It exhibits no wobble as it passes through the plane’s turbulence. List descends to 6,000 feet and turns to the south to look for it but cannot find the object. (“Plane’s Near Collision with Mini-UFO,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 1 (Nov./Dec. 1980): 11–12)

He meets the man he calls “Falcon” (described as elderly and gaunt) later at a restaurant, beginning a long-running relationship between Moore and 10 members of a shadowy group connected with military intelligence and supposedly opposed to the coverup of UFOs. The story soon emerges that the Roswell incident involved alien bodies and that in 1949 another alien, this one still alive, was found and housed at Los Alamos until its death in the early 1950s. It is called an Extraterrestrial Biological Entity (EBE) and is the first of three that the government would have in its custody. Moore decides to cooperate with these AFOSI sources and provide them with information. They tell him there is considerable interest in [Paul Bennewitz](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bennewitz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107147669&usg=AOvVaw1Mh4GbwG-j-Wc_d0080Aex) and that he is to spy on Bennewitz and APRO as well, inundating them with disinformation that Doty and others will supply.

He goes to the window and sees a round object about 70 feet wide hovering above his backyard trees 110 feet away. Hundreds of steady bright white lights surround its perimeter, rotating in a clockwise direction. A row of square white windows is also visible. McAlister wakes up his wife Faye, who also watches the object, which, after tilting on its side, is now receding to the east-northeast at a good rate of speed. The UFO settles into place as a distant white light source that persists until dawn at 7:05 a.m. McAlister claims his ears ring for another 3 days from the initial noise.

September 13 — Night. Some people camping near Hamilton, Texas, wake up when their tent is lit up with a yellow glow. Outside is a loud humming sound and above them at no more than 125 feet is a triangular object. The underside is grayish or greenish, and two lights appear at each tip in a combination of yellow-white, red-green, and blue-white. The object is moving north very slowly but stops for about 10 seconds and begins to pulsate, almost sounding as if it will stall. It starts up again, heads north, and is soon gone. Thirty minutes later, the group hears a loud explosion, and some people see sparks above the top of a hill. (MUFON UFO Journal, January 1981)

September 21 — 7:00 p.m. A witness is driving west on a county road near Lima, Ohio. She looks up and sees a square opening in the clouds that looks like a picture frame.

September 22 — 3:43 a.m. Pan Am Flight 440, flying at 39,000 feet and piloted by Capt. Dave Garber, nearly collides with an unidentified blue-green cigar-shaped object over the Caribbean Sea south of Haiti. The UFO has a

horizontal row of 5–6 steady lights, which the flight crew presumes are windows. The distance between the Pan Am flight and the UFO at its closest approach is less than a mile. The estimated length of the UFO is 50 feet. It changes course when the plane flashes its landing lights. The event is witnessed independently by the crew of two other airliners in the area.

September 26 — 4:30 a.m. Susan Southerland, Debbie Riley, and Kim Conolty are driving in Washington, Indiana, when they see a streetlight-shaped light source slightly above the treetops. It begins moving toward them. Even after their car turns, the light stays on their left side. They drive to the police station and ask officers Tim Roark and Don Grannon to look at it through binoculars, and they are convinced it is something unusual.

September 26 — 2:26 p.m. A woman watches a Saturn-shaped object approach her home in Blythe, California, from the east and pass overhead for 2–3 minutes and shoot straight up out of sight. (“Daylight ‘Saturn’ over California,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 1 (Nov./Dec. 1980): 14)

September 30 — 1:00 a.m. George Blackwell, a farmer near Rosedale, Victoria, Australia, is awakened by a noise and his disturbed livestock. Getting up, he goes outside and sees a 24-by-15-foot sphere passing by, some 6–9 feet off the ground and 450 feet distant. It stops above a water tank, then settles to the ground. Blackwell rides a motorcycle to the spot and stops 45 feet from the landed object. It is making a loud whistling sound. After 3 minutes, the UFO emits a louder noise, gives off a blast of air, and moves off to the east. A 30-foot doughnut-shaped ring is found where the object rested, and Blackwell experiences health problems the next week. The 10,000-gallon water tank is mysteriously drained of water.

October or November — Ground-based radar at RAF Neatishead, near Norwich, England, tracks an aerial object executing aerial maneuvers that “defied all convention.” A very bright light is seen by the pilot of an RAF F-4 Phantom II aircraft. It vanishes as quickly as it has appeared. (Nick Redfern, A Covert Agenda: UFO Secrecy Exposed, Simon & Schuster, 1997, p. 136)

October 1? — A group of people go to Lucky Point, east of Monroe City, Indiana, to look for UFOs. High in the eastern sky they notice a dark triangle, as large as the full moon and possibly surrounded by a light glow. As it moves overhead, they hear a voice announce, “the time is now.” It changes direction slightly and accelerates to the northwest. The group reports a tingling sensation and a humming noise on their FM scanner radios. (“UFO Mini- Flap in Southern Indiana,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 3 (Mar./Apr. 1981): 12)

October 5 — 3:00 a.m. Five off-duty metalworkers at the Dagang Oilfield, Tianjin, China, see a cone-shaped, red, glowing object that lights the area below.

October 6 — 5:50 p.m. A retired man is resting on his sundeck in Ipswich, Massachusetts, when he sees a silver object tumbling end-over-end. He grabs binoculars and watches as it passes overhead and continues, appearing to descend as it disappears behind trees toward the Sagamore Hill Solar Radar Observatory \[now relocated to Millstone Hill, Westford\] in South Hamilton.

October 15 — 11:30 p.m. A Knox County, Indiana, deputy sheriff stops by the side of a road to stretch his legs. Out of the east comes a black triangular form, as big as a house and 10 times the angular size of the full moon. He estimates it is 250 feet away and 200 feet up at its closest. Five figures are visible from the waist up through a long window on one side of the triangle. Large slanted unblinking eyes, white skin, and a straight-line mouth are visible on their elongated heads. He thinks they look afraid, so he tries to telepathically assure them not to be afraid. They respond by asking him, “Why do you hate the Iranians?” The object draws closer the speeds away to the northeast. During the sighting, his police radio displays intermittent interference and his patrol car’s engine and headlights pulsate. The deputy feels light-headed and sluggish, and his eyes water.

October 16 — Evening. Operators at Tianjin Binhai International Airport, China, are observing the movements of Flight 402 on radar when an unexplained echo shows up. When the airliner is about 6,500 feet from the runway, the plane’s blip disappears for 7 seconds. The mystery target gives a strong, distinct return, and it seems to cause strong radio interference as the airliner touches down. Other anomalous targets show up later that night, but none are seen visually.

October 23 — 8:55 p.m. Randall Rogers and Larry Mortensen, employed at the Phelps-Dodge Corporation’s copper smelting site at Morenci, Arizona, go outside to pick up three other employees for an evening meal break. They notice a boomerang-shaped object approaching the north smokestack at 1,500–2,000 feet altitude and a very slow speed. It stops and hovers briefly, then comes down to 700–1,000 feet, just above the stack. A brilliant light erupts from the forward angle and shines directly down into the interior of the stack. 10 seconds later it goes out and the object moves south to hover above the south stack and shine the bright light inside. It then moves off at 5–10 mph to the south, then suddenly takes off at great speed to the southwest. A very short time later, it returns and hovers above the slag dump. The object is seen as dull black and perhaps 1,320 feet from wingtip to wingtip. Eight reddish lights are on each wing about 75 feet apart and connected by a white tube of light. Greenlee County Sheriff Ralph Gomez also observes the object, as do about 100 members of the Morenci High School band.

October 26 — 7:00 p.m. An oddly shaped UFO is observed by a husband and wife on their farm 2 miles southeast of Bloomfield, Indiana. The object looks like two full moons spaced about 12 feet apart with a flashing red light in back like a lopsided triangle. Each white light is about 3 feet in diameter, and the white is intense but nothing around lights up. The object is at treetop level and passes to the right of a security light. There is no reflection of metal anywhere. The woman gets the impression that the lights are connected to something huge, saying: “The object passed about 20 feet above the barn making no sound and lights making no light. When it was over the barn roof, the sows with baby pigs in the barn jumped up and began wild grunting and knocking about in their pens. They settled down immediately after the object cleared the roof. The object is now coming very slowly towards the front of our house and yard. My husband had gone back into the house to watch from the front windows, my children are crying, and I am on the back porch having the time of my life.” The UFO disappears behind the roof line of the house.

October 31 — Day. The airport control tower at Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, detects a UFO on its radar. An F-5 squadron has just landed, with the exception of one plane, whose pilot requests authorization to pursue. He sees a bright gold object right in front of him and accelerates to approach, but the object immediately speeds up. The control tower loses the object on its radar. The pilot continues to pursue for 2 minutes before the UFO speeds off over the ocean. (Clark III 206–207; Brazil 555–556)

November 2 — 12:42 p.m. A couple driving westbound on US Highway 50 some 20 miles east of Montrose, Colorado, notice a silver, oblong object in the distance. As the highway starts to curve, it is seen against a background of mesa. They stop the car for a better look for another 10 seconds. It banks like an aircraft to the right and its shape changes to an oval. It disappears by shooting up over the top of the mesa toward the northeast.

November 2 — 3:00 p.m. Mike Clampett and his wife are stepping out of a Toyota showroom on Solano Avenue in Vallejo, California. They see a group of people looking at the sky where a Piper Cub seems to be on a collision course with a cigar-shaped object. The plane is moving north to south while the UFO flies silently from high in the east to the west. The object is rotating or spiraling about once every second. It takes nearly 10 minutes for the object to reach nearly overhead, dropping in altitude all the while. It remains stationary in the zenith about 5 minutes then moves to the south at a higher altitude. (“A Spiralling Daylight Cigar,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 2 (Jan./Feb. 1981): 11–12)

He spots an orange, bullet-shaped light that is keeping even with him at 212 mph. The light brightens and begins to pulse with an increasing frequency, then shoots forward and makes a perfect right-angle turn upward. Five minutes later, it reappears behind him and performs a similar maneuver. The sighting is corroborated by a commercial airliner. (“A Twin ‘Déjà vu’ Sighting?” IUR 7, no. 1 (January 1982): 5)

November 18 — For the resolution of the CAUS v. NSA, the National Security Agency creates two affidavits to explain why UFO information is to be withheld from the public. The affidavits are written by the chief officer of policy for the NSA, Eugene F. Yeates. The first of the two is the “unclassified, softened-down” version released to CAUS and the public. The affidavit says that it is in the NSA’s direct interests not to have the documents published, as they can compromise national security because they contain sensitive intelligence regarding the interception of foreign communication; and no meaningful amount of information can be declassified without giving foreign intelligence information regarding US time and methods of information interception. The second affidavit is for Judge [Gerhard A. Gesell](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Gesell&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107185786&usg=AOvVaw0RgBa73TvQXZheZX8Y59py) only, classified “top secret,” which the judge can read with an “in camera” clearance. The judge sides with the NSA after reviewing the affidavit (released to CAUS through an FOIA request with 95% redactions, later released in 1997 with only 25% redacted, and in 2014 with a bit less missing). Gesell states that “the public interest in disclosure is far outweighed by the sensitive nature of the materials and the obvious effect on national security their release may well entail.” CAUS fashions an appeal to the US Supreme Court.

November 18 — 7:30–11:00 p.m. Many people living in northern Missouri and northeastern Kansas, from Edina, Missouri, to Fairview, Kansas, report a formation of unusual lights traveling slowly and noiselessly. An airport and the police department in Kirksville, Missouri, receive 25 calls or so. The basic description is a triangular formation with two bright headlights. Rick Hull, a 20-year-old photographer from Trenton, Missouri, watches the lights pass overhead four different times; the underside shows a diamond-shaped array of white lights with a steady red beacon in the middle. There are also two bright headlights and an apparent dome with seven green lights around it. He manages to photograph the array only once out of several attempts. Most people provide an estimated altitude for the lights as 300–400 feet, but a Trenton witness puts it at 1,000–1,500 feet, and Missouri Highway Patrolman Bob Lober guesses 1,500–1,800 feet in Edinburg, Missouri. The lights change direction frequently. Radar technician Franklin West, located at a remote radar station of the Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control Center at Sublette, Missouri, finds a radar target in the same direction and distance as visual reports that local witnesses alert him to. It passes through the Kirksville area 4–5 times in a 2–3 hour period. He estimates its speed at 45 mph. A pilot landing at the Olathe, Kansas, Air Route Traffic Control Center says he recognizes the UFO as a refueling tanker with jets following it, which matches an established refueling track in the area. The Center for UFO Studies confirms that Altus AFB in Oklahoma, flew a huge C-5A cargo aircraft behind a KC-135 tanker from Grissom AFB in Peru, Indiana, that evening. The two planes flew in tandem at 20,000 feet at an indicated air speed of 250 knots beginning at 8:00 p.m. and ending around 11:00 p.m. However, there are a few discrepancies with the reports.

November 19 — 11:45 p.m. A couple is driving home to Longmont, Colorado, from Denver when they hear a loud “whish” and a beam of blue light strikes their car. Their headlights begin to dim and the radio emits static before fading out. The back wheels of the car leave the pavement and the car rises at an angle into the air. They lose consciousness and wake up as the car is resuming its 50 mph journey down the road. More than one hour of time is missing. The next day, the woman finds a rectangular mark on her abdomen and soon has vivid dreams of a craft and an entity. She develops a nearly fatal case of pneumonia and finds out she is pregnant. The man discovers a melanoma on his legs, but it improves. Under hypnosis they recall seeing a hovering domed craft, a luminous entryway, and a humanoid with a large head, gray skin, thin fingers, and shiny golden garb.

November 29 — Mechanic Granger Taylor, 32, of Duncan, British Columbia, a man obsessed with aliens and UFOs to the point of building his own full-size model in his backyard, announces to his friends and parents that he is going to board an alien spacecraft and take a 42-month interstellar voyage. He is never seen again. In 1986, truck fragments and bones are found at a blast site on Mount Prevost. Though DNA testing is not in common use at the time, pathology work by the coroner attributes the adult human bones to Taylor. Fragments of clothing found amid the decayed material are from a shirt owned by Taylor, as confirmed by his mother. Representatives from the auto division of the RCMP confirm the truck is his.

As for psychotronic weapons, he sees much potential, saying, “with development, these weapons would be able to induce illness or death at little or no risk to the operator. Range may be a present problem, but this will probably be overcome if it has not been already.” As an example, he cites work by the Soviets, who have “examined the effects of electromagnetic radiation on humans and have applied those techniques against the US Embassy in Moscow.” (John B.

December 3 — 8:30 p.m. On State Highway 57 about 10 miles south of McLain, Mississippi, Robert and Janice Lowrey \[or Lawrey?\] see a luminous, blue-white ball of light to the east. The FM radio of their car quits, the car’s headlights dim, and the car heater quits when light comes briefly over the right side of the hood. They estimate the light to be about a foot in diameter and only 3 feet away. The seat belt alarm also comes on during the encounter. The light just vanishes.

December 4 — 8:38 a.m. Graham Moyle and other controllers at the Perth, Western Australia, airport report watching “silver tumbling discs” two or three times through 11:00 a.m. Danielle Russell, 12, sees four objects with lights that change color from red to blue to green moving quickly north to south at 11:00 a.m. There is a reported paint on the radar 7 miles distant at a speed of 138 mph and a height of 5 miles. The target is lost in the radar’s cone of silence. The RAAF scrambles a Macchi jet, but it cannot find the objects. At 1:20 p.m., a target is detected on the radar at 21 miles, due south. The tower tracks an object high above one of the runways. Five minutes later, the radar returns another target.

December 5 — 10:00 p.m. Two teenagers parked next to a swimming pool in a subdivision of Normal, Illinois, see a stationary bright white light about half the size of the full moon in the western sky. Suddenly it splits into two smaller halves that rejoin, growing small and fuzzy, then brighten and enlarge. Three small lights shoot out and snap back in again. They watch the display for about one hour. During the last 15 minutes, their ears begin to hurt simultaneously. The pain shifts from their right ears to their temples, and they both feel a pea-shaped lump under their skin. They return home. The next day the lumps are gone but they have headaches. On December 8 at 8:45 p.m., the boy returns to the same spot alone and sees another light for about one minute. When he calls his girlfriend again to tell her, both regain the painful lumps in their temples.

December 6 — 12:45 a.m. A man is driving westbound a few miles north of Edwardsville, Illinois, when a disc-like object cuts across his view from the south about 100 feet away. It seems to be 40 feet in diameter and 9–13 feet thick. Five intense, steady, blue-white lights illuminate its dark shape. He sees windows at the center. The witness tries to drive toward the object, but his car engine fails for 1–2 minutes. The object zips off after a few minutes.

December 6 — 9:01 a.m. Jean Findley of Poole, Dorset, England, is waiting for a bus and feels the urge to look up. She sees a disc-shaped, domed UFO hovering above nearby trees. Feeling “spellbound” and experiencing a sensation of “peace, calm, and warmth,” she watches the object emit a beam of light, rotate once, and fly away at a great rate of speed. She looks at her watch and sees that 4 minutes have elapsed, seemingly in the space of a few seconds. Even though it is rush hour, she sees no one else around. (Clark III 866; Jenny Randles, UFO Reality, R. Hale, 1983)

December 13 — 5:47 p.m. James Garrigus sees an oblong, pulsating orange glow descending at a 30° angle in the northeast as he is driving in Lima, Ohio. Suddenly it curves back upward in a backwards “J,” continuing to move in the same direction. The light increases speed, still bobbing and spinning, and finally shoots upward.

December 15 — 3:00 p.m. About 40 witnesses at the Orpington Hospital redevelopment site in London, England, watch a UFO that alternately hovers, moves slowly, shoots across the sky, and finally divides into three and disappears straight up at 4:15 p.m. The object is an elongated triangular shape with a reddish-orange nose, silvery body, and diamond-blue rear section, with its nose pointing southeast. Peter McSherry, clerk of works for Lovell (Southern) Ltd estimates its height at 50,000 feet. A video of the object is taken in the presence of other witnesses at Seal

Chart near Sevenoaks, Kent, and although it shows only a point of light in a cloudless sky, it does corroborate the sighting.

December 25 — 9:00 p.m. Soviet spy satellite Kosmos 749 re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere, breaks into several pieces, and creates a spectacular fireworks display over northwest Europe. Police stations, coast guards, and the RAF receive hundreds of calls reporting four or five “comet-like objects leaving bright trails.” Astronomers also record three fireball meteors the same night, the largest and brightest appearing at 3:00 a.m. (UFOFiles2, [p. 105](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/the-ufo-files-the-inside-story-of-real-life-sightings-david-clarke/page/n173/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107203841&usg=AOvVaw3WAmNHoZO6lZMFbk_s1IA5))

December 26 — 3:00 a.m. A series of reported sightings of unexplained lights near Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, England, have become linked with claims of UFO landings. The events occur just outside RAF Woodbridge \[now MOD Woodbridge\], used at the time by the United States Air Force. USAF personnel, including deputy base commander Lieutenant Colonel [Charles I. Halt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I._Halt&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107204665&usg=AOvVaw1oHBmEE871zirlFMGQRaRp), claim to experience a UFO event. A security patrol (A1C [John](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/A1C_John_Burroughs.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107204987&usg=AOvVaw0nogprRmR9GvL4NGvLjnMY) [Burroughs](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/A1C_John_Burroughs.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107205315&usg=AOvVaw2vVT_SH0_qnitij9rjTeH9) and S/Sgt Budd Steffens) near the East Gate of RAF Woodbridge sees lights apparently descending into nearby Rendlesham Forest. These lights are attributed by astronomers to a piece of natural debris seen burning up as a fireball over southern England at the time. The observers initially think it is a downed aircraft but, when others (S/Sgt [James Penniston](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/Sgt_James_Penniston.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107205669&usg=AOvVaw25-1p99-gLOD03VSpn2QXt), Burroughs, and A1C [Edward Cabansag](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/A1C_Edward_Cabansag.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107205986&usg=AOvVaw0JHFFBZuFuHrq0hzAQPiit)) enter the forest to investigate they see, according to Halt’s memo, a glowing object, metallic in appearance, with colored lights. As they attempt to approach the object, it appears to move through the trees, and “the animals on a nearby farm went into a frenzy.” Penniston later claims he and Burroughs encountered a “craft of unknown origin” while in the forest, which he photographs and touches, although there is no publicized mention of this at the time and no corroboration from other witnesses. (Burroughs only reports a blinding white light.) Shortly after 4:00 a.m., local police are called to the scene, but they report that the only lights they can see are those from the Orfordness Lighthouse, a few miles away on the coast. After daybreak, Burroughs and Penniston return to a small clearing near the eastern edge of the forest and find three small impressions on the ground in a triangular pattern, as well as burn marks and broken branches on nearby trees. At 10:30 a.m., the Suffolk Constabulary are called out again, this time to see the impressions, which they think could have been made by an animal.

December 27 — 9:30 p.m. Construction workers skating in Yantan Park, Lanzhou, Gansu province, China, notice a red triangular object moving slowly in the eastern sky. It moves above them and they notice it has a misty circle surrounding it and a dark red center. It also has a gray protuberance that shines a brilliant light, and the outer edge emits regular flashes of yellow light. They watch it for 7 minutes until it disappears in the northwest.

December 28 — 1:48 a.m. RAF Woodbridge Deputy Base Commander [Charles Halt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I._Halt&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107207395&usg=AOvVaw0b9i-MR17tJZtJcwBHY49U) visits the alleged December 26 landing site with 20–30 servicemen (including [John Burroughs](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/A1C_John_Burroughs.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107207773&usg=AOvVaw0Mw_ezksfvstUwN0vEvZ1M)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/A1C_John_Burroughs.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107208031&usg=AOvVaw3_l6fYzLsRnBnj7Y4RI8Ah) Sgt.

They take radiation readings in the triangle of depressions and in the surrounding area using an AN/PDR-27, a standard US military radiation survey meter. Although they record 70–100 microR/hr at the landing site, in other regions they detect only 30–40 microR/hr, around the background level. Furthermore, they detect a similar small “burst” over half a mile away from the landing site. Halt records the events on a microcassette recorder, the “Halt tape,” released to UFO researchers in 1984 by Col. Sam Morgan, who has succeeded [Ted Conrad](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/Colonel_Ted_Conrad.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107209248&usg=AOvVaw2tFY2DcgsjDqkZeKF5TGt8) as Halt’s superior. The tape chronicles Halt’s investigation in the forest in real time.

During this investigation, a flashing light is seen across the field to the east, almost in line with a farmhouse, as the witnesses had seen on the first night. The Orfordness Lighthouse is visible further to the east in the same line of sight. Later, three star-like lights are seen in the sky, two to the north and one to the south, about 10° above the horizon. The brightest of these hovers for 2–3 hours and seems to beam down a stream of light from time to time. Astronomers have explained these as merely bright stars. In June 2010, retired Col. Charles Halt signs a notarized affidavit, in which he again summarizes what happened, then states he believes the event to be extraterrestrial and covered up by both the UK and US military. Contradictions between this affidavit and the facts as recorded at the time in Halt’s memo (dated January 13, 1981) and tape recording (made December 28) have been pointed out. In 2010, base commander Col. Ted Conrad provides a statement about the incident to UFO researcher [David Clarke](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Clarke_(journalist)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107209737&usg=AOvVaw0KZi4sBi3VzDDxzQRYvNZv)[.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Clarke_(journalist)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107209974&usg=AOvVaw3lX0c00mfQ1RD0mgvVjbjd) Conrad states that “We saw nothing that resembled Lieutenant Colonel Halt’s descriptions either in the sky or on the ground” and that “We had people in position to validate Halt’s narrative, but none of them could.” In an interview, Conrad criticizes Halt for the claims in his affidavit, saying “he should be ashamed and embarrassed by his allegation that his country and Britain both conspired to deceive their citizens over this issue. He knows better.” Conrad also disputes the testimony of Sgt. [James Penniston](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/Sgt_James_Penniston.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107210328&usg=AOvVaw0YlFCGlrfVi8dX4fLhCXmR)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/Sgt_James_Penniston.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107210571&usg=AOvVaw3egsqKX0QXa5Lz3KQhU_-j) who claims to have touched an alien spacecraft; he had interviewed Penniston at the time and he had not mentioned any such occurrence. Conrad also suggests that the entire incident was a hoax. ()

December 28–29 — Around 12:00 midnight. USAF A1C [Larry Warren](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/Larry_Warren.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107210984&usg=AOvVaw2A27R12ejdKuKFxSytvMNE) claims he is on patrol at RAF Woodbridge with other servicemen who are bringing lighting equipment to a large clearing called Capel Green. At 12:30 a.m., he is

directed into the woods to “investigate a disturbance.” They soon come to a large field where about 40 military personnel are gathered. They are ordered to surround what appears to be a bright fog or mist. When his group enters the field, Warren sees it is a glowing, yellow-green, circular object not more than 12 inches in height. Two officers walk around it with Geiger counters, someone takes photos, and another operates a movie camera. He hears shouts of “Here it comes!” and sees a small red light that quickly approaches his group at 1:30 a.m. The basketball-sized object makes a downward arc and hovers at 20 feet above the ground. It then explodes in a blinding flash that gives off no heat. Instantly, about 25 away, Warren claims he sees a large, pyramid-shaped object topped by a glowing red light. Covering the entire surface are what look like boxes and pipes. An officer orders [Bustinza](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.therendleshamforestincident.com/Sgt_Adrian_Bustinza.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107211596&usg=AOvVaw34OXlS-828IqtEVHwXlGpn) and Warren (now feeling nauseous) to approach within 10–15 feet of the object. Before long they are ordered further back. A staff car arrives, carrying Col. [Gordon Williams](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_E._Williams&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107211942&usg=AOvVaw0_FqbmJ69x_dAlDr8AoAoo) and his staff. From far behind the object comes a bright bluish ball of light. Warren claims he can see large-headed beings inside. He sees Col.

Williams approach the beings and stare at them. Warren arrives back at Security Control at 4:30 a.m. Most ufologists find Warren’s account unreliable, and the book he coauthored, Left at East Gate, is withdrawn by the publisher, Cosimo, in 2017 after finding “inaccurate or embellished” testimony. In 2010, [Jenny Randles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Randles&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107212517&usg=AOvVaw2YL5Xr0Te4V6yWwwgTKSFA), who first reported the Rendlesham case in the London Evening Standard in 1981 and coauthored with local researchers the first book on the case in 1984, Sky Crash: A Cosmic Conspiracy, emphasizes her previously expressed doubts that the incident was caused by extraterrestrial visitors. While suggesting that an unidentified phenomenon might have caused parts of the case, she notes: “Whilst some puzzles remain, we can probably say that no unearthly craft were seen in Rendlesham Forest. We can also argue with confidence that the main focus of the events was a series of misperceptions of everyday things encountered in less than everyday circumstances.” The most plausible skeptical explanation is that the sightings are due to a combination of several factors. The initial sighting on December 26, when the airmen saw something apparently descending into the forest, coincides with the appearance of a bright fireball over southern England; such fireballs are a common source of UFO reports. The supposed landing marks are identified by police and foresters as rabbit diggings. According to the witness statements from December 26, the flashing light seen from the forest lay in the same direction as the Orfordness Lighthouse. When the eyewitnesses attempted to approach the light, they realized it was further off than they thought. Timings on [Halt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I._Halt&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107213109&usg=AOvVaw2COcPNNRNX-JOaRSKJtQ5W)’s tape recording indicate that the light he saw, which lay in the same direction as the light seen two nights earlier, flashed every five seconds, which was the flash rate of the Orfordness Lighthouse.

The star-like objects that Halt reported hovering low to the north and south are thought by some skeptics to have been misinterpretations of bright stars distorted by atmospheric and optical effects. No evidence has emerged to confirm that anything came down in the forest. However, [Nick Redfern](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Redfern&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107213598&usg=AOvVaw1PiWukEYFbfV8nG8YwmowC) in The Rendlesham Forest UFO Conspiracy alleges that the events were created by US and UK military as part of a series of top-secret experiments involving ball lightning and the “use of sophisticated holograms and hallucinogens” to test the reactions of the personnel exposed to them.

the plaintiffs have not proved that the helicopters are associated with the government and that military officials have testified that US armed forces do not have a large, diamond-shaped aircraft in their possession. Although there is no doubt that the incident occurred, it is now considered by many to be a non-UFO case.

Hopkins also shows that a period of unexplained missing time is a typical aspect of the abduction experience. The information comes primarily from hypnotic regression performed by licensed psychologist [Aphrodite Clamar](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doctor.webmd.com/doctor/aphrodite-clamar-ab8738e2-5b55-4812-a744-3992f61501fd-overview&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107237686&usg=AOvVaw3e-IU6GHxEIdfG6XV3XQ9E), who also conducts psychological tests on the abductees.

He finds that most of these cases occur in the late evening or early morning hours, and that in 35% of the cases, witness estimate they are within 100 feet of the object. Rodeghier also notes a high concentration of four characteristics: the presence of a light beam, loss of control of the vehicle, a physiological effect on the witness, and the UFO chasing the vehicle.

1981 — A husband and wife are sleeping in their farmhouse near Newark, Ohio, when their dogs start barking loudly. They can hear people talking outside their window in a “foreign” language. They do not investigate, but in the morning they find three sets of footprint-like traces outside. They look like elongated scratch marks about 12 inches long, are uniform in shape, and go all the way to the fence line and through it. The couple begins to see a “perfectly round white circle of light,” about 1.5 inches in diameter, moving slowly around in their bedroom each night. The light is seen for about a month, no matter how the blinds and curtains are arranged. Sometimes it would stop moving for hours. (Michael D. Swords, “A Trick of the Light,” IUR 31, no. 2 (June 2007): 9)

January — A. Bindas observes a radiant object above the city of Khatanga, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, during the polar night. It disappears and reappears abruptly, hovers, and directs a wide beam of light on the ground. After 5–7 minutes it zooms off in a spiral-shaped trajectory. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, p. 97)

January 8 — 5:00 p.m. A well-documented case of physical effects from a UFO takes place in Trans-en-Provence, Var, France. Renato Nicolaï, a gardener, hears a strange whistling sound while doing agricultural work on his property. He then sees an object in the shape of two saucers, one inverted on top of the other, about 8 feet in diameter land about 150 feet away at a lower elevation. It has a thick band around the middle section, two circles that look like trapdoors, and two feet that extend about 8 inches below the body of the machine. The object takes off almost immediately, rising above the tree line and departing to the northeast. The case quickly comes to the attention of the police and is soon investigated by GEPAN, the French government’s scientific team of UFO investigators.

The physical traces include evidence of vegetation and soil heating, skid marks, and circular ground marks. The chemical analysis reveals that the soil has been heated to 300°–600° C. [Jean-Jacques Velasco](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Velasco&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107242119&usg=AOvVaw2d-EceVG3JwJMI0oo2Wooj) thinks that the object could have weighed between 4 and 5 tons. Trace amounts of phosphate and zinc are found in the sample material, and an analysis of wild alfalfa near the landing site shows chlorophyll levels 30%–50% lower than expected. The police report says that the trace, which appears on an active road, looks like one made by a car tire. This explanation is dismissed by GEPAN because of Nicolaï saying otherwise.

March — 4:30 a.m. A witness is driving toward a pancake house in Memphis, Tennessee, for a cup of coffee when she sees three shining objects in the sky. She is so engrossed in watching that she passes by the restaurant. Suddenly the objects disappear into what look like puffs of smoke. A minute later, one reappears directly over the street in front of her. She turns into the Admiral Benbow Inn parking lot and alerts the night watchman, who sees the object hovering above her car and then rise above the inn.

March 17 — 4:03 a.m. Sgt. Russell Yokum of the St. Helens, Oregon, police is on patrol on US Highway 30 on the edge of town when he sees a bright light apparently above the Columbia River. He goes to the Columbia County Courthouse for a better view, where he is joined by other police, but the object is no longer visible. Meanwhile, they are conversing via CB radio with Donald Atkins, who is in nearby Ridgefield, Washington, and watching a stationary light over the river. Atkins transmits a faint humming sound the object is making through his CB radio to officer Ricky Cade, who captures it on a cassette recorder. Yokum and Cade look to the south and see a bright orange-red light about 80–100 feet above the river, apparently the same one that Atkins is watching. (“An Orange(!)

Frogs stop croaking and dogs begin barking excitedly. The object appears oval and is black except for lights on the circumference. A large circular opening is visible in the bottom of the black disc. Inside the opening the witnesses see “this churning motion of bright white light with yellow and orange colors in it...like gases rolling around in there.” After about 20–30 minutes it takes off rapidly. Shortly thereafter a

jet flies over. Another UFO is seen coming across the trees a good 5 minutes later with the same results. (“Another World,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 5 (July/Aug. 1981): 16)

April 3 — 9:30 p.m. Some 50 people driving on National Route 35 north of Santa Rosa, La Pampa, Argentina, watch an object hovering about 300 feet directly over the Escuela Agrotécnica de Santa Rosa for several minutes. It is a saucer-shaped craft about 100 feet in diameter that is radiating light over its circumference due to an intense white light at its center. It speeds away to the west and disappears.

April 8 — 3:00 a.m. A private pilot named Dennis is flying a Piper PA-28-181 Archer II near the San Luis Reservoir, California, when a bullet-shaped object pulls alongside the airplane. Simultaneously, Dennis’s distance-measuring equipment, navigation and communications radios, and transponder go out. The object shoots ahead of the plane by about 1,500 feet and executes some erratic motions. Then, slowly drifting back, it paces him. The object is glowing orange and has a whirling bluish ring around it.

April 25 — 7:00 a.m. Du Shengyuan notices a curious object circling in the sky above Beijing, China. After unsuccessfully calling media outlets, he goes back outside and finds the object is now directly overhead at more than 6,500 feet. Through binoculars he can see it is bullet-shaped and varies its speed, sometimes hovering. The middle part is white, and the bottom is luminous green.

May 4 — 2 :00 p.m. As he is pulling up to his home in Danville, Pennsylvania, on a motorcycle, William F. Hummer notices “cobwebs” hanging over houses, telephone wires, and parked cars. Wispy material is falling from the sky. He sees something moving around in the sky and goes in to get binoculars. He and another man watch several flying discs as they dart overhead in groups of twos and threes. One pauses and he can see it is round and metallic with a dome and “kind of peak on it.” His sister joins them and says they can see big masses of material floating around for 30 minutes.

At first it is 1/2 mile away but it eventually approaches to 300 feet. Inside, the cosmonauts see three brown-skinned beings with slanted bright blue eyes, straight noses, and bushy eyebrows. At a distance of 100 feet, they resemble mechanical robots. Their facial expressions remain emotionless. They seem to be requesting closer contact with the Soviet craft. The object shifts around erratically and from time to time it vanishes, but then reappears in an instant. It seems to be metallic, but it has no doors, no solar batteries, no optical systems, no antennae, and no marks or writing of any kind. The cosmonauts also notice normal-looking armchairs, some devices, and walls inside the craft.

July 11 — 10:30 p.m. A camp director at Girl Scout camp headquarters near Port Byron, Illinois, suddenly hears his dog barking in a warning manner. Through the trees that screen the camp swimming pool, he sees bright lights. He moves to an unobstructed view of the pool and notices the pool lights are not on. Instead, directly above the pool, and higher than the regular lights, is a brilliant light. Suddenly the lights go out. He hears a whirring noise that rises in pitch as it apparently rises into the sky. When he turns on the lights, he notices the pump is not running and the water level is down three feet, meaning some 30,000 gallons of water are gone.

It stops abruptly about 600–900 feet away, then changes direction and begins silently pacing the car. Mrs. Thew, who is driving, becomes frightened and speeds up to 65 mph in an effort to reach a lighted area of town. The UFO keeps pace and moves closer, allowing the witnesses to see more details, such as two slots like vertically elongated rectangles and a row of square portholes. After a while it shoots away to the east. When they arrive home in Temuka at 1:20 a.m., they are surprised to see the object about 1,000 feet overhead. It remains visible another 40 minutes.

It is about 30 feet in diameter and is glowing with an internal yellow light, which goes out as the object approaches. The object clears the highest part of the bridge by about 10 feet, making a wheezing sound. At its closest, it is 150 feet above the ground and 750 feet away from Wagner. It disappears above a small hill to the west. (“The Case of the Paralyzed Rabbits,” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 6 (Jan./Feb. 1982): 13)

It is a large sphere about 10–12 feet in diameter and moving silently west to east. Shortly afterward, it returns over some trees to the east, moving slowly toward the lake. It comes down about 3 feet off the ground and hovers 4–5 feet from the edge of the water, then moves slowly back to the east.

July 23 — 10:30 p.m. James L. McCabe is sitting outside his home on Highland Avenue in Dover, New Jersey, looking for satellites with binoculars. Suddenly, two flashing white lights appear above the southern horizon. Their flashes become more frequent when their speed increases. One speeds away, but the other approaches, slipping in and out of the clouds for 20 seconds. He estimates it is at 1,500 feet when overhead, has a flat bottom, a strange raised center section, and a flat metallic color. Its top has a rippled appearance. The upper section has two windows.

July 30 — 8:30 p.m. Jennifer Lindsey and her three children are driving near Berwick, Mississippi, when they notice an object with bright lights moving back and forth across the sky. As they arrive home, the object is moving at a low altitude above the house. It is bigger than an airplane, shaped like an arrowhead, and appears to be metallic.

Behind it is a red light traveling in tandem. It passes over the house again 30 minutes later, moving west, without the trailing red light.

July 31 — An interview with Russian UFO expert [Felix Ziegel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Ziegel%23UFO_studies&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107280816&usg=AOvVaw0CeXpEVbagv-c1rBTD9aUD) appears in the Italian weekly magazine Gente, followed by a second part in the August 7 issue. Ziegel claims he has 50,000 UFO reports on file in the Moscow Aviation Institute and has compiled eight volumes of research material that are still unpublished. He believes there are three basic types of UFO occupants: spacemen (tall beings), humanoids (human-like), and aliens (short and like the “greys”). He says that UFOs carry crews of androids that possess the ability to appear and disappear at will and “seem to be deliberately constructed in order to confound all our notions of space, matter, time, and dimension.” (Good Above, [pp. 240–241](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/240/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107281264&usg=AOvVaw1qHyj1QvdN867CoiOKHaYd))

July 31 — 8:50 p.m. Two men in a motorboat on lake Mönninselkä near Pielisjärvi, Finland, see a dark spot in the sky. Four lights suddenly appear above them, and a fog forms in front of the boat. They lose the ability to move and soon lose consciousness. When they wake up, they are differently placed in the boat, the time is 4:10 a.m., and the boat is drifting. They go back ashore to their cottage, their heads begin to ache, and they feel very sleepy. Their hands tremble for nearly 2 weeks afterward, and their sense of balance is disturbed.

July 31 — 9:15 p.m. A husband and wife are driving along a bumpy road near Kinston, North Carolina, when their headlights and dash lights go out and the engine stops. They open the doors and get out to push the car to the side of the road (noticing later that it is odd that they can see the road on a moonless night) and the lights suddenly come on again. They start the car up again and drive the short way home. Mechanics tell them they don’t know why a car would do that, so they assume there was a UFO involved.

July or August — 11:00 p.m. A man is camping with the Red Cross in a small town to the southeast of San José, Costa Rica. He sees a well-lit, triangular object about 1,200 feet away and perhaps 1,000 feet above the ground. It is completely silent. After hovering, the object turns, moves, makes a sharp angular turn, and then another to draw a triangular path in the sky. Then it moves rapidly high, then low, back to its original location. A second triangle approaches, and they hover in close proximity to each other for 30 minutes. Then they split up and disappear rapidly. (Michael D. Swords, “Timmerman’s Triangles,” IUR 29, no. 2 (Summer 2004): 15–16)

August — Three mysterious flattened circles appear in a cornfield within a natural amphitheater known as The Devil’s Punchbowl at Cheesefoot Head near Winchester, Wiltshire, England. The central circle is 55 feet in diameter; two smaller circles are arranged on either side.

August 8 — 6:15 p.m. A witness is on the beach with some friends at Chalupy on the Hel peninsula, north of Gdynia, Poland. He leaves them briefly to go back to a camping area and sees, 500 feet in front of him, “two boys in dark suits” dashing into the bushes on his right. A moment later they reappear, standing on the path in front of him.

They are 5 feet tall, wear green suits, and have green faces with big, almond-shaped eyes and slits for mouths. He can see dark boxes, violet and yellow cables, and tapes and spirals hanging from belts on the entities. He notices a silvery object and receives a telepathic message to “not be afraid.” He walks closer to them and hears another message: “Keep walking. Don’t stop.” The witness has the curious sensation of “passing through the interior of a ball.” He walks past them, looks back, and they have disappeared. On his right, the silvery disc, 6 feet high and 16–20 feet long, is hovering only 3 feet above the ground. Investigators later find seven odd oval marks where the object had been.

August 10 — 3:30 a.m. Russell Matson is driving west on 150th Street in Apple Valley, Minnesota, when just west of Pilot Knob Road he sees a hexagonal object nearly overhead, at perhaps a distance of 500 feet. It has two green, two red, and white lights on its corners. It is 60–90 feet across. The object pivots, making a 90° turn while stationary, then descends and approaches the witness. It makes a soft whooshing sound as it passes, like gas escaping from a propane tank. (“The Investigator’s Dilemma,” IUR 7, no. 1 (January 1982): 13–14)

August 12 — 2:15 a.m. Rupert Pring is several miles outside of Anderson, Indiana, taking time-exposure photographs of the Perseid meteor shower with a camera attached to a tripod. He notices a distant light flashing like a strobe far to the south; it is soon joined by a second strobing light, and both move northeast in a straight line. The lights are as bright as a “halogen automobile headlight at 50 feet.” They stop moving briefly twice near the star Eta Tauri, then make a sharp right turn to the southeast. When Pring first notices the lights, he gets out of his car for a better sight, but freezes abruptly, “like something heavy was pushing down on my head and shoulders.” He experiences nausea for three days afterward and has a temporary, day-long memory loss. Meanwhile, the camera has captured much of the 6-second flight path of the lights in an 8-minute time exposure. Further investigation prompts Pring to reveal that he and his wife had an abduction experience with missing time later that morning. As for the photo, the lights were most likely caused by Pring failing to close the shutter of his camera as he removed it from the tripod and thus picked up two mercury-vapor lights at a farmhouse about a half-mile away.

August 15 — 6:00 p.m. Twenty workers returning from the fields at the Forestry Commission Station of La Rochelle, 5.5 miles northeast of Mutare, Zimbabwe, see a ball of light moving around at a low level. Clifford Muchena is in charge of the group, and he watches the 5-foot fireball maneuver around the grounds then move up to an observation tower, entering through the top window before it bursts into flame. As Muchena is ringing a warning bell, he sees the fireball come back down the tower, go past him, and burst into flame again at an outbuilding.

Muchena goes to douse the fire but stops when he sees three men wearing silver coveralls. The light is too bright to see clearly, and after it goes out the beings are gone. Women in the compound have seen the fireball and the entities and run out into the bush, thinking they are ghosts.

August 16 — A huge object approaches the island of Cyprus. Radar at a Sovereign British Base, either Akrotiri or Dhekelia, track it at 30,000 feet going 900 mph. It comes to a sudden stop and hovers above the base for 45

minutes. Witnesses take many photos of a bright white triangle more than 700 feet long. Allegedly, the Ministry of Defence had sent an encrypted message to the base prior to the sighting, ordering a “complete stand-down of aircraft in the event that any strange ‘aerial phenomena’” are sighted. On August 17, a man and woman arrive at the base, stay for 6 hours, then leave with all the photos and other evidence. Shortly afterward, according to an informant, US and UK Air Force personnel meet at RAF Lakenheath in England to discuss the case.

September 10 — 11:15 p.m. Denise Bishop, 23, is returning to her home in Weston Mill, Plymouth, England, when she sees some lights behind the house. As she goes to the back of the bungalow, she sees an enormous metallic-gray UFO hovering above houses on top of a hill. Six or seven broad shafts of light are shining down on the rooftops beneath it. As she grabs the doorknob to go inside, a lime-green pencil of light comes from the object and hits the back of her hand and she cannot move. The light remains for 30 seconds; when it switches off, she opens the door and goes inside. The UFO then lifts into the sky and moves away. An hour of so later, she notices a burn mark on her hand. The next day she visits Bob Boyd, an investigator with the Plymouth UFO Research Group, who takes photos of her hand, which has a patch of shiny dermis with spots of blood and bruising. On September 12, Boyd visits her with a nurse, who persuades her to see a doctor. Scab tissue forms on September 15, followed by a scar that is still visible in July 1982.

September 18 — 8:45 p.m. Six members of a family in Simi Valley, California, watch a light approach and see a triangular object with five bright white lights on the front and sides. The unlit center portion appears to be like brushed aluminum with a grid pattern. As it passes overhead, they hear a low-pitched hum. A blinking, red-orange light is at the rear. Two or three smaller lights are following in its path. (UFOEv II 229)

September 18 — 9:15 p.m. John Sharwath and Randy Bandurant are driving north on the Moorpark Freeway north of Thousand Oaks, California, when they notice three bright lights like floodlights on the horizon to the north. As they approach the end of the freeway in Moorpark, the light resolves into five separate lights, three in a row above and two below. When they pass nearly under the lights, they notice two triangular bodies that the lights are associated with. At 9:25 p.m., Cherie Thompson and Joyce Bandurant are driving on the Moorpark Freeway some distance behind the other car, and they see two triangular lighted objects. The lowest passes over their car at 50– 100 feet altitude near the Olsen Road interchange. They stop along the freeway to watch, but the objects are disappearing behind the hills.

One thing leads to another, and Mendez finds herself under interrogation by the FBI and AFOSI. This includes polygraph tests, which she fails because she finds them very distressing. This leads to an emotional breakdown, hospitalization, and medication. There are more interrogations over the next few months, and another hospitalization. Eventually, the Air Force clears her of criminal charges, but her security clearance is stripped, and she is transferred to another base.

October 2 — Afternoon. Three days after a nighttime UFO sighting, Grant Breiland goes down to the business district in Victoria, British Columbia, to meet a friend. When the friend does not show, Breiland calls him up from a pay phone. Immediately afterward, he sees two men watching him. Dressed in dark suits, they have suntanned, expressionless faces and unblinking eyes. When they speak, their lips do not move. The first one asks his name, then the second asks for his address and phone number. He does not respond, and after 5 seconds, the men leave through the main door and walk in perfect synchronization to a nearby roadway. Breiland follows them and sees them enter a muddy plowed field some 80–90 feet across. Three-quarters of the way across, the men vanish, leaving no footprints behind. During the entire time the men are visible, no other human beings are in view and no cars pass by. (P. M. H. Edwards, “[M.I.B.

October 15 — 7:30 p.m. Many citizens of Hällefors, Sweden, observe a huge cigar-shaped object “as large as a truck” that appears suddenly in the north gliding along just above the treetops. Four oblong windows are apparent, through which a blue-white light shines, and a red light is in the rear. A clear and piercing engine noise is evident as it slowly moves south for more than an hour. Former Chief Constable Björn Fagrell describes it as like two connected railway cars. The object makes a slow clockwise turn around the village, after which a flame comes out of the rear of the object.

November — Residents of the Hessdalen valley, Norway, begin reporting frequent sightings of unusual lights that hover (sometimes for as long as an hour) and sometimes streak off at speeds that render them all but invisible. On many occasions the lights are below the horizon, either just beneath the tops of nearby mountains or not far from the ground or the rooftops of nearby houses. The lights come in various shapes, but three predominate: a bullet or cigar, a sphere, and an “upside-down Christmas tree.” They are usually yellow or white. Sometimes a small red light appears in front of the others, the various lights maintaining a fixed position, leading observers to suspect

they are all attached to a single, dark object. More often than not, they are seen at night moving from north to south; but daylight sightings also occur, usually during the winter. Anomalous sounds are sometimes reported. Especially frequent activity occurs between December 1981 and mid-1984, when the lights are seen 15–20 times per week, attracting many tourists.

1982 — The Royal Australian Air Force grants permission to UFO researcher [Bill Chalker](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Chalker&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107319089&usg=AOvVaw0TXZQz0-_RjTB9ZB6Dr0Ld) to examine its UFO files.

Chalker visits the archives in Canberra, A.C.T., and reviews more than 1,000 reports in 53 RAAF files through 1984, allowing him to compile a detailed summary covering the years 1950 to 1980. He concludes that the existence of some interesting cases in the files is not suggestive of an RAAF coverup.

January 3 — Two Brazilian Air Force F-5 fighters flying at about 5,000 feet over Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, see a dark metallic-looking object about 66 feet long, 55 feet high, and 3,000 feet away. The control tower cannot see anything in the vicinity. The F-5s get closer, but the object ascends and stays above them. They stay in this position for 30 seconds and then the UFO accelerates and disappears. (Clark III 205; Brazil 552)

January 9 — 8:20 p.m. Carl (Eddie) Cox III steps outside his rural home near Washington, North Carolina, to photograph the rising full moon with a new 35mm camera using high-speed color film. He sees and takes 8 photographs of a strange, tubular object moving from the northeast. The photos show a double tube with varying configurations of white and red-orange lights. The final photo shows the tops of nearby trees and distant condensation trails.

Analysis suggests that the sighting is due to a distant aircraft passing through a condensation trail.

January 15 — 7:05–11:35 p.m. Three sightings occur one after the other in Turkey. An object resembling a tray is seen at 7:05 p.m. over Niğde in central Anatolia. At 9:35 p.m., two UFOs are reported at Havsa, Edirne, accompanied by reported malfunctioning TV sets in the town. Around 11:30 p.m., a reported UFO causes the citizens of İzmir, western Anatolia, to panic. When the UFO hovers above the Buca forest it takes on a flaming appearance, causing

fire brigades to rush to the scene, keeping watch over the object for 45 minutes until it vanishes. (“‘Mysteries of Turkey’: UFO Activity Revealed,” IUR 8, no. 1 (Jan./Feb. 1983): 8–9)

February 2 — 8:00 p.m. Susanne Anderson, 18, is jogging in Skövde, Sweden, when she notices two intense blinking lights that seem to be coming toward her. She hears no sound and gets frightened. After speeding up to a full run, she turns around and sees a metal-blue, saucer-shaped object with a blinking red light on the bottom. Terrified, she hides in a school building.

February 8 — Capt. Gerson Maciel de Britto, piloting a Boeing 727 for VASP Flight 169, notices an intense light source while flying over Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil, on a southern course. It starts accompanying the aircraft in a parallel course, keeping the same distance. But the object soon begins changing its speed, moving ahead of the plane and then allowing it to catch up. As it approaches Belo Horizonte, the object approaches the plane, allowing crew and 150 passengers to view its lenticular form. At this point, the light emanating from the UFO penetrates the interior of the cabin and illuminates it with a bluish tint. The UFO is still in clear view as the aircraft begins landing at Galeão Airport in Rio de Janeiro. Some witnesses on the Rio-Niterói Bridge also see the object.

February 19 — 4:54 p.m. A strange radiance is noticed in the sky above the frozen Lake Onega, from Petrozavodsk in the Republic of Karelia, Russia. The glow is pale blue and is shaped like a cloud, inside of which is an elliptical bright spot. After a few minutes, the bright spot disappears behind the forest, but the luminescent cloud remains in the sky for a time. Around 5:00 p.m., two more spots appear, moving together. One of them resembles the first object but is smaller. The other is a luminous sphere moving in a spiral. As it moves, it leaves a hazy trail that quickly disappears. At 5:15 p.m., a bright arrow-shaped object flies directly above the city a great speed, leaving a trail. None of the objects make any sound.

February 24 — 5:15 a.m. Neillsville, Wisconsin, police officer Chuck Urban is patrolling 12 miles west of town when a bright light approaches him on his left. He stops his squad car, turns off his headlights, grabs a camera, and takes a picture that turns out poorly. He hears no sound from the object. The light follows him as he returns to Neillsville. The light is so bright he can see the road plainly. At one point the light crosses the road ahead of him for a few miles, then recrosses to the other side. He loses sight of it as he enters town.

March 30 — 11:15 p.m. Nanette Morrison is driving home in Charlottesville, Virginia, when she spots a large, brilliant light in the sky hovering several hundred feet in the air and a quarter mile away. It approaches as she makes a turn and flies right over her car, later pacing her as she drives the remaining 15 blocks. She pulls up to the curb, and the UFO stops and hovers above a house across the street less than 400 feet away. The object reverses direction and moves away as she runs up to her house. (J.

April 1 — 7:15 p.m. Three men are repairing a jeep in Petrolia, Pennsylvania, when one of them notices a bright object with a flashing red light just above the trees. A few minutes later they see it has risen much higher. After they turn on the jeep’s headlights, the bright object moves toward them. When they turn the lights off again, the object backs away. The lights go on again, and the UFO passes over their heads at 250 feet. Its bright lights go out, and its triangular shape becomes clear, as well as its gun-metal color and the luminescent mist surrounding it. A red light is on the front, with white and amber lights on the other angles. Two bright lights shoot away from the triangle, one going north and the other south. When a jet approaches from the east, the object stops and becomes bright. Then it rises straight up until it is out of sight. For several days, the witnesses have severe headaches, and one has diarrhea. Other triangular UFOs are seen in the Pittsburgh area from March 22 to May 19.

April 8 — 11:50 p.m. Angie Parrotta and Nancy Hanson, both 18, are driving south on County Road 533 west of Escanaba, Michigan. They notice a bright star to the southwest, which soon becomes two huge yellowish-white “headlights” attached to an object. It descends and moves toward them. They speed up but the object keeps pacing them on their right. They become frightened when they see a blinking red light on the craft. They watch the UFO move swiftly toward Escanaba in the east and quickly lose sight of it. (Kenneth C. Schellhase, “A Unique Triad of CE-I Sightings,” IUR 7, no. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1982): 7–8)

April 22–23 — Night. A group of Polish Air Force pilots during missions over northwest Poland in the area from Elbląg to Ostróda and Olsztyn encounter a weird light at 47,500 feet that does not appear on their radar. It looks like a cloud with the central part a raised-up cupola and is emanating beams of light from the underside. Around it is some kind of vapor. (Poland 66)

June 1 — Two UFOs allegedly hover above the Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, for 14 seconds, one of them directly above launch pad number 1. On June 2, bolts and rivets are found that supposedly have been sucked out of the support towers, and welded sections have come apart. The other UFO hovers above the adjacent housing complex, knocking out thousands of panes of glass or making fine holes in them. The cosmodrome is said to be put out of action for two weeks.

June 10 — Three witnesses in Madbury, New Hampshire, see a wedge-shaped object with bright white lights and smaller blue-green-red body lights hovering about 50 feet above the Bellamy Reservoir, its lights reflecting on the surface of the water. As they try to move to a better viewing location, the object moves away, almost instantly. They see it again hovering above a house with an oscillatory motion. A red light beam shines down on the house and then on the car. After a while the object approaches the car from behind and passes above it by about 30 feet. (UFOEv II 41)

June 12 — Everyone on board a British aircraft sees a large translucent object 500 feet long flying at 41,000 feet altitude over Dinkelsbühl, Bavaria, Germany. It has the form of a “double rectangle surmounted by a globe (egg-shaped) crowned by a silver one.” (Nick Redfern, A Covert Agenda: UFO Secrecy Exposed, Simon & Schuster, 1997, p. 162)

June 18 — 9:10–10:53 p.m. Five Chinese Air Force pilots are flying on patrol over the northern military frontier in Hebei province, China. At 10:06 p.m., a large yellowish-green object appears in the northern sky, whirling fast and creating rings of light. After 10 seconds, the center of the ring explodes “like a hand grenade.” It grows larger than the apparent size of the full moon, and black spots appear near its center. The aircraft lose their communications and navigational systems and are forced to return to their base.

July 6 — 7:30 p.m. A man driving alone near Hampshire, Tasmania, finds that his car is gradually losing power and stops. He turns off the ignition and the lights, then gets out of the vehicle when he notices a stationary, noiseless object that looks like a large army helicopter about the size of a bus. It is blue-black in color and seems to be gradually moving to the west for about 90 seconds. He starts the car’s engine and leaves the area. An inspection of the car finds nothing to account for its behavior. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 19)

Early August — A man is in a meadow near a forest on the shore of the Vistula River a few miles northwest of Warsaw, Poland. Suddenly he hears a sound like an electric motor and sees a rectangular, black, domed object above the treetops that rises and sails slowly beyond the river. Windows in the dome cast a flickering light (Bronislaw Rzepecki, “Encounters in Poland,” IUR 12, no. 3 (May/June 1987): 17)

September — Rosalind Reynolds-Parnham and her boyfriend Philip are driving through the northwestern outskirts of Sudbury, Suffolk, England, when they see an object with an oval mass of orange lights moving through some pylons and causing sparks. They can smell a noxious odor. They drive on, and when they are near Cavendish on the A1092 some lights approach them from behind and the car loses power. When they arrive at their destination, they realize they have lost four hours of time. Rosalind begins to recall an abduction experience, aided by some disturbing dreams and odd scars on her abdomen.

September 9 — A partial meltdown occurs at Chernobyl nuclear power plant Unit One in Pripyat, Ukraine. Officials deny that an accident has taken place, but radioactive contamination reaches the town and spreads as far as 9 miles from the plant. It includes iodine-131, fragments of uranium dioxide fuel, and hot particles containing zinc-65 and zirconium-niobium-95 consistent with partial destruction of the reactor core. Contaminated areas around the plant

are simply sluiced with water and covered with soil and leaves. Lenin Square is discreetly covered with a new layer of asphalt. (Adam Higginbotham, Midnight at Chernobyl, Simon & Schuster, 2019, pp. 69–70)

September 17 — 9:00 p.m. Capt. Stefan Freitag and the crew of the Romanian cargo ship Bosca are steaming 200 miles off the coast of Brazil in the South Atlantic when they see an object like a full moon, accompanied by a smaller, star-light object, which grows brighter and larger in size. Both objects disappear, leaving behind a shiny cloud. Then another moon-like object appears, during which a silent explosion takes place and an orange object is ejected. A fourth moon appears and approaches the ship, causing the crew to panic and the ship’s dog to howl. A fifth object appears briefly, leaving a glow that persists for 30 minutes. A Geiger counter indicates a radiation level of 5–7 rads on the ship. A similar phenomenon is seen by another ship in the general area at 11:03 p.m. and on the following night.

September 30 — 10:15 p.m. Four women, all management personnel of New England Bell Company, are returning to Exeter, New Hampshire, after a trip to a county fair to the north. They are riding in a Mercedes owned by the driver, Mary Ann Poland. She and the passengers (Rose Messina, Mary LaMontagne, and Nicky LeClair) see a low-flying bright light approaching. Poland pulls the car over and they all jump out, as if the object has a compelling influence on them. The object is egg-shaped with swirling red lights around its equator and a white beam of light coming down from the side. After a few minutes it sinks down behind the tree line.

October 14 — 2:00 a.m. Four residents of Alta, Troms og Finnmark, Norway, see three points of light appear above the mountains to the south-southeast. Each point of light is made up of several smaller lights bunched close together. They move in a northerly direction at a great speed, apparently about 43–50 miles in 5 seconds, or about 35,000 mph. Suddenly light rays flash down toward the ground simultaneously from all three objects. The rays are made up cones with an opening angle of about 15°. Their color is a powerful white with a bluish hue, especially at the sides. After 20–25 seconds, the rays begin to widen just as the light begins to diminish in strength. In 2–3 seconds the cones became “an ocean” of light with an opening angle of some 180°. Then they move off one by one with a separation time of one second. At the same moment as the lights go out there appears an ellipsoid object that gives

off a faint light, but nevertheless is distinctly visible. Its color is pink with a deeper color tone that becomes gray just underneath the object. It is motionless, hanging in the sky for 30 minutes, then it suddenly disappears. All of the observers feel a strange, dead silence during the entire observation.

October 18 — 7:50 p.m. A couple is driving along Quinpool Road near Armview Avenue in Halifax, Nova Scotia, when they see an object about 8 times the size of the full moon traveling silently south to north at about 50 mph and 300 feet altitude. It is cigar-shaped with a steady green light in front and a flashing green light in back. They have it in sight for 15 seconds.

October 19 — Night. A US Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft monitoring Soviet military activity is buzzed by a huge object (larger than the RC-135) over the eastern Mediterranean Sea. British personnel at RAF Troödos on Cyprus listen to the radio calls of the American crew for 90 minutes as the encounter unfolds at 35,000 feet. The UFO, described as a multitude of lights flashing 20 at a time, is picked up on the aircraft’s radar as it approaches from the south about 2 miles away. It circles around the plane and closes in. Two US Navy F-14 fighters are scrambled from an aircraft carrier, and an RAF Phantom is diverted from a night flying exercise to intercept the object south of Cyprus. As the three interceptors approach, the RC-135 crew sees the object depart to the south. The fighter pilots can see nothing. Following the incident, British authorities launch a secret investigation, the results of which (including a transcript of the RC-135 crew’s conversation with ground controllers) are sent to the US Department of Defense in November. One senior RAF official strongly suspects that the object is a mirage effect from lights on the coast of Israel or Lebanon. (David Clarke, “A Cold War Close Encounter,” Fortean Times 357 (September 2017): 17)

October 21 — 12:35 p.m. An oval object about 3 feet in diameter descends into a garden in Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France, and hovers about 3 feet off the ground. After 20 minutes the object takes off silently. The witness, a cellular biologist, reports that when the UFO rises up, the grass under it stands up straight. In the afternoon, the witness notes that two amaranth plants located near the UFO have desiccated, withered leaves. The witness calls the Gendarmerie, who inspect the garden and take some samples of the amaranth plants. The analysis of the samples made by GEPAN finds that the plants are dehydrated, but there is no evidence of radiation.

October 24 — 9:20 a.m. Pilot Michael Davis and his father (a student pilot) are flying a 1968 Piper PA-28 Cherokee 140 about 10 miles southeast of Lowell, Indiana. Just after reaching their cruising altitude of 2,300 feet, they encounter an object they at first think is a malfunctioning parachute. At one point, the UFO flicks across their nose, veering to its left and missing the aircraft’s right wingtip by no more than 10 feet. It has no exhaust trail. At the instant that it passes, the vortex hits them so hard that the plane’s airframe groans in protest, and the altimeter goes “wacky.” It continues to curve to the left, still accelerating and eventually beginning to climb until it finally disappears into the distant haze.

October 27 — Early evening. Bonnie McCrory and her father, Maurice Smith, are driving south on the Richardson Highway near Summit Lake, Alaska, when their pickup stops with a frozen gas line. After about 20 minutes, they notice a huge ball on the ridge to the east. It is silver-colored and looks like a geodesic dome. Within the next hour it changes color from silver to yellow to orange to fiery red-orange. It slowly moves up the ridge until it moves out of sight. Possibly the full moon.

November — After 12:00 midnight. A man and his wife are camping in Davies Valley, Imperial County, California, when they are awakened by a surge of static electricity. A huge object shaped like a manta ray 200 feet across is hovering above them. It makes a humming sound as it slowly passes over them, heading east.

Early November — 6:15 p.m. Rachel Morton is waiting for a bus in Whitby, North Yorkshire, England, when a triangular-shaped object with a domed covering passes noiselessly overhead. Two small white lights are at the front and three lights at the top. (Whitby (UK) Gazette, November 12, 1982; Marler 114)

November 2 — 10:50 a.m. Capt. Júlio Miguel Guerra is flying a DHC-1 Chipmunk in the region of Serrea de Montejunto and Torres Vedras, Portugal, near Ota Air Base \[now Military and Technical Training Center of the Air Force\] in Ota, Alenquer, Portugal. He encounters a metallic disc at 4,900 feet that engages in evasive maneuvers and circles his plane. The object is 7 feet in diameter and its lower hemisphere is reddish. A circular dark area is visible on the bottom and something looking like a grid encircles its middle. The pilot of another Chipmunk trainer sees the same object at 11:05 a.m. The object continues circling between the two aircraft for 10 minutes, when it makes a pass at the second plane and speeds off to the southwest.

Late November — Senior Coastguard Bernard O’Reilly watches a lighted triangular object hovering silently for several minutes over Skegness, Lincolnshire, England. It moves away to the southeast. (Lincolnshire (UK) Daily Echo, December 1, 1982; Marler 114)

November 25 — Day. US Army Military Policeman Christopher Grooms is on guard duty in Tower 5 at the Army Special Weapons Depot at Kriegsfeld, a nuclear weapons storage and maintenance site in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. He watches for over 10 minutes a dark triangular-shaped craft fly slowly in a straight line from the southwest, over the valley, over the town of Gerbach, and directly over his watchtower, flying toward the northeast. After approaching for about 7 minutes, it flies directly overhead and Grooms steps out onto the tower landing with M- 16 in hand and looks straight up at the object. It is completely silent and has no markings. As it passes over, the object rotates 360° nose down, pointing directly at him, then rotates back into its original position. Grooms has “the overwhelming feeling that it was acknowledging my presence with this maneuver or was ‘checking me out’ as it did it.” (Robert L.

November 27 — 5:00 a.m. A luminous object with brilliant lights brightly illuminates a police patrol car driven by Cmdr. Michael McDonald near the intersection of West Northwest Highway and Smith Street in Palatine, Illinois. Two other officers (Ron Roszak and Dennis Somsel) in two other patrol cars on Lincoln Avenue see a domed, disc- shaped object 30 feet in diameter, which emits a light beam toward the ground, then changes direction when pursued. The white disc is later seen to the east, with a light beam extended toward the ground, as it descends behind the tree line, seemingly landing in Busse Woods (Ned Brown Forest Preserve). The entire episode lasts about 12 minutes. (Mark Rodeghier, “A Police Puzzler from Palatine,” IUR 8, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1983): 10– 14)

December — During naval exercises in the Black Sea near the port of Sevastopol in the Crimea, Russia, an unidentified target is detected over the Balaklava District at a low altutude. It has a sharp nose and sparks coming from its tail section. The object does not respond to attempts at communication, so jet interceptors are scrambled. The object descends into the water when they approach. Soviet naval ships cannot detect it underwater. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, pp. 133–134)

December 8–12 — The Third International Congress of Extraterrestrial Science is held in Rosario, Argentina, with representatives from Spain, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and the US, as well as Argentina.

December 10 — 7:55 a.m. Stephen Eric Alexander is waiting for a school bus with his daughter in Rosedale, Queens, New York City, when he sees an object among a flock of birds. The birds disperse and leave the object alone, drifting silently at 25 mph. After 15 seconds, it tilts and veers to the southwest and disappears. He estimates the object is 11 feet wide and 5 feet tall, 150 feet away from him, and 210 feet above the ground. Its ends pointed slightly downward.

December 31 — Around 11:50 p.m. An off-duty police officer and his family see a boomerang-shaped object drift slowly over their home near Kent Cliffs, New York. They can see a solid structure with roughly 15 red, green, and white lights anchored to its underside. It maintains a constant altitude of about 490 feet, moves at a gentle walking pace, and makes only a faint hum. As it passes over, he feels a deep vibration in his chest. At one point, the lights go out and three blinding white lights in the shape of a triangle appear in their place. About 5 seconds later, the colored ones return, and the object drifts out of sight. Warehouse foreman Edwin Hansen, 55, sees what appears to be the same object as he is driving down Interstate 84, just moments later. Hansen, among others, stops on the

side of the road after spotting a boomerang-shaped formation of lights that project a bright beam of light to the ground. It is so large that it fills the sky in front of him, and it makes slow, tight circles in the air. Just as he thinks he’d like to get a closer look, the object moves in his direction. He panics as it approaches, but then hears a voice in his head that tells him not to be afraid. At the same time, the object turns away and the beam goes out. Hansen says that he “felt thoughts that weren’t \[his\] own,” and believes that he has received a telepathic communication from the UFO. (NightSiege 5–9)

1983 — Since 1966, some 6,700 Ummo communications have been received. The early ones are written in Spanish, but over time they are composed in French, though certain grammar and punctuation oddities indicate that Spanish, not French, is the writers’ first language.

At the second meeting with Gersten alone, he speaks openly about the 1977 Ellsworth AFB “incident” that he claims AFOSI and the FBI are investigating. He tells Gersten that the US government knows why UFOs appear in certain places and that “beyond a doubt they’re extraterrestrial” and come from 50 light years away. He mentions Project Aquarius, which he says is the government’s top-secret involvement in communications with aliens. He speaks of documents that tell of agreements between the US government and extraterrestrials under which the aliens are free to conduct animal mutilations and land at a certain base, in exchange for information about advanced UFO technology.

Soon the object is joined by two US Air Force jets from Incirlik Air Base. One of the jets flies in tight circles around the UFO, which dwarfs it in size and is described as a disc with a dome on the underside. The object accelerates and disappears over the Mediterranean Sea with the jets in pursuit.

January 19 — 6:00 p.m.–7:00 p.m. South Wales police begin to receive reports of UFOs. Two detectives in Swansea observe a silent, triangular object with three pulsating lights at 1,000 feet altitude. Carole Griffiths and her husband are driving home in Cardiff when they see a large triangular object in the sky and pull over to watch. It has 11 lights around it. Similar objects are seen in Porthcawl and other Welsh localities. (Marler 114–117)

January 27 — 7:00 p.m. Peggy Iery sees a large central white light with two flanking lights over some power lines as she is returning home 2 miles north of Marquette, Michigan. Suddenly it appears over her car and seems so huge that it blocks out the sky. Its shape is a perfect pentagon with a small white light at each of the corners; the bottom is

silvery and flat. She drives home quickly, and she and her husband see four lights nearby, which gradually recede beyond the trees. (Kenneth C. Schellhase, “The Marquette Pentagon,” IUR 8, no. 3 (May/June 1983): 11–13)

It has many lights, which seem to respond to their thoughts. It has a crisscross lattice structure and tubes on its underside. Their CB radio just has static. Another independent witness, Rita Rivera, probably sees the same object, a V-shaped array of 50 lights with amber, red, and blue colors. (NightSiege 8–14; Philip Imbrogno, George Lesnick, and Chris Clark, “Boomerang Update,” IUR 8, no. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1983): 8–9)

Spring — 10:00 p.m. A woman hospital employee is driving to work near New London, Connecticut, when she sees a light flick by quickly in the sky ahead. It stops above the treetops and shines a searchlight-like beam down on the woods. She pulls over to watch. Abruptly the object moves directly in front of her. There is no other traffic, although the road is usually busy. The object is round and has blue, yellow, red, and white lights flickering in a circle. She blacks out for a short time and finds that the engine, lights, and radio have been shut off. The window has been rolled down. The car stalls when she tries to start it, but the engine finally catches and she drives to work, where she arrives uncharacteristically late at 11:05. (Michael D.

SDI is derisively nicknamed by Senator [Ted Kennedy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107382845&usg=AOvVaw00LWWkw-N0WKYP4NEp5x2I) (D-Mass.) as “Star Wars,” after the 1977 film by [George Lucas](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107383268&usg=AOvVaw1FP63p4Os-_rXgpglinkgU).

March 23 — Night. Russian Major V. Gorsky is stationed in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia when he sees, along with two of his commanding officers, a silvery disc at an altitude of 1,300 feet and 1–2 miles away. Its colors seem to be changing constantly, and it is surrounded by a blue halo. A narrow beam of light descends from it, illuminating the area. More than 30 other soldiers witness the display. It studies the area another 4 minutes, then the beam disappears, the halo vanishes, and the object is gone instantly. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, pp. 127–128)

March 24 — 7:30 p.m. A corporate executive in Bedford, New York, sees a half-circle of lights hovering behind some trees near a commuter-bus station. There is no sound. After watching for 5 minutes, he goes inside his house to alert his family, but when they come outside, the lights are gone. (Clark III 1277)

March 24 — 8:00 p.m. Four persons in Carmel, New York, see a half-circle of red and white lights and the vague outline of a larger object to which they are attached. The lights are hovering above trees several hundred yards away.

They drift to the east and are lost to view, but almost immediately a family living a quarter mile away sees them drift into view. Through binoculars they can see a “huge object” with a dull-green metallic color connecting the lights. When the UFO turns slightly, they see it has a V shape. At that moment a brilliant beam of white light shoots down from the center of the object, and in it a small reddish object descends then shoots off “very, very fast toward the north.” The beam is shut off and the object turns and heads slowly east. (Clark III 1277)

March 24 — 8:30 p.m. Police officers in Yorktown, New York, say that their switchboard is flooded with calls reporting a large, boomerang-shaped UFO with red, blue, and green lights. Police in the nearby villages of Millwood and New Castle receive a flood of calls as well, describing an object as large as a football field. William Hele, a meteorologist for the National Weather Corporation, sees an asymmetrical V-shaped object about 1,300 feet long, with 6–7 lights as he is driving south on the Taconic Highway. The object descends from about 2,000 to 980 feet altitude and slows as it approaches. Hele realizes that the lights are all changing colors at different times, as if lit by a rotating prism within the structure. Suddenly, all the lights go out, leaving nothing in their place, as if whatever object was supporting them has simply disappeared. The lights reappear 30–40 seconds later, and a few seconds after that, the object turns to the north and flies away, as the lights change to a slime green. At the same time, people 15 miles north in Putnam County see a smaller object exhibiting similar behavior. Ruth Holtsman describes a silent object that hangs motionless in the sky. While it is in view, a driver pulls up and stops almost directly underneath it. The lights start to flash in a wild sequence up and down its “wings.” The driver jumps into his car and speeds away. Then the UFO approaches Holtsman’s car, which is bathed in a blinding white light as it speeds under the boomerang. John Miller sees the object hovering above a pond near his home in Brewster, New York. It is aiming two very bright searchlight beams over the surface of the water. He hears a faint whooshing sound.

March 24 — 8:45 p.m. Several dozen diners at a ski-resort restaurant near Stormville, New York, see white lights in a boomerang shape hovering over a utility pole 600 feet away. Three other people driving near the pole stop by it. The driver, a corrections officer, gets out and studies the object about 200 feet above him. It is silent, and the structure that holds the lights is dark and nonreflective. After watching it for 20 minutes, he heads back to his jeep, at which time the UFO moves down the road. He follows it to Interstate 84 and all the lights go out, allowing him to see the boomerang shape. The lights come back on and he follows the object for more than an hour, clocking it speed at 20 mph. (Chris Clark, “Boomerang!” IUR 9, no. 3 (May/June 1984): 10; Clark III 1278)

March 24 — 10:00 p.m. The last sighting of many this night is by an IBM executive who sees a lighted object “larger than a 747” hovering over pine trees near his home in Danbury, Connecticut. (Clark III 1278)

March 28 — Radar at the airport at Gorky \[now Nizhny Novgorod\], Russia, tracks an unidentified target flying at 110– 125 mph at an altitude of 1,310–1,970 feet. Flight Controller A. Shushkin sees the cigar-shaped object, which is similar to an aircraft in size but has no wings and is metallic. It is in view for only 10 seconds.

Miller drives her to his home and calls Doty, who arrives promptly. Doty’s attitude is defiant and nervous, but Howe asks him about the alleged 1971 Holloman AFB landing. Doty says [Robert Emenegger](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://prabook.com/web/robert_e.emenegger/381357&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107388453&usg=AOvVaw12kQWiB6zl3iCeyo4wp0Kl) got the date wrong and that it was actually April 25, 1964, shortly after the Socorro landing. Transferring to his office at Kirtland, Doty is reluctant to talk about the 1977 Ellsworth landing. He shows her a bogus, undated document, A Briefing Paper for

the President of the United States on the Subject of Unidentified Flying Vehicles. The document lists UFO crash/retrievals and states that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrials from a nearby solar system and have been on earth for many thousands of years. Through genetic manipulation, they have influenced the course of human evolution and helped shape our religious beliefs. Roswell and the 1949 living alien are mentioned, as well as Projects Snowbird (retroengineering a crashed UFO), Aquarius (umbrella project involving all ET contacts), Sigma (an ongoing electronic communications effort with aliens), and the defunct Garnet (investigation of ETs on human evolution). Doty promises Howe thousands of feet of film of crashed discs, bodies, EBE-1, and the Holloman landing for her documentary. He says that a similar release of data through Emenegger and [Allan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761954/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107389028&usg=AOvVaw2YNnnWKNroePcFss2ESBBs) [Sandler](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761954/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107389290&usg=AOvVaw3znTNLd2dQGbzWesUcFDS8) was halted because “political conditions were not right.” When she tells her HBO contacts about this, they ask her to secure a letter of intent from the US government with a legally binding commitment to secure the promised film footage. HBO wants the film, but Doty now stalls. In June, Doty tells her he is officially off the project. Further contacts up to March 1984 are fewer. In 2008, Doty claims that the intelligence community targeted Howe to find out who her inside sources were.

April 10 — 8:30 p.m. Two drivers near Ross, Ohio, see a large, bright, oval object that seems to land. The property owner at the location also sees a white light on a hillside behind his home and watches the object ascend slowly before moving away at speed. The drivers’ car lights flicker, and the engines nearly stall. The landowner reports flickering houselights and TV problems. Investigation of the landing site indicates that a heavy circular object about 50 feet in diameter has landed, producing a 3-foot burn mark in the center.

April 26–27 — Day. For two days, a UFO is seen above Nuremberg, Germany. Amateur astronomer Walter Schwarz takes a photo that apparently shows a balloon. A local radio station hires a Lear jet to approach it, reaching 12,300 feet, but it is still too far away to identify it. Eckard Pohl, the astronomer at the Nuremberg Observatory, tracks it and says that it looks like a deformed pyramid with a pointed top and estimates it is flying at an altitude of 14.3 miles.

At 4:55 p.m., the Oslo has a first sonar contact south of Leirvik on Stord island. At 5:21 p.m., it fires a Terne rocket as a warning. On April 29, a possible sonar contact is recorded in Selbjørnfjord. On the afternoon of April 30, the Oslo, after another sonar contact, fires a Terne rocket and drops a mine. Five minutes later it launches four more rockets, but then the sonar contact is lost. Around 4:00 p.m., five Terne rockets are fired at nearby Halsenøy. Near midnight, a sonar contact south of Leirvik results in another rocket firing. On May 1, at 4:20 p.m., another sonar contact takes place and six Terne rockets are fired. They hit the water and plunge deep before detonating. Immediately afterward, an Orion aircraft drops a mine at the same spot in Skåneviksfjorden. At 5:20 p.m., the Oslo again attacks with six rockets. Five minutes later it launches four more rockets, and the sonar contact is lost. At 8:30 p.m., an Orion aircraft has the last sonar contact. The aircraft drops mines at the entrance to the Høylandssundet. On May 2, mines are dropped in the Selbjørnfjord.

May 20 — Sam Meadows and another ranch hand discover a perfect circle of disturbed grass in a pasture on the Teas Ranch in Hemphill County near Canadian, Texas. The circle is 29 feet in diameter, with an outer circle of much

shorter and greener buffalo grass that is 4 inches wide. This is a characteristic of new grass that comes up after a fire has burned the old grass. A prickly pear cactus pad is found at the edge of the ring; the side closest to the ring is devoid of spines, while all the spines facing away from the ring are undamaged. No UFO is seen. (W.

May 23 — 7:30 p.m. A high school art teacher and his daughter watch a disc-shaped object with a black top, blue sides, square windows, and a reddish golden metallic bottom maneuvering over trees in McHenry, Illinois. It then rocks violently, levels out, and flies off following the contour of the land.

May 23 — Night. Farmer Alcineu Sousa is aboard his twin-engine airplane returning from a visit to a farm near Corumbiara, Rondônia, Brazil. As he is about to land on his farm near Porto Velho, Rondônia, he sees an opaque light about 30 feet in diameter on his left that begins to approach and shine more brightly. His airplane instruments start to go haywire. He pulls the plane sharply to the right, but the UFO does the same but more moderately. A few seconds later, the light disappears over the horizon.

May 24 — 6:00 p.m. A schoolboy is in his parents’ backyard in Jüchen, Germany, when he sees a red ball shoot down and hover above a nearby electric power line. It ejects a pyramid-shaped array of colored lights toward the ground. A few minutes later, the array disappears from the object downward to the ground. The object then speeds away into the sky toward its point of origin.

June 5 — 5:00 a.m. Retired restaurant manager Mario Claretto wakes up because his dogs are barking outside his home at Varzi, Pavia, Italy. He sees a shining object with an orange headlight on a hill across the road from his house. It is hovering low above an alfalfa field. Its upper portion is slowly rotating, showing a silver section, a dark section, then the orange light. After finishing some work in the kitchen, Claretto goes outside for a closer look. He sees another person walking toward the object; after approaching very near, the person runs away, escaping down the road. Claretto points the object out to a neighbor, Bruno Stafforini, who has also woken up because of the dogs.

The UFO rises after skimming the grass for a few feet, its dome recedes, and it emits a vapor. It seems to change its form to cigar-shaped. Suddenly it speeds off to the south-southwest.

July 7 — An unauthorized target appears on the radar screens at Darłowo Airport, Poland, corresponding to a rotating, oblong object with a steel-colored covering flying at 11,0000 feet. Polish Air Force Captain Praszczałek and another pilot go up to intercept it and get within 660 feet. He sees a solid hull, 50 feet long and 6 feet across. Just after they are ordered to shoot it down, the object shoots up to 30,000 feet, too high to pursue. (Poland 64–65)

July 12 — 9:30 p.m. A police officer answers a call at a location southeast of Danbury, Connecticut, where several people are standing outside looking at a circular pattern of lights that are flashing red, blue, and green. The lights appear to be attached to a silent object 300 feet in diameter and less than 500 feet in altitude. The officer shines a spotlight on it, and the object projects a brilliant flash of white light downward. It then moves quickly to the north and is lost behind trees. At 10:55 p.m., Danbury Police Chief Nelson Macedo, his brother-in-law Charles Yacuzzi, his son Michael, and retired policeman Jim Lucksky are boating on Candlewood Lake north of Danbury. They notice a circular gray object silently hovering high in the sky. 20–30 bright blue, red, orange, and green lights moving in a circular pattern are visible on the object. The men turn off the boat lights and the object shuts off its own lights. After several minutes, Yacuzzi turns the lights on again, and the UFO switches on bright lights and moves off behind the mountains.

July 22 — 12:40 a.m. Police constables Raymond Ellens and Peter Ferguson are on car patrol east of Melton, Melbourne, Victoria, when they see a bright, stationary light over the center of the town. As they approach, they discern that it is composed of two lights. The object turns west and hovers about 200 feet above the Melton Regional Shopping Centre. Soon the object flies off to the southeast, making a high-pitched humming sound. After rising to about 500 feet, the UFO moves off to the north and is lost to sight. The UFO is picked up on radar at Tullamarine Air Traffic Control in Melbourne. The constables see it again at 2:40 a.m. when it appears to be on the ground at the rear of the Toolern Vale stables (they inspect the paddock but find no traces), then it is lost to view until 4:30 a.m. when they are again at the shopping mall. At some point police Sgt. Barry Harman and Chief Inspector Hickman also see the UFO above the shopping center. The constables follow the object, this time with more lights visible. Between their position and the object is the Australian Army Rockbank Receiving Station, and it seems to be headed directly toward the antenna array. Before reaching it, the object turns and arcs again to the north. Ellens and Ferguson lose sight of it at about 6:00 a.m. Their written report states that over time the UFO flew in a triangular pattern bounded by Melton, Rockbank, Sydenham, and Diggers Rest in a counterclockwise path between 200 and 1,600 feet in altitude. The Australian Signal Intelligence facility at Rockbank is alerted that its security has been breached.

July 25 — 5:15 a.m. Tom Jackson is getting ready for work in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, when he sees a bright light outside his bathroom window. He opens it and sees a huge object hovering above pine trees about 750 feet away. It is metallic gray, possibly 300 feet long, and elongated but with the front and back ends dropping down. It has two rows of evenly spaced windows. After 5 minutes it moves toward the town’s sewage plant. Other residents report a brilliant orange light over the sewage plant. Still others hear a loud, high-pitched sound so intense that it causes headaches and disturbs neighborhood dogs. (MUFON UFO Journal, October 1983)

August 1 — 12:15 a.m. Terry Conner is at the intersection of West County Line Road and South Ashland Avenue about

1.5 miles southwest of Beecher, Illinois, when he sees a cluster of red flashing lights. They are coming from an object in a farmer’s field about 450–600 feet away. It appears to be 30 feet tall with 40–50 continuously flashing red lights in the shape of a vertical U. After 2 minutes, two large steady red lights appear to rise until they are even with the top of the U. After 10 seconds, all the lights go out at once.

August 12 — Around 1:00 a.m. Alfred Burtoo is fishing along the Basingstoke Canal in Aldershot, Hampshire, England, when a disc-shaped UFO lands nearby. Two humanoid beings approach him. They are 4 feet 6 inches tall, dressed in green overalls, and wear helmets with visors. They gesture at Bertoo to follow them, and he goes up a stairway

into the craft. He is made to stand under an amber light. The beings speak to him in broken English, telling him that he is too old and infirm for their purposes. They then let him go.

August 12 — 11:10 p.m. In the Maraponga neighborhood of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, João de Lira Pessoa Neto is riding his motorcycle with his friend Plínio Couto de Alencar Júnior to a party. The cycle breaks down, so they push it home and head back on foot to the party. They pass the train tracks and the Cavan poles factory, where they notice that a transformer that always buzzes is silent. Stray dogs do not bark, and the lights on the poles are blinking intermittently. A strong light blinks near them and they see a disc-shaped object about 325 feet above the Lagoa da Maraponga, its shape reflected in the dark water. The object moves, and the two witnesses run off. Party hosts Roberto de Lira Pessoa Neto and his wife Rejane, Rejane’s sister, and a sailor named Cal are intrigued and decide to return to the site together. They look around and see the UFO landing on the lake shore. The disc has large round windows and a brightly lit interior. Inside they see human-looking beings moving about and looking out the windows. Roberto sees three humanoid figures beside the UFO. They seem to be covered in a plastic cloak and have a wobbling gait. Plínio thinks the object disappears and reappears like a mirage. The witnesses begin running away when another similar UFO appears above them and causes a gale. It disappears, and everything returns to normal, with dogs barking and the transformer buzzing. Later at home, João has a strong urge to return to the scene. The object is still there, and he has a compulsion to meet the occupants. He suddenly gets dizzy and nauseous and falls to the ground unconscious. He revives 2 hours later and finds himself in a soccer field and cannot remember how he got there. He goes home, but his behavior changes, becoming ruder. On May 21, 1989, João drowns under mysterious circumstances in a lagoon in Uruoca, Ceará, Brazil.

August 26 — 4:00 a.m. A Mrs. Zurwaski is awakened by brilliant white flashes of light reflecting off the trees to the east of her house in Cedar Lake, Indiana. She gets up, thinking a thunderstorm is approaching, and she sees the screen on the front door flooded with intense light. Her husband is also awake by now, and he describes the light as yellowish. Through a picture window, Mr. Zurwaski sees an object hovering 4–5 feet off the ground in their yard. Mrs. Zurawski hears a swoosh and a crackle and notices a ribbon of light moving southeast.

Machowski grabs a camera and takes three photos that shows the large object looking like a hat standing on its brim, and the object disappears shortly afterward. (Poland 57–58)

September 26 — Midnight. The Soviet orbital missile early warning system (SPRN), code-named Oko, reports a single intercontinental ballistic missile launch from the US. Lt. Col. [Stanislav Petrov](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107412119&usg=AOvVaw3MZUGespfQGWXZjS-Jn3H2)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107412350&usg=AOvVaw1Ne_kPil9P4j6qQHydKBgF) who is on duty during the incident, correctly dismisses the warning as a computer error when ground early warning radars do not detect any launches. Part of his reasoning is that the system is new and known to have malfunctioned previously; also, a full-scale nuclear attack from the US would involve thousands of simultaneous launches, not a single missile. Later, the system reports four more ICBM launches headed to the Soviet Union, but Petrov again dismisses the reports as false. The investigation that follows reveals that the system indeed has malfunctioned, and false alarms are caused by a rare alignment of sunlight on high-altitude clouds underneath the satellites’ orbits.

October 13 — 8:30 p.m. Catherine Burk is driving to her home in Altoona, Pennsylvania, when she sees a large, silvery disc pass about 30 feet above her car. The force of the UFO lifts the right side of her car briefly off the road, causing her lights to blink out and the engine to stall. She suffers hearing loss in her right ear, has severe headaches, and develops problems with her shoulder, chest, and spine. Local police investigate and find her “visibly shaking.” (UFOEv II 232; MUFON UFO Journal, November 1983)

October 26 — 9:00 p.m. David Keener is driving on US Highway 321 northeast of Hickory, North Carolina, when a diamond-shaped object, red in front, bright green in the rear, hovers low over his car and then rises up again. The observation lasts about 5 minutes and the object is silent throughout. He reports the incident to the sheriff’s department. (MUFON UFO Journal, April 1984)

October 28 — 2:15 a.m. Biomedical engineer Jim Cooke is driving by the Croton Falls Reservoir on his way back to Mahopac, New York, when he sees “aircraft lights” approaching and dropping very fast. Oddly, they seem to hover for a while, then blink out. Cooke gets out of his car, walks toward the shoreline, and spots a triangular object hovering less than 15 feet above the water and 200 feet away. After a few minutes, 9 red lights come on from its sides and a red beam of light from the underside probes the water. The UFO moves to four locations above the reservoir, each time shining the red light on the water and remaining at a steady altitude. Each time a car drives by, its lights go out. Cooke estimates the object is 100 feet long at the base and 30 feet at the apex. After 10–15 minutes, it lifts upward at a 30° angle and disappears. (NightSiege 2–4)

October 28 — 10:00 p.m. Two men are driving in the countryside near Ithaca, New York, looking for signs of deer in order to plan their hunting activities. They see a lighted area low in the sky ahead of them. Through binoculars, they see that the light is cast by a round object with three rows of lighted window panels and an illuminated rotating dome that is bright enough to reflect off the low clouds. They estimate it is 15–25 feet in diameter, It stays visible for about 5 minutes as it moves slowly and noiselessly over the ridge of a hill. (CUFOS case file)

November 7–11 — NATO carries out a command post exercise code-named Able Archer 83. Its purpose is to simulate a period of conflict escalation, culminating in the US military attaining a simulated DEFCON 1 coordinated nuclear attack. Coordinated from the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) headquarters in Casteau, Belgium, it involves NATO forces throughout Western Europe. The Soviet leadership is concerned that this could be a ruse for an actual US nuclear strike and moves to a high alert.

January 3 — 4:14 a.m. A woman wakes up in her home near Port Washington, Wisconsin, when a bright light shines through the bedroom window. She sees a strange object with three circular lights in a fixed position about 50 feet from the shore of Lake Michigan. The center light, as bright as a searchlight, rotates north, casting an illumination on the water, which is seen to be turbulent. All three lights are rotating clockwise around a 30-foot body. She

wakes up her husband, who suggests that it is a Coast Guard helicopter. But the object is completely silent. After a short time, a smaller object also with three lights appears over the first one, hovers a few minutes, then disappears. The searchlight periodically shines directly in the window. The object moves about 20–30 feet then hovers there another 10–15 minutes. At 5:15 a.m., it moves away and disappears to the southeast. The woman goes back to bed, but soon feels a powerful electric shock penetrate her body with a buzzing sound. (Donald R. Schmitt and Richard W.

January 8 — 3:15 a.m. Three people are traveling southeast in a van at mile marker 236 on I-80 southeast of Cozad, Nebraska, when the highway lights up and they see a huge disc as big as a baseball diamond 75–100 feet above and slightly to the right of the road. Bright lights are evenly spaced around the rim, most of them white, but others pink or blue. As the car passes it at a slow speed, they can detect no motion and can hear no sound. They attempt to communicate by Citizens Band radio, but the radio picks up strange interference like an “intermittent bleeping.” (J. Allen Hynek, “Nebraska Close Encounter,” IUR 9, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1984): 10–12; “Addendum to Nebraska Encounter,” IUR 9, no. 3 (May/June 1984): 3)

January 9 — 10:30 p.m. Two witnesses driving on State Highway 208 near Hawthorne, New Jersey, see an object with lights descend then move away from their car. After driving another 300 feet they spot another object over the road. They drive directly under the object, which is moving slowly at an altitude of 200 feet. The driver pulls over, and the object moves toward the first UFO.

January 21–February 26 — Project Hessdalen sets up three fieldwork stations, the primary one on Aspaskjolen mountain, and two smaller ones at Hersjøen and Litlefjellet, Norway. This group secures technical assistance from the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, the University of Oslo, and the University of Bergen. Over the course of one month, investigators see numerous lights, take photos of many of them, and track them instrumentally. On three occasions, lights are seen visually and tracked on radar simultaneously, casting a reflection on the radar screen so strong that a Norwegian defense expert later says that if that is not a solid object, then it must be a “strongly ionized gas.” One of the lights is tracked moving at 19,000 mph. On another occasion, a light under constant visual observation shows up on radar only on every second sweep. In most instances (33 in all), when radar shows something, the eye or a camera sees nothing. On two occasions the researchers direct a laser beam on passing lights. Out of a total of nine times, the lights respond all but once in a curious way, changing from a regular flashing light to a double-flashing light. The total number of sightings in this period is 188, although some may be attributable to passing aircraft. Only four of the photos taken through the special lens grating come out well enough to show light spectra, and only two of these are useful for analysis. Changes in the magnetic field are recorded in 40% of the sightings, but the Geiger counter and infrared viewer prove unhelpful. Researchers categorize the phenomenon into three different types: a white or blue-white flashing light, high in the air; a yellow light with a red light on the top, sometimes flashing; and a slow-moving, yellow or white light that maneuvers, stops for an hour or more, and continues maneuvering.

February — Night. The commander of a group of soldiers in the 103rd Regiment guarding warehouses at Przasnysz Airfield, Poland, sees a light silently coming in his direction. It is attached to a huge oval object 70–100 feet across that is moving soundlessly 150 feet above the ground. He and his assistant feel unexplained terror and paralysis, remaining rooted to the spot. Noticing a light at its rear end, he considers taking an AK-47 and shooting it out, but receives a mental command not to do so or he would be paralyzed. (Poland 67)

February 7 — 4:00 a.m. A witness in Atco, New Jersey, awakes to a loud humming sound and finds his room illuminated by a bright light. He goes to the window and sees a bright circular object with a hump on top in a stationary position about four feet above his neighbor’s yard and 200 feet away. It is about the size of a small car. A human- like “image” is standing next to it, but that vanishes and the object ascends in a zigzag pattern, then moves away at a high rate of speed.

Spring — A Soviet pilot in a MiG-23 is scrambled to intercept an object flying at supersonic speed from north to south over the Mikha Tskhakaya Airfield south of Senaki, Georgia. The MiG-23, flying at 16,400 feet in full afterburner at Mach 1.2, is unable to close in on the object. By the time the interceptor is approaching the coastline of the Black Sea, it is flying at Mach 1.6. The pilot activates his infrared search and track system when he is 7.5 miles away from the target and sees the largest “bloom” he has ever encountered. By the time he reaches Mach 2, he has to break off due to lack of fuel, never having acquired a visual target.

April 12 — 2:10 a.m. Air traffic control radar at Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados tracks a large group of unknown targets moving at about 100 mph in “loose but distinct formation” 30 miles southeast of the island.

Authorities notify Prime Minister [Tom Adams](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Adams_(politician)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107446025&usg=AOvVaw0EB2SQTPFEirO2u9r6J19d), the Barbados Defense Force, and the police commissioner.

April 13 — 10:00 p.m. While boating on a lake near Gainesville, Florida, two witnesses see a stationary oval-shaped object at an altitude of 100 feet about 300 feet from their boat. The object shines a cone of bright white light onto the surface of the water. After about 3 minutes, it hovers out of sight behind some trees. (Bob Gribble, “UFO Hotline Reports,” IUR 9, no. 3 (May/June 1984): 16)

April 15 — 12:00 midnight. Some 20 witnesses (farm workers, a police officer, venture scouts) at Llangernyw, North Wales, see a pink-orange ball that drifts to the ground and explodes in a shower of purple sparks. Out of the shower emerges a white disc that appears to land out of sight behind a ridge. A large army helicopter and two military trucks apparently perform a search of the area beginning at daylight. (Jenny Randles, “Anatomy of a UFO Wave,” IUR 11, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1986): 4–5)

April 18 — 9:30 p.m. A married couple is driving on a road near RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, England, when they come upon a huge rectangular object straddling the road ahead. It has at least 60 lights arrayed in rows on its frame. Red and green lights are at its edges, but the majority are white. The object remains absolutely still and silent about 100 feet in the air. They are anxious to get home, so they do not see the object leave. (Jenny Randles, “Anatomy of a UFO Wave,” IUR 11, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1986): 5)

April 19 — 8:05 p.m. A family in Llano, Texas, watches a huge dome-shaped object pass over their house at an altitude of only 200 feet. It has red lights around it. A jet aircraft appears to be pursuing it. The mother says she can hear a humming sound coming from it. (Bob Gribble, “UFO Hotline Reports,” IUR 9, no. 3 (May/June 1984): 16)

April 20 — 10:04 p.m. Four people in a car in Beaverton, Oregon, see a large, pulsating, yellow light high in the sky. The driver stops, and a small, bright-blue object comes into view, moving toward the yellow object at high speed.

Suddenly, a “fast red thing” shoots out of the blue object and knocks the yellow object in half, one part disintegrating and the other part falling to the ground. Two other objects, yellow and blue, appear with the blue object chasing and apparently shooting down the yellow object. The blue object then climbs at a high speed vertically and vanishes in the clouds. The observation lasts 20 minutes. (Bob Gribble, “UFO Hotline Reports,” IUR 9, no. 3 (May/June 1984): 16)

April 22 — 10:10 p.m. A woman and her mother are watching TV at a trailer park in Saltfleet, Lincolnshire, England, when they see a dome-shaped object with circle of white lights, a small group of red lights above, and a brilliant white light on top. It is hovering nearby and about 500 feet in the air. More lights turn on and the object begins to revolve. As its speed increases, the colors blend into one another. The object moves away to the south, but over the next hour it circles the trailer park in wide loops that take it several miles out to sea before returning over their heads. It switches a searchlight beam off and on. The woman’s two dogs are looking fearfully at the UFO. At one point the object drops to 100 feet and hovers in absolute silence above the witnesses. The searchlight comes from two headlight beams projecting forward. The UFO has a “smoky glass” dome on top. Dogs are howling for miles around. The object switches off all but four of its lights and climbs vertically before heading out to sea to circle for a few more minutes.

April 25 — 6:00 p.m. A woman is in her garden at Blairgowrie, Scotland, working on a tapestry when her dog leaps up and runs indoors. A ball of light appears in the air and seems to enter her body. She is blinded for a few seconds but feels calm. A white cloud rises from her head and hovers above some bushes. It blinks twice and climbs into the sky toward a large silvery object shaped like a house key. The cloud moves along the length of the key, flashing and lighting up bits in turn. She calls her son, who arrives just as the UFO sways from side to side and vanishes in a sudden pink flash. (Jenny Randles, “Anatomy of a UFO Wave,” IUR 11, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1986): 7– 8)

April 25 — 9:55 p.m. Three witnesses driving on American Canyon Road south of Napa, California, see a huge triangular object the size of a football field hovering 100 feet above the road. They drive beneath it, and after 5 minutes the object moves out of sight.

April 26 — On a visit to the 6513th Test Squadron, Red Hats at Groom Lake, Nevada, USAF Lt. Gen. [Robert M. Bond](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Bond&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107449719&usg=AOvVaw0ZBvHnyDD7WZs0QpgkDcdf) requests to fly a MiG-23 BN fighter-bomber, a newly acquired supersonic Soviet aircraft flown for testing.

Instead of the usual 2 weeks of training, Bond is given a cursory briefing while sitting inside the cockpit with an instructor. Just as he is flying at 40,000 feet and over Mach 2 speed, a hydromechanical inhibitor activates, preventing him from disengaging the afterburner. Bond loses control, makes a distress call, and is killed while ejecting. The MiG-23 crashes on Jackass Flats in Area 25, still contaminated from NERVA rocket testing. Bond’s body is discovered by a USAF sergeant on his way to work, who removes the rank insignia from Bond’s flight suit with a pocketknife before going to get help. The USAF does not confirm or deny that Bond was flying a MiG when he died and states that he was flying “an Air Force specially modified test craft,” but it leaks the information on the MiG testing program to journalist Fred Hoffman. There are fears that the publicity will also lead to the exposure of the F-117 program, still secret and also based at Tonopah, but this does not happen. (Wikipedia, “[Robert M.

April 26 — 9:45 p.m. Terri West spots an odd light in the sky from her home on Belmont Lane, Stanmore, Greater London, England. At 10:15 p.m., she joins her neighbors Ruth and Bruno Novelli to watch the light, which is moving back and forth and constantly changing colors from blue to green to pink. Soon it emits a large ball of light that shoots toward the ground. The witnesses call the police at 10:22 p.m. A team of police arrives and watches the object for about 2 hours. Police Constable Richard Milthorp says the light is originally at 45° but after 15 minutes it moves up and to the right. He draws a sketch of the object, which is circular in the middle with a dome above and below. It has different colored lights on the top and bottom. One of the officers takes photos, but they do not come out well. Some others chase the UFO by car, but it is already fading from view.

April 27 — 9:45 p.m. Linda Braga and her daughter Piper see a starlike object that follows their car along West Ridge Road in Cornville, Maine. About 35–45 feet in diameter, the red and yellow object comes almost within touching distance. When they reach their driveway, it backs off and hovers above a field, then moves around to the other side of the house. It disappears in the distance.

May 5 — 2:55 a.m. A witness in Piedmont, South Carolina, hears a loud pulsating sound and looks out the window in time to see a large metallic object passing above his house at about 750 feet. Described as bigger than an Air Force C-5A transport, the object is shaped like a flattened football. A car stops along the road, and the driver gets out to watch it. All of the dogs in the neighborhood are howling as it is in view for 2 minutes. (Bob Gribble, “UFO Hotline Reports,” IUR 9, no. 3 (May/June 1984): 16)

May 5 — 7:30 p.m. An ultrasensitive orbiting US Defense Support Program spy satellite detects the entry of an unknown object that passes 15 miles in front of it only 1.8 miles away, and then flies below it over the Indian Ocean.

May 5 — 9:45 p.m. Five workers on a garbage truck are near the Rio Seco, Tucumán, Argentina, when they see a strange light like a fireball. The truck stops, and later it is found that the fuses have burnt out. The upper part of the object

is giving off a red light and the lower part a blue light, and it hovers above the truck for 20 seconds. It then moves away silently and disappears. Residents of Rio Seco also see the light, which illuminates the village. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 19)

n of 15 lights, estimated to be the size of a Boeing 747 airliner if all are connected to one object, passes directly over the home of John Burdett, an IBM engineer in Hawthorne, New York. It makes no sound as it passes overhead except for a faint humming. All lights simultaneously turn blue and then it makes a tight 180-degree turn and flies off to the north. At 8:30 p.m., the object is seen from Route 117 in Pleasantville, New York, and follows a car down the Taconic State Parkway. At 8:45 p.m., David Boyd in Yorktown, New York, sees a V-shaped formation of lights turn and fly away to the west. (Philip J. Imbrogno, “More Nocturnal Lights,” IUR 9, no. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1984): 6–8)

Mid-June — 4:10 p.m. Seaman Alexander Globa and mate of the watch Sergey Bolotov are beginning their watch on board the Russian tanker Gori in the Mediterranean Sea 20 nautical miles east of Gibraltar. They see what seems to be an airplane with its landing lights on and flying toward them at an altitude of 4,920 feet about 2 miles away. It is shaped like a “frying pan turned upside down” with a shiny, metallic surface. It emits bright, irregular flashes of light. In two minutes it reaches the ship’s position, turns south, and keeps pace with the ship, gyrating for 3 minutes. The object is perfectly round and about 75 feet in diameter. There is a round, black spot on the bottom, and a cylindrical “tailpipe” is seen at the junction of two segments that are rotating in opposite directions. At 4:20 p.m., another ship approaches to the left, and the object flies quickly toward it and hovers above it. Capt.

Sokolovsky contacts the vessel, an Egyptian dry cargo ship enroute to Greece, and it confirms the presence of the UFO. After 90 seconds it quickly moves back to the Gori, ascends at an angle of 40°–45°, veers to the right, and eventually disappears. Total duration of the sighting is 12 minutes.

June 21 — 9:30 p.m. Investigators Dick Ruhl and Richie Petracca are on Interstate 84 in Dutchess County, New York, when they see a brilliant white wedge-shaped object floating and turning in the sky. The lights suddenly turn red, and as the object continues to turn, they see red, green-blue, and white lights. They stop and get binoculars out, then notice another object on the left. Both objects glide slowly and maneuver, constantly changing from white as they approach, and to red as they turn away. They finally form up into a boomerang shape. Ruhl and Petracca suspect they are seeing the “Stormville pilots,” so they drive to the Stormville airport. After waiting in the snack bar a short time, people see lights in the direction of the Green Haven Correctional Facility. It turns out they are six Cessna Skyhawks, apparently with mufflers on the engines, and they land one by one on a nearby runway.

Ruhl photographs the serial number of one of the planes, N76106. (Dick Ruhl, Richie Petracca, Sal Giamusso,

July 13 — 4:30 p.m. A mysterious object comes into view above Rzeszów, Poland, remaining stationary for a long time.

A flight controller from Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport estimates it is at 6,500 feet and is slowly moving to the northwest. Mielec Airport air traffic controller Kasimierz Lubertowicz scrambles an Iskra jet trainer on a scouting mission. As pilot Henryk Bronowicki approaches the object at 24,600 feet, he realizes it is not a weather balloon and is moving away from him. He gives up the chase, but the object descends and he approaches it again, failing to reach it as it retreats.

July 19 — 10:00–11:00 p.m. Police in Danbury, Bethel, Brookfield, and New Fairfield, Connecticut, receive reports of a low-flying, slow-moving object “as large as a football field.” It directs intense beams of light toward the ground and gives off heat felt by those beneath it. It has white lights in a circular pattern.

July 24 — 9:00 p.m. Security police at Indian Point Nuclear Plant at Buchanan, New York, again see a UFO with a semicircle of lights. The lights first flash yellow, then white, then blue. Far to the rear is a blinking red light. The dark mass behind the lights blocks out the stars as it approaches steadily. The plant’s movement-detecting sensors and alarm systems fail, as does the computer responsible for security and communications. By the time it gets to 500 feet away, the police can see an ice-cream-cone-shape and a solid body the length of three football fields. As it passes over the Unit 3 reactor, at one point getting as close as 30 feet, it is moving so slowly that the police can keep up with it by walking. An officer inside the plant watching security monitors is instructed to film the object using a camera atop a 95-foot pole; the camera has to pan almost 180° to cover the entire length of the object. One officer notices two hollow spheres or portals in the bottom. The UFO takes 5 minutes to pass over them. By the time the security police call Camp Smith, a National Guard base 10 miles away, and ask for an armed helicopter, the UFO is gone. Many other people in the area also report seeing the UFO over the plant. Police in Peekskill receive quite a few calls that evening. Police Sgt. Hoffman goes out to investigate and sees a giant UFO with more than a dozen white lights in a V formation slowly move toward the power plant. On July 25, the security guard supervisor tells them to forget what happened. Video and audio records of the event are removed, and in the next two days representatives of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversee a shakeup of the plant’s security operations. (Philip J.

August 20 — 9:00 p.m. Irene Lunn and her daughter are driving near Deer Trail Drive in Mahopac Falls, New York, when they notice triangle-shaped UFO with an unusual L-shaped tailpiece. They stop to observe it more carefully. The object has one red light, one green light, and eight white lights, and is moving south when it makes a sudden 90° turn and slowly moves toward them. They drive the short way home where they retrieve some binoculars. She can clearly see a dark, metallic object, which moves off to a neighbor’s yard and hovers. A rectangular object with white lights in each corner comes into view and moves in front of the first UFO for 5 seconds, then vanishes. The triangular object continues to hover, then silently moves off out of sight.

August 23 — Afternoon. Military radar at Otopeni Airport \[now Henri Coandă International Airport\] near Bucharest, Romania, picks up a target flying above Alexeni Air Force Base \[now closed\] east of Urziceni at 13,000–14,700 feet. The target, the size of a small plane or helicopter, appears out of nowhere and is tracked by 4–5 different radars in separate locations on different frequencies. After 15 minutes, the object is spotted visually. Through a telescope it appears oval, metallic and shiny, and about 9 feet long. During its appearance, the base notices a strong interference on VHF and short wave radios. The target climbs and descends about 7–8 times to altitudes ranging from 6,500 feet to 34 miles as it moves west at speeds up to 7,450 mph, making zigzagging movements and turning at sharp angles. It is under observation for 40 minutes and is lost at a height of 62 miles as it disappears into space at 620 mph. (Romania 104–105)

September 7 — 4:10 a.m. While approaching Minsk, Belarus, the pilots of a Soviet Aeroflot Tu-134 airliner are startled to see a strange, brightly glowing shape that appears to their right and follows their path closely for several minutes. The glowing object changes shape repeatedly, appearing first as rays, then concentric circles, then as a cloud, and finally as an amorphous mass. While copilot Gennady Lazurin sketches the object, Captain Igor Cherkashin contacts air traffic officials, who report that radar shows a strange “double” object, believed to be the airliner and the unidentified object. Years later, reports surface of a second flight crew traveling in the opposite direction who also see the glowing object. At the same time that the pilots in the first craft notice the UFO, a Soviet missile is launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Lazurin’s sketches of the object closely parallel sketches made by other witnesses at rocket launches, including amateur observers of the Soviet missile launch watching in Finland.

Late September or early October — 9:00 p.m. Militia Capt. Boris Ivanovich Vladimirov is riding in the right seat of a patrol vehicle with another policeman in Bayramgulovo, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, when they notice an unusual triangular pattern of colored lights about 80 feet away on the right side of the road in a freshly plowed field. There are 11 lights on the left and right sides of the object and 13 lights up the center. The lights on the edge flash sequentially like a theater marquee. After a bit, all the lights turn off. The next day, Vladimirov returns to the field and finds three round depressions in the soil about 10 inches deep and 36 inches in diameter. They are at the corners of an equilateral triangle 26 feet apart. (Richard F. Haines, “CE2 in the Eastern Urals,” IUR 17, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1992): 11–13)

October 8 — 7:40 a.m. Giuseppe Cocozza goes into his alfalfa field near Prata di Principato Ultra, Avellino, Italy, to get some fodder for his cow. On the beaten-earth path to the field he encounters an entity about 4 feet tall, wearing a blue helmet on its head and carrying a blue box on its back that features tubes running into the helmet and the entity’s back. Its body is covered with long, dark-brown hair, and it appears to be using a T-shaped instrument to explore the ground. There is a wide, aluminum-colored slit around its eyes. After noticing Cocozza, the entity moves toward a clearing among some hazel bushes, emitting small bluish flames from its sides. The witness backtracks and loses sight of it, but sees a UFO ascend at an angle from the bushes, turn, and shoot away toward a mountain range. Cocozza returns with a shotgun and finds some hoof-like footprints and holes left by the strange instrument, as well as landing marks apparently caused by the object.

October 9 — 3:30 a.m. A beam of light coming in through a window wakes up Isidoro Ferri in his residence on the Via della Tessaia in Polcanto, northeast of Florence, Italy. He sees that it is coming from the forehead of a dark figure on a nearby hill across the road. Suddenly the figure and light vanish, and Ferri sees a stationary ink light with three jets projecting downward. After several minutes, this light disappears and an extremely bright white light approaches and floods the area. Ferri gets up and approaches the window but finds himself paralyzed for a few seconds. The light then withdraws, and he finds he can move again. The white light is replaced by a red lens- shaped light that hurts his eyes then moves on to the northwest.

Fall — The UK Ministry of Defence is reorganized, making the group Sec. AS (2a) its main focal point for receiving public UFO reports. Its mission is to “determine whether or not UFOs present a threat to the security and defence of the United Kingdom.” It has no other budget than minor staff costs and its records are unclassified. However, [Timothy Good](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Good&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107478887&usg=AOvVaw1wqzOtWqEUpVULCFejJ3Aq) uncovers evidence that the U.K Provost and Security Services at RAF Rudloe Manor \[now MOD Corsham\] northeast of Bath, England, are conducting more serious and secret UFO investigations. More recent declassified files have revealed that RAF Rudloe Manor was a filter center for UFO reports in the 1950s. The British Police Force’s elite Special Branch in 1997 opens files on two UFO researchers in the UK who are collecting data on the Rudloe Manor operations—Robin Cole and Matthew Williams.

November — Discover magazine publishes a cover story on the Westchester County sightings, which claims that the UFOs are actually a group of pilots from Stormville, New York, who fly ultralight aircraft in a tight formation and use their lights in such a way as to create boomerang or circle patterns. The author, [Glenn Garelik](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.proz.com/profile/44501&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107480748&usg=AOvVaw0w5TzkAi8IWE-0jFPDLEdw), notes that single-engine planes, even when directly overhead, are barely audible at ground level when they are flying above 3,000 feet. However, it fails to disclose that many witnesses are much closer to the object than that, nor does it mention the hovering for extended periods. In his 1987 book Night Siege, [Philip J. Imbrogno](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2011/07/crash-of-philip-j-imbrogno.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107481088&usg=AOvVaw2BUWl8aNLAcEgiYVa4k8KQ) lists 12 reasons for rejecting the explanation of the Stormville pilots. On those occasions when witnesses see both a plane and a UFO, the plane is clearly audible and the UFO is not, even if it is much closer. The UFO also appears on nights when the Stormville pilots are not in the air. The UFO’s maneuvers simply are beyond the capacity of most aircraft, and the power and intensity of the lights is far beyond the power capacity of small planes.

December — Night. A married couple are up late watching TV in Trafford, Pennsylvania, when they hear a tapping on the window. They see a red ball of light about as big as a basketball that moves away from the window. They turn on the outside lights to watch the ball, which has black marks among the red and gives off beams and sparks. It floats over a neighbor’s house.

1985 — Near the town of Krasnovodsk \[now Türkmenbaşy\], Turkmenistan, a radar station under the command of Captain

L. Valuev tracks a disc-shaped object at an altitude of 60,000 feet and apparently more than one-half mile in length. The object is stationary, and some time later a small disc about 16 feet in diameter flies out of it and then lands on a lengthy spit on the Caspian Sea. Patrol boats rush to that area, but when they reach a distance of 325 feet from the object, it takes off and flies more than one-half mile away. This happens five times. Then the object ascends at a huge speed and reaches the larger disc, which rises up and disappears.

February — 2:35 a.m. Freight train #1702, consisting of 70 empty cars and a locomotive, is paced by a strange object for 31 miles from Essoyla station through Suoyarvi, Karelia, Russia, for 1 hour and 20 minutes. It comes from the side and crosses the railway about 100–160 feet ahead of the train. The men feel as if hypnotized and stare at an object about 13 feet in diameter that moves silently above the ground as if drifting. When the train is approaching the Novye Peski station, Engineer Sergei Orlov switches on his portable radio and contacts a woman on duty who goes out to meet the approaching train. She is surprised to see the shining ball followed by the vibrating object looking like an “upturned basin.” The train appears, moving at about 37 mph. She thinks the ball might hit the station, but right before the switch, it suddenly separates from the locomotive and passes around the building.

When it returns, the object moves again toward the train, which speeds up as if the UFO is pulling it. The train manages to stop only near the Zastava station and the ball disappears behind the forest. The crew has to wait for a train coming from the opposite direction toward Petrozavodsk. Conductor Mironov gets out of the cab to examine the wheels, and as soon as he walks around the locomotive he feels a strange force press him against the train. He cannot move, but eventually it lets up; he reaches the cab and the train starts off as if it is waiting for him to take his seat. The train keeps moving for some time until the ball disappears behind trees. Automatic recorders on the locomotive and other official documents corroborate the testimony. The shining ball is noticed earlier at the Kutizhma station even before it is spotted by the train.

March — Noon. At a military shooting range at Mălina, west of Galaţi, Romania, Doru Voloşeniuc is sent to collect compasses from a military vehicle when he sees a flat, silvery object hovering about 5 feet above the ground. It becomes shrouded with a blue-green mist as it increases its rotation. He hears an unusually strong and penetrating ringing sound and he is lifted off the ground more than 12 inches and slams into the road face down. Looking up, he sees the object is no longer there.

March 7 — 11:40 a.m. A witness is driving south on North Stevens Street between 12th and 16th streets in Tacoma, Washington, when he sees a long, glowing, oval object to his left less than 2 miles away. The object, the width of four full moons, begins banking to the northeast. At a traffic light, the witness is able to take three photographs of the distant object, and he drives another mile toward the UFO, taking a fourth photo before it shoots straight up and out of sight. The photos only show a blur of distant light. A day later, the witness develops a rash on his face.

Alexander states that one of ATP’s goals is: “Study of the UFO data could provide a potential for a leap in technology. This would not require access to a craft, but could be derived from scientific examination of the reports determining the theoretical physics required to achieve such results.” The group dissolves in 1988, since no government agency wants to openly fund it.

May 23 — 10:35 p.m. A Soviet bomber regiment carrying out a scheduled mission spots an oval, orange object over the Khabarovsk Krai, Russia. Radar does not track it, but observers estimate it is traveling close to 350 mph. A light halo surrounds it. The sighting lasts 13 minutes, during which time the object occasionally descends and remains motionless. Two hours later, a similar object is seen at high altitude for 10 minutes, emitting beams of light.

May 26 — 9:30–10:15 p.m. More than 100 people around Newtown and Southbury, Connecticut, see a low-flying, silent, circular formation of lights that passes over Interstate 84, causing many cars to pull over for a look and some to lose power. Commercial airline pilot Randy Etting sees the lights as he is driving along I-94. He pulls off the road and snaps a photo of the formation. He is sure there is a solid object behind the lights.

Pointing his flashlight in that direction, he sees that the glow is coming from a raccoon with black eyes. The raccoon speaks to him, saying, “Good evening, doctor.” He gives a friendly reply, and a moment later it is suddenly morning and he is walking on a road uphill from the cabin with no idea how he has gotten there. His clothes are clean and dry.

Mullis goes back to the cabin for some sleep. Later, he returns to the area near the fir tree and experiences an irrational panic. In 1987, he sees the cover of [Whitley Strieber](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitley_Strieber&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107504780&usg=AOvVaw0pfVZ3W_gN_--IfGnXi4MU)’s Communion and feels a vague sense of recognition.

June 11 — 10:40 p.m. A Chinese Boeing 747 airliner encounters a UFO on its flight from Beijing to Paris that almost forces the captain to make an emergency landing. Flight CA 933 is over Lanzhou, Gansu province, China, when Captain Wang Shuting and his crew first observe the object. The UFO crosses the path of the airliner at an altitude of 33,000 feet at a very high speed. The object illuminates an area of 25–30 square miles and is huge, with an apparent diameter of 6 miles. It is elliptical in shape and has an extremely bright spot in the center, with three horizontal rows of bluish-white lights on the perimeter. The sighting lasts for 2 minutes. Passengers do not see the object.

June 27 — During startup of the first reactor at the Balakovo Nuclear Power Plant, Saratov Oblast, Russia, a relief valve bursts and superheated steam at 572° F. escapes into the annular compartments surrounding the reactor well.

Fourteen men are possibly boiled alive. The incident is covered up by Soviet authorities. (Adam Higginbotham,

July — 3:00 p.m. As a pilot is flying a Grumman AA TR-2 toward the Port Columbus International Airport \[now the John Glenn Columbus International Airport\] in Ohio, the airport gives him authorization to investigate a “second sun” about two-thirds the size of a football field a few miles to the northwest. It is not tracked on ground radar. As he approaches, he sees it is a huge bright light that switches off as he gets closer, revealing a gray sphere. The object apparently consists of “millions” of clearly visible, pentagon-shaped, partially translucent crystals. The pilot estimates they are 6 inches in diameter, all spaced identically about 12 inches apart. He decides to penetrate the mass with his left wing, hoping he can knock some to the ground. As his wing slices through, he hears what sounds like a hailstorm on a tin roof and he sees hundreds of crystals breaking along the wing. The aircraft turbulence does not disturb the small objects, but their impact on the wing nearly destabilizes him. Later, he looks for fragments embedded in the wing, but does not find any.

July 14 — 12:56 a.m. Brian McMullan Sr., Brian McMullan Jr., and a third member of the rock band C.E.IV (because of their interest in UFOs) are in the garden outside the home of their bass player in a northern suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, when they see an amber ball skipping along the sky. It crosses the sky in 25 seconds, slowly changing color to red. They estimate it is about 60 feet across and vanishes toward Fenwick Moor. The band remembers being “paralyzed with awe” for several minutes after the sighting. (Jenny Randles, “Cosmic Rock,” Fortean Times 397 (October 2020): 31)

July 22 — 5:45 p.m. Two Hawk jets of the Zimbabwe Air Force piloted by C. Cordy-Hedge and T. R. Van Rooyen are scrambled from Thornhill Air Base in Gweru, Zimbabwe, following sightings in Bulawayo and five other cities in Matabeleland South. The object is seen and tracked on radar at Bulawayo Airport. It looks orange and round with a short cone on top. When the jets arrive at Bulawayo, the object is hovering at 7,000 feet, but it suddenly accelerates to a height of above 70,000 feet in less than a minute. The Hawks level off at 31,000 feet and return to Thornhill, where the object is seen for a few moments before disappearing horizontally at high speed.

The captain restarts the engine, but it dies again when the object is overhead. The UFO moves off toward the city and disappears. The men use oars to return to shore.

November 19 — 11:00 p.m. A woman is returning to her home near Madison, Wisconsin. Suddenly she sees three lights above a row of trees descending toward a house on the north side of the street. She pulls over to the curb and sees the lights make a sharp, 90° turn toward her car. Then it rises several feet in front of the car avoiding the power lines. Triangular and black, the object is the size of a large car with a light on each side. Sweeping to the north, the triangle stops and hovers directly over a house. She leaves and calls the Madison police department. (Don Schmitt, “The Belleville Sightings, Part Two,” IUR 13, no. 1 (Jan./Feb. 1988): 17–18; Marler 163)

November 22 — After 5:00 p.m. A Wisconsin state employee is driving north on County Highway CV near DeForest, Wisconsin, when he notices three white lights hovering 20–30 feet above a farmhouse. He exits the highway for a closer look. The UFO is roughly triangular, dull gray, 40 feet across, and its bottom is sloped into contours. It is hanging stationary over a 60-foot-high tree as the witness pulls his car past it. He gets out of his car about 200 feet away, and the object moves closer toward him to about 100 feet over the road. Smoothly and quickly it moves away to the west.

Initially he identifies it as the star Antares but soon realizes the position is wrong. He takes measurements of its height and azimuth. It remains in the same spot for 15 minutes, after which it begins moving quickly. Other crew members see the light approaching the ship and reaching the zenith 2 minutes later. The object’s outline does not resemble an airplane or helicopter, and it has an intense white light at its center, a weaker red light near it, and another soft light set apart. The object is flying low and silently. (Swords 436)

1986

1986 — NORAD technical intelligence works on 813 initial Unknown targets this year (whittled down quickly from an even greater number of Uncorrelated Targets). Nearly two-thirds are pursued by fighter interceptors and more than one-third of the scrambled cases are successfully intercepted and identified. Almost half of the total are identified by further Air Traffic Control correlation, leaving 123 Remaining Unknowns at the end of the year. This is reduced further in early 1987 to 87 “Not Identified” REMs by additional intelligence correlation analysis, leaving roughly 10% of the initial amount unidentified. (Clark III 801)

1986 — Night. Dissident Chinese writer [Ma Jian](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Jian_(writer)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107527622&usg=AOvVaw2t4NN2WTPz2wQayVPqX3iz) has escaped from custody and is making his way through dangerous terrain in Lancang Lahu Autonomous County in southern Yunnan, China. Suddenly, a ball of light the size of a cantaloupe appears in the darkness. It rises from a stream and floats through the trees, then stops by some branches 30 feet away. It drops to his eye level and he follows it through the forest, guiding his way for 12 miles until dawn.

January 1 — The Usenet bulletin board service ParaNet is launched, managed by James J. Speiser in Arizona. It quickly develops into a thriving community where a full range of researchers, skeptics, and cranks can post articles. Dale Goudie takes over the online information service Computer UFO Network. Operating out of Mercer Island, Washington, it functions as a UFO bulletin board using a voice and data line connected to an IBM personal computer. CUFON receives most of its reports from [Bob Gribble](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://avalonlibrary.net/Wendy_Connors_Faded_Disc_archive/NuforcDirectory.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107529194&usg=AOvVaw00pbQnvza3IygAc4kIUr0v) of the National UFO Reporting Center. In Seattle. By late 1986, Goudie has more than 1,700 members and is receiving many calls per day, mostly IFOs.

January 7 — A UFO emitting beams of light toward the ground is seen in Butler, Pennsylvania. In Pittsburgh, 20 minutes later, a silver-gray disc is seen hovering. Mist forms around it, the object tilts, and it moves out of sight. (MUFON UFO Journal, December 1986, p. 7)

January 9 — 9:00 p.m. Multiple cars stop along Interstate 84 in Hartford, Connecticut, to watch a silent boomerang- shaped object, estimated to be the size of a Boeing 747, with white, red, blue, and green lights. It moves low through the sky then hovers for 15 seconds before heading off to the west. The boomerang is also seen by dozens of witnesses in Torrington, Connecticut. A family sees the UFO, with 10 white lights, hover directly over their house, engulfing their home in a brilliant white light. They are so frightened they flee to the basement. The building inspector for Torrington sees a “cigar with square windows” near Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks. The FAA claims the object is a blimp, although there are no blimps flying in the area. (NightSiege, 5–6, 194)

January 29 — 7:50 p.m. Inhabitants of Dalnegorsk, Primorsky Krai, Russia, see a reddish ball about half the size of the full moon. The ball is flying soundlessly parallel to the ground. It is later determined that its speed is approximately 34 mph and that it is about 2,300–2,625 feet in altitude. When the object reaches Height 611 (also known as Mount Izvestkovaya) it starts to descend and then crashes into the hill. All witnesses but one agree there is no sound when the object reaches the ground. Some say the object falls with a flash and is not visible after that; others claim it oscillates at altitude above the hill, radiating light of varying intensity as it goes up and down. The light given off by the object is described by some as a forest fire, which lasts for approximately one hour. A scientific team led by [Valery Dvuzhilny](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/vladivostok-u-s-s-r-soviet-botanist-valeri-dvuzhilny-news-photo/515217982&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107530823&usg=AOvVaw3-6ekQznF9uBaHenICK3We), head of the Far Eastern Commission for Anomalous Phenomena, arrives on the site on February 3. Some rocks at the impact site have drops of silvery metal, which are later determined to be lead. The type of lead found on Height 611 is different from lead found in local lead deposits. Also, black, glassy, drop-shaped beads and mesh fragments are found at the site. In all, approximately 70 grams of lead,

5 grams of mesh fragments, and 40 grams of beads are discovered. The radiation level of the landing ground is normal. Photos of the site using two different cameras all develop as blank. Chemical analyses of the beads show they are mostly composed of lead, silicon, and iron. Some of the drops contain significant amounts of zinc, bismuth, and rare earth elements. An analysis of the soil, rocks, and burned wood taken from the landing ground shows that the chemical composition is similar to the composition of samples taken from the site of the 1908 Tunguska event. The mesh fragments are also analyzed; the material does not dissolve in strong acids and organic solvents, even when exposed to high temperatures for prolonged periods of time. One of the mesh fragments is discovered to be composed of scandium, gold, lanthanum, sodium, and samarium. An analysis of another mesh fragment shows gold, silver, and nickel. After that fragment is heated in a vacuum, the analysis no longer shows these elements; however, molybdenum and rhenium are detected. The concentration of gold found in one of the mesh fragments is equivalent to 1,100 grams per metric ton. This is much higher than gold deposits in the region, which become economic to extract when the concentration of gold reaches 4 grams per metric ton. There are no gold deposits in Dalnegorsk that contain gold at concentrations high enough to extract.

February 4 — 3:00 a.m. A woman in Reseda, California, wakes up with a sinus headache. She hears animals in the neighborhood barking, growling, and howling. Looking outside, she sees above a power line a black object hovering with a peculiar vibrating motion. It is “like a black mirror with a small, white fluorescent aura around it.” After 3–4 minutes, it emits orange bands of light. She wakes her husband, who manages to see a thin, white mist floating away. A strong wind comes up for 5 minutes afterward.

February 8 — 7:00 p.m. Matthew Woodard, 16, and Melinda Hays, 17, are driving toward Lima, Ohio, from the west on State Route 117. As they are crossing the bridge over the Ottawa River, they see a large, dark object about 50–60 feet long hovering above some trees on the right side of the road. It parallels them as they turn left on Seriff Road. It has a rectangular upper section with a single steady white light on top and sloping sides with a red and blue light on the lower left. The object eventually disappears in the distance behind trees and houses. (John P. Timmerman, “A Giant Triangle,” IUR 11, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1986): 9)

February 12 — 12:33 a.m. A woman who lives on the northwest edge of Lima, Ohio, is awakened by a loud sound. She looks out and sees a “strange dark object” in the southeast sky. It is triangular in shape, has white lights in the two lower corners and a red light in the top corner, and is hovering about 250 feet away. She goes to wake her husband, but when she returns the object is gone. (John P. Timmerman, “A Giant Triangle,” IUR 11, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1986): 10)

While flying over the Irish Sea, the pilot of his Vickers VC10 observes a bright red flash in the sky. Charles does not see it, but several other aircraft in the vicinity also report a reddish ball of fire with a tail (undoubtedly a meteor or space debris reentry).

February 28 — 11:30 p.m. Multiple witnesses in New Castle, Pennsylvania, watch a 50-foot-long lighted object, with two apparent legs for landing, hovering and moving up, down, and sideways. A dog becomes completely agitated. (MUFON UFO Journal, December 1986, p. 8)

March 18 — Two triangular objects flying one behind the other with their points forward are seen near Newport, South Wales. The first is covered with multicolored lights, while the second has three lights at each point. Both are a few hundred yards long. (Marler 138)

March 26 — Night. Some 500 witnesses in Kingston, New York, see an object “like a giant Ferris wheel” the size of a football field. It makes a humming sound and has intensely bright lights, mostly white but also red, yellow, green, and blue. A dark mass behind the lights blots out the sky. Suddenly the object flips on its side before moving away. A police officer who sees the UFO says it cannot be “a bunch of guys flying in planes.” (NightSiege 197– 198)

April 22 — After 10:00 p.m. Medical technicians taking an injured man in an ambulance to Debrecen, Hungary, see a huge, luminous, orange sphere flying silently above the right side of the road at Hajdudorog and moving along with them. It is about 325 feet away from them, floating at 100–130 feet. The sphere is surrounded by a ring, and flames appear on its surface from time to time. Two flames blaze on opposite sides, while another moves to and fro along its middle. The sighting lasts for 15 minutes for a distance of nearly 12 miles. When the ambulance reaches Hajdúböszörmény, the object speeds up, stops above a forest, and slowly descends while radiating a bright light that illuminates the trees. It goes out shortly afterward. On the return from Debrecen, the huge sphere returns over Józsa, this time with 6–7 flames instead of 3. It speeds over the village and “waits” on the other side for the ambulance, following it again to the north. The perplexed technicians decide to stop the ambulance. The UFO slows down, but does not stop, moving over a power line and illuminating the cables below. The ambulance recommences its journey, with the object following for another 10 minutes. A short time later, covering the same route, the technicians notice that the forest where the sphere landed is on fire. They find the grass all wet, with 5- foot flames (natural gas?) emanating from the ground. (Karoli Hargitai, “The UFO Phenomenon in Hungary,” IUR 14, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1989): 14)

April 22 — 11:00 p.m. Two people are driving on the Via Flaminia near Pesaro, Italy, when their car engine stops. After hearing a strange sound, they see 3 discs 65 feet in diameter with domes and tripods standing on the left of the road. They have white and blue lights. After hovering for 20 seconds, the discs emit a strong whistle, accelerate, and disappear. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 19)

April 25 — 9:05 p.m. A private pilot sees a V-shaped configuration of approximately 12 spherical nocturnal lights for about 15 seconds in Memphis, Tennessee. He estimates they are moving at 300 knots at an altitude of under 1,000 feet. (Mark Rodeghier, “From the CUFOS Files: 1986 Reports,” IUR 11, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1986): 14)

April 26 — 1:23 a.m. The Number 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant at Pripyat, Ukraine, has a power surge during a backup generator test. Flawed reactor design and inadequately trained personnel lead to the fuel rods overheating, causing an explosion and meltdown, necessitating the evacuation of 300,000 people from the area. Around 5% of the core is released into the atmosphere, dispersing radioactive material across Europe. The reactor explosion kills two of the reactor operating staff. In the emergency response that follows, 134 firemen and station staff are hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation. Of these 134 people, 28 die in the days to months afterward, and approximately 14 suspected radiation-induced cancer deaths follow within the next 10 years. Among the wider population, an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths are documented as of 2011. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation at multiple times reviews all the published research on the incident and finds that at present, fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely attributable to increased exposure to radiation. Determining the total eventual number of exposure-related deaths is uncertain based on the linear no-threshold model, a contested statistical model that is used in estimates of low-level radon and air pollution exposure.

April 26 — About 4:30 a.m. During the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, Mikhail Varitsky and other technicians observe a fiery sphere, similar in color to brass, within 1,000 feet of the damaged

Unit 4 reactor at the height of the fire. Two bright rays shoot out from the object, directed at the reactor. It hovers in the areas about 3 minutes, then the rays vanish as the UFO moves slowly away to the northwest. Radiation levels taken just before the UFO appears read 3,000 milliroentgens/hour; after the rays, the readings show 800 milliroentgens/hour.

May 6 — Several witnesses are driving from Worthing to Billinghurst in West Sussex, England, when they see a trapezium-shaped object with two square lights in front, and two green and one red light in the rear. Making a dull humming sound, it hovers above the road then zigzags behind their car. After they step out of their vehicle, the object comes straight at them, turns, and proceeds to the north.

May 19 — 6:30 p.m. 2ndSgt Sergio Mota da Silva, airport flight controller for São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil, sees two luminous objects about 6,500 feet above the city and 9 miles away. Through binoculars, the objects have distinct borders and intense multicolored flashing lights in the lower part. At 7:00 p.m., flight controllers at Brasilia and São Paulo confirm three primary radar targets above São José dos Campos. Around 7:30 p.m., da Silva sees more lights, predominantly red, but changing to yellow, green, and orange. ()

May 19 — 7:40 p.m. Visual UFO sightings continue over São José dos Campos, with objects remaining motionless for long periods of time. By 8:00 p.m., CINDACTA radars in Brasilia track 8 unidentified targets on their screens. ()

May 19 — 9:00 p.m. A Xingu light airplane piloted by Col. [Ozires Silva](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozires_Silva&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107539707&usg=AOvVaw1pOnRfz76Hz6lvw2r3JoA4), an aeronautical engineer and a manufacturing CEO for Petrobras, is preparing for a landing at São José dos Campos. His copilot Cmdr. Alcir Pereira da Silva receives a call from CINDACTA in Brasilia asking them to confirm some unidentified targets. They look and see bright red or red-orange lights “not at all like stars or planes.” Aborting the landing, they attempt to pursue one of the objects, which blinks on and off irregularly, appearing in a new location each time as if changing position rapidly. After about 30 minutes, they give up the chase and land. The Xingu makes three other attempts to land, but each time is diverted toward looking at other unidentified lights and targets. ()

May 19 — 10:23 p.m. By this time, the Air Defense and Air Traffic Control Center is on full alert, radar screens showing numerous unidentified targets. Three F-5E fighter jets are scrambled from Santa Cruz Air Force Base near São Paulo. One of the pilots, Capt. Marcio Brisola Jordão, is able to approach within 12 miles of an unidentified target, visible to him as a strong, constant light that is changing colors continuously from white to green. He breaks off contact when the object moves away out to sea. Another F-5E, piloted by Lt. Kleber Caldas Marinho, chases a very intense red light that changes to white, then green, then red again. Running low on fuel, he has to return to base. Both ground and airborne radar are tracking the objects. After the F-5E pilots make visual contact, more jets are scrambled from Anápolis Air Force Base, Goiás, about 10:50 p.m. This second flight consists of three Mirage III fighters equipped with Sidewinders and Martra missiles. One of the pilots, Capt. Armindo Sousa Viriato de Freitas, is vectored toward 10–13 unidentified targets at a distance of 20 miles. Radar controllers see the objects surrounding his plane, 6 stationed on one side and 7 on the other, and later following his plane at a distance of two miles, but only see them visually once when they are climbing vertically. During the night, a total of 21 luminous objects, apparently spherical and ranging in size from 165 to 330 feet in diameter, are seen, captured on radar, and pursued by jet fighters. Activity ceases around 11:20 p.m. The Air Force Minister, Brig.Gen.

June 26 — 9:49 p.m. A husband and wife see two objects traveling from southwest to northeast, about as bright as Venus, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They move on parallel paths below a scattered cloud cover. After a minute, they appear to begin rotating, then stop and move out of sight.

July 15 — 12:00 midnight. A single witness walking home from the bus station in Watertown, Massachusetts, is watching airliners land at Logan Airport when he sees a string of three bright-orange lights. They are moving along the same glide path as the incoming jets but seem to slow down, come to a dead stop, then vanish instantly.

August — 2:00 a.m. Meteorologist Ion Lazeanu is making routine radar observations at the National Meteorological Administration in Bucharest, Romania, when he picks up a stationary target that appears to be above the city of Sofia, Bulgaria, at an altitude of 18.6 miles. It suddenly disappears and relocates 3 miles lower down. After a short while it relocates to its original position. Over the next 3–4 weeks, he detects the same target every night he is on duty for periods of 3–20 minutes. He discovers another target above Cluj-Napoca, Romania. In February 1988 it reappears above Sofia, and in March 1988 he tracks it moving horizontally toward Varna, Bulgaria. At one point he locks the radar directly on the target and the system is temporarily disabled. He estimates that the target has a length of at least 4,920 feet.

August 11 (approximately) — 6:00 p.m. A retired factory worker and his wife are sitting in their driveway in Lima, Ohio, when they see a rotating, diamond-shaped object about 20 feet in diameter pass nearby. They watch it for less than 2 minutes. It is flying low, passing behind several trees as it moves from west to northeast and out of view. (Mark Rodeghier, “From the CUFOS Files: 1986 Reports,” IUR 11, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1986): 13)

August 12 — 12:00 midnight. A single witness in Cridersville, Ohio, sees two UFOs, one while watching the Perseid meteor shower, and the other 7 hours later while driving to work. The first object is a white ball of light seen for about 60 seconds; the second is a circular bluish object in the western sky seen for 1–2 minutes.

August 13 — 7:50 p.m. A family of three observes a metallic, hamburger-shaped object through a sixth-floor hospital window in Indianapolis, Indiana, for 4–5 minutes. It passes above an airliner going in the opposite direction. The object tips on its edge at one point, and it has a haze of pale green along one side.

August 15 — 11:00 p.m. A married couple on vacation in Calalzo di Cadore, Belluno, Italy, are sitting near a wood outside town when they see a bright light descend. It soon becomes a disc-shaped, domed object, blue in color and luminescent. They see it land, then their awareness ceases until two hours later. By this time the object has disappeared, and only a dark circular trace is left on the ground where grass is bent and blackened for a diameter of 30 feet. Strange dreams and difficulty sleeping, as well as the memory of two humanlike beings in coveralls, persuade them to be hypnotized on August 23–24 by a physician in Pordenone. They relate that a being had come out of the disc and took them on board without touching them. Inside they are laid down and given a medical examination of some kind. The entities have long, oval-shaped heads with phosphorescent eyes, pointed ears, and narrow mouths.

August 31 — 2:30 a.m. A man is driving home when his car engine stops in Manzuno, Italy. He gets out to find out what happened, hears a sharp whistle and dogs barking, and sees two bright lights. The objects descend and remain visible for more than 15 minutes. He sees their shape as rectangular with a luminous trail. The engine comes back on as the objects disappear. (Herbert S.

Fall — Night. A group of five lights maneuver at high speed above the Malmstrom AFB Alpha-01 missile alert facility southeast of Belt, Montana. Air Force Security Policeman Joseph C. Pscolka watches them make sharp-angled turns and stop at the same time instantly. Other launch control facilities in the same sector call in to report the lights. Soon five more lights descend from the clouds to join the others. They stop momentarily, then all 10 dart around “like crazy fireflies” for a minute before moving close to the ground. They zip off at high speed in all directions. (Nukes 396–397)

October 10 — 1:30–2:00 a.m. Witnesses see strong lightning-like flashes in the sky northeast of Fürjes, near Békéscsaba, Hungary. The flashes do not go lower than some 700 feet from the ground. The flashes are vertical, yet 5 times “thicker” than lightning. The flashes stop and a shining, metallic-blue, misty phenomenon appears and floats about for 5–6 minutes until it gradually fades away after breaking into several parts, each about 30–80 feet long. The display is followed by an unusual odor that persists for 20–30 minutes. (Karoli Hargitai, “The UFO Phenomenon in Hungary,” IUR 14, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1989): 13)

October 14 — 11:00 p.m. A couple driving north on US Hwy 45 near Bristol, Wisconsin, sees red and white lights flickering on the road ahead. They drive cautiously forward and see a large, triangular object hovering 30 feet above the pavement. The lights are running along its outer edges. They pull up almost directly underneath it, park, and step out of the car. They see a grid structure on its lower surface. Two minutes later the UFO drifts slowly toward the southeast and vanishes.

October 28 — UK researcher [Jenny Randles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Randles&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107556849&usg=AOvVaw3joGhBy6dUA-Y7A9L8lwSG) receives a call from a British military man who refuses to give his name or phone number. He says his commanding officer has given him her phone number and suggests she might want 600 pages of UFO reports that have come into his possession. One document appears to be a report from 1948 that uses the term “befabs” to describe “beings from alien objects.” Another file, from Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio in 1977, is titled “Elimination of Non-Military Sources.” Randles is suspicious but intrigued. The two speak again on October 30 and agree to meet at a local pub a couple hours later. She brings along a colleague, Peter A. Hough. The informant (“John”) is in his late 20s and a former member of the Royal Army Corps. In 1983, his commanding officer had befriended a USAF computer technician at Wright-Patterson AFB who had accidentally tapped into UFO files. The British officer copied many of the files but is arrested for being in a secure area without permission. During questioning, the technician withholds the fact that he still has copies of the files and manages to tell the British officer where they are and request he take them out of the US. For 2 years, his commanding officer shows “John” some of these reports until he leaves active duty in 1985. In August 1986, “John” returns for a reservist training camp, and his former commander gives him a key to where the documents are stored and tells him to take them, read them, and offer them to Randles. The pub meeting ends with an agreement for “John” to deliver the files the next time they meet on November 7. “John” never shows up but writes a letter to Randles saying that he has been detained at a base and interrogated about the documents, which he is informed was the “creation of an educated prankster.” He apologizes for letting her down, and she never hears from him again.

November 16 — 9:00 p.m. Between Nocera Umbra and Valtopina, Perugia, Italy, two witnesses see a dark disc, 26 feet in diameter with a blue dome, fly over their car. The car stops and restarts after the object goes away. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 19)

November 17 — 5:10 p.m. Japan Air Lines Flight 1628, a Boeing 747 cargo plane with a crew of three, is in the vicinity of Fort Yukon, Alaska, on its way to Anchorage. The jet is carrying a cargo of French wine and is flying at 35,000 feet through darkening skies, a red glow from the setting sun lighting one horizon and a full moon rising above the other. Capt. Kenju Terauchi and First Officer Takanori Tamefuji, along with Flight Engineer Yoshio Tsukuda, see two small objects and one huge Saturn-shaped object visually and on radar for more than 30 minutes. The objects follow the airplane for about 350 miles. The pilot changes course and altitude several times, with FAA permission, in an effort to identify the objects. Two rectangular-appearing objects sparkling with arrays of lights suddenly loom directly in front of them, one above the other. After a few minutes they abruptly change position and appear side by side. They move quickly, stop suddenly, and swing from side to side in unison, as if linked together. VHF radio communications are occasionally garbled at this time and cease when the two objects move away to the left of the aircraft. Two flat white lights continue to pace the airplane, then drop back and are lost from view both visually and on radar. About 5:30 p.m., while in the vicinity of Fairbanks, Terauchi checks a white light behind the plane and sees “a silhouette of a gigantic spaceship.” It is walnut-shaped, symmetrical above and below, with a central flange. He says, “It was a very big one—two times bigger than an aircraft carrier.” At its closest point, the large object casts such a bright light that it illuminates the cockpit, and Terauchi can feel heat on his face. Radio communications again became garbled during the close approach. The crew becomes frightened by the large object and requests permission to change course. After the course change, they look back and see the object still following them. Increasingly fearful, they request a descent to get away from the UFO (“We had to get away from that object”). After they descend and turn again, the object disappears. The FAA at first confirms that several of its radar traffic controllers had tracked both the 747 and the large object, and that USAF radar has also done so. Later official statements back away from this and try to ascribe the radar targets to weather effects. On December 29, the FAA issues a report stating, “We are accepting the descriptions of the crew, but are unable to support what they saw.” (Wikipedia, “[Japan Air Lines Cargo Flight 1628 incident](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Air_Lines_Cargo_Flight_1628_incident&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107558932&usg=AOvVaw2ZyXGbj4K8cD7ukPJ3OCO8)”; NICAP, “[Fantastic Flight of JAL 1628](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/861117alaska_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107559288&usg=AOvVaw1oTR2im2-tc_fMoTzY2yWM)”; Bruce Maccabee, “The Fantastic Flight of JAL 1628,” IUR 12, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1987): 4–23; Don Berliner, with Marie Galbreath and Antonio Huneeus, UFO Briefing Document: The Best Available Evidence, Dell, 2000, [pp. 128–132](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/ufobriefingdocum0000berl/page/128/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107559867&usg=AOvVaw3sDZqs4iFma218IL-zQq6x); Kean, [pp. 218–229](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307716842/page/226/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107560267&usg=AOvVaw2yWGH-wGmbkH9JaBD1L1OU); Swords 342; Good Above, [pp. 432](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/432/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107560552&usg=AOvVaw13UEv02QSJkI02Wk692Jno), [532](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/532/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107560827&usg=AOvVaw2Z9oqrF36uDPh9-due8V5J); Good Need, [pp. 400–401](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/needtoknow00good/page/400/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107561071&usg=AOvVaw1FsdME2e_swC2DszmhXqKi); “[JAL Flight 1628 over Alaska,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ufoevidence.org/topics/jalalaska.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107561307&usg=AOvVaw0AT7Yj9KImYNw6SK2BsxHg)” UFO Evidence; Clark III 630–632)

November 24 — 11:00 p.m. Dale Goretske is driving in Waukesha, Wisconsin, when he notices some flashing red lights in the sky to the southeast about 450 feet away. They are attached to a flattened triangle about 75 feet wide with pairs of flashing red lights at each corner. On the sides are pairs of steady white and red lights. The object is rotating silently. He tries to approach it in his car, but it moves away and is lost to sight.

November 25 —Afternoon. Civil and military personnel in Magadan Airport, Russia, notice an unidentified radar target. Since there is another aircraft in the vicinity, air traffic control asks the pilot to be aware of an unknown object. The plane and UFO “pass clear of each other,” although no details are given. Afterward, the object turns east and speeds up to 1,800 mph over the water toward Kamchatka and disappears from radar screens. (Vadim K.

Mid-December — Navy Commander “Sheila Mondran” is on duty at the US Space Command’s Surveillance Center inside the Cheyenne Mountain Complex near Colorado Springs, Colorado. Sensors detect something tripping the US Navy Space Surveillance System (the Space Fence), a multistatic radar system built to detect orbital objects passing over the US. The intrusion occurs above Lake Kickapoo, Texas. Mondran’s team tracks the object’s maneuvers, including loops, backtracks, crash dives, and fast climbs. She sends a flash alert to the Commander- in-Chief of NORAD, but the object immediately disappears. Two searches are ordered: one by NORAD’s Space Detection and Tracking System, the other by a network of sophisticated telescopes. Nothing turns up. The flash

alert is recalled the following day. A summary of the incident is sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and President [Ronald Reagan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890107563142&usg=AOvVaw0WQkWc_phJVpZ0J-nu1Erc) for his daily briefing.

Late December — 2:30 a.m. A road-maintenance engineer is driving on the highway between Hajdúböszörmény and Debrecen, Hungary, when he sees a “trailer with lit-up windows” landed in a field about 900 feet away. An orange light is flooding through the windows. The object is in the same spot where the sphere chasing the ambulance in April had passed above power lines.
