1947                        US. A U.S. Air Force intelligence report suggested that the observed "flying saucers" could be long-range aircraft with
                            high maneuverability and speed. These unidentified objects were thought to possibly be of Russian manufacture, influenced
                            by German technology. However, there was also speculation that they might represent interplanetary craft. (Chapter 8, Ref 310)
302
1943                        Germany. Some believed post-war UFOs originated from Nazi holdouts. In 1943, Admiral Karl Doenitz, leader of the German navy,
                            allegedly told naval cadets that the U-boat fleet had created a secret, fortified refuge for the Fuehrer somewhere in the world. (Chapter 8, Ref 311)
303
1945                        Argentina. Admiral Karl Doenitz didn't specify the location of this secret refuge, but speculation primarily focused on South America,
                            particularly due to the presence of large German immigrant communities and sympathetic governments in countries like Argentina
                            and Paraguay. A 1945 U.S. Treasury memo even highlighted Argentina as a potential haven for Nazi criminals and a center
                            for Nazi financial activity in the hemisphere. (Chapter 8, Ref 312)
304
1945                        Argentina. Approximate date. General Juan Peron's military dictatorship, with his wife Eva ("Evita"), allegedly provided up to
                            10,000 blank Argentinian passports to clandestine Nazi escape networks in Europe, especially from Italy and Spain, after the war. (Chapter 8, Ref 313)
305
1945                        Argentina. Approximate date. Several former members of the Nazi regime wanted for war crimes, including concentration camp director
                            Adolph Eichmann, Auschwitz doctor Joseph Mengele, and Hitler's deputy Martin Bormann, reportedly took refuge in Argentina post-war.
                            Eichmann was later kidnapped by Israeli agents, while Mengele and Bormann are believed to have died in South America during their
                            time in hiding. (Chapter 8, Ref 314)
306
1986                        Argentina. A young American adventurer wrote in 1986 about rumors of a secretive city in central Argentina inhabited by ex-Nazis and
                            their families. This city was reportedly closed off to journalists, investigators, and outsiders. A Japanese journalist, after
                            attempting to cover the story on this "lost city of the Third Reich," narrowly escaped danger. (Chapter 8, Ref 315)
307
1946                        Antarctic. 1946-1947. Some believe that remnants of the defeated Third Reich retreated to a hidden underground base in Antarctica. This
                            theory is bolstered by Germany's history of Antarctic explorations, with known expeditions in 1873, 1910, 1925, and 1939. Supporters of
                            this "frozen Fourth Reich" idea often cite Operation High Jump, a 1946-1947 military expedition to Antarctica led by American polar
                            explorer Admiral Richard Byrd. Officially, Byrd stated the operation aimed to train naval personnel and test equipment in frigid conditions. (Chapter 8, Ref 316)
308
1946                        Antarctic. 1946-1947. Rumors emerged that during Operation High Jump, Byrd's expedition encountered hostile disc-shaped aircraft of unknown
                            origin in Antarctica. Despite being equipped for 6-8 months, the operation concluded after just two months. Upon leaving, Byrd made a
                            statement to the media, and a Chilean newspaper reported that he stressed the need for the U.S. to prepare defenses against hostile
                            regions. Byrd was quoted warning of a potential threat from flying objects capable of traveling from pole to pole at astonishing speeds. (Chapter 8, Ref 317)
309
1947                        Washington DC. When he returned to Washington from Antarctica expedition (Operation High Jump), Admiral Richard Byrd reportedly urged
                            the U.S. to use Antarctica as an atomic test site. (As far as we know, his recommendation was not acted upon.) (Chapter 8, Ref 318)
310
1956                        Antarctica. Despite the seemingly implausible idea of hidden Nazi bases in Antarctica, there have been mysterious and unexplained
                            occurrences reported in the area post-WWII. In a 1956 account, four Chilean scientists reported witnessing UFOs in the Antarctic skies.
                            They described observing two metallic, cigar-shaped objects reflecting sunlight. These objects remained perfectly still, and even after
                            changing their viewing point to rule out optical illusions, the appearance remained consistent. Both objects performed intricate aerial
                            maneuvers, with sharp turns and instant stops. Using equipment, the scientists estimated the altitude of these objects to be
                            around 24,000 feet, with each object measuring approximately 450 feet in length and 75 feet in diameter. When one of the scientists
                            aimed a polarized spotlight at an object, it responded with a bright flash, altered its altitude, then resumed its aerial display,
                            achieving speeds up to 24,000 miles per hour. The sighting ended when clouds obstructed the view. (Chapter 8, Ref 319)
311
1958                        Antarctic. In 1958, two American scientists in Antarctica observed a white plume emerging from the icy landscape. Upon investigation, it
                            was identified as a potent-smelling steam cloud surrounding a dome-shaped structure, about six feet high and 12 feet in diameter, with
                            a shiny, glass-like exterior. One of the scientists, drawn towards the dome, recounted seeing two moving figures near it. These figures,
                            described as being around three feet tall, yellowish, and balloon-like, moved unsteadily around a source of light, reminiscent of an
                            acetylene lamp. Suddenly, a ball seemed to explode, releasing a burst of blue sparks. Alarmed, the scientist fled, warning his
                            colleague. From a distance, they glimpsed the reflections of the dome momentarily before another white cloud obscured their view. When the
                            cloud dissipated, there was no trace of the previously seen phenomena on the ice. (Chapter 8, Ref 320)
312
1958                        Antarctic. Soviet scientists reported spotting what seemed like walls and buildings under large slabs of ice in Antarctica from the air.
                            These structures were described as "too geometrical" to be natural formations, and there were sightings of human-shaped figures moving among them. (Chapter 8, Ref 321)
313
1965                        Chilean base in Antarctic. At a Chilean base in Antarctica, 17 individuals observed a "lens-shaped" aerial object. The base's commander
                            described it as a solid object moving at incredible speeds, executing maneuvers, emitting a greenish light, and causing electromagnetic
                            interference at a nearby Argentine base. The object hovered for approximately 20 minutes before speeding away, and it was observed
                            through high-powered binoculars. Concurrently, the Argentinian government reported that their Antarctic naval garrison spotted a large,
                            lens-shaped flying object, which displayed various colors and moved in diverse directions, pausing for about 15 minutes. (Chapter 8, Refs 322, 323)
314
1965                        Antarctic. In that decade, a team of international scientists in Antarctica reported multiple UFO sightings and experienced unexplained phenomena
                            originating from under the ice. They heard mysterious rumbling, humming noises, and sounds resembling heavy machinery in operation, despite
                            no known activities by any nation that could explain these sounds. (Chapter 8, Ref 324)
315
Jul. 1945                   Argentina. After World War II, unusual U-boat activity was observed in the South Atlantic. Two German submarines docked in Argentina carrying
                            incomplete cargoes of cigarettes and liquor. The crews were evasive about their last mission. Another German U-boat appeared in Argentina,
                            but this time, its men and cargo vanished. The U.S. ambassador believed they had parts of Germany's secret weapons. Despite tracking $400
                            million of Nazi funds to Argentina, they found a lack of cooperation from the local government, leading to many unanswered questions about
                            the extent of Nazi infiltration in the region. (Chapter 8, Ref 325)
316
Late 1940's                 A Patagonian bay, Argentina. Rumors persisted in Argentina post-World War II that German U-boats carrying Nazi war criminals and treasures
                            landed in Patagonia, Argentina's southern wilderness. A local newspaper later published a photograph, believed to be from the late 1940s,
                            showing what appeared to be a Nazi submarine in a Patagonian bay. Multiple witnesses claimed to have seen the submarine near San Matias Gulf,
                            with one elderly woman recalling spotting the submarine near the war's end, which later disappeared as an airplane passed overhead. This
                            region, Patagonia, is the closest part of Argentina to Antarctica. (Chapter 8, Ref 326)
317
1946                        Near Falkland Islands. Shortly after the end of World War II, the Icelandic whaler "Juliana" encountered a large German U-boat near the
                            Falkland Islands in 1946. This U-boat, which surfaced and displayed the German naval flag of mourning, dispatched a boarding party to
                            the "Juliana". The submarine's commander demanded a portion of the whaler's fresh food supply, speaking fluent English and
                            compensating the whaler's captain with U.S. dollars, even adding a bonus for each crew member. As the provisions were transferred,
                            the U-boat's commander informed the captain about the location of a large school of whales, which the "Juliana" later found as indicated. (Chapter 8, Ref 327)
318
1946                        Between the southernmost tip of Latin America and the continent of Antarctica. A French news agency corroborated ongoing rumors, confirming
                            that there were indeed genuine instances of German U-boat activities occurring between the southernmost part of Latin America and Antarctica. (Chapter 8, Ref 328)
319
Apr., 1946                  Florida. Following World War II, there was a surge in UFO sightings worldwide. An American military transport plane pilot reported an
                            encounter over Florida. While flying, he and his crew spotted what they initially believed to be a shooting star. However, as it approached,
                            they realized it was a long, cylindrical object, about twice the size of a B-29, with glowing portholes. The object, estimated to be
                            traveling at 2,000 miles per hour, veered to avoid a collision and vanished over the horizon. (Chapter 8, Ref 329)
320
Early 1946                  Near Lafayette, New York. A motorist noticed a gleaming light in the sky and, upon looking up, saw a large, metallic, cigar-shaped object
                            hovering above. The UFO, estimated to be between 300 and 400 feet in length with pointed ends and no protrusions, was observed for a few
                            minutes before it vanished instantly. (Chapter 8, Ref 330)
321
Mid 1946                    La Grange, Florida. A Navy officer in La Grange, Florida, heard a whistling sound above him. Looking up, he saw a dark "flying football"
                            moving from west to east at around 1,000 feet, traveling approximately 125 miles per hour. The object had no wings, engine sound, or
                            other distinguishable features and was estimated to be 15-to-20 feet in diameter. It smoothly curved southeast and disappeared into a
                            cloud bank. The officer's wife and family also heard the noise, and his wife briefly saw the object as it disappeared. (Chapter 8, Ref 331)
322
Mid 1946                    San Diego, California. In 1946, two individuals observed a UFO near San Diego, California. Positioned on high ground curving from Morrow Bay,
                            they spotted a dark, bat-like object in the sky after sunset. The object remained stationary for several minutes, its shape clearly visible. It
                            then either descended or was obscured by rising cloud mist, disappearing from view. After its disappearance, a vibrant flush of color
                            spread over the sea. (Chapter 8, Ref 332)
323
1946                        Lake Nipissing, Ontario. A family in Ontario, Canada, observed a group of small, disc-shaped UFOs at Lake Nipissing. Approximately a dozen
                            of these craft landed on the frozen lake surface, roughly 75 feet away from the observers, moving with a rotating motion. These UFOs
                            repetitively ascended a few feet and then descended back onto the ice. When one of the witnesses approached them, the objects swiftly departed
                            at a 45-degree angle, leaving a series of black marks on the ice. (Chapter 8, Ref 333)
324
1946                        Portugal. A large disc-shaped UFO with a green iridescent glow was observed hovering motionless over a town. The object remained for about
                            five minutes before departing in a southerly direction. (Chapter 8, Ref 334)
325
Mar. 1947                   Palatine, New York. A motorist in New York encountered a disc-shaped object hovering near the ground in a field. The craft, measuring
                            about 60 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick, rose vertically and vanished within seconds. (Chapter 8, Ref 335)
326
Mar. 1947                   West Virginia. A woman in West Virginia spotted a round, silver-colored aerial object in the afternoon sky. It appeared to float silently,
                            unlike the audible engines of airplanes at a similar distance. The object emitted reflections like a sunlit tin can, with its sides being
                            silver and the top resembling the color of silk. (Chapter 8, Ref 336)
327
Mar. 1947                   Maine. Or April. A man driving near an airport in Maine observed several "saucer-like objects" hovering close to the ground. These objects,
                            resembling pie plates, revolved and emitted a trail of smoke from their edges. They were distinct from conventional aircraft, reflected
                            sunlight, and were estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter. (Chapter 8, Ref 337)
328
Mid May. 1947               Manitou Springs, Colorado. A group of seven railroad workers observed a silver UFO performing aerial maneuvers above them. The object
                            hovered approximately 1,000 feet above, revolving as it stayed in place. It moved erratically in wide circles, reflecting light intermittently,
                            suggesting a changing angle of reflection. After around 20 minutes, the UFO disappeared in a straight line towards the west-northwest. (Chapter 8, Ref 338)
329
Late May. 1947              Beaufort, South Carolina. A fisherman observed a formation of four spinning, highly-polished disc-shaped UFOs. They flew by noiselessly, and
                            each had a circular rim or projection on the underside, about one-quarter of the way from their edges. (Chapter 8, Ref 339)
330
Apr. 1947                   Richmond, Virginia. Two Weather Bureau employees in Richmond observed a metallic elliptical disk through a theodolite on three occasions.
                            One sighting was at 15,000 feet, lasting 15 seconds. The disk had a flat bottom and round top, appeared below a weather balloon, and was
                            moving rapidly. (Chapter 8)
331
May. 1947                   Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. An RCA field engineer in Oklahoma City observed a disk flying at an altitude between 10,000 and 18,000 feet. The
                            object was moving northwards rapidly without leaving any trail. (Chapter 8)
332
Jun. 28, 1947               30 miles northwest of Lake Meade, Nevada. An Air Force lieutenant flying northwest of Lake Meade, Nevada, at 10,000 feet observed five or
                            six white circular objects in formation moving at an estimated speed of 285 miles per hour. (Chapter 8)
333
Jun. 29, 1947               Near White Sands, New Mexico V-2 firing grounds. A party of three, including two scientists, reported seeing a large disk or sphere moving
                            horizontally at high speed and an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet while heading towards a V-2 firing ground. The object, with no
                            protruding surfaces like wings, was visible for about 60 seconds before disappearing to the northeast. Two observers concurred on the
                            sighting details, but one believed he saw vapor trails. (Chapter 8, Ref 340)
334
Early 1947                  Australia. Two schoolmates in a small town in Australia witnessed a significant UFO event on a cold night. The surroundings suddenly
                            illuminated brightly, prompting the boys to dismount their bicycles. They observed a large UFO hovering just above them, seemingly
                            resting on power lines. The object seemed to struggle with descending further due to its position between shops. The boys had a clear
                            view of it for about three minutes. Subsequent to this event, Australian newspapers reported multiple UFO sightings in nearby areas. (Chapter 8, Ref 341)
335
Jul. 1, 1947                Off the coast of the east African nation of Kenya. Passengers and crew aboard the steamer "Llandovery Castle" off the coast of Kenya
                            reported a massive, silent UFO pacing their vessel one night. The object, resembling a dirigible, was about twice the ship's length,
                            approximately 1,000 feet long, with a shiny surface. The ship's log noted the UFO descended to around 100 feet, projecting a brilliant
                            white light from below, and followed the ship at a half-mile distance. After a few minutes, the light went off, and the object
                            ascended into the darkness. (Chapter 8, Ref 342)
336
Aug. 1946                   Tinker Air Force Base outside Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. A civilian employee of Tinker Air Force Base encountered a lens-shaped, metallic
                            UFO with a "weathered aluminum finish" hovering over trees near her home. The object, estimated to be about 75 feet in diameter, had
                            around a dozen square windows on its lower portion. In each window, she observed the head and shoulders of human-like figures, which
                            appeared either bald or possibly wearing helmets. After observing her for a few minutes, the UFO rotated and quickly and silently flew away.
                            The witness, familiar with many conventional aircraft, believed this was something entirely different. (Chapter 8, Ref 343)
337
May. 1946                   Sweden. A prominent Swedish businessman witnessed a disc-shaped object with a cupola, oval windows, a mast resembling a submarine's
                            periscope, an oblong fin, landing legs, and a ladder touching the ground. The UFO, approximately 53 feet in diameter, had turbine-like
                            holes from which jet beams emerged, scorching the grass upon departure. The mast emitted a strange pulsating purple light that covered
                            the object and nearby ground. The businessman observed multiple individuals, totaling 11, near the UFO. These individuals wore white
                            overalls, transparent helmets, black boots, gloves, and belts. The women had ashen-colored hair, while the men wore black caps.
                            The beings appeared sunburned. One guard had a black box hanging from his neck, which seemed to drain the battery of the witness's
                            forehead lamp upon being directed at him. The witness briefly left the site but returned to see the UFO ascend and depart rapidly. (Chapter 8, Ref 344)
338
Mid 1946                    Johannesburg, South Africa. Two South African women observed a UFO hovering above a hotel roof in Johannesburg. The object was saucer-shaped
                            with a central gold-colored ball. They heard a clicking sound, and the ball detached and then re-attached itself above the main saucer. Two
                            seven-foot-tall human-like figures, resembling identical twins with fair complexions, broad shoulders, and short, wavy hair, appeared between
                            the saucer and the ball. Dressed in white uniforms with stiff collars and wide belts, the figures stood motionless, staring at the women.
                            The sighting concluded as the UFO and its occupants slowly moved away, obscured by a building. (Chapter 8, Ref 345)

Spring, 1947                Langley, British Columbia. In a remote area near Langley, British Columbia, two young boys encountered a UFO. One boy, while reading near a
                            creek, heard a hum before a silver-gray UFO landed in front of him. From it emerged several creatures resembling praying mantises, wearing
                            form-fitted silver-gray attire. One creature approached the boy, took his book, placed its hands on his shoulder, and communicated
                            telepathically, instructing him not to look up as they departed. When the boy eventually looked up, the UFO was ascending rapidly, pursued
                            ineffectively by four military planes. The other boy seemed in a daze, and the boy had to guide him away from the creek. Following the
                            encounter, they experienced extreme thirst and the boy felt ill for days. Later, they noticed a circle of burnt grass where the UFO had landed. (Chapter 8, Ref 346)

Jun. 1946                   Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton OH. A young boy visiting Wright Field claimed to have seen a domed saucer around 20 feet in diameter
                            with three legs in a hangar. Next to it were several small, humanoid bodies with large, pear-shaped heads on stretchers. After being spotted
                            by a colonel, the boy's father lost his job. The boy's grandfather, an employee at the base, allegedly confirmed a UFO had been brought there. (Chapter 8, Ref 347)
341
Mid 1946                    Oconomowoc Lake, Wisconsin. Three individuals witnessed a shiny object, resembling a silver-colored pointed cam, tumbling from the sky over
                            Oconomowoc Lake in Wisconsin. As it descended, a barn caught fire, and locals reported hearing an explosion. Despite the witness's attempt to
                            inform authorities, they dismissed the claims. (Chapter 8, Ref 348)
342
1946                        Sweden. Beachgoers in Sweden observed a "projectile trailing luminous smoke" crashing into the sand, leaving a slag-like crater. Descriptions
                            mentioned a cylindrical object between 65 and 100 feet in diameter. Despite the testimony, the Swedish military dismissed the incident, suggesting
                            the witnesses had imagined it. (Chapter 8, Ref 349)
343
Oct. 1946                   Arkansas and Wright Field, Dayton OH. Or Nov. A classic saucer-shaped UFO, resembling two soup bowls joined at the rim, was allegedly found in
                            Arkansas and moved to Wright Field. An ex-airman at the base described the craft as being 15 feet in diameter and 7 feet thick with a
                            series of rectangular windows. It had a brushed aluminum appearance and seemed to be made from a single material. The interior was mostly empty,
                            but featured a central cylinder about three feet in diameter. (Chapter 8, Ref 350)
344
1946                        Either Arizona and New Mexico. Or 1947. Three construction company employees, after hearing a loud explosion, discovered the wreckage of an
                            unfamiliar aircraft. Nearby, they saw three small humanoid creatures, one of which seemed injured. Later, they were interrogated by individuals
                            who claimed the incident was related to a secret government project and instructed them to remain silent about what they witnessed. (Chapter 8, Ref 351)
345
Jan. 1947                   Arizona. Two men, one a U.S. Navy enlisted individual on leave and the other recently discharged from the Army, encountered a disc-shaped object,
                            half-buried in the sand with a diameter of 30 feet, a thickness of 18 feet, a dome on top, and windows or portholes around its rim. They were
                            quickly ordered to leave the scene by military personnel. (Chapter 8, Ref 352)
346
May. 1947                   Socorro, New Mexico. A former military photographer reported a UFO crash near Socorro, New Mexico. The crash resulted in one dead alien
                            occupant, while three others survived. These survivors made crying-like sounds and held box-like devices close to their chests, with one
                            appearing injured. The same witness later claimed to have filmed autopsies of alien beings on two occasions in 1947 and once in 1949. (Chapter 8, Ref 353)
347
Jun. 24, 1947               Chehalis, Washington. A private pilot named Kenneth Arnold observed a chain of nine peculiar-looking aircraft flying near Mount Rainier. 
                            Initially thinking they were reflections from another plane, Arnold noticed that the objects flew like geese, in a diagonal, chain-like formation, 
                            swerving between mountain peaks. These objects lacked visible tails and were estimated to be traveling at speeds of approximately 1,700 miles per 
                            hour, faster than any known aircraft then. Arnold compared the span of the objects to the distance between the outermost engines of a DC-4, 
                            which is around 60 feet. The sight deeply unsettled him as he was familiar with most flying objects. (Chapter 8, Ref 354)
