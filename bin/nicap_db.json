Julian Sandoval, a NASA contract flight engineer, also an experienced pilot and navigator, and two independent witnesses saw a glowing elongated object with ablunt end. lt had a series of four body lights varying from brilliant green to a bluish tinge, and was hovering at an estimated 12,000 feet. When the object moved, its glow brightened and it appeared to be a powered craft (luminosity/motion correlation). The witness watched the object for an hour and a half, after which it climbed vertically, accelerated to a high velocity and disappeared to the northeast in about 12 seconds.
