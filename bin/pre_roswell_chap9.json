Just a few years after the Wright brothers' inaugural flight, when most air travels were low-altitude and nighttime flights were rare, mysterious high-flying planes were spotted, especially during nighttime. On one Christmas Day, observers in New Haven reported a mysterious aircraft circling the city at a great height. Its exact appearance, pilot, and mechanics remained unclear, but its distinct flight pattern set it apart from known balloons or dirigibles. Though many had seen conventional planes, this sighting was unique. The aircraft was believed to be the same one spotted over New England for several months. (Chapter 9, Ref 355)",

Tillinghast's monoplane had a 72-foot wingspan, weighed 1,550 pounds, and was powered by a 120-horsepower gasoline engine he designed. Unique features of his plane included its uncapsizable design, the placement of occupants on the machine's body, and an acetylene gas headlight. Tillinghast kept many details secret, especially its location, as he intended to compete in upcoming Boston aviation contests. He emphasized that his machine was no prototype and had been successfully tested at night. (Chapter 9, Ref 357)",

The journalist believed the estate's large shed might house the mysterious aeroplane but was arrested before confirming this. Paul B. Morgan's past investment in a failed Swedish aviator's project and his connection to Tillinghast further fueled speculations.
