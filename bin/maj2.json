His rivalry with Thomas Edison, who was a proponent of direct current (DC), is legendary in the history of science. Tesla's innovative work spanned a wide range, including radio waves, remote control drones/robotics, the Tesla turbine, wireless transmission, and the Tesla coil. Despite his profound contributions, he spent his later years in relative obscurity and died in New York City in 1943.\n\nThe SI unit named after Nikola Tesla is the [\"tesla,\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)) symbolized as \"T.\" It is the unit of magnetic flux density (or magnetic induction) in the International System of Units. One tesla represents one weber per square meter and can also be viewed as the magnetic field strength that results in a force of one newton on a charge of one coulomb moving perpendicular to the field at a speed of one meter per second.",

Illumination seemed to emanate from an endless string of portholes which were arranged on a straight line or plane and were yellowish like an incandescent bulb. The objects were cigar-shaped, but could have been one side of a flat, saucer-shaped form. Each \"coach\" was identical in size and shape except the first, which was larger, brighter and seemed to have a proboscis-shaped appendage in front like a figure head. The objects traveled extremely fast, emitting no noise, jet exhaust, or flame.",

Shortly five saucers (such as those pictured by George Adamski) appeared over the ship and hovered. Orders were given to fire upon them. He asserted that they could see the tracers and shells heading directly toward the saucers. The shells either exploded or disintegrated before reaching the objects. This attack continued for 10 minutes but nothing affected them. At the approach of naval planes the saucers disappeared.",

No sound or visible means of propulsion was observed from the UFO. It flew away at tremendous speed for 3 miles where it was joined by 2 other UFOs into a ‘V’ formation and sped away.",

Subsequent inquiry found that there had been no fire or explosion aboard the jet before or after the crash and that scorch marks found on the exterior windows, fuselage and parted tail section showed signs of having been exposed to tremendous exterior heat. Also the force causing the plane to come down did not come from within the plane. Radar Operator, E.H.

The Radar Operator spied the UFO heading straight for the craft. The operator radioed for the F-86 to climb at once, but it was too late. The two blips merged as one and the UFO was tracked moving away. Classified as “mysterious” not a single shred of the F-86 was ever found. (ref. Kinross AFB where an F-89 with crew of two merged with an UFO and disappeared.-Donald Keyhoe) Second Case: A radar operator was tracking a transport plane carrying 26 persons aboard when, suddenly, another blip appeared on the screen closing at 2500 mph on the transport. Before the operator could warn the transport the two blips emerged as one. The remaining blip sped straight up at tremendous speed.

A second F-4 that was scrambled began closing in on the UFO at greater than Mach 1 and was closing on the UFO at 150 nautical mph., but the UFO accelerated and stayed ahead of the F-4 (confirmed by Radar). Multi-colored flashing lights were visible on the UFO. The moment the F-4 pilot tried to lock an AIM-9 missile at the UFO he lost all weapons panel and communication control. The UFO launched two smaller UFOs, one of which began to follow the F-4. After evasive action by the F-4, the smaller UFO returned and united with the larger UFO. The other smaller UFO seemed to have landed on the ground so the pilot flew down to investigate it. The landed UFO appeared to be 12feet in diameter. As the pilot descended the light from the landed UFO went out and he lost sight of it. The DIA termed this sighting as “an outstanding report. This case is a classic which meets all the criteria necessary for a study of a UFO phenomenon.” And, “an inordinate amount of maneuverability was displayed by the UFOs.”",

The scientists believed this program would \"dispel any of the mystery\" created by military security procedures, and also keep the investigation on a scientific basis. The recommendations were not adopted.<br/><br/>Summary Released by Air Force, 1958: The panel concluded that UFOs constituted no \"direct physical threat to national security,\" there was no evidence of \"foreign artifacts capable of hostile acts,\" and no \"need for the revision of current scientific concepts.\" The panel recommended \"immediate steps to strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired.\" The panel suggested \"an integrated program designed to reassure the public of the total lack of evidence of inimical forces behind the phenomena.\"<br/><br/>Exactly what transpired at the conclusion of this meeting is not clear, though it is strongly suggested that the whole story has not been told. If the decision of the panel had been clearly negative, as the 1958 summary implies, there would have been no reason to be so secretive about it. On the contrary, there would have been every reason to make an immediate public announcement.<br/><br/> What is known about the affair is the public manifestation of the UFO project following the meeting. After a period of apparent serious interest in gathering better data (which supports Ruppelt's version of the panel conclusions), the Air Force began debunking UFOs. Since then the Air Force does not admit to having the slightest shred of evidence that anything at all out of the ordinary is taking place.",

In our space they travel much slower, and, of course, become visible either by intent or by accident, for in their travels they use the invisibility screen.” “This space navigation has been going on for millions of years, these ‘nova’ having come into our galaxy originally from the Great Magellanic Cloud via the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, 47 Tucanae, Omega and Alpha Centauri clusters.” “Their masters planted the original humanities here and which did not develop sui generis. They have been absent from our planet since before the fall of the Roman Empire when the Great Master left earth for the outer galaxy by fohatic teleportation.” “He is now back and what is going to be done depends upon mankind, but my advice is that physical man set up no belligerence, for a small concentration of those disks just beyond the range of our atmosphere could clean the surface of our planet completely in a matter of less than 24 hours. “Their present local headquarters is on the unseen side of our moon.

The object had first appeared over the highly restricted areas near the White Sands Proving Grounds. On July 2, Steve MacKenzie (a pseudonym, actually Frank Kaufmann), stationed at [Roswell Army Air Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Air_Force_Base), had received a call from [Brigadier General Martin F. Scanlon](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/105707/brigadier-general-martin-f-scanlon/) of the [Air Defense Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_Defense_Command), ordering him to report to the radar sites at [White Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range). MacKenzie was to monitor the object's movements and report them directly to the general. MacKenzie could not leave the scope unattended for even the shortest of times. In fact, once he had his watch established, he set up a system of mirrors so that he could see the screen even when he needed to use the latrine. MacKenzie stayed at his post for twenty-four hours straight, but nothing changed. The object appeared periodically over southern New Mexico, but usually just \"flitting from one location to another.\" When MacKenzie reported that nothing had changed significantly during his twenty-four-hour watch, Scanlon decided to end MacKenzie's part of the operation. Although MacKenzie was ordered back to Roswell, the operators at White Sands were told to continue to monitor the object, as were the radarmen at Roswell and Albuquerque. (R.G.: Interestingly, this case was deleted and \"declared a hoax\" in NICAP's records and by K. Randle, but after re-reading all the relevant research I don't believe that this is a matter of a simple hoax. It fits into the historical timeline well and should be re-examined.)",

Burleson, author of *UFOs and the Murder of Marilyn Monroe*, mentions wiretaps of phone conversations between reporter Dorothy Kilgallen and her close friend, Howard Rothberg, and wiretaps of phone conversations between Marilyn Monroe and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the Kennedys started distancing themselves from Marilyn, she grew angry and (mentioning it on the telephone, unfortunately) started planning to hold a news conference and \"tell all.\" According to the hypothesis set forth in Dr. Burleson's book, Attorney General Robert Kennedy then became so fearful that \"tell all\" meant telling the big secret-- the government retrieval and coverup of UFO crash debris and bodies (which reporter Kilgallen wrote about several times in her newspaper column). The document was signed by James Jesus Angleton, who at the time was the Chief of Counterintelligence for the CIA.\n\nThe UFO connection becomes all the more compelling with the discovery, described in *Burleson's UFOs and the Murder of Marilyn Monroe*, of an imprint to the left of the \"TOP SECRET\" stamp near the top of the document; the imprint, when Burleson enhanced it by computer imaging techniques, turns out to contain the name of Brigadier General George Shulgen, who was formerly the chief UFO investigation-coordinator for the U.S. Air Force. (The imprint also refers to General Schulgen's Intelligence Collection Memorandum, a document known to have existed.)

On a Monday evening around 10:30, a noise from the cattle lot awoke farmer Alexander Hamilton of Vernon. Expecting it might be his bulldog causing mischief, he was stunned to see an airship descending above the cow lot. Joining him with axes, Gib Heslop, his tenant, and his son Wall approached the craft, which hovered about 30 feet above the ground. This airship had a cigar-shaped section estimated to be 300 feet long with a transparent carriage below. Within the brightly lit carriage were six unusual occupants: two men, a woman, and three children speaking an unintelligible language. The vessel itself had parts that weren't transparent tinted in a dark reddish hue. Suddenly, a loud noise drew the beings' attention, and they shined a light on the humans. Reacting swiftly, they activated a large turbine wheel beneath the vessel, making it ascend gracefully. As it hovered about 300 feet overhead, the observers noticed a bawling heifer entangled in a red cable connected to the airship. Despite their efforts to free the animal, the ship and the cow both soared away and vanished into the northwest. The next day, parts of the cow were found by Lank Thomas in Coffey County, puzzling him as there were no tracks on the soft terrain surrounding it. The harrowing experience haunted the narrator, who was tormented by nightmares of the peculiar ship and its occupants, questioning if they were devils, angels, or something else entirely.",

Recent mutilations have appeared across several Colorado counties, with 58 cattle reported dead and mutilated, often found with vital organs missing and no blood traces. Wild theories have suggested devil worshipers or even extraterrestrials might be involved, though no evidence supports these claims. This phenomenon isn't limited to Colorado; states like Texas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Arkansas have reported similar cases. Concurrently, there have been numerous reports of unidentified and often silent helicopters, leading some to speculate a connection between the two mysteries. Authorities and organizations, including the FBI and the Cattle Raisers Association, have tried to curb the mutilations and investigate the helicopters to no avail. Amidst the rising panic, the Army has even advised helicopter pilots to maintain altitudes above 1,000 feet to avoid being shot at by alarmed ranchers.

The article theorizes MJ-12 may have in reality researched high-altitude aircraft.  \nEither way, the extreme secrecy around real continuity of government planning by the U.S. government, including building underground bunkers and facilities over nuclear concerns since WWII, has fueled speculation among UFO researchers. While MJ-12 may have existed for COG study, likely not under the names in UFO documents, the government's vast hidden COG infrastructure has inspired paranoid myths about alleged underground alien bases. The intense secrecy enables ongoing conjecture about what facilities truly exist and their purpose.",

It supports itself in the air by drawing its belly, widening itself and forming an arch as far as the ribs extend, and forces itself ahead with the rapidity of a bird, by sinuous motions, like a serpent swimming. There is nothing in the reptile which bears any resemblance to a wing. Its length is about four feet, and bite is dangerous. Another description of flying or darting serpents, is described by the natives, whose bite is instant death. It leaps or flies only about half the distance of the other, and makes none of the sinuous waving motion in the air. This discovery, of the truth of which there can be no doubt, shows the portion of Scripture which speaks of “burning fiery serpents” had a literal fact for the basis of its figurative language, though the species is now extinct in the region spoken of in the Bible.

The purpose of this press conference was to address and challenge the widespread denial of the existence of **Project Aquarius** and UFO-related documents by certain government agencies. These agencies had consistently denied the existence of such projects when queried, particularly in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.\n\nThe press conference primarily revolved around the revelation of documents that strongly hinted at the existence of **Project Aquarius**, a secretive project related to unidentified aerial objects (UFOs). It was emphasized that the denial of these projects was misleading, as evidence indicated otherwise. One significant piece of evidence was a telex dated November 17, 1980, which explicitly mentioned the existence of **Project Aquarius** and its involvement with UFO investigations.\n\nFurthermore, the conference highlighted key documents from the National Security Agency (NSA) that acknowledged **Project Aquarius's** existence, further substantiating claims made during the press conference. One document, dated March 3, 1986, explicitly stated that **Project Aquarius** did not deal with unidentified aerial objects.\n\nAdditionally, the speakers detailed incidents at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where unauthorized aerial objects (UAOs) were observed. These UAOs, commonly referred to as UFOs, were witnessed by military personnel and civilian observers landing near strategic military installations. The incidents included visual sightings and radar confirmations of these mysterious objects.\n\nThe press conference called for transparency and urged responsible senators and congressmen to approve congressional hearings to investigate these incidents fully. The presenters argued that the American public had the right to know about these events, especially given the potential national security implications. They emphasized that the truth about these UAOs should be disclosed to ensure informed decision-making in a democratic society.\n\nIn conclusion, this press conference was a pivotal moment in advocating for the disclosure of information related to UFOs and **Project Aquarius**, challenging government agencies' denial of their existence and highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability in these matters.",

She and her twin brother, Everett, were playing in front of their house when they noticed a strange object in the sky that resembled a small cloud. As they watched, the object approached from the north, flying at a low altitude. It appeared to slow down, circle around an old fairground, and then pass by Grant School before stopping near some electrical poles. At this point, the object emitted a series of colored lights, including red, blue, green, and ecru.\n\nThe ecru light, in particular, was very bright and forced Esther to cover her closed eyes. After a few minutes, the spotlight turned off, and the object moved closer to the electric poles. It then ascended high into the sky before descending slowly and landing on the other side of the railroad tracks. At this point, the object, which was approximately the height of a telephone pole, emitted four lights and a pillar of light. When Esther looked away briefly and then back, the UFO had disappeared.\n\nDespite her account of the event, no one believed Esther at the time. It wasn't until June 1947 when she saw a picture of a UFO in a Sunday newspaper that she realized the object she had seen in 1923 was indeed a UFO. Esther never had another UFO sighting after this encounter.\n\nThis incident can be categorized as a typical close encounter of the first kind, where a witness observes a UFO at a relatively close distance. Notably, Esther was one of a pair of twins, which has led to speculation that the UFO crew might have been intrigued by the sight of identical human children, one male and one female.",

It took the Air Force three weeks to find the wreckage of Button’s A-10 Thunderbolt II, which had apparently crashed into a Colorado mountain side known as Gold Dust Peak. Investigative journalist William Warwick, inspired by an insider's revelation, delved into the case. The insider claimed to have been the person Button contacted before his disappearance, expressing concern about losing control of his aircraft. This led Warwick to investigate the possibility of Button's plane being remotely controlled by a clandestine group. He identified an uncontrolled airpark named Mogollon outside radar range, suggesting it might have been used for a covert operation. Warwick questioned whether Button had been lured there under false pretenses, thinking he was meeting a reporter, only to meet with foul play. The motive behind Button's and another pilot's deaths could be linked to their knowledge of classified information.\n\nWarwick emphasized the need for a thorough investigation into these incidents and the importance of protecting UAP whistleblowers who might have vital information.
