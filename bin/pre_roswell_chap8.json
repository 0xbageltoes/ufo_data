These objects remained perfectly still, and even after changing their viewing point to rule out optical illusions, the appearance remained consistent. Both objects performed intricate aerial maneuvers, with sharp turns and instant stops. Using equipment, the scientists estimated the altitude of these objects to be around 24,000 feet, with each object measuring approximately 450 feet in length and 75 feet in diameter. When one of the scientists aimed a polarized spotlight at an object, it responded with a bright flash, altered its altitude, then resumed its aerial display, achieving speeds up to 24,000 miles per hour.

One of the scientists, drawn towards the dome, recounted seeing two moving figures near it.

Suddenly, a ball seemed to explode, releasing a burst of blue sparks. Alarmed, the scientist fled, warning his colleague.

The surroundings suddenly illuminated brightly, prompting the boys to dismount their bicycles. They observed a large UFO hovering just above them, seemingly resting on power lines. The object seemed to struggle with descending further due to its position between shops. The boys had a clear view of it for about three minutes. Subsequent to this event, Australian newspapers reported multiple UFO sightings in nearby areas. (Chapter 8, Ref 341)",

The ship's log noted the UFO descended to around 100 feet, projecting a brilliant white light from below, and followed the ship at a half-mile distance.

The mast emitted a strange pulsating purple light that covered the object and nearby ground. The businessman observed multiple individuals, totaling 11, near the UFO. These individuals wore white overalls, transparent helmets, black boots, gloves, and belts. The women had ashen-colored hair, while the men wore black caps. The beings appeared sunburned. One guard had a black box hanging from his neck, which seemed to drain the battery of the witness's forehead lamp upon being directed at him.

From it emerged several creatures resembling praying mantises, wearing form-fitted silver-gray attire. One creature approached the boy, took his book, placed its hands on his shoulder, and communicated telepathically, instructing him not to look up as they departed. When the boy eventually looked up, the UFO was ascending rapidly, pursued ineffectively by four military planes. The other boy seemed in a daze, and the boy had to guide him away from the creek.
