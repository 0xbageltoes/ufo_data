(cf. April 1946) Howard Menger meets a young girl who resembles the "Stein Girl". Later he realizes that Marla is actually reincarnated and is his soul double. He then remembers a previous life with her. He creates a group of which he is the spiritual leader. Like Angelucci and Van Tassel, he prepares people for future extraterrestrial contacts.

The witness, a painter, wishes to keep the strictest anonymity. In the month of March 1955, occupied in painting a landscape, he saw a circular aluminum-colored craft slow down and descend vertically from the clearing where the easel was set up. The craft had 8 to 10 m in diameter, topped with a dome, and landed 50 m from the witness. A kind of door opened slowly and he saw a person descend, dressed in a gray or light brown suit, wearing a helmet. After looking more closely he realized that this being was a woman, of great beauty, with blond strands protruding from the lower and side edges of the helmet. She looked at him smiling, took a few steps, but stayed 5 or 6 m from her craft. The woman picked up a number of small stones which she arranged two by two on the ground between him and her. There were 10 pairs of stones. She pointed her index finger at him, at her, and at the first pair of stones. She pointed to the other pairs of stones and pointed to herself, and to different points on the horizon. The witness thought he understood that she had established contacts with 10 different people.<br/><br/>He expressed his desire to visit the craft, but she answered with incomprehensible words and it seemed to him that she promised to return three days later. The witness returned wondering if he had dreamed. He was nevertheless at the rendezvous on the 3rd day and the mysterious woman as well. In March and April she returned 7 times, but it was only the last time that the witness was able to visit the craft. She also agreed to the request made each time by the witness to leave him something tangible, a proof. That day he received a kind of cylindro-conical object shining like aluminum, 45 cm long, 20 cm wide at the large base and 6 to 8 cm in the small one. It weighed about 2.5 kg. When held in the hand the metal turned into a kind of glass or opalescent material. In short it was an extremely powerful long-range view, requiring no focusing, allowing to see clearly even at 17 kilometers.
<br/><br/>Shortly after the investigator visited the witness, he became ill and had to flee, pursued by 4 men in black, who gave him no peace. The witness literally "disappeared". (vog: which is still the most elegant way for a fiction author to get out of trouble ... and avoid an investigation.) (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out on the S.V." - FLEUVE NOIR 1956 - p. 245 to 253)

At around 9 o'clock, the witness and his wife were driving slowly up a hill near the highest point in the area. Through the leafless trees, he saw a strange object on the ground 10 meters from the road. The object was a strange mass of fairly bright colors, mixed with blue, green, and gray, with a dome resembling mica, slightly translucent, topped with a red cone, the tip pointing upwards. The bottom of the craft was hidden by the grass. In front of this thing, beings wearing tall hats, 80 to 90 cm high and of various colors, were maneuvering. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

Mr. Droguet, residing at the girls' college, found himself upon returning from the cinema around 11:45 pm (0:15?), in the presence of a craft, stationary at 1.50 m from the ground, in the courtyard of this school establishment. Paralyzed by surprise, or by a blue-green ray that illuminated him immediately, he distinguished two small humanoids, dressed in diving suits with helmets, one of which was taking samples of the large gravel in the courtyard alley. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 92)
(...) "Under the craft I distinguished a black hole from which hung a kind of metal ladder with only a few rungs. When they went back up I distinctly heard a metal noise coming from their soles and the ladder. When they were inside it was raised. I then felt a kind of suction. The craft, still lit, rose higher. It was circular and seemed to turn on itself. In the center there was the black hole that I had noticed and which seemed motionless. When the craft was higher than the trees, everything went out and I saw nothing more. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Facing the Extra-terrestrials" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 142, 143)

My mother saw it first. She was working in the garden, pulling weeds and tending to her flowers. She was about to put away her tools to go and prepare the afternoon coffee, a sacred tradition in our family. She must have shouted to get our attention as my father and I were in the attic, where he had his workshop. He was busy and didn't find the event important enough to come down. I rushed to the window which faced south, but I couldn't make out anything unusual; I tumbled down the three floors and joined my mother in the garden: that's when I saw it. What I observed was a grey metallic cigar or maybe a disc seen from the side, with a transparent bubble on top. It had the apparent size of a full Moon and it hovered silently in the sky above the Saint Maclou church. I don't remember seeing it leave. My mother told me that the object went away leaving behind it like flakes of a white substance (...) The next day I met my friend Philippe at school, we were revising together for the baccalaureate exams. He mentioned having seen the same strange object from his house less than a kilometer away from my position, on a higher ground. He had observed it through binoculars and confirmed my description".

R. Hunnicut was driving at 4 o'clock in the morning towards Loveland and in the lights of his headlights he suddenly saw what seemed to be three men kneeling on the right side of the road. Thinking there was an injured person, he stopped to offer his help. He then discovered that these silhouettes were not human, about 90 cm tall, gray in color, including their clothing. These clothes seemed very tight and stretched on the chest "crookedly" which seemed abnormally strong on the right side and protruding from the shoulder to the armpit. To this bulbous part hung a slender arm that seemed much longer than the arm on the other side. The legs and feet were not discernible, hidden in the vegetation, but the witness had the impression of "something bagged." The head reminded him of "a frog face" especially because of the mouth, a thin line cutting across the smooth and gray face. The eyes had no eyebrows, the nose was indistinct, the top of the skull gave the impression of painted hair, apparently consisting of rolls of fat running horizontally from the top of the eyes, over and around the entire head. The one in the middle of the three had appeared first with an arm raised above his head and seemed to hold a dark chain or stick that emitted blue-white sparks. When the witness approached, the entity lowered the object to his ankle. (...) One of the creatures made a gesture that the witness understood as a defense to get closer.

Mrs. Wesley Symmonds of Cincinnati was driving through Stockton towards Florida and saw four creatures with "stalked eyes" near the road. Her drawing shows small bipeds with thin arms, large eyes, and pointed chins. The two in the background seem to be turning away, a third was bent over what seemed to be a stick held in its hand, and the fourth had its right arm raised and was facing forward. It had large protuberant eyes, something resembling a cap on its head, no visible mouth, a long pointed nose, and a chin that ended in a sharp point. Its long arms ended in appendages resembling claws. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 181)

Three young people arrive in Melbourne with what they say is a photo of an entity. A bright object had fallen from the sky. They searched and found chipped, shining metal pieces and 50 meters in front of them, there was a moving silhouette. From behind it looked like a toad, and from the front it seemed humanoid. Some sort of green slime hung from its knees. Its feet and hands seemed to be covered in a sheet metal armor. Photos would have (would have, this conditional deserves special attention...) been taken just before the thing disintegrated in front of their eyes.

flying low above his house. The object discharged a dark, reddish-brown, liquid substance which burned his arms and hands. A peach tree above which the object was located was found dead the
next day, with the leaves and stems curled up, as if having suffered extreme frost. Plant samples and liquid were submitted to the AFOSI of the Air Force at Wright Patterson, who warned the witness a few days later that it was a violent poison.

RR3 - Evening, 7 adult witnesses and 4 children, duration: 4 hours
(...) One of the witnesses had seen a UFO land in a ravine near the Sutton farm. When he returned he told his adventure. He was gently mocked and no one thought about it anymore. An hour had not passed when the dog started barking violently in the yard. Two of the men in the house went to the back door to see what was going on. A small luminous man with huge eyes, his arms raised above his head "as if he was being robbed" was slowly approaching the house. In this region, the material level of the witnesses and the social contingencies mean that they shoot first and talk afterwards. The two men did not fail to follow the rule, one pointing a 22 long rifle and the other a hunting rifle. They fired together when the "ufonaut" was no more than about six meters away from them. The shots echoed, they say, exactly as if they had been fired into a bucket. The visitor had a sudden jerk and immediately disappeared into the night. Soon another visitor showed up at the window and was likewise greeted with rifle shots. The wire mesh that protects the window still bears the mark (the bullet pierced it) of this defense against the invader.<br/><br/>The men then went out to see if they had killed the intruder, and as the first in line had momentarily stopped under a small projection of the roof, those who followed him saw a clawed hand descend to touch his hair. New shots, this time directed against the creature on the roof and against another one noticed in a nearby tree. This last one was apparently hit directly but it floated to the ground and ran away. Not much can unsettle a Kentucky farmer more than the inefficiency of his firearms and soon the whole family had barricaded themselves in the house. From time to time the visitors showed up again at the windows. About three hours later the family unanimously decided that the siege had lasted long enough and the eleven occupants of the house piled into two cars and raced into town to alert the police. It was 11 o'clock at night. Given that it certainly takes a great stimulation for a family of eleven people to cram into two cars, cover a dozen kilometers at full speed and come to ask for the help of the police, one can judge the terror of the Suttons. They returned to the farm accompanied by policemen who scrutinized the place, pointed their spotlights in all directions, made a great noise, but found nothing. (J.

10:55 p.m. Sgt.

The object is described as something resembling an airplane engine, but emitting sparks and surrounded by a reddish glow. The object is seen descending from 100 to 300 feet, then rising vertically. At times it would tilt to the side, as if having difficulty maintaining its hover. The Atomic Energy Commission launched an investigation. (The Cincinnati Post 8-26-55) Witnesses observe three fighter planes engaging in a dogfight with three circular UFOs, with no damage to either party.

Mrs. Dejean, living in the Gironne district, was busy putting the hook on the window of her bedroom around 10 pm when she saw two objects on the ground in a meadow near the Ayguecau stream, resembling eggshells with beautiful lights. Next to these objects were two beings about 90 cm tall, bald headed.
Mr. Dejean got up, watched the spectacle and took his gun to go warn the neighbors. The dog barked and immediately the two craft flew away quickly.

A group of children aged 4 to 14 had seen saucers and little men. One boy said he was climbing a tree when the first of a series of saucers arrived. A silver arm waved at him, he said, and "I began to float in space from the roof of a house". How did he get to that roof? "He sort of slid in there". Other children in the group had seen the boy fall straight off the roof, landing on his head but not getting hurt. Another child said he saw a man about 90 cm tall come out of a saucer that had landed in the nearby field. The creature had a "big red mouth, big red eyes and four diamond-shaped things where his nose should have been". Another boy said he saw a strange man carrying two guns with which he paralyzed two of the boys. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of the Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 183)

At 9:55 PM, Mr. Kolesnikof was leaning in a ditch to ease his back pain. Suddenly it became bright and in a clearing of the forest, he saw a flying rocket whose luminosity spread over a radius of about 1000 meters. At the front, the rocket was veiled by a reddish halo, on the side a brief jet of luminous lines of various colors, on the right side 3 rows of portholes: 25, 26 and again 25, making 76 portholes lit from the inside. Two curious wings in the shape of half crescents arched towards the front from which three precise points emitted luminous arcs of different colors, at a precise cadence. The craft moved slowly and silently at 10 meters above the tall oaks. It could measure 375 to 400 meters. A streak of fire came out of the end of the rocket, three times the length of the craft. The wind that had been blowing strongly a few minutes before had completely stopped. Mr. Kolesnikof saw 3 wild boars brush past him: they fled the trajectory of the object. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

Near Boisseuges an unusual whistling sound attracted the attention of the young shepherd M. Frigoul at around 6 pm. He saw a dark mass descend from the sky. A strong gust of wind made him fall. The object measured 3.50 m in length and 2 m in height. It looked like a machine with an opening from which he saw a staircase. There were two occupants. One of them had a red face, a bald head and very small teeth. They picked some plants and flew off to the northwest. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronique des apparitions E.T." DENOEL 1972 - coll.

USA, (New York)
This observation took place in the night of September 16 to 17, 1955, at the Titicus Reservoir in the Northern Westchester County, state of New York. I reproduce this account, word for word as it appeared in the magazine of a New York organization called Civilian Saucer Intelligence (Civil Intelligence Service on Flying Saucers), extremely serious, but which unfortunately was dissolved 10 years ago (1969). "The couple arrived at the lake to fish for perch with a spoon shortly before midnight. Around 1:30, they were in a small cove on the north shore of the lake, which is about 5 km long and which is oriented east to west. Mrs. Bordes was rowing while her husband was untangling the fishing lines. For the first time in their lives, they had not caught a single fish. It was pitch black; there was no moon, and the clouds hid the stars. At this moment, Mrs. Bordes saw a strange object rise out of the water between the boat and the shore, at a distance of only a few meters. It was a luminous pink sphere - at least seen from above it appeared spherical - about the size of a basketball, with darker plates.<br/><br/>The object rose about thirty centimeters and then fell back into the water with a loud splash. Mr. Bordes, standing at the back and his back turned, thought that a big fish had jumped. Mrs. Bordes is a rather more intrepid than average young woman who likes to fish and hunt at night, but the spectacle was so abnormal that it scared her; she took up the oars and rowed straight to the shore. Her husband, still absorbed in his task, swore and protested, until suddenly he also saw something. He whispered: "Shh! I think I see a phenomenon!" Mrs. Bordes, petrified, then saw the "phenomenon" too. About 200 meters southeast, towards the middle of the lake and apparently floating on its surface, two parallel lights shone, like fluorescent tubes of a bluish white. They had a wavy but rigid shape; they did not undulate. Their length seemed twice that of a 5 m boat. Above these "serpents" there was a less bright round light, and of a more yellowish white. Much smaller than a full moon, and less bright than a car headlight, at a distance of 200 m it appeared to be the size of a basketball. It did not hover in the air but was apparently attached to a solid body, visible only intermittently as a grayish shape in the darkness. They were able to observe that this round light was regularly eclipsed on one side and then became round again, giving a very clear impression of a rotating lighthouse; and if it did not project a visible beam, they could see each other when the light shone towards them.

Richard Price, 8 years old, was playing with a friend near the Troy cemetery. The children heard a surprising noise: like a steam locomotive. They walked in that direction, but the little girl, scared, stopped. Richard continued alone, saw a small ET in military uniform with a belt and transparent helmet approaching and allowed himself to be taken aboard a hexagonal-shaped vessel where he witnessed a special projection: a kind of interactive virtual reality. He discovered an orange planet, ETs, the variety of their ships and witnessed a battle between two galactic fleets. The film allowed him to participate in the events. Then he was taken to another room where he underwent a medical examination and an implant was inserted into his sex. (...) In 1989, the implant broke: part of it was expelled through the skin, then the rest came out two days later. At MIT, Professor Pritchard was interested in it: the implant would be metallic, coated with a biological material. After a while, Pritchard announced that the implant was not metallic but organic: 90% carbon, traces of oxygen and nitrogen...

(cf. 1954; Vienna) Wanderka is on a motorbike in a place called Arbesthal, he is following a forest path. He notices something very bright through the trees. Curious, he continues on foot, the engine in his hand and finds a metallic saucer, 2.50m high and 10 to 12m wide in a grassy clearing. All around the object is smooth and metallic and no windows appear. Yet there is an opening, square, 2m on each side, from which a ramp of 4m in length emerges. Inside everything is lit up, Wanderka takes courage and crosses the ramp. Inside there are 6 people, all about 1.80m tall, with beautiful smooth faces like those of children. They are wearing grey matte suits: the fabric is smooth, it does not show any weaving. There are no buttons or other seams on the uniforms. The whole thing is one piece. The people are blond and have mid-length hair, around the neck the opening of the suit is round, without opening. The place is lit up by indirect light as he does not see any lamps. Wanderka does not see any structure, yet he supposes that behind the people there must be a wall. A bit surprised to find himself facing these people, Wanderka apologizes for his intrusion. He gives his identity and address. One of the group responds to him: "According to the standards on Earth, we are from somewhere around Cassiopeia." Very surprised, Wanderka asks them how it is that they speak German so well. And the answer comes: "We have learned it." The voice is almost feminine, like that of some mature women. Yet they have a slight foreign accent. As a good socialist, Wanderka asks them what they are doing here, after having explained to them the political system in his country. The extraterrestrials tell him that at their place there is no longer any class division. Wanderka asks them if they can intervene to change certain things on Earth. To his astonishment they answer him: "You, people of the Earth, must solve your problems yourselves." Wanderka then describes to them the situation in the world, the famine in some countries, the social injustice in his own, in such vibrant terms, that the extraterrestrials start to cry. Moved to see their grief, Wanderka does not know what to do, he bids them farewell, the extraterrestrials respond with a small bow. Wanderka takes his motorbike and leaves.

FRANCE, Barre des Cévennes (Lozère)
Two gendarmes, MM. Barboule and Simon, were coming from Cassagnac around 01:00 in the night and were pushing their bicycles up a small hill. They then heard a noise that was getting louder, like that of a truck engine. Above them appeared a craft of about ten meters in diameter. They could make out some sort of nozzles from which short, reddish glows were escaping. At the same time, an extremely violent hot breath pressed them against the wall of a building next to which they had stopped. The craft landed a little further away on a flat piece of land. Shortly afterwards, a white ball emerged from the upper dome and, at a low speed, made two laps around the Castelai hill, then returned to the craft, passing silently 50 meters away from the gendarmes, who were still pressed - out of fear? - against the wall. Meanwhile, four figures had come out of the craft and were moving around. Shortly after the ball's return to the craft, the figures got on board. The takeoff was immediate, with a deafening noise, but without any glows or flames. The inhabitants of Barre des Cévennes had been woken up that night by a loud noise above their heads.

(cf: June 1946, High Bridge) Starting in March 1956, Howard Menger took care of welcoming the extraterrestrials who were to stay on Earth: their hair had to be cut, they had to be provided with clothes and informed about Earth customs. They brought their own dried food and mainly ate fruits, vegetables and whole wheat bread. They had previously learned the language of the country they were going to live in, thanks to an impressive linguistic transformer-converter, both visually and audibly, to their brain cells. Through this system they could assimilate 3 languages in one week. (following July 4th 1956) (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "The Enigma of the E.T." - ed. Guy Trédaniel 1995, p. 146)

Around 3 o'clock in the night Major Cunningham of the USAF and Sgt. Lovette were outside in a sand dune field, looking for debris after a missile test. At a certain moment Sgt. Lovette was behind a dune and out of sight when Major Cunningham heard him scream, a scream of terror or agony. Cunningham thought Lovette had been bitten by a snake and running towards the scream, he saw Lovette being carried away in what appeared to him to be a silver disc, hovering 3 to 5 meters in the air. Major Cunningham described what appeared to him as a long object, like a flexible tube, wound around Lovette's legs and carrying him away in the disc. Cunningham watched helplessly as the disc quickly disappeared into the sky. He ran to the jeep and reported the incident by radio to Missile Control, who confirmed a radar echo. A search party was organized to find Lovette and Cunningham was admitted to the White Sands dispensary for observation. The search for Lovette lasted three days, and eventually his naked body was found 10 miles from the disappearance site. The body was mutilated: tongue excised, incision under the chin extended to the larynx and esophagus. He was emasculated and enucleated, the anus was excised and part of the colon. Completely exsanguinated corpse. Nearby were birds of prey, which no doubt had been fighting over the corpse, dead themselves. Death apparently dated back two days. At first Cunningham was suspected of having killed Lovette, but then he was acquitted. (prepared and reported by John Lear - USA)

Professor Joao de Freitas Guimaraes was walking along the bay between 7:10 and 7:15 PM and had sat down on the sand. Suddenly the water became clearer in the strait between Bela Island and Sao Sebastiao, then a jet of water rose up and he saw a round craft heading towards the bay. There it dropped an anchor made of a rope with spheres. Two men jumped out of the craft and came towards him. They had the appearance of human beings. They were quite tall (1.75m), fair-skinned, with long hair, wearing a one-piece green suit. They had light eyes and a sharp gaze. (...) So he got on board. The conversation was held telepathically. (...) When he returned, his watch had stopped, but he thought the journey had lasted 30 or 40 minutes. (Perrin Jack R. "The Mystery of UFOs" - J'ai Lu/Pygmalion 1976 pp. 59-65) Joao Freitas de Guimaraes is a professor of Law at the Catholic University of Santos. In May 1956 he was in Sao Sebastian, called for a military justice case. (...) they had long blond hair, fair skin, thin eyebrows and clear, calm eyes. Their green suit covered their feet and hands. The professor asked them if they had a breakdown in the machine: no answer. He repeated his question in French, English and Italian, with no more success. He had the impression that they wanted to show him around the machine and he followed them. On board there was a third person. [followed by a similar sequence as in Perrin, with telepathic conversation and warning against atomic dangers] (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

Roland X. was cycling and when he came out of a hollow path around 6 o'clock in the morning, he saw a bright object on the ground, which resembled a miner's leather hat. The main body, whose darkest part was hidden by vegetation, was topped with a kind of cockpit. He observed without daring to approach. Suddenly he saw a gray, robustly-shouldered being, the size of a 9-year-old child, wearing a diving suit, who was moving without haste. He disappeared from the witness's sight without him being able to say how. Then the object rose, described a spiral, inclined and moved away in absolute silence. The witness said that between the object and him there was an energy that paralyzed him and forced him to turn away his gaze. Afterwards he had difficulty pedaling. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 225)

(cf: March 1956, USA) Howard Menger is invited to board a saucer, rises to 1500 m and observes everything that is happening below through a powerful magnifying lens. Then he does a teleportation experiment, round trip of 13 km from there, which lasts about 15 minutes (follow-up: 1956, second week of August) (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "The Mystery of the E.T." - ed.

Complex series of visual and radar observations, both from the ground and from aircraft, for nearly six hours. The UFOs are sometimes isolated, sometimes in a flight formation. Sometimes they are stationary, sometimes they move at very high speed, or else play cat and mouse with the fighters (aircraft) (Science et Vie, special edition 1997: 50 years of UFO, Atlas of Unsolved Cases, pp. 60-63). The magazine Astronautics and Aeronautics published a study of the case by Thayer, the Condon Commission's radar expert, in September 1971. For the record, let us note that on several occasions, and notably in 1976, Philippe Klass, editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology, attempted to criticize these works and reduce the case to a series of ordinary events (meteors, radar propagation anomalies, etc.). The incidents began at Bentwaters Base, preceded between 9 and 10 pm by unusual radar control approach observations, which we will not detail. (...) Thayer concluded his article in the Astronautics and Aeronautics magazine thus: "Considering the high credibility of the information and the coherence and continuity of the reports, as well as their high degree of 'strangeness', this UFO case is certainly one of the most troubling known to date. ('COMETA Report, 1999)

Ms. P. was riding a moped around noon when she was overtaken by two enormous nickel-plated motorcycles, absolutely silent. Each was ridden by two sumptuously dressed passengers wearing a moiré fawn-colored jacket. They were gloved, helmeted and hermetically booted. Five hundred meters further on the two motorcycles were stopped side by side in the middle of the road, blocking it. Ms. P. had to pass them on the extreme left despite the lack of space, as the machines were enormous, of an unusual size. The travelers turned towards her. Their faces were totally hidden by thick smoked glasses: neither cheeks nor chins were visible. The witness, very impressed, looked back ten meters further on, but the road was deserted, the motorcycles had disappeared without a sound.

(cf: 1955, same place) For 10 days Howard Menger and his group prepared for a trip to the Moon. In September 1956 it took place. (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998) (cf: 1956, August, second week) Howard Menger is taken in a much larger craft which circles Venus and shows him its surface from 30 m high, like in a kind of 3D movie. Still in September he is taken to the Moon, after a 10-day one-way trip in a saucer, the necessary time to subject his organism to a treatment allowing him to adapt to the vibrational frequency of our satellite. He takes pictures, collects moonstone and visits the underground installations. Howard Menger gives lectures and writes books to expose what he experienced.

An ex-sheriff, out hunting, had an encounter with a small man of 1.2m in height, who appeared to be entirely human. He was wearing a red and gold cape, tight green trousers, a gold-coloured jacket, and small boots. There were no buttons or other fastenings on the clothing. After a minute of facing each other, the small being ran towards a pile of gravel and disappeared. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 360)

FRANCE, Le Houlme
At around 11:20 PM, Mr. Follon was riding his Solex and was about to cross Barentin when he saw a bright light, resembling a barn fire. As he crossed the town, he saw nothing, but on the hill a strong light was visible again in the direction of the St Jean du Cardonnay plateau. He decided to go and see. He then saw along the N 13bis (Le Havre-Rouen) 8 to 10 people hidden behind the plane trees. At 60 m there was the saucer, hovering 80 cm above the ground (diameter 12 to 13m, height 9m, antenna on the top). 3 to 4 human-shaped silhouettes visible through the 35x50 cm windows seemed to be doing some work. From underneath the small antenna, gray-green flames of about 10 cm were coming out. After 10 minutes, these flames grew to approximately 7m, and a very powerful beacon illuminated 300m to the south. The noise produced by this device became very loud, as the witness, who was a bit deaf, could hear it very well. The craft rose at an angle of 45° for 500 m and then disappeared at the speed of our jet planes. The witness was troubled for 15 to 20 hours after this observation. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 228)

Around midnight, the two witnesses in the car, near a chestnut tree, were stopped by a "breakdown" of the engine. The driver got out and examined it. Suddenly he shouted, and the two witnesses tumbled into the ditch near the cornfield to hide. About 200 m above them was a huge silent mass, like the volume of a five-story house. After 5 minutes a light shot out from the edge and it unrolled like a rope ladder, slowly, to sweep the area. The surroundings were lit up but had distorted colors. The witnesses stayed crouched for an hour and a half, with this thing above them. Suddenly the craft rose vertically and disappeared in the direction of the Loire. (J.C. BOURRET: "La nouvelle vague des S.V." - France Empire 1975, pp. 73-77)

NORWAY, near Lake Gjersjoen
Trygve Jansen and Mrs. Buflot were in the car in the evening and were driving towards Ski from Oslo. At the Gjersjoen bridge an object came at great speed, flew over the lake for a moment and returned towards the road. At one point the light followed the car, approached it 6 or 7 times and the occupants were scared. As the road left the lake, the object suddenly flew in front of the car, stopped above the road. Jansen braked, but the car stopped abruptly, all by itself, and when it stopped moving the object slowly approached it by descending. Right in front of the car the object stopped again, then suddenly rose into the air at a prodigious speed and disappeared vertically. When the object was in front of them, the witnesses had a tingling sensation on their faces. When they arrived home Mrs. Jansen noticed that the car, normally a dull beige, was of a sparkling greenish color. The next day it had its normal color again. The two witnesses did not feel well, but this sensation disappeared the next day. The saucer was a shiny disc with wings. It seemed to rotate on itself and at its top it had a kind of dome, the bright color emanating from it was pale green. It spread in waves and at times this light illuminated the whole forest. (B. Le Poer Trench - 1960: "The People of the Sky" - I have read - p. 124 to 126)

ARGENTINE, Desert of Atacama
Inhabitants of these sparsely populated Andean regions reported in 1956 the presence of strange giants on the snowy slopes of Mount Macon (over 6000 meters) where huge tracks had been discovered in the snow. A year earlier, a huge cigar-shaped craft had been seen flying over the region; it was reported to have landed in the Cordillera or crashed against a peak. Furthermore, large quantities of condors and eagles were found dead, and many of their nests were ravaged and destroyed in the same region where the giant footprints had appeared.

A 12-year-old girl lost consciousness immediately after feeling herself floating above the ground. She woke up in a very large room in the company of two men in silver suits. Again she lost consciousness and later she was found in a paddock, where other witnesses had just seen a flying saucer. (Keith Basterfield - Ufora)

(cf: 1954) 18 months after the observation of the saucer, Elisabeth Klarer sees it again in the same place. She runs to meet the man who had come out of the craft and they embrace. She recognizes him as her soul mate. He is a tall blond, close to two meters tall, and he wears a cream-colored garment. He has gray eyes and high cheekbones like Asians. Both of them board the saucer and settle on a cross-shaped couch. His name is Akon and he comes from another solar system. They take off and position themselves near a mothership. Akon tells her that she is his soul mate and that she will give birth to a son for him (note from vog: a vein at 45 past!). Originating from Venus, Akon's race lives somewhere in the outskirts of Proximus of Centaurus, on the new planet Meton. (...) Eight months later Akon comes to fetch Elisabeth and she gives birth to a boy, Ayling, on the planet Meton. (...) In the meantime (note from vog: it is not said how long) her son Ayling is himself the commander of a space ship. (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

The objects were visually observed by three air traffic controllers
and by the director of operations who was in the city to
monitor an air mission. They were also tracked on radar
by N.C.O.I.C. and by G.C.A. for three to five minutes. They were about
10 km behind an airliner and moving twice as fast. One of the objects split into two and another one made a 180° turn. Identification requested by I.F.F.: no response. The light spot on the radar screen was about the same size as that of a B-47. The objects seemed to remain stationary and then suddenly accelerate and shoot away. (J.

SOUTH AFRICA (unspecified location)
..."a remarkable letter from an Englishwoman living in South Africa. Her
house was situated high on a hill above a large valley with a river
running through it. One night in February 1957, she saw a 'Moon'
moving and emitting multiple flashes. She got out of bed and went to
another room where she opened the window overlooking the valley. The
'Moon' moved towards the house with a rapid zigzag motion, changing
shape to become a golden oval balloon, flying above the roofs. She
smelled a smell similar to that of an overheated radio. At one point
the phenomenon passed behind a tree: the object was then visible in
part from each side of the trunk. It disappeared at great speed."

The witness saw a UFO at a distance of less than 150 m, around 2 pm. First through the back window of his house on the road to Great Meadows, then from the back yard. The weather was clear, under a low cloud ceiling. First the dogs barked and looked at the object. Its shape resembled a top hat, with a rounded cap of 9 to 12 m high, a horizontal diameter of at least 15 m above a slightly upturned edge protruding at least 3.50 m to 4.50 m at the bottom of the cap. This edge appeared smooth, completely sealed, slightly curved, without openings or portholes, or bays, or slots of any kind, nor on the rest of the object of a uniformly white, dull, clean, texture reminiscent of pipe clay. A moderate northeast breeze was blowing, and the object remained hovering almost stationary, like a boat at anchor, swaying. At the same rhythm and at the same time it emitted a rumble or buzz that increased and decreased regularly. Under the object he seemed to see, not to see, to see again, strips or filaments of a material that sparkled like Christmas tree garlands. Suddenly, with a slight suction noise, the object rose almost vertically, obliquely towards the northeast through the cloud layer, where it ceased to be visible. (J.

RR2. Around 3:00 PM, three witnesses (two elderly women: Mmes Garcin and Rami and independently of them an apiarist Louis Boglio), duration: 1 to 2 minutes. It seems that a curious metallic machine in the shape of a spinning top and about 1.50 m high landed on a road about a hundred meters from two old French peasants. At the same time, a deafening noise of shaken metal rose from a metal signpost planted 6 or 7 meters from the landing area. This sign had been shaken by violent shocks. A man who was about 300 m away heard the women's cries and the crash of the sign. He arrived in time to see the spinning top jump from the ground to a height of 6 meters, turn and land again this time on another road, branching off the first. While it was turning, it flew over another signpost, and this one vibrated just as loudly, as if it had been violently shaken by successive blows. However, the machine was absolutely silent. It did not pass close to a third sign that was in the vicinity. The compass placed near the signs that had vibrated showed a deviation of some 15°. (J. Allen HYNEK: "Les OVNI, mythe ou réalité?" - trad. Belfond 1974 - p. 141, 163 to 165, 277) (Science et Vie, special edition 1997: 50 years of UFO, Atlas of Unsolved Cases, p. 60 to 63) Yet one who has some aeronautical knowledge will find strange resemblances between this UFO and a small French helicopter, used since 1954. This is the SO-1221, better known as the Djinn. (...) EDF will use the SO1221 as the Bell47 for its line surveillance. (...) aerial prospecting for mining could justify a low-level flight. The region is known for its bauxite mines from which aluminum is extracted. In this period of the 1950s, France was looking for uranium on its territory (and elsewhere) to ensure its nuclear future. (...) in the May 1958 issue of Transmondia, pages 22 to 24, the proof that in May 1957 (date cited in the article!) people from the Var and the Alpes Maritimes were able to observe Djinns from the Hélicoptère Service Briand of St Raphael flying over their region at low altitude (between 0 and 300m).

At 8 o'clock in the morning, while driving his 404 van, Mr. Senes was about to take the last turns of the Grasse road. He was surprised to see that the top of the hill in front of him was brown, covered with dead leaves, although it was spring. This brown plate blocked the road. The witness felt the van braking, he shifted to third gear, the engine was stuttering, then to second gear and then he saw the brown plate moving backwards. It was at this moment that he saw the saucer-shaped craft taking off to the left of the road. The craft was rather blurry, the saucer was made of matte aluminum, some kind of rods connected an upper disk to a larger lower disk. (M. FIGUET/J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed.

The motorcyclist witness broke down on the road. He then saw at 15 m from the ground a disk of 20 m in diameter and 5 m thick and hid in a ditch. He saw the disk descend towards the ground and heard a sound similar to that of air escaping from a valve. It had a metallic blue-green appearance and some kind of elevator emerged at the base. Inside, a man of about 1 m 70 made a gesture of friendship to the witness. He was wearing a plastic suit. The motorcyclist was invited on board and discovered other people sitting in front of control panels. There was a splendid clarity. Then he was taken back and the disk flew off towards the northwest.

At 10:50 PM, Michel Fekete was riding his bicycle when he saw an object hovering 30 cm from the ground and next to him were 4 small men. The police found on the site fragments similar to lava. Six other witnesses confirmed this apparition, including Mr. and Mrs. Iklef and Lepot. The luminous object alternated between red and white pulsations, with the red phase being the longest. When it was white it was more blinding than a projector. It was 50 m away from the group of witnesses. The occupants were about 130 cm tall, with a gray-beige body and an abnormally large black head, they were swaying as they walked. The object flew away when a car arrived.

Miss Stichler was occupied in the barn at 6 o'clock in the morning, when she heard a turbine sound and looked up. A flat object, in the shape of a saucer, about 6 m in diameter with a ring of one meter in width, had appeared above the barn, at 4.50m from the ground. When it stopped, one side inclined towards her, she saw a man dressed in light gray with a very tight helmet and a wide cape of a shiny gray, perched on the ring of the UFO. His feet and legs seemed to be hidden from view in the lower part. He was facing Miss Stichler, seemed to be of average size, had very sunken eyes, a long face with a "mocking" expression and he was quite dark-skinned. At the very moment that Miss Stichler overcame the initial shock, the object moved towards the southeast with a "whirl" sound and disappeared from view at the speed of lightning.

The emotion was very strong when a group of five panicked young people recounted their encounter with a UFO. The craft had landed in a wheat field outside the town, rested on spherical landing gear and was pierced with a series of portholes. Samples of soil taken later emitted a phosphorescent glow. The wheat grains were healthier and more vigorous than the other ears around. An incredible increase in the size of insects was observed. A spider, by chance trapped in the container containing a sample of soil taken, presented a size ten times greater than normal. (A. SCHNEIDER-H. MALTHANER: "The Secret File of UFOs", ed.

Luciano Galli left his home at 2:20 PM to go to his workshop near Via Castiglione when a black Fiat 1100 stopped in front of him. Out of it came a tall, swarthy man with very black eyes but he had a face that inspired trust and invited friendliness. This man was wearing a double-breasted grey suit, a collar, a tie and spoke Italian fluently. At the wheel was another man in a light suit, he never spoke. This stranger asked Galli if he remembered him (which he did, he had already seen him a few times) and "Don't you want to come with us?" "Where?" "Have faith, nothing will happen to you." Galli got into the car. Around 2:30 PM they arrived at "il buco del Preto Santo" where a flying saucer was waiting. A bit scared, Galli entered it and was immediately "photographed" and went on a journey, seeing the earth move away and become small. Through the portholes he discovered the silhouette of an immense dirigible at least 600 m long. Through six small openings disks were entering and leaving. These openings were as big as hangars, each able to hold at least 50 disks. At least 500 people, men and women were there, wearing shiny plastic or silky materials. These people told him they were from Venus. He was back around 5:40 PM. He confirms that he made the journey with his physical body.

Another flying saucer crashed in the same Arizona desert,
after crossing the American territory at an incredible speed,
recorded on radar and estimated at more than 20,000 kilometers per hour.
The accident site was immediately surrounded by security services and four humanoid corpses were removed from the craft, with great difficulty as it was impossible to twist or cut the metal it was made of. The bodies of the humanoids were severely burned and it was impossible to distinguish their features, but their silver suits were absolutely intact, despite the terrible temperature that had burned the bodies. These corpses, which were about 1.20m long, were immediately sent to Wright Patterson where they are still kept cool, as well as the wreckage of their saucer, which is now in a shelter with several others.

During a training flight, Captain Lenos Ferreira saw a sparkling light point at a height of Granada, which changed from intense green to bright red. Behind him, the pilots of three other planes also spotted it. When Ferreira decided to head towards Cordoue, the UFO followed the squadron. The pursuit lasted 40 minutes. During this time, the object dropped four luminous rings that spread around the plane. The object and its satellites then made a dive, causing panic in the squadron. They disappeared shortly afterwards. The observation was marked by an interruption of the radio link. At the same time, the Coimbre Observatory recorded an abnormal variation of the magnetic field.

The Greatest Joke in the History of Science. In 1957, the whole world held its breath waiting for the American satellite. The "Project Vanguard" had received monstrous publicity. (...) But the triumph was for Moscow with the launch of Sputnik I, a 58 cm diameter ball weighing 83 kg. It contained a small radio emitter that sent signals through four long antennas and it turned around the Earth between 226 and 950 km of altitude at a speed of 28000 km/hour. As its trajectory surfaced most of the globe, it could be observed everywhere, at dawn or at dusk, while it was illuminated by the sun and the ground was in shadow. (Fell on January 4, 1958) ("Astronautics" Pierre Rousseau, Hachette 1965, p. 17) But at the same time as it, the last stage of the carrier rocket had been satellited too.

(following October 14) (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 125) It all started the night of October 5, 1957. There had been a dinner with friends at the farm, and we had gone to bed later than usual, at 11 o'clock. I was in my room with my brother, Joao Villas Boas. Because of the heat, I decided to open the shutters of the window, which overlooked the farm courtyard. That's when I saw, right in the center of the courtyard, a silver and fluorescent reflection, brighter than the moonlight, illuminating the whole ground around. It was a very white light, and I don't know where it came from. It was as if it had fallen from very high, like the light of a car headlight shining towards the ground and spreading its light all around. But in the sky, there was nothing visible, nothing from which the light could have come. I decided to call my brother and show it to him, but he is a very incredulous person, and he said it was better to go to bed. So I closed the shutters and we both lay down to sleep. But some time later, unable to overcome my curiosity, I opened the shutters again. The light was still there, in the same place. I kept watching. Then, suddenly, it started to move slowly towards my window. Quickly, I closed the shutters...so quickly that it made a loud noise and woke up my brother who was already asleep. Both of us, in the darkness of the room, watched the light enter through the small shutters of the shutters, then continue in the direction of the roof and shine on the tiles. There, finally, it went out and did not come back.

Fiji Islands, Nawaca
At three o'clock in the afternoon, four inhabitants of the Fiji Islands saw (...) a metallic object that began to descend from the sky in a gliding and silent flight. The four people were in a motorboat (...) one of the men proposed to approach to offer help if necessary. (...) the strange object was stationary at about 60 m above the water (...) it was describing a circle around a fixed point. (...) They distinguished the silhouette of a man inside the apparatus (...) and as soon as he became aware of the approach of the Fijians, he immediately directed a beam of light so powerful that not only were they blinded, but (...) very weak. (...) the boat pushed by the waves moved away to about 160 meters. At that moment the silhouette of the man disappeared and, at great speed, the object rose and was soon out of sight. (...)(Jean FERGUSON: "The Humanoids..." - ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1977, p.48, 49) (note from vog: the source of this information: New Zealand Herald of 21.10.1957)

Mrs. Yeager saw on the 9th of October, a bright circular object descend behind a hill. It flew away two minutes later. The next day, she was feeding the animals when a UFO appeared 2 m from the ground causing the animals to flee. Two small dark beings emerged and went into the woods. The object remained on the ground for two minutes then flew away. The search for the occupants was in vain. At the same time, a bus driver saw two craft in a field near the first landing site.

A door opened automatically on the object. Two people appeared, then two more, and then two more again, and finally a seventh one passed between the two groups formed by the first six. All of them watched the truck for three minutes. All these people looked like Earth men but they were of smaller size, had long hair on their shoulders and their clothes were luminous on the chest. When these little men looked at me I entered a state similar to a trance and I felt the strange sensation that they were telling me: "We come in a peaceful mission.."(Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 62,63) A Spanish naval officer Miguel Espanol and a companion, who were traveling by truck to Ceres, encountered a huge UFO. First high in the sky, bathing the whole region in light, the craft descended and made the truck stall. The craft had at least 170 m in width and 40 m in thickness, in an oval or saucer shape, with a long "antenna" coming out of its dome and topped with a red light. The hovering monster turned off all its lights and the two men saw seven small beings the size of a child, with long hair and dressed in luminous suits, appear in an open panel of the craft. They silently regarded each other for three minutes. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 121)

Between 9:30 and 10:00 PM, Antonio Villas Boas, working with another brother, tried unsuccessfully about twenty times to approach a dazzling white light that seemed to hover 100 meters above the field. It had the size of a truck wheel and projected rays in all directions. Finally it went out. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 125) The second episode occurred in the night of October 14. This must have happened between 9:30 and 10:00 PM, although I cannot guarantee it since I had no watch. I was working on the tractor, plowing a field, with my other brother. Suddenly, we saw a very bright light - so bright that it hurt the eyes - motionless at the northern end of the field. When we saw it, it was already there, large and round, about the size of a cart wheel. It seemed to be at an altitude of about 100 meters, and it was a red light, illuminating a large portion of the ground. There must have been something inside the light, but I cannot affirm it positively, because the light was much too strong for anything else to be seen. I called my brother so that we could go together to see what it was. He did not want to, so I went alone. When I got close to the thing, it suddenly started moving and, at an enormous speed, it passed to the south part of the field, where it stopped again (...)

Antonio Villas Boas was plowing the field alone, as usual, with a tractor. He saw a big red star among the others, it began to grow and came towards him, quickly, like a flash. It stopped 50 m above him, a shining object in the shape of an egg, so bright that the lights of the tractor headlights could no longer be seen. Villas Boas remained petrified with terror for two minutes. The object plunged towards the ground 10 m from the tractor. It was like a large elongated egg, with 3 long conical protuberances on the front in the shape of glowing rods, on the top a kind of flattened dome that kept turning slowly on the ground, at a terrifying speed in the air. The object landed on 3 telescopic feet. Villas Boas then tried to flee in the tractor, but the engine stopped, then on foot: he was taken by the arm by a small creature from which he quickly freed himself, but 3 others immobilized him by lifting him off the ground. Screaming and vainly writhing he was taken towards the UFO: the ascent of a frail staircase allowed a new fight, but he soon found himself in a square room, with polished metal walls. The door closed and he had to go into another oval room. It was furnished with a curious table and revolving armchairs. He was undressed and naked like a worm he saw another being approaching him who anointed him with a liquid with a sponge. He had to go into the next room: two other creatures took blood and skin samples from him at the sampling sites. He was left alone for half an hour in this room furnished only with a bed where he was invited to rest. He felt bad, plus there was a smell like burnt fabric, he wanted to vomit. A kind of gray smoke escaped from very many small tubes on the wall at the height of his head. Suddenly a "woman" enters. She is completely naked. She is of a different beauty than the women of the Earth, with long fine and soft blond hair and large almond-shaped blue eyes. She has a pointed chin and she takes him in her arms, makes him understand her desire. Villas Boas is surprised to be able to get sexual excitement and they lie down for a normal mating. After a short break, a new assault of desire and Villas does her honor. He felt like a stallion who had to improve the herd: the woman grunted and gave him the impression of being lying with an animal. They separated. Shortly afterwards, the woman left, his clothes were returned to him and nothing was missing. Then he had the advantage of taking a tour on the bridge and then he was signaled to go down. The object takes off. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on Humanoid ET" - Laffont 1977 - p. 125 to 132) A very close encounter, which could only be an invention intended to prove the virility of the hero.

(The names in the text are pseudonyms - the real names are known to the Brazilian ufology group) The young Laiz was dying of advanced stomach cancer. The night was terrible with suffering, the injections had no effect, and the whole family was gathered around the dying one. Suddenly a strong light illuminated the right side of the house. The sister of the patient went to the window: there was a saucer there. Through a hatch two small beings came out. The beings entered, they were the size of a ten-year-old child, with long blond-red hair, elongated eyes like the Chinese, dressed in white. The back, wrists and chest shone. They approached Laiz's bed who groaned in pain with wide open eyes. No one spoke. The two little men arranged the things they carried on the bed, made a gesture to the father of the family who began to tell them the whole case of Laiz, without words, by telepathy. The men then illuminated the girl's belly with a white light: everyone saw the inside of the belly. With an instrument that made a squeaking sound pointed at the stomach, everyone saw the ulcer. It lasted a small half hour. Miss Laiz fell asleep and the beings left, not without having communicated to the father the medicine to be administered for a month. They gave him a hollow ball that contained thirty small white pills: she had to take one a day. Miss Laiz was really cured and on May 14 the governess sent this testimony to Dr. Olavo Texeira Fontes.

Two sentinels of the Itaipu fort were on patrol when they saw an orange light coming from the sea increasing in size. As they watched, their amazement turned to terror as the object came directly above them, hovering at a height of 100 meters. Its diameter was at least equal to the wingspan of a DC 3. Suddenly a buzzing sound was heard and the men felt an intense heat. One of them collapsed, while the other managed to take shelter under the gun carriage. His screams eventually alerted the other soldiers. Suddenly all the lights in the fort went out and the emergency generator failed. The sentinels were burned to the second and third degree, but curiously the areas not covered by their clothing were not affected.

He declared that the passengers of this spacecraft spoke English and German and that they told him that at the right time, he would know what they had come to do on our planet. After a pleasant conversation, which according to Schmidt would have lasted about twenty minutes, the visitors took their place in their craft which rose into the air exactly like a helicopter. (A. RIBERA: "These Mysterious UFOs" - De Vecchi 1976, p. 233, 234) They were Saturnians. Two of the men had mustaches. Curiously, this hairiness is not mentioned in his little book. (...)

At dawn, 5:40, Richard Keyhoe, a telephone employee, was driving towards Playa del Rey when the engine of his car, as well as those of three other cars, including those of Ronald Burke from Redondo Beach and Joe Thomas from Torrance, stalled. When the drivers got out of their vehicles to see what was wrong, they saw on the beach an ovoid spacecraft enveloped in a blue mist. Two men, about 5'2", emerged from the UFO and asked questions to Keyhoe and the others, such as "where we were going, who we were, what time it was, etc." Their skin seemed yellowish-green in the morning light but otherwise they looked normal. They wore black leather pants, white belts, and light-colored jerseys. They spoke a kind of English but Keyhoe couldn't understand them. They then returned to their craft which disappeared into the sky. The craft had the shape of an egg, tanned or cream-colored, with two metal circles surrounding it and on which the object rested, according to Keyhoe.

Everett Clark (12 years old) opened the door at 6:30 in the morning to let his dog Frisky out. In doing so, he saw a strange, oblong object without a particular color in a field a hundred yards away. He thought he was dreaming and went back inside. Twenty minutes later, he saw that the object was still there and Frisky was standing next to it with some of the neighbor's dogs. Near the craft were two women and two men dressed in ordinary clothes. One of the men tried several times to catch Frisky but had to give up for fear of being bitten. Everett then saw these people talking to each other "like German soldiers" in a movie he had seen, walk straight into the side of the object, which flew away without making any noise.

At dusk, John Trasco went out to feed his dog and saw an egg-shaped object in front of his barn. On the way he encountered a three-foot being with a mastic-colored face and large frog eyes who said in bad English "We are peaceful people, we only want your dog". The strange being was specifically ordered to return from whence it came. It ran away to its machine, which flew away a few moments later. Trying to catch the creature, Trasco received some green powder on his wrist which washed away. However, the next day he still had some under his nails. The entity was wearing a green suit adorned with shiny buttons, a Scottish-style cap and gloves from which, at the end of each finger, shone an object. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T.

An USAF lieutenant in a car had to stop at 6:10am since the engine suddenly cut out. Having got out to detect the cause of the breakdown, he heard a sharp buzzing and saw to the right of the highway, 300 or 400 m away, 4 objects in the shape of discs, stopped on the ground. He headed towards these never-before-seen machines and managed to get to within 15 m of the first object. They were all identical: discoid, luminous, with a diameter of around 15 m, a transparent dome made of another material, the light diffusing from the inside out, all over the body of the objects. They had three hemispherical landing gear of around 60 cm in diameter, made of a dark material. From the ground to the top of the dome they were between 3 m and 4.50 m in height. The objects were surrounded by a darker annular part seeming to be animated by a rotational movement. When he got to 15 m the buzzing suddenly became so sharp that it hurt his ears, and the objects took off, rising to 15 m, retracting the landing gear, and slowly at 15 km/h they left towards the north, crossing the highway, skirting the small hills 800 m away, and disappearing behind them. The observation lasted around 20 minutes and the witness saw no openings of any kind on the discs. He examined the ground where they had been stationed and apart from the slight hollows left by the landing gear, there were no traces. After the UFOs left, he was able to start his car again, which functioned normally. (J. Allen HYNEK: "New Report on UFOs" - Belfond 1979, pp. 179-181)

Looking out, she saw an object that had stopped just 3m from the house. It seemed to be 6m long, 1.80m high and was dark grey or black, with brightly lit portholes. The object stopped at around 1.50m from the ground - it had no protrusions. Through the portholes Mrs Starr saw two shapes crossing each other, going in opposite directions. They seemed to have their right arm raised and it reminded her of waiters holding a tray. She didn't see any hands. They were wearing some kind of jacket, their head was square or rectangular and red-orange in colour, with what seemed to be a red bulb in the middle of the "head". Feet were not visible. A third shape appeared on the left and Mrs Starr leaned forward to get a better look at its face. At that moment the portholes went dark and the whole hull began to shine while a kind of antenna 15cm long rose from the top of the object at the end closest to the witness (...)

Fred Taylor and Franck Dickenson observed at night a red and shining object in the sky above the marshes. This object was in free fall. They went home to get flashlights and returned to the scene. Shortly before midnight Taylor and Dickinson found a small smoking crater in the moor. A mini-saucer was there. When this object finally cooled down, the two men pulled it out of the hole and with a knife managed to open it. Inside they found 17 pages of an unknown kind of parchment paper, covered with indecipherable hieroglyphs. The Ministry of Defense and the RAF considered this event to be a hoax. The analyzed saucer turned out to be made of an unusual alloy of copper. When the affair calmed down, the 17 pages of writings were entrusted to the lawyer Anthony Parker of Scarborough.

Between 8 and 10 PM and for 20 minutes five witnesses observed the descent of a saucer with a mixed crew. Two witnesses observed the phenomenon from the tall grass, the other three from inside the house through a slightly open door. A luminous object arrived at great speed in a vertical descent and remained in hover at 2 m from the shore of the lagoon. The farm was 390 m away. The object was round, 10 m in diameter and 3 m high, topped with a dome resembling a hat. Of metallic and shiny appearance, it emitted an intense light of clear red, causing a burning sensation in the eyes. This light entered through the windows and the cracks in the dwelling where it was completely diffused without giving any shadow. Suddenly, two tall beings of about 2 m in height appeared near the object, wearing white suits with a wide white belt. They had a wide face and hair falling on their shoulders. "They look like saints," said the little girl. White race, barefoot. Three other characters also appeared, of small size, 1.40 m approximately in brown suits, belt of the same color, wearing boots, white race and long hair. These three small beings stayed near the craft all the time. The two tall beings went back and forth between the craft and the fence, the last time opening the door and approaching 60 m from the house.

"A large shape and a thin rod, at least 50 feet high, seemed to be shrinking and sinking into the ground". As she approached, the car stopped completely and, in panic, the witness desperately tried to restart it. Suddenly she saw two suspended forms spinning around the rod that was sinking into the ground, they looked like four-legged animals, but then suddenly everything disappeared and the shape rose into the air: a saucer that zigzagged ten feet above the ground. It rose further and disappeared. Then the car lights came back on and she was able to start it again.

(cf: January 7, 1958) An unknown man rang the doorbell, saying he had burned his hand and asking for help. When he removed his hat, revealing his long blond hair, Cynthia recognized him. He asked for boiling water and plunged his hand into it. After injecting himself with white light to protect himself from terrestrial bacteria, he applied a jelly to his hand which immediately restored the skin.

On this occasion they spoke to her in English but with a foreign accent, articulating carefully. The first form (her contact of November 18) had long hair falling on her shoulders. The second and apparently the oldest of the two had shorter, curly hair on her ears. Mrs. Appelton was informed that they only appeared to her because her brain was properly tuned for such contacts. She was told that she was seeing a projection of entities and that she should not touch them. (...) she said she had experienced other visits since the first two, including one where an entity appeared at her door and asked her to bandage his injured hand.

ALGERIA, Bouahmama
Shortly after noon, the legionnaire on duty heard a whistling sound seeming to come from the sky. When he looked up, he saw an enormous object about 300 m in diameter, descending to about 45 m from him. The most remarkable thing was not the object itself, but the intense conical beam of a light green emerald coming from below and directed towards the ground. Instead of shooting to give the alarm or taking the phone, he stayed to stare at the object for more than three quarters of an hour: he declared that these pale green and emerald colors were the most beautiful, calming and fascinating he had ever seen. The object took off in a classic way: first a whistling, then an elevation to an altitude of about 90 m and finally an ascent at a dizzying speed towards the northwest. When the object left, the man was filled with sadness. (Jacques VALLEE: "Other Dimensions" - trad. Robert Laffont 1989, p. 58, 59)

A Colombian farmer, working in his fields with his workers, suddenly saw "a man at least 3 meters tall, green in color, appearing to be naked, and whose skin, resembling that of a crocodile, was crossed by deep transverse wrinkles. The arms, very long, almost reached the ground". The story might be laughed at, if it did not evoke, with troubling coincidences, a similar event that occurred on February 12, 1952 in Flatwood (Virginia).

CANADA, Rodney, Ontario 
(rg: Unsure of date.) "This Sunday morning I was with my friend (name censored) in Rodney, around 4:30 at Lake Erie, just south of Mopeth, to go fishing. Our equipment being ready, we were sitting at the docks. It was still dark and the sky was very starry. At 4:45 in the direction of the southeast, an intense red light appeared on the horizon and rose in a straight line. In a few seconds the red light became white, much brighter than any star, and rose in the sky on an erratic trajectory. The spectacle made us forget a bit about fishing, and we stayed to observe this light. Sometimes it seemed to blink a bit but always gradually rising. An hour later, at 5:45 dawn was drawing and the sun was about to rise and the light was still rising at an angle of 45° but seeming to move away from us.

GREAT BRITAIN, near Birmingham
(cf: March 11, 1958). In the late afternoon Mrs. Appleton saw the E.T. enter calmly through the door leading to the courtyard, which was open. Why hadn't he come earlier? A lesson on the theme of "what is time". He gave her an object that the investigator could immediately decode. It was a piece of metal with some signs on it. Later, when Mrs. Appleton met the investigator, she could no longer find this proof, which had been carefully stored in an envelope. However, she remembered some signs and drew them from memory. The investigator recognized signs that Adamski claimed to have received from the Venusians, and at that time this was enough to discredit the case, which is currently (1995) being looked at more closely. Needless to say, the University of Manchester never gave the results of the analysis of the E.T.'s skin fragment (Marie-Thérèse de BROSSES: "Investigation of E.T. Abductions" - Plon 1995, p. 140).

At 2:45 AM, Mr. Donniou was on his way to work on his moped. As he left Gouzon, he saw strange lights, then a strong beam of light with perfectly sharp edges, rising vertically into the sky. Around the base of this beam, close to the ground, was another multicolored beam that suddenly went out. Then there was a sound like a sharp crack, like a branch being broken. Then an object resembling a large aluminum funnel pointed downwards rose vertically: 6m in diameter, 5m high. It disappeared, turning red. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

At 9:30 PM, 11 km before Laval coming from Paris, the witness suddenly saw an object motionless 10 m above the ground and 150 m to the left of the road. It had the shape of two cones with a common base and showed a row of around 10 openings in its middle part. It must have been around 20 m wide, had a metallic appearance, with a red light (like that of traffic signals) shining through the windows. The witness had time to stop and maneuvered so as to be able to light up the object with his headlights. During the whole duration of the observation, a whistling sound similar to that of a jet could be heard. The object rose very slowly, then quickly ascended until it was out of sight.

At around 7:55 PM Jean Boyer was returning home to Beylon de Montmaur. He had reached 700 meters from the bridge over the Buech, without even thinking about it. When he arrived near the bridge in the Cote des Egaux, he saw a luminous disc suspended above the bridge and the valley below. A railway bridge passing over the road bridge and the valley cast the oval shadow of the disc. He ventured onto the road bridge and stopped near the railway bridge. He got out of the car and looked up, noticing that the object was perfectly round and contained a smaller circle. Boyer estimated the disc to be 120 meters long and 300 meters in altitude. After two or three minutes of observation, the witness was truly frightened when the disc began to sparkle with a dark red and then rose vertically at an incredible speed, without making any noise. Then he was hit by a strong wind, as were the five other witnesses who, like him, had observed the phenomenon. ("Ufo's: A Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Prss Inc. 1999, p. 259)

FRANCE, Renédale (Doubs)
Witnesses: Mme Côte Suzanne and Defrasne Césaire, farmers.
It was about 8 o'clock. Between the house of Suzanne Côte and her
neighbors Defrasne there is a vast wasteland where the grass barely
covers the rock. About 10 m away is a pile of stones 7 to 8 m in
diameter, 1 m high. On her way home, Suzanne felt a breath coming
over her, her hair flew as if sucked and without her having time to
make a gesture, she saw, passing a few meters above her head and
producing a very perceptible whistle, three discs flying towards the
pile of stones. These objects, which could be compared to plates or
perhaps to rings, each measured 20 to 30 cm in diameter. Their plane
was parallel to the ground and they were arranged in a triangle of at
least 1 m side. One of the discs was clearly yellow, another was
clearly red, the third was bluish. The triangle formed by these discs
was animated by a slow rotational movement in the direct sense.
Arriving near the stones, this composite triangle was less than a
meter from the ground. It circled the pile and made three circular
tours around the rubble. It then continued its trajectory, its
whistling momentarily interrupted, seemed to accelerate its pace and
passing behind the Defrasne house, flew in the direction of Evillers
where it disappeared. (Henry DURRANT: "Le dossier des OVNI" - Laffont 1973 -

An AT unit from the Aberdeen area was on a weekend exercise
in the vicinity of Braemar and Ballater. During the maneuvers the two
young soldiers were to guard a small hill. Well equipped they
dug a trench for shelter. In the early hours of
dawn they heard a strange gurgling sound coming from
behind the trees a few hundred meters from their position.
As they decided to go and see, two huge silhouettes emerged from
the shadows and headed towards them. They froze, horrified, as
the creatures were more than 2 m tall. The gurgling sound
seemed to be the sound the creatures made while conversing with each other. (...) dressed in strange clothing that hampered their
pace. Terrified, the soldiers spun around and ran away.

On their way back from a ball in Hoganas, Hans Gustavsson, 25 years old, and Stig Rydberg, 30 years old, saw a particular light through a gap in the pine trees at 02:55. They left the car to go towards the light. They saw a disc-shaped craft resting on three legs, about 1 meter high and 4 to 5 meters long. It was luminous but not dazzling. Suddenly they were attacked by 4 creatures, lead-gray in color, about 1.20 meters tall and 35 cm wide. They seemed to have no limbs and looked like skittles, but when they attacked they firmly grasped and tried to drag the men towards the craft, which they had no grip on because they had the consistency of jelly. They smelled like old marshes. The struggle lasted from 4 to 7 minutes and suddenly they were only paying attention to Hans who had clung to the post. Stig had taken the opportunity to run to the car and honk. Immediately they let go of Hans who fell to the ground.

A resident of Goulburn was fox hunting. He had an unusual encounter and shot at it, hitting something that emitted a terrible noise. Then there was a flash and something burning, pierced the sleeve of his jacket and left a small mark on his arm. The burn itself took a year to heal, but the mark had first grown, so that it measured two and a half inches by three. It exactly reproduced the shape of the planet Saturn: a globe surrounded by a ring. (Continued on December 28, 1968, same place) (Bruce CATHIE /P. TEMM "Harmonic 695" - ed.

In 1958, Trevor James (Trevor James Constable) published a book dedicated to his psychic contacts with an Ashtar who gave him a different speech than the one given to George Williamson (November 1952). According to James's Ashtar, all the peoples living beyond our Moon (sic) are of an ethereal nature and they possess vessels that move at the speed of light! When it seems necessary to them, they can show themselves to our eyes in the form of human beings similar to ourselves and have a material appearance such that the person who sees them has no reason to think that they can be different.
