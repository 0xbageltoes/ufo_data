USA, Madisonville (Kentucky) and elsewhere. MANTELL Case
In the early afternoon hundreds of inhabitants of Madisonville, then
thousands of citizens of the same state, saw an immense circular and
shining object. The state police alerted Fort Knox, The diameter of the
craft was, it was believed, at least 75 meters. (etc… ) (Donald E.
KEYHOE: "The UFO Files" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.37, 38) At 1:15 pm a
round object, about 70 m in diameter, is reported above Madisonville
heading towards Fort Knox. At 1:45 pm the observer of the Godman air
base signals it; the officers observe it from the ground with binoculars
and with the naked eye. The commander of the base, Colonel Hix, orders
by radio a patrol of three F-51 fighters to take the object in pursuit
and observe it. The patrol, commanded by Captain Mantell, who was
overflying Fort Knox, then heads towards Godman. At 2:45 pm Mantell
reports that the object is above him. He rises to meet it and the speed
of the three fighters is about 500 km/h.<br/><br/>Radio message from Mantell:
"I'm approaching to better examine it. The craft looks like it's made
of metal and it's huge".<br/><br/>At an altitude of 5,000 m the object still
rising, the other two fighters lose sight of Mantell due to the clouds
and abandon the pursuit to return to the Godman base. At 3:15 pm Mantell
reports that he can't reach the object and that he will abandon the
pursuit at 6,000 m if the craft continues to rise, as he does not have
an oxygen inhaler. This is his last message. Around 4 pm debris from
Mantell's F-51 was found within a radius of several kilometers, which
would prove that the plane disintegrated in mid-flight. Despite the
searches made, nothing of the pilot's body was found. (Henry DURRANT:
"The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970 - p.89-90) (note from vog: see
newspaper article of the following day: the remains of Mantell were
indeed found and evacuated from the crash scene by ambulance)<br/><br/>Years
later it was known that the secret military Skylook weather balloons
were being tested in the area and Arnold would have died from lack of
oxygen at an altitude of 20,000 feet. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern
Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 48)<br/><br/>Here is
an excerpt from the article published in the January 8, 1948 edition of
the weekly "The Franklin, Kentucky Favorite". AN AIRPLANE EXPLODES AT
MID-ALTITUDE, THE PILOT IS KILLED IN THE CRASH ON JOE PHILLIPS' FARM.
An Army P-51 combat plane exploded at mid-altitude yesterday and
crashed on Joe Phillips' farm in the afternoon around 3:30 pm killing
the pilot identified as Thomas F. Mantell (Jr.), 3533 River Park Drive,
Louisville. The plane bore (on the tail) No. Ky. NG 869. Mrs. Joe
Phillips said she was sitting near the fire when she heard the plane,
whose engine apparently had some trouble, flying near the house. Almost
immediately there was a great explosion.<br/><br/>Surprised she looked out the
window and saw 200 yards from the house, the disintegrated plane fall
into a wooded lot. Pieces of the wreckage were found up to a quarter of
a mile around the point of impact. Several people in Franklin say they
heard the explosion. A trail of steam still floated in the air an hour
after the crash. Another eyewitness, Barbara Mayes, a student at the
Franklin Grade School said she saw the plane explode while it was still
at mid-height. She was waiting for the bus to go home when she heard
the explosion. This is the second explosion in a few months. The place
of the explosion was only 3 miles away from the one that took the life
of Ed Snow and Richard M. Thomason on April 29, 1947. (…)<br/><br/>Mrs. Joe
Phillips said she called an ambulance and help. The remains of the dead
pilot were removed from the scene by ambulance and taken to the Booker
funeral home awaiting official instructions.<br/><br/>Captain Mantell was a
veteran of World War II and participated in the June 6, 1944 Normandy
landing, he was among others decorated with the Flying Cross. He was
demobilized a year ago (in 1946). He leaves a wife and two children. (…)

Farmer B. Stevens was up early that winter morning, like every other morning. He first went out to the barn to take a look at the pigs. But on the way he saw something he couldn't accept. Above the farm buildings was suspended an object of metallic appearance in the shape of a saucer. Very down-to-earth Stevens could immediately judge that the object was real and solid, that it measured 60 feet in diameter and was thick from 10 to 12 feet. The center seemed dome-shaped and a bright orange light was coming out of it. This dome was transparent, because when the saucer inclined slightly, he could make out a silhouette inside. The occupant of the saucer seemed to concentrate his gaze on the farm buildings and Stevens thought that the cause might be the green light that lit up one of his hangars. Soon the light from the dome was fading and Stevens could no longer make out the occupant well. Then the saucer glided upwards and flew away out of sight.

ITALY, San Martino in Pensilis - Fara di Cigno
Giusseppe Langiano and his foreman Giuseppe Bavota observed a saucer of the shape of an open umbrella, without the handle, of a luminous orange color. It was heading west to east in the sky. Suddenly it stopped at about ten meters from the ground. There, stationary, it emitted a beam of white light from its center, which descended to the ground while the witnesses then had the impression of feeling very hot. On the upper part of the saucer there was a rounded protuberance illuminated by a soft and silvery light. After two minutes, a more or less anthropomorphic figure, about one and a half meters tall, descended vertically through the central light beam, until it touched the ground. It wore a suit that seemed metallic, large gloves and boots of the same material. Its head was covered and a kind of visor was outlined in the one-piece helmet with the suit. In this visor there were two circles (glasses?) The witnesses were less than 200 meters away (let's say that to see the circles in the visor, these witnesses had some good eyes ... try it ...) and were heading towards the strange machine, but at that moment the being was going up, vertically, through the beam (elevator?) which was getting shorter. Suddenly the object flew away, even faster than it had arrived.

Incident reporting a flat, round object, oscillating at 1:06 PM and reported by 1st Lt Aytch M. Johnson Jr of the 375th VLR Weather Squadron. The UFO was coming from the northeast flying towards the southwest. Flying at an altitude of 2000 feet, and at a speed of 200 to 300 mph. But at one point the object made a dive covering 500 feet in 2 seconds. Horizontal flight, silent, in a clear sky with unlimited visibility.

GERMANY, north of Munich
At 10 pm, the captain of an F 80, in flight, saw an object that was moving
vertically from the base (American in Germany) at an altitude that
could not be specified. The object, which looked like a star, was red. It was heading south, towards Munich. Then
suddenly it changed direction and headed first southwest
and finally southeast. Its speed must have varied between 300 and 900
km/h (...) The base gave the alarm to the radar station which at first did
not see anything on the screens. After a few minutes the radar station
announced an object flying at 1350 km/h, at an altitude of 8000
meters in a point located 45 km south of Munich. The captain noted that the object he had spotted was not in this
area. After a few minutes the radar station indicated that the object
was now at 15000 meters altitude, circling about sixty km south of Munich. (A. RIBERA: "These Mysterious UFOs" -

Test pilot Howard Lilly was killed in an experimental flight with the NACA Skystreak. This aircraft had the same aerodynamic configuration as the XS-1 but apart from the wing and tail, the D-558-1 (official name of the Skystreak) had nothing else in common. The Skystreak took off from the ground with its own General Electric TG-180 turbojet engine. The Douglas Company had built three of these D-558-1s. (NASA Website, 1997 - On the Frontier)

TURKEY, Adapazari
The newspaper "Yeni Sabah" of May 5, 1948 reported that a luminous object exploded in mid-air above Adapazari. Pieces fell into a nearby village, killing a shepherd dog. The recovered parts clearly show that it was a missile. It came from the northwest and was only 200 meters above Adapazari before it fell. Rumor has it that this flying object was from Soviet tests conducted at the Alagoz base near the eastern border of Turkey.

Hans Klotchbach was travelling without a passport on a coal train. At night, just before the Wasserbillig border control station, he fell onto the ballast and injured both of his legs. He fainted, losing blood and unable to walk. He claimed to have regained consciousness inside a flying saucer, in a cabin bathed in an opaline blue light. A voice gave him information in German about upcoming cataclysmic events and added that it was by chance above his unconscious body that the occupants had come to his aid. He fainted again. Four days later he was sitting in the moss of a small wood, 6 km inside Luxembourg, 10 km from the place of his fall: his legs completely healed but his trousers and shoes full of clotted blood.

At 3:00 PM, a passenger aboard a C-47 transport observed at 8000 feet altitude, three objects in the shape of a disc. He defined them as being "golden silver". Another passenger confirmed the observation, but only saw two objects. The size of the objects was estimated to be 300 or 400 feet and with a well-defined outline when they emerged from the clouds at 18000 feet. They flew in the opposite direction to that taken by the plane. ("Ufo's: a Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 104, 105)

USSR, Kasputine Yar (Baskounchak)
Test pilot Arcad Ivanovitch Apraksine took off in a series aircraft, reached an altitude of 10500 m and found himself above a solid sea of clouds, flying in a southward direction. He had been flying for half an hour when he spotted an unknown flying craft coming across and descending. The object had the shape of a cigar. Light cones or beams were projected backwards. Seeing this craft, Apraksine, who was in radio communication with his base, described what he saw. He was told that the unknown object was being tracked on radar, had been given the order to land and had not responded. Apraksine was given the mission to intercept the craft and order it to land and, if it did not, to open fire. Carrying out these instructions, Apraksine maneuvered for interception and approached to a distance of 10 km from the object. Its light beams then opened up in a fan and engulfed his aircraft, dazzling him. At the same time he realized that all the electrical controls of the aircraft were dead and the engine stopped. Apraksine managed to make a forced landing after a glide. He saw the object shoot up into the sky. (Continued on May 6, 1949) (Jacques VALLEE: "The Invisible College" - J'ai Lu 1975, pp. 81-83)

A two-storied spacecraft, moving at a higher speed, had been seen on July 20, 1948 (...) Witnesses had reported it at a very high altitude moving at a fantastic speed. (Donald KEYHOE: "Les soucoupes volantes existent" - ed. Corrêa, Paris, 1951, p. 97) An object was observed four times, when it intermittently emerged from the clouds around 1:30 PM. It was built like a V2 from the Second World War, without wings or fins, but its appearance did not resemble that of a rocket. One of the witnesses said he was able to see two floors on the object.

The DC 3 was at 2:45, 32 kilometers west of Montgomery, when a projectile-shaped aircraft came roaring along the air route. … "It suddenly changed course and passed about two hundred meters to our right. I then saw that it had no wings." The mysterious aircraft flew past where Whitted was, allowing him to examine it in detail. ) – The object was about thirty meters long, cigar-shaped and had no wings, he said. It was about twice the diameter of a B 29, without protrusions. According to Chiles, the cabin looked like an ordinary cockpit, except that it was lit by a light of supernatural brightness. Whitted and he agreed that the brightness was comparable to that of a magnesium flash. They did not see any occupants, which is not surprising at that speed. – An intense dark blue glow emanated from the side of the craft, Chiles said. (…) It ran the length of the fuselage, like a fluorescent blue lamp. The exhaust was an orange-red flame, lighter at the outer edges. The two pilots said that the flame extended between ten and fifteen meters to the rear. As it passed, Chiles observed a kind of beak similar to a radar antenna. (…) So the spacecraft was not a stray rocket. But it could be a new kind of aircraft, somewhat revolutionary, made in the greatest secrecy. (Donald KEYHOE: "Les soucoupes volantes existent" - ed. Corrêa, Paris, 1951, pp. 91 to 95, and same author: "Le dossier des Soucoupes Volantes" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.39) Chiles and Whitted on their DC.3 saw a lit bolide emerge at 03:40. Chiles had only time to move away and the UFO passed along the plane at less than 200m. It was cigar-shaped, 30 m long, the cabin was lit like by a magnesium flash. An intense dark blue light emanated from its side. The exhaust was an orange-red flame extending over about fifteen meters. The UFO had also maneuvered to avoid collision. The pilots saw it rear up, spew out an awful jet of flames and climb at a terrifying speed. Duration of the observation: 10 seconds. It had no wings or other protrusions but had two rows of rectangular windows lit up (Jacques POTTIER: "Les Soucoupes Volantes" - DE VECCHI - 1974 - p. 25) An airplane was shaken by the wake caused by the passage of a UFO (Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - p. 210)

A real aerial duel between a UFO and Lieutenant Pilot George F. Gorman, of the North Dakota Air National Guard. (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970 - p.91) "(...) Suddenly Gorman noticed a strange phenomenon. Instead of discerning the silhouette of an airplane around the eclipse light, he saw none. (...) The pilot, at that moment, distinctly saw the thing. It was a white disc about 20 cm in diameter. (...) When Gorman approached with his F-51, this 20 cm light suddenly stopped flashing and jumped to his left. It was absolutely round, white and without material consistency. There was nothing, no shape, no machine in the center of the glow: a disc of pure light, without apparent emission source. "(Henry DURRANT: "The UFO File" - Laffont 1973 - p. 50) The authorities concluded that Gorman had chased a weather balloon and that in the second part of the incident he was chasing a mirage of the planet Jupiter, caused by a temperature inversion. Apparently Jupiter descended below the horizon when Gorman saw the light rise and disappear. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London, 1989, p. 49)

The UFO seemed to them a bit smaller than a DC-3, but it was traveling three times faster. The sun was reflecting off of it and giving it a kind of blinking brightness, as bright as that which can be reflected by a chrome surface. It was coming from the northwest and flying towards the southeast. There were no wings, engines, or other visible propulsion devices on the object.

Already in a report published on November 11, 1945, General H.H. Arnold, Supreme Commander of the American Aviation, envisaged the launch of a space exploration program. (...) On December 29, 1948, Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal officially revealed that a program of artificial satellites was under study in each of the three arms and that the Commission of Special Long-Range Engines was going to take charge of these files to develop a common program.

The launches of V2 rockets were followed by visits from UFOs. I have the recording of the interview with Charles Schwartz, the radar operator at White Sands during one of these UFO appearances. (Has anyone heard this recording???) The object had the shape of a disc, it rose to 1600 km/h at the same time as the V2 which it circled around. It was observed with binoculars, theodolites and radar. It had passed the rocket at some 9000 km/h and had disappeared into space. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad.

The NACA had hoped to receive one of the two X-4 aircraft that Northrop was building this month (as part of the transonic research). But in December 1948 only one was complete and still at the factory, where it made its initial flight. The X-4 program experienced delays and design problems: in six months it only made three flights and according to the pilots, this aircraft was far inferior to the Skystreak with which Howard Lilly had lost his life.

On a cold January morning in 1949, a strange phenomenon was observed on the farm of the Lampe couple. It had snowed heavily during the night and in the morning, looking out the window, Mrs. Lampe saw in the snow a patch of light gray color, no bigger than two hands held together. It had an irregular shape. It "rested" on a small rounded pile of snow, about three wheels from the house and right in front of the window. Suddenly this patch changed into a disk of bright white light with a diameter of three feet (90 cm). This lasted about two full minutes. Then suddenly the light contracted into an orange bar 10 to 12 cm wide which flew quickly towards the window where the witness was looking and then, apparently, exploded against the stone foundation of the porch as several sparkling red and blue sparks rose up to 70 cm above the door frame. When day broke, the couple looked for evidence, but no mark or trace to explain the phenomenon was found. (THE CASE FOR THE UFO by Morris K. Jessup, Citadel Press, New York, N.Y., 1955, page 168)

MEXICO
Mexico experienced a strange incident. "Aviation from Beyond Space" by Alberto Perego and other works extensively relate this extraordinary event. So, on this March 17, a few hours from Aztec, a mysterious disc of about thirty meters in diameter landed close to secret bases. Alerted immediately, the authorities surrounded the area with secret service agents and called in aeronautical experts. As one can imagine, there was great confusion and anxiety and men examined the outside of the craft for several days. (...) Time passed, bringing with it the certainty that "no one could come out alive" from this craft. So technicians tried to open the hermetically sealed cockpit. Their fear, as soon as they entered the strange vehicle, turned to terror. Sixteen men, of human appearance, lay there, on the ground, dead. One of the witnesses reported "that they all looked like "twins", with fine features and very beautiful faces. They wore a blue uniform of the type of our naval officers and could measure between 1 m 30 and 1 m 40. They had obviously died in the landing. It was with difficulty that the parts of the craft, embedded one in the other, could finally be dismantled and the first analyses revealed that this mysterious disc had been designed in a very light alloy, the composition of which could not be established. The bodies of the mysterious pilots were then taken to the Aeronautical Hospital and subjected to an autopsy. After which, the doctors stated that they were "in all respects like us".

That night, two American aviators, Jack Adams and his co-pilot G.W.Anderson declared to have seen a flying saucer: "It was during the first part of our flight to Shreveport, (Louisiana), explained Anderson. "Jack was at the controls. We were heading west, and we were about 25 km north of Stuttgart (Arkansas). The visibility and the ceiling were unlimited, we were flying at about 600 meters. Suddenly, Jack saw, on our left, a flashing light, of a bluish color, and of an extraordinary intensity. It was about 300 meters above us and 800 meters away. It shone at the top of an object of almost spherical shape. The object was buzzing at a great speed, 800 to 900 km/h approximately. It was moving towards the north, in front and above us. The craft remained well visible for thirty seconds, and we were able to consider it attentively. It had no navigation lights, but we distinctly saw other lights, which seemed to come from eight or ten windows or portholes lit in the lower part of the aircraft." "The lights were of a fluorescent kind, soft, flaky, and did not resemble anything we had ever seen.. The "object" was circular. It approached and disappeared exactly like another plane. (...) "The object was about the size of a DC 3. It had no exhaust pipe, and caused no smoke trail. In our opinion, it was an aircraft, but not a jet."

Leaving his home at 10:00 PM, the witness heard a considerable noise of clicking. Towards the east, at 40° above the horizon, he distinguished after 10 seconds an object, a solid mass, curved, rounded, of the size of 4 to 5 feet in diameter, at a height of less than 1000 feet. Its color was dull, slightly colored by the lights of the ground that were reflected in it. The object moved slowly towards the west or the northwest. The visual observation lasted about 35 seconds. The object made a kind of turn of 90°, the clicking noise was constant, even during this turn. On the part of the modified trajectory (towards the south) the noise became duller. When the sound was no longer perceptible, the witness no longer saw the object. There were fluctuations in this sound, resembling that of an incorrectly adjusted household mixer-beater. (doc.

Moore followed this balloon with the theodolite for several minutes, after which he handed the instrument to a sailor. Shortly afterwards, he noticed that the sailor had pointed the instrument in another direction. Letting out a choice of naval curses Moore was about to snatch the instrument from the sailor when the latter said: "But I'm keeping it in there." Moore looked and saw in the theodolite's field of view an elliptical whitish object. It was moving east at a speed of 5° of azimuthal displacement per second.

Apraksine maneuvered towards the flying cigar. The two aircrafts were going very fast on a collision trajectory. At a distance of 10 km, a cone of light beams was once again directed at Apraksine. He was blinded. All the electrical controls of the plane were destroyed. The Plexiglas windshield was damaged.

The lower part of the thing was rust-colored, while the upper "glass" part was divided into four panels. The craft was quite small, about two meters in diameter. When the object was directly above them, they could see that the base was completely round, crossed by four reinforcing bars two in each direction, at the back, the two bars ended in a kind of exhaust pipes directed downwards from which a thick orange gas came out, especially when the craft gained altitude. The trail of this gas measured 40 meters long and only formed 4 or 5 meters behind the craft. There was only a very light buzzing, the object then passed over the trees at 40 or 50 meters altitude, and continuing on its trajectory, disappeared from their view behind a hill.

On the evening of August 20th, 1949, at 10:45 PM, Professor Tombaugh was in front of his house in Las Cruces, New Mexico, with his wife and her mother. Looking up at the sky, he suddenly saw near the zenith, six or eight rectangles shining with a greenish light, flying quickly towards a point on the horizon between 25 and 30 degrees southeast. They moved with a rapid and uniform motion and seemed to be windows of some unlit craft carried in a luminous vague silhouette against the black of the firmament. In any case, these rectangles were certainly flat objects, because as they moved away they gradually contracted in the direction of flight, as if the three witnesses had seen them increasingly in profile. The whole of the six or eight rectangles, which followed each other two by two, formed in the sky a perfectly rigid design of an area of about one degree, which corresponds to twice the width of the full moon. (...) (There are slight differences between the two accounts: first in the magazine "Life" and then in Menzel): in the first Tombaugh frankly speaks of a cigar with two rows of windows, while in the second, the cigar has faded into a vague silhouette. In the first account the observation lasts about twenty seconds, it is much shorter in the second. ("Glimpses of Flying Saucers" Aimé Michel, ed. Maison MAME, 1954, pp. 69 and 70, dated August 20th)

In the afternoon, at 2:45 PM, this pilot was flying from Clark Field to Parkersburg in a Luscombe 84, at 160 km/h and 3450 feet above sea level, in the west of Virginia when he suddenly noticed a bright yellow shape coming straight towards him. The object was coming towards him at such a speed, added to the speed of his own plane, that it made him jump when it passed him in the space of two seconds. But it was flying roughly 100 feet below, 50 feet to the right. Thanks to the dark green of the forest that was passing beneath the plane, he was able to clearly distinguish the intruder: it was a bright canary yellow, 15 to 18 inches long, diameter around 4 inches at its widest part. It looked like a missile, but in fact had the same shape and proportions as the fuselage of a Lockheed X 90 of the Air Force. No wings, but vertical and horizontal ailerons at 1/3 of its rear. No visible means of propulsion, no engines, combustion trail, smoke, steam, exhaust gas. The front of the missile was very pointed, with a needle-shaped nose. This needle was about 6 inches long and resembled a lead pencil. The other end of the object was as pointed as the tail of a jet plane. The missile was heading west at 240°. It seemed to be coming to the end of its course when it passed the plane, as its speed seemed to be slightly decreasing. (doc. FBI - Bruce Maccabee, translated by Jean Sider)

USA, Albuquerque (New Mexico)
In 1949, a new type of UFO descended at night near the Albuquerque airport, in New Mexico. It was about 200 meters away when, all of a sudden, it fell to around 50 meters and exploded, spreading a rain of red dust. At the time, people feared it might be a toxic gas, but no harmful effects were observed. The incident repeated itself three times at the same hour, in the same place. There was no doubt that the red-emitting UFO's were very precisely controlled. The case was recorded in the "Grudge" study group report. Without any comment. (Donald E. KEYHOE - 1973 - Trans. "Les Etrangers de l'Espace" Ed. France-Empire coll. Press Pocket 1975 - p. 211-212)

Mikel Conrad shot a 300-meter film of the maneuvers, landing, and takeoff of 8 flying saucers, 70 km north of Juneau (Alaska), in 1949. The American government confiscated this film, examined it, and studied it in detail before returning it to him a year later.

#1949
At sea, Strait of Hormuz
Excerpts from an article in the United States Naval Institute Proceedings, by Commander J.R. Bodler (USNR): My ship had just passed through the Strait of Hormuz, bound for India. The night was clear and beautiful. The second mate called me to the bridge, saying he had seen something I should see. About four points (45°) on the starboard bow, toward the coast of Iran, there was a band of light that seemed to pulsate. Its aspect suggested an aurora borealis, but much lower, below the horizon in fact. Binocular examination showed that the lighted area was distinctly below the horizon, in the water, and was approaching the ship. As the phenomenon drew near, it became apparent that the pulsations seemed to emanate from the middle of the band and ripple out to the ends. At a distance of about one mile from the ship, the phenomenon appeared vaguely circular in shape, with a diameter of 300 to 450 meters. The pulsations were clearly caused by a rotary motion of the whole about a rather ill-defined center, with light rays like searchlight beams, radiating from the center and revolving (in a counterclockwise direction) like the spokes of a giant wheel. For several minutes the ship occupied the approximate center of the phenomenon. Slightly curved bands of light swept rapidly across the starboard bow to the stern and across the port bow. The brightness made the superstructure very visible. The luminous bands seemed to pass over a given point about every half second. As can be imagined, the effect was strange and extremely impressive; the ship seemed to occupy the center of a huge fireworks sun, with its “phosphorescent rays” revolving rapidly around the vessel as hub. The “hub” of the phenomenon gradually drew nearer the port side and passed astern, becoming more and more distant on the port quarter. While still in view several miles astern, and appearing at that time as a pulsating band of light, a repetition of the manifestation occurred on the port bow. (Yvan T. SANDERSON: "The Invisibles Under the Seas" Albin Michel 1979 - pp. 119-120)

#1950's
USA, New York
(Sometime in June.) One evening in June, people were leaving a New York theater. It was 11 pm when suddenly they saw in the middle of the intersection a man who seemed from another era. He was wearing a jacket with a row of buttons on the back, a wrinkle-free and non-reversible pants and a top hat. The people who saw him declared: "He was there, in the middle of the intersection, looking with an astonished air at the red lights, as if he had never seen them before". Suddenly what was predictable happened, a taxi could not avoid the man who died on the spot. On him was found an identity card with the name Rudolf Fentz and old coins. The police investigation will allow to trace the trace of a certain Rudolf Fentz who mysteriously disappeared in the spring of 1876, wore the same clothes and had the same age as the man who died at an intersection of another era than his own.

ALASKA, Kodiak
At 02:40, Lt. Smith of the US Navy, the flight commander of a P2V3 patrol plane #4 of Squadron #1, reported a radar contact with a UFO (note: launch of AEROBEE???) 20 miles from the Naval Air Base of Kodiak. At 02:48 a second radar contact was made with an object located 10 miles southeast of the base. The radar operator, Lt. Gaskey, reported intermittent radar interference of a type he had never recorded before. The contact was then lost, but the intermittent echo persisted. At 04:40 Smith had a visual and radar contact with the object which was moving at a high speed, and for 10 seconds all the crew members saw the object flying above them at about 1800 mph. The object then seemed to return and was observed at a larger size. But it quickly turned and seemed to be heading towards Smith's side, who turned off all the lights and the plane's lights. Four minutes later the object was moving away to the southeast. It appeared as two orange lights rotating around a common center. (doc. FBI - Bruce Maccabee, translated by Jean Sider)

At 04:35, Lts. Causer and Barco and Captain Paulson, the flight commander, saw an object for 10 minutes while they were in flight 62 miles south of Kodiak. At no time was a radar contact made. The object appeared to them like some kind of projectile in the shape of a flame of pulsating yellow-orange light, pulsing regularly every 3 to 5 seconds. When they saw the object more closely, the pulsations were at a beat of 7 to 8 seconds. (doc. FBI - Bruce Maccabee, trans. Jean Sider)

In the middle of the morning a T.W.A. aircraft was preparing to land at the Dayton municipal airport. As it maneuvered to present itself, the pilot and co-pilot saw a bright light, seeming to hover towards the southeast. They warned the control tower. The operators replied that they also saw this light and had warned the Ohio National Guard squadron stationed at the airport. A pilot was already running to his F-51. All the staff actually saw the UFO: an extremely bright light, much brighter and bigger than a star. It was at a very high altitude because the thick and high clouds masked it from time to time. In the air there was the F-51 of the (...) A few minutes later the object disappeared from the radar screen. The two F-51s descended. When the clouds dissipated, nothing could be seen anymore.

At 6:30 PM Wilfredo H. Arevalo saw a disc land, while a second craft hovered higher up. Arevalo got as close as 150 meters to the disc on the ground which emitted a bluish-green vapor and an "intense smell of burning gasoline" and seemed to be made of a phosphorescent metal similar to aluminum. On the disc a large flat part was spinning "like a gramophone disc". In the center the disc had a "glass" cabin very transparent through which he saw four tall, well-formed men, dressed in something like Cellophane, working on various instruments. He was particularly struck by the paleness of their faces. Seeing him, the men directed a spotlight towards him, a blue light illuminated the craft, there was an increase in vapor and red-green flames shot out from the base. The craft then rose with a low rumble and the two machines disappeared leaving bluish trails. (ground traces) (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 108)

Anderson, Jr. A circular disc of 100' with 9 to 12 portholes along its lower part, emitting a soft purple light and at the upper part a white flashing light that blinked 3 times in 9 seconds, flying at least 1,000 m.p.h. Observation of 25-35 seconds. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner).
On the night of March 31 at 9:29 p.m. the pilot Jack Adams noticed the presence of a white light on his left. His companion the second pilot G. W. Anderson made the same observation. When the UFO passed in front of the DC 3 they were able to examine it closely. Neither of them was able to indicate its exact shape because, according to them, its contours were blurred. Because of the arrangement of the 8 or 10 portholes through which a bluish light could be seen, they assumed it must have been round. In addition, a white light was flashing intermittently at the top of the craft. (Edward J. Ruppelt: "Confronting the Flying Saucers", ed.

SPAIN, Burgos - Villafria
At noon, Ruiz Gomez, head of the weather service at the air base, the sergeant in charge of transmissions, and the officer responsible for teletypists, heard a sound similar to that of an airplane approaching the airfield. They were surprised because no plane was expected in Villafria. From the top of the control tower where they were, they saw a flying saucer appear, coming from the southwest, soon to be vertical to the tower. It then changed its route abruptly and headed east. The three observers calculated that the aircraft was flying between 500 and 1000 meters in altitude and resembled one of those airplanes called "winged wings". However, the object observed was much smaller than the planes of this type .. one could have thought that it was simply an eagle. The UFO passed over the witnesses at 1800 km / h, three times as fast as the fighter planes of the time. (A. RIBERA: "These Mysterious UFOs" - De Vecchi 1976, p. 322, 323)

The duty officer of the Logan International Airport control tower and the other controllers saw from 21:55 GMT to 22:05 GMT, while on the ground and at altitude the wind was blowing in gusts at 75 km/h from the northeast, full west, 15° above the horizon a dark blue light, sailing towards the southwest. During the observation it changed to a bright white, then back to a dark blue. This point split into two blue lights that were spinning around each other and their trajectory led them to 45° above the horizon. (Cloud cover at 5000 m altitude). There was also a mass that was once luminous white, and then cherry red. The object was moving against the wind. [Note from vog: if the wind was blowing from the northeast and the object was flying west and then southwest, it was not flying against the wind!] (J.

Young Lightfoot approached the UFO so closely that he could touch it. It was a small flying saucer no bigger than a truck tire. The bottom was rounded and the top looked like a shallow plate, with a slight space between the two parts. David Lightfoot was injured on his face and hands by a burning jet that came out of the craft at takeoff. The top part kept spinning during the landing and this movement accelerated to take off.

Dean Margen, an amateur photographer, on an excursion in the forest around his hometown, ran down a small hill, crossed a thicket and found himself in the open air. He directed his gaze to the sky and almost fell back in terror. "Seven meters above my head, I saw the metal base of a huge circular craft, absolutely motionless as if suspended in the air. On top there was a red-colored dome, the craft started moving." He had time to arm his camera and take a picture. It was then 3:38 PM. During the same day, around 4 PM, a young newspaper carrier, Donald Gene, who was cycling about fifty miles from Red Bud, stopped in front of the Green family house. As he glanced at the roof being repaired, he saw a silver "saucer" flying very high in the sky. (A. Schneider-H. Malthaner: "The Secret File of UFOs", De Vecchi ed., 1978, pp. 103-105)

A man wearing tights and a helmet was making repairs, and three other silhouettes were working around the craft. When Facchini offered his help, the men spoke among themselves with guttural sounds and one of them projected a kind of beam at Facchini, which knocked him down a few meters away. Then he was caught in a kind of whirlwind of air which threw him back to the ground. The work finished, a hatch was closed and the craft flew away with a sound like that of a giant beehive.

USA, Goshen (Indiana) in flight
At 8:25 PM a TWA DC 3 heading west flew over Goshen. In the cockpit were Captain Robert Adickes, and Captain Robert F. Manning, who was serving as second for Flight 117 to Chicago. As the plane flew at 600 meters altitude, Manning suddenly saw an unusual red light moving quickly behind them and a bit below their plane. He saw it descend and then continue on its way beneath the DC 3, approaching the plane. At this point the DC 3 was flying at 280 km/h. The mysterious object passed them at great speed while its brightness increased. It had an orange-red color and seemed like a molten metal bar sliding through the sky. Manning could make out a spherical shape at the top that shone intensely, while the bottom was dark. He drew Adickes' attention (...) who decided to contact the control tower. The UFO began to fly alongside the DC 3, and Adickes suddenly made a turn, but immediately the mysterious craft veered away. The pilot executed the maneuver a second time with the same result. He called flight attendant Gloria Hinshaw and ordered her to alert the passengers (to ensure their testimony). Suddenly the UFO began to dive at a dizzying speed towards the north towards South Bend. Gloria Hinshaw said: "It looked like a huge wheel of red color spinning close to our plane. The spectacle was extraordinary. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would have had a hard time believing the pilots' story. (...) (A. RIBERA: "These Mysterious UFOs" - De Vecchi 1976, pp. 369-373)

M. Pierrard and his daughter Madeleine, aged 14 at the time. "It was 6:30. As usual we were going up to the meadows with our dog to get the cows. When we reached the park I suddenly exclaimed: 'Dad, look at the sun, it's really close? (...) We heard a strange noise, it was like: hou! hou! hou! hou! and then a ball appeared. It was like a ball of fire. It came closer, then it landed in front of us. My father asked me not to move or go forward, for fear of being burned. It was after the ball was still that we realized it was more like a kind of saucer. I then saw, right in front of me, inside the object totally transparent like glass, a little man about 1 m 40 tall, arms spread, perhaps hindered by the diving suit he was wearing. He was absolutely motionless. He looked like a Michelin man. He wore a kind of motorcyclist's helmet with a Plexiglas visor and two tubes apparently connected to two tanks above his shoulders. What shocked me the most was that it seemed to me that he was constantly looking at me. I felt completely paralyzed during the whole observation. I felt a heat stroke similar to the one felt when sunbathing. I did not move during this period which lasted about two minutes. The object then rose like a spinning top, turning slightly on itself, rising in successive steps, emitting the same noise as at the beginning, after which it moved away and disappeared in the direction of Buzancy.

Enrique Caretenuto Botta (Enrico Botha, other authors write E.C. Bossa)), an aeronautical engineer, was driving when he saw a metallic disk with a shiny surface, 10 m in diameter and 4 m high (2 m high on the edges), resting in a field near an infrequently used road. The only activity detectable was a flashing light on the dome. There were no visible landing gear, the disk was slightly tilted on the ground. The whole had a smooth and shiny look, but at the same time like a kind of elasticity like rubber). He approached and entered through an opening on the side. (There was an odor of ozone and garlic. Three humanoids, about 1 m 30 tall, dressed in a lead-colored suit were sitting motionless on seats (in the turret). (Their faces and hands were uncovered. Their skin was tanned, their hair gray-brown, their eyes very large) He touched them: they were dead (and rigid). In front of them were control instruments and a kind of television screen. The humanoid sitting in the center held his hands on two levers. The other two were lying on curved beds along the circular wall). Above a flashing orange light. Very impressed, Botta left (he had only been inside for 5 minutes) and returned the next day with two engineer friends. They only found a pile of ashes (still hot, leaving a greenish color on their hands). They then observed, very high in the sky, a large cigar and two disks, one of which was hovering above them. Then the two disks entered the cigar which (became all red) and disappeared in a few seconds. (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "The Enigma of the E.T." - ed.

A woman, Micheline G., had a terrifying encounter at the place called "Givry" during a walk, around 4 pm, along the Loire. Before that, there was a great gust, a whirlwind, like a storm wind and she heard a strange laugh, heard as if through water. The laugh stopped abruptly and then she received a kick in the back, as if the knee was made of steel. She fell and was forced to lie down, still with her head held tight, and that's how the entity dragged her onto the path and into a bush of thorns and nettles. Then it said "There she is. We have her!" as if speaking to someone. She was dragged through the bushes into a small pasture and there it gradually let go. She wanted to call out but had no voice. She was able to stand up. She saw the tops of the trees bend, the branches shaking violently. It didn't last very long. There was then a bitter, unknown taste in the air. After the traumatic encounter there was again a violent displacement of air and she was blinded by a burning white light, while she felt an electric current in her body, like a brief paralysis. It was brief, calm returned immediately. (Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - p 210) Micheline headed for the lockkeeper's house in Givry, who treated the bloody and covered in multiple bruises victim, with finger marks embedded in her neck.

The witness was walking on the dirt road when he saw, near an abandoned barn, a light. At the same time he heard noises that he thought were of metallic origin. He wondered if it was wise to approach, but after a moment of hesitation, he decided to approach. He then heard voices perfectly. He thought it was people who had taken up residence in this barn to make "bagosse" (illegal moonshine). He had already heard that this had been seen in the region. (...) he slipped behind a "pitoune" (wooden balls) rope. There he heard the voices very well and he saw the object that emitted the light. It was a bright and shiny disc 6 m in diameter, suspended one and a half meters from the ground. (...) "Near this device, I clearly saw, because of the light that was still quite strong and coming from the object, a being 1 m 60 tall. He was well built, thin and looked rather young. (...) I was not afraid to look (...) and so I advanced." Up close the witness noticed that the man had a phosphorescent one-piece garment and on his face he wore a mask that seemed to be made of a piece of soft leather with holes for the eyes. It started in the middle of the forehead and ended just under the mouth. (...) the character spoke words in an unknown language (note from vog: detached syllables resembling German) Almost immediately the witness felt movement under the luminous object. Another character emerged from under the apparatus. (...) this second character is smaller than the first; he is dressed in the same way; his head is bigger and covered with a kind of hood. He has wide shoulders, a hunched back. At the waist he wears an object similar to a flashlight. With an awkward gesture he directs the instrument towards the witness, who immediately feels "mortified". (note from vog: paralyzed in place but seeing and hearing everything). (...) The two beings began to talk. The character with the flashlight approached the witness (...) he touched his forehead (...) with a hand with fingers deformed as if by arthritis. (...) his head barely reached his shoulders (...) he removed his hood. (...) L.B. had a shudder of disgust (...) The skin was wrinkled and tanned... deformed by a grimace, one could clearly see all his teeth... small and all alike. (...) because he was showing me those eyes with his fingers all deformed. (...) the area around the eyes had wrinkles like the area around the eyes of a chicken. And the black dots of the two eyes did not reach the same height, as if they were looking in different directions. I also saw that the face had no mobility at all, it was stuck there, period. (...) he put his hood back on. He stayed a few minutes looking at the witness's face. The other (..) started talking very loudly. The one in front of me left me on the spot to go to the luminous object. The two then climbed into the object by a short ladder. (..) L.B. remembers nothing else. (...) he was able to move again. (...) He was sitting in the grass. (Jean Ferguson: "Les Humanoïdes, les cerveaux qui dirigent les S.V." ed. Leméac 1978, p. 241 to 244)

USA, Chicago
The witness, being in an observation tower north of Chicago, saw at around 01:00 an object in the shape of a cigar. 2/3 of the front part were lit up with a glow resembling the color of the flame of a kerosene lamp. The last third of the object was dark. The UFO left a light blue trail in the sky, of the same length as the object itself. No noise. (Doc. FBI, Bruce Maccabee, translated by Jean Sider)

#1950, July 2
CANADA, Steep Rock Lake
A couple had gone, as they often did, to a secluded cove of Sawbill Bay, a narrow and deep arm of the lake, surrounded by rocks just above the water. In the afternoon they had pulled their boat onto the beach, eaten and drunk tea and were resting in the open air when it began to vibrate. The strange sensation persisting, the man had climbed a rock, which was cut at its top by a narrow slit through which one could see without being seen. "I saw a large, shining object floating on the water in the curve of the opposite shore, less than 40 m from the entrance of the farthest pass. I quickly descended and, trying to keep my calm, I told my wife what I had seen. We climbed the rock together. The thing was still there: it looked like two large saucers joined by the edges. On the circumference there were portholes bordered in black and spaced one meter apart. As the base was in the water one could not see the underside. At the top there were like hatches open and at the surface a dozen strange little beings were slowly turning in a circle. An object in the shape of a hoop was rotating around a central point 2.50 m in the air. As it was just opposite us it stopped and the little beings imitated it. Everything seemed to converge on the slit through which we were looking. Instinctively we stepped back. Glancing over my right shoulder I caught a movement in the bushes. A deer was coming down to drink. The circle or hoop and the little beings faced the deer. The hoop having started to turn again did not stop on the deer. My wife and I stepped back, we had the impression that the rock was protecting us from the hoop. This one was maneuvered by a being who was standing on a small platform. He had a skull or a bright red helmet. All the others wore dark blue helmets. All were the same size, about 1 m. All were dressed the same way and had something shiny on their chest that seemed metallic and something darker on their arms. They moved like automatons and did not turn around like us, but had to move their feet to change direction. I watched one of these beings grab the end of a flexible tube of a very bright green and lift it while he was in a certain position and make his feet turn half a turn to be able to go in the opposite direction. At the same time my wife and I heard a regular humming. They seemed to be drawing water with a tube and discharging something with another. We had to step back again because of the hoop and when we looked again, everything had disappeared from the surface of the object and it began to rise above the water. It was about 2.50 m high. The water where it had landed was reddish blue with golden reflections. The thing seemed to have a thickness of 4.50 m in the center and 3.50 m on the circumference. There was a gust of wind at the moment it flew at about 45° and quickly disappeared in the distance. Comparing it to two trees on the opposite shore I estimated its diameter to be about 14.50 m." (Frank Edwards: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 144 to 146)

#July 4, 1950
USA, White Sands (New Mexico)
Daniel W. Fry, supervisor of the rocket launching facility at White Sands, had gone for a nighttime stroll. Suddenly he saw an oval object slowly descending and landing 20 meters away from him: no sound except for the cracking of branches. He walked around the object and estimated its diameter to be 9 meters and its height to be 8 meters. He found no openings. He touched the shiny metal surface with violet reflections and found it to be extraordinarily smooth and quite warm. He lightly tapped it with his hand and immediately felt a tingling in his fingers. That's when a voice came out of nowhere, telling him not to touch it. Fry was so scared that he backed away, stumbled and fell. The voice spoke in correct English and then spoke in a way that was meant to "advance mankind" and Fry was invited aboard. A panel opened on the lower part and Fry entered the cabin which was 2.7 meters long and 2.1 meters wide and contained 4 chairs adapted for humans. There was no one aboard. But Fry was able to make a trip to New York in 30 minutes, and back. He had barely left the spacecraft when the panel closed, the craft was surrounded by a red halo and it rose vertically, while Fry felt as if he was being pulled off the ground and almost lost his balance. (Johannes von BUTLAR: "UFO, We Are Not Alone" - Presses de la Cité 1979 - pp. 39-41) On July 4, Daniel Fry wanted to go to Las Cruces to see the fireworks of the Independence Day celebration and missed the last bus. He decided to take advantage of the beautiful night to go to the desert. Suddenly he saw a shooting star, which went up and then down. It was a 20 meter diameter saucer that landed. A voice echoed, coming from a mothership still in the sky. The craft on the ground had no crew. In 30 minutes, Fry, who had entered the craft on the ground, made a round trip to New York, at 13500 km/h. (continued on July 28) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998) In 1954, the contactee Daniel Fry published a book in which he detailed several highly questionable experiences. However, he claims to have had a telepathic dialogue with an extraterrestrial whose name is sometimes written as A-lan and sometimes as Alan, who took him in his flying saucer on July 4, 1954.

5 p.m. Witnesses: two experienced ballistic arsenal employees, including Mr. Washburn. An object, in the shape of a pointed arrow, with the appearance of polished aluminum, flew horizontally. Then this triangle rotated 1/4 turn on its axis inversion and returned to its initial position. The object then made an abrupt right angle turn, accelerated and disappeared in the distance. Observation lasted 30 seconds. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner).

#1950, July 23
FRANCE, Guyancourt (20 km from Paris)
Lucky Blondeau, owner of the squadron bar, on the edge of the airfield, recounts: "Around 11 o'clock at night I was going for a walk before going to bed. I admired the starry sky on the airfield, where I was isolated more than a kilometer from the first house. Suddenly I heard a sound of wind. Turning around I saw at a hundred meters from me in the darkness, two gray shapes: perfectly round objects of 5 m in diameter and about 1.60 to 1.70 m in height. All around the edge was glazed, sort of rectangular portholes. On the lower face of each of the objects an ovoid door very thick (40 cm) opened and I saw a man descend from each machine. These pilots measured about 1.70 m and their hair was dark. They wore a gray-brown or dark blue suit. These men rushed to one of the machines where they placed or moved a kind of blade resting on something like rubber. They did this work with their bare hands, without tools. Despite my emotion I approached. Seeing me they seemed surprised but calm. "Are you broken down?" I asked. And one answered "Yes, but not for long". A minute later the repair finished, each of them advanced towards the door of his machine and opened it. From the inside a formidable lighting burst out. Hesitating I risked a look through the open hatch. It was the most perfect lighting, throwing no shadows. In the middle there was a kind of armchair and in front of it a radio station with 7 or 8 buttons. Above there was a huge oval wheel with a handle at each end. It was solid metal, covered with signs and buttons. Other devices were mounted on blocks around the armchair. I asked other questions but the answer was brief: "Energy". They entered, locking the doors. I had the impression that the metal of the machines resembling aluminum, weighed nothing and that the discs were suspended 10 cm from the ground without touching it. From their horizontal position these machines immediately passed to the vertical and thus disappeared, like shooting stars. After takeoff I heard a small sound of wind, like a breath. In all, since I had seen them, barely two minutes had passed. [IN REALITY: it would be a hoax that at the time largely abused the press. Its author admitted to having set up this story from scratch, without giving the reasons.] (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - pp. 86 to 88) (M. FIGUET / J.L.

#July 28, 1950
USA, unspecified location
(cf. July 4, 1950) Daniel Fry had a new contact with the extraterrestrial A-Lan. He explained to Fry that the saucer had two poles and that electrons were in free mixture between them. The control mechanism caused the electrons to be expelled through the two rings above and below the saucer. He was made to understand that it was a powerful electromagnetic field and Fry, being a scientist, was able to follow the conversation. A-Lan specified that his people had been living on board ships for generations. Tens of thousands of years before, their ancestors had built an empire on the Earth Lemuria, part of the continent Mu, now submerged in the Pacific Ocean, A-Lan said. They were of a very advanced culture and technology. This was also the case for the inhabitants of Atlantis, but the two races were rather rivals. There was an atomic catastrophe, which is related in the Mahabharata. The survivors fled to Mars (etc...) (...) As proof of his contact, Fry received a cruciform disc 8 cm in diameter which, according to analyses in scientific laboratories (note from vog: which ones, and where are the results?), contained a curious mixture of various elements.

The 8 year old girl was playing in her grandparents' barn,
when suddenly she found herself hundreds of meters away
in the farm yard, without understanding how she had gotten
to that place. A warm liquid was running down her leg: at mid-calf a deep, clean and absolutely painless wound of 2.5 cm long and 1 cm deep. She was bleeding abundantly: yet, the pants were absolutely not torn. (continued: summer 1966, France, in Alsace)

Belgium, Maldegem
(Source: GESAG, GS 552) Willy V. (aged 8-10) was outside the house with his younger sister Yvette, at the hamlet of Broekhuize, Maldegem. Yvette first noticed the phenomenon, looking up at the sky almost mechanically. It was a disc rotating on itself, flat on the top and curved on the bottom. At the periphery of the disc were short beams of grayish light. There was no emission of smoke and the light rays remained fixed on the edge of the object, like short pulsations. At 60 cm from the eyes, the diameter was estimated at 20 cm, while the speed of movement could be estimated as that of the planes of the time (900km/h). It seems that it was not the outer ring that was rotating around the vertical axis. Yvette specifies that sometimes the surface of the object sparkled, despite the absence of the sun but that the sky was clear. The object was moving from west to east, almost passing directly above the young witnesses at an altitude estimated between 4000 and 6000 meters. The children rushed into the house to alert the parents and when they all returned outside, everything had disappeared. From the moment of the observation until they returned to the house, about 3 minutes had passed. (Investigation by Jacques Bonabot, in September 1972.)

#1950, Summer
ESTONIA, Liiduvere
A 6-year-old girl spotted an "airplane" in a clover field not far from her father's farm. She wanted to go and take a closer look.
The airplane had no wings, only a long fuselage about 6 m long with silver ends and a black middle. Four small men, barely taller than her, were busy. They were extraordinary: dressed in bright green, with a red face and a kind of cap on their heads. They moved like puppets, one of them kicked the airplane, their eyes were fixed and did not move. The girl then told them that they were in a clover field in the village of Liiduvere, but suddenly she was seized with panic and ran home. Looking back, she saw the plane rise slowly. The next day she returned to see if the plane had returned, but she was scared when she approached the place. For a long time, for her, the word "airplane" evoked this cigar-shaped device. She had told her story to her grandmother and her mother, but they did not believe her. (International Ufo Reporter, vol. 2 n° 12, 1977)

Japan Sea
One morning in August, in the midst of the Korean War, a Russian reconnaissance plane - which, escorted by two fighters, had taken off from Vladivostok - was flying over the Japan Sea. A Japanese merchant vessel was sailing on the same sea and its crew often looked up to follow the maneuvers of the Soviet aircraft. The sailors were rightly worried; they were suddenly stunned. A round, very bright thing had just crossed the sky and stopped motionless at the height of the planes. Suddenly the reconnaissance plane turned around while the fighters began to whirl around the luminous ball and one of the two pilots took it under fire from his machine guns. The thing, which seemed insensitive and invulnerable, the fighter pilot seemed to want to approach it and at the moment when he was about to touch it, the sailors saw the Soviet one remain motionless for a few seconds, then waver, then tremble, then vibrate, then eject planes exactly like him, he who still did not move. There were three, four, five exactly identical ones arranged in a fan, connected to each other by the beak. Then there was the explosion. (...)

Two police officers patrolling in a car saw through the windshield an object slowly approaching the ground. The object seemed to them at first to be a parachute. Located at the tops of the trees it seemed to have a diameter of six feet. It landed in a nearby field. The police officers, after watching it for some time, wanted to take possession of it, but the object disintegrated, leaving only a slight odorous residue. Total duration of the observation: 25 minutes, during which the object emitted a light so bright that the witnesses saw that the grass did not even bend under the craft. (FBI doc. - Bruce Maccabee, translated by Jean Sider) It was a circular mass about two meters in diameter, thick about 30 cm in the center and 5 to 6 cm at the edges. In the light of their torches, they distinguished that the strange thing was reddish and that it quivered like something alive. In the darkness the thing radiated a faint red glow. "Should we pick it up?" one of the police officers proposed. After a moment of hesitation, Collins tried. He only managed to grasp pieces of a gelatinous material that broke and slipped between his fingers, leaving a kind of grease or foam on his hands without smell. In less than half an hour, the whole quivering mass had disintegrated, evaporated. The police officers are certain of one thing: it was alive.

When the California Central Airlines plane took off from Burbank-Hollywood Airport at 7:55 PM, neither the captain nor the co-pilot suspected they were on a collision course with a UFO. Five minutes after takeoff to Oakland, the plane was somewhere between Van Nuys and San Fernando, climbing to 4500 feet. Suddenly the captain, Cecil Hardin, drew the co-pilot's attention to an illuminated object approaching directly ahead. The co-pilot, Jack Conroy, later told reporters that the object was only observed for a few seconds before passing beneath the plane. "It's impossible to say how fast it was going and how far away it was," said Conroy. "But it seemed big, flying at a tremendous speed, and quite close, say 500 feet from us," added Hardin. "What really seemed strange to us was that it had absolutely no fuselage. We didn't feel the rush of air from its engine or its speed when it passed beneath us." They estimated the length of the object to be about 85 feet, with 6 to 8 bright lights arranged on the upper part, all of which were blinking. (NUFORC, Looking Back, by Bob Gribble)

Mr. A.W. Bearne, of Preston, saw above his house a kind of cigar spewing flames and descending at great speed. It changed direction and left horizontally. Its tail flames suddenly decreased in intensity and two large disks of silver-blue color appeared in front of the cigar at a higher speed. They moved silently at about 2000 feet and approximately at the same speed. Their minimum diameter must have been 15 to 20 meters.

Pope Pius XII (...) after getting up as usual at 6:30 and fulfilling his duties, went out for a walk. (...) Pope Pius XII approached a statue of the Virgin at the bottom of the garden (...) it was on his way back from this place that he looked up at the sky. To his great astonishment, he saw the sun dancing just like at Fatima thirty years earlier. Certainly the phenomenon had something worrying about it in more than one respect. The sun, although bright, did not dazzle him, he was able to look at it for long minutes without feeling any discomfort. The "sun" began to vibrate on itself, then it went zigzagging in the sky. It moved in abrupt, almost violent and very fast movements from north to south, then from east to west. Its trajectory often brought it back to its starting point from where it started the same game again. Then it stabilized in the sky and began to spin at an incredible speed. It had the appearance of a wheel of fire and from this wheel came out in disorder spiral bursts of light, pink, yellow, orange and mauve which shot towards the 4 points of the horizon. Suddenly there was a complete stop and the sun became normal again, but after a few moments it started its amazing game again (...) and suddenly the heat seemed unbearable. (...)
