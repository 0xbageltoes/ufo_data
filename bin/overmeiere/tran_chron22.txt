FRANCE, Chabeuil/Combovin
At around 7:45 PM, returning along the road where they had previously seen a "star" that seemed to be following their car, the Perez family stopped. On the left they observed an elliptical metallic object at 300 meters distance, about twenty meters above a sloping field. It was illuminating a foggy mist around it and towards the ground. Red and blue sparks were coming out from under its base. A dark mass like a rod was located above and to the left of the craft, which was stationary. After 8 to 10 minutes of observation, Mr. Perez decided to flash his headlights. At that moment, the craft slowly rose vertically, first without sound, then it started at an incredible speed towards the north, made a 180° loop heading south towards Châteaudouble. (M. FIGUET/J.L.

PORTUGAL, Leca da Palmeira-Oporto
A UFO, reappearing for 4 days starting on January 1st, always around 7 PM, was filmed by a team from a Portuguese television station. However, on the same days, around 5 AM in the Oporto region, witnesses reported hearing the sound of a "large electric engine". Each time, the sound lasted around 20 minutes and then stopped abruptly. The sound seemed to come from the sea.

At 9:30 PM, the 24-year-old witness heard a strange sound and saw near his house an object like a dark rectangular box about 2 meters high and 1 meter wide, above a tree. The 9-year-old sister, upon seeing the object, had a nervous breakdown. The next day a circular depression was found near the tree where the UFO had been, which suddenly disappeared. Later, no grass grew in the depression on the ground, while animals refused to pass through it.

CANADA, Montreal
Mrs. Malboeuf, sitting in front of the window, saw at 1:15 a.m. an object in the shape of an ellipsoidal cap land on the flat roof of the third floor, 30 m away from her, on the other side of the street. A second later she saw two 2 m tall ufonauts, dressed in white and wearing helmets, arrive at the edge of the roof, examine the ground, the street, and the sky, and return to the craft which immediately took off. Traces on the snow-covered roof: an oval surface of 6 m where the melted snow had refrozen, two other oval traces, and four footprints from the center to the corner of the platform. (Inforespace No. 36 pp. 17, 18 and No. 53 p. 23) Time: 1:15 a.m. approximately. Duration: 45 seconds maximum. Place: At Montreal, on Casgrain Street, at the corner of Beaubien Street. Witnesses: Mrs. Malboeuf and three other people. The site, in the heart of Montreal and close to a major geological fault, is at the height of a three-story house, on Casgrain Street, south of Beaubien Street. Our main witness, Mrs. Malboeuf, is in her fifties and lives in an apartment on the ground floor, with her son André, aged twenty-five. It is customary for her to get up at night, unable to sleep due to bronchial coughing. That night, however, she saw a white and luminous shape slowly emerge against a sky not covered. The object was coming from the block of houses located immediately at the southeast corner of Casgrain and Beaubien Streets. The object was coming from the north at about 5 meters above the roofs. Her astonishment was immediate: she knew nothing similar to this kind of oyster with lights. The object, which seemed white at first sight, seemed to her to be made of silver metal. Its shape, oval, very flattened and bulging only on the top, had at its base a series of four or five white lights, not very strong in intensity, and which seemed to continue all around the "oyster". She very distinctly saw the object reach the alley and reach above the house which begins, in the alley, the continuous series of dwellings, on the other side of the street. Yet, the UFO stopped as soon as it reached this point and, without any transition, descended directly, she believes, on the roof. The object was quickly hidden by the edge of the facade of the apartment, on the third floor, by the effect of perspective. It only took a second for two characters to appear, obviously coming from the object stopped at the moment.<br/><br/>Mrs. Malboeuf did not see them come out of this object, however. Soon, the two men reached the facade of this house and reached, one behind the other, diagonally, the corner of the roof of the adjoining apartment. At this point, for the witness, they seemed to be side by side. They seemed to her to be very tall and very thin, two meters perhaps, with long arms, without their walk seeming abnormal. She could not distinguish their face. She says that their head was covered with a tight "bathing cap", reminding her of the frogmen. These two characters, with a lot of naturalness, looked towards the ground and towards the street, a little around them, longer towards the sky, and returned on their steps. As soon as their head was no longer in the field of vision of the witness, the object rose about 7 meters and headed towards Bellechasse Street at the same speed as on arrival. It was not until the next day around 6 p.m. that she spoke to her son about it, as he had not slept at home the previous night. André went around the block of houses, found a way to get on the roof, and went there. For this, it takes a man with a good dose of audacity and more than the strength of a child to achieve this goal. At that moment, his breath failed him, his nervous state increased, and he kept this tension for several days. André was in the presence of a large ice surface with a depression towards the center with an average diameter of 6 meters. Two other small oval ice surfaces were placed near the large one; he went down and told his mother of his discovery. Naively, he had a glaring proof that could convince everyone that a flying saucer had come... But André did not know that in the matter of UFOs nothing is more negligible than a proof for those who refuse to know the subject. Saturday, January 8, around noon, the photographer Gilles Lafrance of the Montreal newspaper came. The two men went up to photograph the large snow circle. The articles, accompanied by the photos of Gilles Lafrance, which were then published in this newspaper and also in the Sunday Express, support in a positive tone the story of Mrs. Malboeuf. These articles "A UFO in the sky of Montreal", and "Say saucer landed on roof home", January 9, 1977. (Investigation by Marc Leduc for UFO Quebec - Summary by Denis Boucher for Quebec Insolite)

BELGIUM, Huy
A.B. in a car around 8:00 PM, noticed 50 meters in front of him and about 500 meters in altitude, a quite powerful light that seemed to move at the same speed as him (60 km/h) and flying over the road. The UFO was very bright, had a rectangular shape, surrounded by a round luminous halo, of a raw slightly yellowish white. Losing sight of the thing due to the path followed, he then found it again and the witness arrived at his home from where he continued to observe the UFO on foot. It flew over the Tihange nuclear power plant, and then stopped abruptly and turned back. During this unexpected maneuver, the witness felt for the first time worried. The object stopped above the power plant, higher and to the left of the long chimney. The witness then called his wife and children, and all of them could see for about ten minutes the strange spectacle, however only seeing the UFO as a rounded shape and the size of a tenth of the lunar diameter.

BRAZIL, Itapua (Viamao)
At around 9:15 PM, Felizberto A. Martins, Acclino Disconzi, and Armindo B. Jacobsen, all from SOPAMA of Porto Alegre, saw a large, bright object at an elevation of 20°, three times the apparent size of the moon. It was oval, with its top part red and its bottom part displaying all the colors of the rainbow. After 30 seconds of immobility, the object moved west in a spiral motion and faded away after 5 minutes on the horizon. Five more minutes passed when an identical object appeared on the horizon and stopped vertically in the same place as the first phenomenon. This second (or the same) UFO was quite close to the witnesses, about a hundred meters away. It stayed still for a minute and then moved west. This UFO was observed for 7 minutes.

CHINA, a small town in the province of Hubei
In the night, some friends and I were driving on a winding road in the mountains. When we arrived in front of the hospital of our town, we saw people gathered in front of the entrance, shouting. (...) A woman told us to look at the sky to the north and we saw a big glowing plate with an apparent diameter of more than 40 cm. The object was 200 m away from us, it seemed to be skimming the crest of the mountain. It flew slowly in our direction (...) Emitting a yellow light, it followed a spiroidal line without any noise. It passed over us, followed by a trail of nearly 30 m long. At that moment, the whole valley was brightly lit and the hospital was bathed in a yellow glow, something nobody had ever seen. The most astonishing thing is that the flying object, having made a turn, came back and passed over the hospital again. Everyone was very scared. (...) We rushed inside the buildings and we didn't dare come out until the valley was back in darkness. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials". Ed. Mercure de France, 1983, p.127, 128)

Lee P., 19 years old, in a car at 01:05 was driving towards his home in Prospect. The ground was covered in snow. He suddenly saw a rectangular object of 12 m by 3 m in color red flying over a row of trees 100 m away from him, at an altitude of about 40 m. The object was dazzling. The witness observed while driving and suddenly saw the UFO quickly depart towards the N.O. He arrived at his home: it took him 45 minutes to make a journey that normally takes 7 minutes. The departure and arrival times were confirmed by his fiancée and his mother. Under hypnosis, Lee explained that he was taken aboard the UFO, in a round room of 6 m in diameter and was put in the presence of rectangular entities, resembling jerrycans, the smallest one being 2 m tall, the largest one 5 to 6 m. Kinds of arms were coming out of the rectangular "bodies" that were burning and stinging while being cold, as if covered with a rough skin. (International Ufo Reporter vol. 2 no. 4 - 1977 p. 6, 7 reported by Inforespace, Belgium) A 19 year old young man, returning from his fiancée's and on his way home, driving in a Jeep, said he encountered at low altitude, a luminous object of red color, hovering in the sky next to the road. His next memory is of arriving at his home, with burning and stinging eyes, and calling his mother. The mother confirms that her son suffered from inflammation of the eyes and skin of both legs. There were also electromagnetic disturbances at the level of the Jeep. (investigation by Leonard H. Stringfield - The Mufon Ufo Journal, January 1977)

GREAT BRITAIN, Broad Haven
14 pupils of the Broad Haven primary school saw on Friday afternoon, a silver disc land in a field 400 yards from the school. The school director, Mr. Ralph Llewhelin (called 'Richard' by the Daily Mirror) was interviewed by the local press the following Monday. He had gathered the 14 schoolchildren, in the same conditions as for a "written exam", asking them to draw what they had seen. The drawings were remarkably similar: a large inverted disc with a red light at the top. When questioned separately, each boy said that the thing had landed for a minute or two. When Mr. Llewhelin wanted to go to the field to examine any traces, it was impassable due to the mud and he gave up. (continued on February 24, 1977) (personal doc. of vog)

(cf. November 1966) Mrs. Bowles, still accompanied by Mr. Pratt, was in the car when they heard a sharp whistle and at the same time the car had engine stalling. Mrs. Bowles remembered: "Suddenly we were both in this machine. One of the space men was the one who had examined us. Everywhere lights were blinking and flashing. The man told us that this was his domain, whatever that might mean. One of his colleagues took out a paper with all kinds of lines on it. In the center there was a circle surrounded by rings. All the men wore boots with the tip curved upwards. These boots were luminous, as were their silver suits. They wore a belt and in the middle of it a shiny stone, and the man closest to me pressed this stone or touched it. Ted thinks it had to do with exchanging messages. All this stopped quite suddenly. We found ourselves sitting in the car, which was stopped. It was near a river, we were completely lost. A large beam of light shone on the car, then diminished as it moved away into the sky.

(cf. February 4, 1977) Mrs. Coombs, with three of her five children in the car, was returning home around 8 pm when one of her sons noticed a light in the sky that seemed to be heading towards them at great speed. As the children began to scream in fear, Mrs. Coombs put her foot down as she feared the "thing" was intending to pass through the windscreen. But the UFO passed over the vehicle, made a U-turn and began to accompany the car, while Mrs. Coombs reached 80 mph and maintained this breakneck speed for 10 minutes. The object was no bigger than a football, glowed with a yellow light and projected a vertical white beam. Finally the car arrived near the house, but the engine stalled. Becoming hysterical, Mrs. Coombs got the children sitting in the back out and with them ran to the house. As she was telling her husband about the event, the eldest of the children saw the UFO disappear. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDELL: "The World's Greatest UFO Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p 141, 142)

ENGLAND, Winchester
(cf: February 7, 1977) Mrs. Bowles was this time in a car with a friend Ann Strickland, very skeptical about Joyce Bowles' claims about space men. It was pitch black, they were driving on a deserted road, the car engine lost power and stopped. "We both got out, and then we saw this oval, luminous shape, making a faint humming sound." said Mrs. Bowles. "A man came out and came towards me, hands outstretched. He looked Ann up and down: she was terrified. So was I, but I didn't show it. The man started speaking in a foreign language, then changed to speaking a little English. I answered "yes" but I'm not sure it was the right answer, as I didn't understand him. Then he said something to me that I understood very well, but I can't tell anyone, I wouldn't dare. He looked like a space man like the ones I had already seen, but he had longer hair, it fell down his shoulders like a woman's hair. I saw like curls at the bottom of his legs, and he was wearing some kind of gaiters. His touch was warm like a human being's. As soon as he had said what he had to say to me, he turned around and went back to the Thing. We saw it take off into the air and go off with a high-pitched humming. Ann and I were on our way to visit friends, but we went straight back to Winchester, home. Mrs. Strickland, 65, said: "I didn't hear what the man said to Joyce and she refuses to tell me, for a promise she made him. I had like a black out: too surprised and shocked to see him there, and scared too. These are no longer things for my age." After this encounter Joyce Bowles had health problems: respiratory infection, and her hands so swollen she couldn't take off her ring.

Spain, Seville
Antonio Delgado, owner of the bar "El Paseillo" on Sanchez Arjona Avenue No. 37 in Seville, aged about thirty, has just revealed that he is afflicted with an extraordinary anomaly: he has four phalanges in the middle of his hands instead of three. He claims that the four phalanges are a characteristic - for all those who show this peculiarity - of his extraterrestrial origin. Another example is Marcos Pinel from Seville who invented the magnetic energy system which earned him 320 million pesetas paid by the Swiss for the exploitation patent. He is therefore of extraterrestrial origin, but he is also human, with the peculiarity that he can always count on the help "of the others" to heal people, to predict lottery winning numbers, etc. At the age of 13, thanks to his extraterrestrial parents, he was able to make a trip to the United States where he stayed in Louisiana and where tall extraterrestrials with red hair and childlike faces taught him a lot of secrets. When he returned home a week later, he got the beating of his life from his biological father.

(cf: April 19, 1977) Pauline Coombes was in her bed trying to sleep when she saw a strange light that stopped above her. She then felt irresistibly drawn by a force and lost consciousness. When she came to, a few hours later, Pauline remembered being taken in a flying saucer and finding herself in a strange room with a dome-shaped ceiling, with two strange beings leaning over her. The rest of her memories are confused. (continued on April 24, 1977)

GREAT BRITAIN, Milford (or Broad) Haven (Wales)
(cf. February 24, 1977) Pauline Coombs and her husband Billy were watching television. Around midnight (around one in the morning) as they were about to turn off the TV, Billy saw through the window (Pauline Coombs suddenly looked towards the window) that the courtyard lamp was not working and that the neighboring farm was plunged into darkness, which was unusual. (these facts are not mentioned in the English report) At a hundred meters (in the frame of the window stood a monstrous being more than 2 meters tall) from the house appeared a strange bright shape: it was impossible to discern what it could be, and the young woman was frightened. The couple then clearly saw a large figure in a silver suit approaching the bay window as if he wanted to observe what was happening in the house. He wore a helmet with edges that fell over his shoulders. (He wore some kind of helmet with a luminous visor, a tube coming out of his mouth and going towards the back of his head) His hands were gloved, his feet shod in heavy boots, his face hidden behind an opaque window. He did not insist, turned around and disappeared into the night. (When the creature, with slightly luminous clothing, touched the window, it began to vibrate loudly) The giant had a very slow gait. The dog, during all this time, was crouching in the farthest corner of the house growling softly. (from this visit the Coombs couple kept two tangible memories: the rosebush near the house completely trampled, and a television completely burned. Six months later they had to euthanize their dog who had never recovered from his fear. They called the police right away.) (Jacques DEGAS - Nostra - 28.4.1982) (for the underlined precisions: Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDELL: "The World's Greatest Ufo Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p 140, 141) They saw outside a giant being who must have been nearly 3 meters tall, because his head, which could not be seen, was hidden by the top of the window which was still 2.50m from the ground. This stranger was knocking on the window and the two spouses were terrified, as was their dog Blackie who had gone to hide in a corner. Billy called the police, but when two policemen arrived the giant had disappeared. The next day they discovered giant footprints 60 cm long that led them to a place where the grass was flattened and half burned, forming an almost perfect circle.

A patrol of 6 men and a corporal were doing routine work when at 04:00 an intense light appeared at a short distance, attracting the attention of a sentinel. Corporal Armando Valdès then moved away in the direction of the light, when another (or the same) suddenly appeared much closer. Taking a few steps forward, Valdès gradually disappeared for a few minutes before the UFO also disappeared. A quarter of an hour later Valdès reappeared gradually and exclaimed "Muchachos" before collapsing unconscious. In this quarter of an hour his beard had grown as it would have done in several days, his watch had advanced fifteen minutes and indicated April 30! (J.C.

MEXICO, Topilejo
On the federal highway from Cuernavaca to Mexico, Victor Gastorena Guerrero and Pablo Mujica Garcia, among other witnesses, suddenly saw a huge blue object in the sky. They lost sight of it for a moment but soon stopped to follow the trajectory of the craft. They saw a dark blue cylindrical beam of light coming out of the UFO. In an instant, the beam touched the ground, enveloping the vegetation and a rest area of about twenty square meters. The brightness was so strong that it seemed that this area had disappeared. The object rose and moved away quickly towards the northwest. A few moments later, the witnesses got out of the vehicles to see what had happened to this strange phenomenon. To their great surprise, the whole part of this environment, including the vegetation, was completely frozen. The plants, leaves, flowers, and grass were covered with frost as if each element was wrapped in a flexible glass. It was so aesthetically perfect that it was a visual enchantment. Witnesses tasted this ice without detecting any difference with the ice from a freezer. The area emitted an intense cold that extended to the witnesses. (report by Fernando J.

As she was returning, around 8:30 pm, from the match (or where her 19-year-old son had played) accompanied by this boy and the other children (18, 10 and 3 years old) the mother saw large circular lights above the coastal hills towards the southwest. As they pulsed and blinked, they rose one after the other and then seemed to approach the ground between the observers and the horizon. (the 10-year-old boy drew the configuration: a large cream-colored object surrounded by 6 smaller objects in green, red and blue).(...) When they reached the intersection with a road called Old Redwood Highway, one of the objects seemed to detach from the group and suddenly dive towards the pavement and approach within 12 meters. (...) the road was flooded with light, the intensity was painful. The mother drew the object which she estimated the diameter to be 15 meters. It had several portholes and two beams of light emanated from it.(...) The eldest daughter had also drawn an oval object with its red glow. She added an important detail: a face observing them through the windows. The silhouette resembled a frog head. (...) The mother, the 18-year-old daughter and the 10-year-old boy were taken with nausea and the boy vomited. The 19-year-old son and the 3-year-old girl had no physiological disturbances. (...)

Investigators: Ron Schaffner and Betty Parks. "We were walking the dog,
and she got excited about something. She ran off and I followed her.
When I caught up to her, we smelled this putrid smell, like rotten eggs.
As my friend circled around, we suddenly saw this creature, 9 feet tall
and weighing at least 500 pounds. It had brown, dirty hair and eyes that
seemed to be white. Its arms were so long, they almost touched the
ground. The creature chased us from under the bridge, across the soybean
field, all the way near our house. It was standing behind us and taking
very big strides. When we got to the main road, we no longer saw it."
When they got home, having told their parents about the event, the police
were immediately called. The police officers accompanied the boys to the
sighting location, but the young witnesses did not want to get out of the
car. For an entire week, one of the boys also refused to open the window

(cf: 7 March 1977) In broad daylight, the car of Joyce Bowles and her passenger Ted Pratt, was taken by an unknown force and deposited on a road far from the Petersfield Road, where it was driving. Two men emerged from a hovering machine less than 25 meters away and headed towards them. They were different from the men previously encountered by Ted Pratt. "They had sandy-colored hair, and they were wearing solid and metallic suits" he said. "They said they were there to help humanity, something about war. They were scared of our mania to destroy ourselves and pollute the atmosphere. They stretched out their hands and took ours. I was very scared. They were making signs with their hands, but I didn't understand. They said goodbye and returned to their craft. It took off and disappeared into the sky. We were there completely shocked. I suppose we had met them for ten minutes. Mrs. Bowles adds: "They pressed a small silver disc into my right hand. Later I had a special white mark there. They said they would come back, but I don't want that anymore. I feel like a marked person. It's not good to talk about it with people, nobody believes me".

The object appeared as a spinning top 45 m in diameter and very low above the hangar. The upper dome part had green and white lights illuminating the surface of the object. The guard sounded the alarm and a military team arrived on the scene. They encircled the area and launched a radar call, to see if the object could be targeted. But however, for some mysterious reason, there was no more electricity on the base and the radars could not come into action. As the incident was later reported to NATO headquarters in Brussels, UFO researchers were dismissed and told that it was actually a mistake in the observation of the Moon shining above the low clouds!

...having finished our work, my colleagues and I were on our way to the restaurant where we were going to have dinner, when, having looked up and contemplated the sky, I saw two luminous saucers stuck together in the dark sky. Looking at them more closely, I found that they looked very much like two pancakes with a point of contact in common. They floated like two dead leaves above the valley. They went up, down, forward and stopped, all the while turning clockwise. Finally they began to go up following a spiral line and disappeared into the darkness of the night.

As soon as we arrived on the second floor landing of the building housing our offices, we saw through the window overlooking the lock, a shining object above the one kilometer wide river. This object was as big as the largest existing bowls. It was turning slowly, silently, and it was surrounded by a grayish ring similar to Saturn's. The object was 40° above the water's surface and followed the course of the river. (...) When it arrived under the building overlooking the river, near the boats, we could clearly distinguish it. It was an elongated sphere and its ring was composed of ten small, equally sized, luminous balls. To be more precise, these balls were only thin, luminous saucers. (...) Shortly after, the formation began to turn faster and higher in the sky, and suddenly everything disappeared. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials". Ed. Mercure de France, 1983, p. 129, 130)

A small entity wearing a helmet, dressed in green, with a tail. On its back it carried a box with red and blue lights. The box lifted and the entity flew away. The witnesses observed the lights of the box above the trees. There, they were joined by other identical lights, as if another entity was waiting for it. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 348) A father and his daughter were at home when they saw a small entity passing under the fence, approaching the house. The father thought it was a child and asked the daughter to turn on the outside lights. This alerted the entity, which turned around. It was about one to one and a half meters tall, dressed in green, including feet, and a helmet with a transparent part in front of the face. An antenna was fixed on it, on the back a box attached to its belt, and the entity had a tail. The stranger passed under the fence again, pressed something on the belt, and flew away like Superman, towards flashing lights further away.

Around 11 PM, Donald heard a noise coming from the door and as he headed towards it, he saw a humanoid about 1.2 meters tall about 1.5 meters away. It was dressed in light on top and dark on the bottom. Donald took a flashlight and a revolver and went outside to shine the light on the creature. Near a tree, not far away, his flashlight illuminated a UFO which quickly sent a beam of light towards Donald and his wife, who quickly returned to their home. He had a terrible headache, his ears were buzzing and he felt numb. This witness said he saw 6 or 7 UFOs and a lot of humanoids: he could even hear them walking on the roof of his house, and even an air vent was lifted. Between them, these beings were jabbering in a strange language. All this activity lasted nearly six hours and didn't end until 5 AM. (International Ufo Reporter vol. 2 n° 9 - 1977)

The first model (of the space shuttle), named "Enterprise", was released from the factory in September 1976. To test its aeronautical capabilities, a test program foresaw a series of gliding flights over the Mojave Desert. The first one took place on August 12, 1977. (...) Two hundred thousand people converged to the site. (...) The show began simply with the takeoff of a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet, carrying on its back a very strange cargo, which at first glance resembled a stubby DC 9 aircraft with a delta wing. The cargo was simply the space shuttle. (...) Having reached a height of 8,000 meters, the carrier aircraft began a wide turn, descended to 6,700 meters and dropped its 68-ton cargo. This was the beginning of a five and a half minute gliding flight towards runway No. 15 of the Edwards base. (...) The shuttle stopped in less than 3 km.

ITALY, between Sturgo and Frigento
Rocco Cirullo and Michele Giovanniello, both students and 24 years old, were driving towards 00:30 on the road connecting Sturgo to Frigento. In the bushes they saw red and green lights and, intrigued, they stopped and got out of the car. A modulated and continuous sound was perceptible. They then saw a silhouette with silver-white reflections, articulated like a humanoid, first motionless, take two steps in their direction. Frightened, the witnesses got back in the car and drove towards the village. They informed other people and returned to the site around 01:00. The glows, the strange sound and the silhouette were still there. The impression was so strong that the frightened witnesses hid back in the car. Curiosity got the better of them and they returned to the site. The humanoid took two steps and they fled again. As soon as the witnesses ran away, the being retreated. This back and forth happened two or three times in 15 minutes. The 5 witnesses returned to the village to get an electric torch. They were back on site between 01:30 and 01:40 where everything was still the same. A. Capobianco then slowly headed towards the bushes up to about twenty meters from the creature and shone a beam of light from the torch. The being seemed disoriented and two orange lights (in place of eyes) started to blink. This reaction scared the witnesses again who rushed back in the car to alert the carabinieri. On the way, fearing ridicule since they had no proof of their adventure, they decided one last time to return to the site. At the top of a hill they saw like a luminous cylinder divided into vertical stripes, the top resembling a dome. At 02:00 they were back on site: nothing had changed. Again a beam of flashlight was directed at the creature, whose eyes started to blink. It seemed to invite the witnesses to come closer and indicated with one hand the sky. Immediately after, an intense beam of white light came out of the top of its head, illuminating the surroundings and blinding the witnesses. This being about 2m tall never turned its back to the witnesses and did not bend its knees. Around 03:15 the witnesses returned to the village to look for other witnesses, but in vain. They returned to the site at 03:30 but there was nothing to see, darkness reigned on the hill. (Inforespace n° 48 of 1979, p. 16 to 19)

The Salyut 6 station took over in September 1977 and was still running when Salyut 7 was put in place almost five years later. Regularly occupied until May 1981, it received no less than 32 space ships, inhabited and uninhabited, including 18 Soyuz ships with crews, two inhabited Soyuz and 12 Progress cargo ships for resupply. The Progress cargo ships usually stayed at the Salyut for three weeks, after which they detached to return and burn in the atmosphere, thus freeing the docking port for another ship. It was during the fourth occupation that Leonid Popov and Valeri Ryumin set a new record for a space flight, with 185 days from April to October 1980.

At 2:00 AM Antonio Bogato La Rubia got up to go to work (he is a bus driver). On the way he saw in a field an oblong object, bigger than a bus and suddenly a blue light illuminated the place. Three silhouettes emerged and seized him, dragging him inside the ovoid object, into a circular room: they showed him images in which he was the main character, and they took some of his blood. Without transition La Rubia found himself in a deserted street of the city, saw the metallic cigar rise in the sky. He looked at his watch: it had stopped at 2:20. He asked a passerby what time it was: in reality it was 2:55. He had pain everywhere and blurred vision but he went to work. Two days later he fell ill with a high fever and a burning sensation all over his body. He was swollen, vomiting, and had a skin rash. (Bertrand MEHEUST: In Flying Saucers - Imago 1992, p. 33, 34) The beings, of small size, were as if covered with metallic scales, their arms were without hands and ended with a kind of finger. The body ended with a kind of single leg, and Antonio had the impression that they were sitting on a kind of stool. The end of this single leg was a foot that looked like a lid. They moved by sliding. (...) all around him were several beings, all rigorously identical, aligned in two rows on each side. In the room there was no ornament, nothing, no furniture, no machines. After a while he tried to free himself and began to shout "Who are you? What do you want?" At that precise moment the beings fell against each other like lead soldiers, without making any noise. A blue light lit up the ceiling and the beings were immediately standing up, but Antonio could no longer shout. Pressing one key after another on a "piano" the beings showed him images, in the following order: Antonio naked lying in an invisible bed for a medical examination, naked standing, standing dressed carrying a bag and nervously beating an arm, a horse pulling a cart and a ragged barefoot cart driver, an orange ball the size of a balloon next to him, a dog barking furiously trying to catch one of the beings who points a syringe at the dog which turns blue and is reduced to a pulp, a flying saucer factory with thousands of busy beings, a small train without windows in a tunnel, a wide avenue that looks like a known avenue to Antonio. After this last image he was expelled from the disk, falling in the middle of this street 4 km from his home, and found himself standing next to the railway not really knowing what he was doing there.

The USSR launches a new satellite of the Cosmos series, the 952nd of its name. It weighs a little more than 2 tons and is placed on an orbit at around 260 km of altitude under an inclination of 65°. It is a spy satellite, the fifteenth of this type since December 1967. (...) As usual, a rocket engine is fired a few weeks later, in order to send the satellite on an orbit evolving between 900 and 1000 km of altitude, its main mission is finished. It must be known that the radars are very greedy of energy, so much so that for the electric supply of this type of satellites, the Soviets have installed on board a mini nuclear power plant, powered by uranium 235. (...) The expedition on a higher altitude orbit is decided so that they do not fall back to Earth after a few months with their dangerous radioactive load. These satellites are launched in pairs, at a few days interval. (continued September 18, 1977, but especially see January 24, 1978) ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed.

Western specialists can observe that the procedure is respected, since on September 18, Cosmos 954, twin brother of Cosmos 952, takes off from the Plesetsk base to reach an orbit at 257 km. Meanwhile, a Cosmos 953, a reconnaissance photographic spy satellite, was launched from the Plesetsk base. On December 1, 1977, Cosmos 954 will be transferred to the high orbit that will ensure it a life span of five to six centuries, which is necessary for the 49 kilos of uranium on board to have its radioactivity fall below one millionth of its initial value. An atmospheric entry can then take place without any danger. ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, p. 101)

Around 4 o'clock in the morning, a huge star began to shine, sending beams towards the earth. Spread out like a jellyfish above Petrozavodsk, it stopped, covering the city with a multitude of light beams that looked like rain. Shortly after, the luminosity disappeared, the jellyfish transformed into a bright crescent and left in the direction of Lake Onega. In the grey cloud cover, a semi-circular hole formed, with a light red center and blue edges. Total duration: 10 to 12 minutes. (Boris CHOURINOV: "The Two Faces of Ufology in Russia" - May 1994, p. 16) At 4 o'clock, a gigantic disc-shaped object appeared, as big as a football field. The UFO would have directed 5 beams at the city, illuminating the city for 12 minutes. Paving stones and windows would have burst and been charred. Yuri Gromov also reported that a smaller object had detached itself from the first and that both had then moved away through the clouds.

Kurt Nilsson, 35 years old, on the spot to get better radio connections, declared: "As I was parking behind the TV pylon, the connection with my colleague became so bad that we cut the contact. It was 8:00 PM. Suddenly I saw an object of pale blue color against a mound in a hollow: it was an object with a dome, about 2 m in diameter. In front of the object there were three figures in space suits: they were standing to my left, at 100 m. They were about 1 m tall and grayish, very visible in the light emitted by the object. I was so surprised that I turned on the headlights to see them better, but then everything became dark, I saw nothing. For a minute nothing happened, then the place lit up as before and I could see as before. I was so scared that I started the car to leave. After 50 m the car stopped and I saw on the road the 3 characters, or 3 others that looked like them. The one in the middle had something in his hand that looked like a shovel, when he turned this instrument towards me the headlights went off and the engine stopped. This character was holding the shovel with both hands, arms crossed and hands on the handle in a "T". Again it was complete darkness and I thought "this is the end". However I started the engine again, I backed up, waited 2 minutes and turned on the headlights: nothing. Nine years before, on March 12, 1969 (see that date), a similar adventure had been experienced by Kjell Näslund, director of the station, almost in the same place.

Suddenly a comrade raised his arm towards the west and shouted "What is that?" At his cry everyone looked up into the sky and saw a shining object flying. It was huge, as big as a basketball. Its movement was that of an Archimedes screw. The object moved slowly, at a uniform speed, while turning in the opposite direction to that of the hands of a clock. (…) oval, topped with a dome or something similar. Its yellow color was somewhat reddish, its white, milky tail was composed of small sparks. At first, the tail wrapped around the shining object was quite wide, but as the object turned, it became thinner and thinner.

On December 17, the anxiety begins to really show. (...) The USA contacts the USSR, in parallel the French, English, Italian, Japanese and Canadian heads of state are warned of the danger.<br/><br/>Because, under an orbital inclination of 5° the undesirable satellite surveys all countries of the world. Only the extreme north of Scandinavia, the northern fringe of Siberia, Canada and Alaska and Antarctica, almost depopulated regions, are spared. (...) Yet it is still not known where Cosmos 954 will fall, in the meantime it accomplishes 16 tours of the earth per day.<br/><br/>On January 19, 1978, the USSR ambassador informs the American authorities that there is no risk of nuclear explosion, yet the news is still not publicly announced. NORAD headquarters informs Washington on the 19th that the fall will take place on January 24, 1978. That day, in the early morning, eastern time of the USA, (...) Cosmos 954 penetrates the atmosphere around 7 o'clock, which places the impact point on Canada!<br/><br/>Immediately the six large carriers C 141 of the nuclear intervention team of the "NEST" take off from Mc Carren International Airport, and from the American air bases of Andrews and Travis. Aircraft of the Canadian Armed Forces, based in Edmonton, also take off, to join the search team. The last quarter of an hour of Cosmos 954, its penetration into the dense layers of the atmosphere, at 120 km altitude, begins above the Pacific, almost vertical to the Hawaiian Islands.<br/><br/>Then, transformed into a ball of fire, the Soviet satellite approaches the coasts of North America, at the level of the Queen Charlotte Islands, almost at the American-Canadian border. After having surveyed British Columbia, the satellite and its dangerous load travels another 1700 km, to the district of Mackenzie. The NORAD surveillance stations, which have perfectly followed this descent, locate the impact point of the pieces that would have resisted the test of fire, in the region of the Great Slave Lake.<br/><br/>It is not known what became of the nuclear reactor. Did it completely burn during the entry or did it reach the ground? This last possibility seems the most plausible, in the measure that the uranium core was surrounded by a thick shield, whose weight is evaluated at half a ton by Western experts.

The witness, a Madrid merchant, went out to hunt partridge with his dog Mus. Strangely, while he was used to a determined hunting ground, the witness headed towards an unknown place. Some kind of impulse forced him to drive his car down a path. The engine stalled, the lights went out. He got out, lifted the hood, examined the engine, when the dog showed signs of fear. From behind some kind of mound two unknowns emerged, wearing green suits and yellow hoods on their heads, and seemed to be very interested in the dog. These individuals invited the witness to follow them, which he did. He found himself in front of a large metallic-looking object that was floating motionless a few meters off the ground. A cylinder descended from it, with a door that opened, and the witness entered it, escorted by the two individuals. He found himself in a circular corridor at the foot of an archaic ladder that led to the upper floor. He climbed it and reached a hemispherical dome room lit with white light. He had to show his gun to the unknowns and give them a cartridge. Then he was made to descend the ladder, get out, and saw his dog running ahead of him. When he turned his head, the craft was gone.

During the night the 15-year-old girl was suddenly awakened and sat up in her bed. From the window of her room came a strong light and she felt unable to move. Very close to the ground in the garden, a strange luminous dome-shaped object was hovering above the snow, motionless. At the base and at its top pulsed colored lights.
- You will get up and come join us...
- No! This silent cry she shouted mentally and, an idea, a very surprising argument pushed her to formulate this thought:
- No, I will not come because I am materialistic, very attached to the mundane joys of life. You, you are spiritually evolved and far removed from my concerns. Leave me, spirituality does not interest me. (...) After a time difficult to evaluate - more than an hour no doubt - the paralysis ceased and the craft, slowly, rose up. Frightened, the young girl ran to wake up her parents. They, through the window, could see without any mistake the ship which now at several meters from the ground, was moving away with its pulsating polychrome lights. (...)

"The light hovered above the garden. I was petrified and the laundry fell from my hands. Suddenly I was completely engulfed in bubbles of light. I saw three entities resembling men. They did not speak. They were about 1.5 meters tall and were dressed in bluish metallic clothing. They grabbed me by the arms and we went up together in this beam of light into some kind of room. Other men were there. I then had the feeling that they did not mean me any harm. A little later I found myself in the entrance of my garden. At the back I had a painful bump.

Three women, lying on a hillside to observe the sky in the evening, felt that a "missing time" had occurred. Shortly after this episode, a hypnotic regression was decided upon and an abduction scenario was then revealed. In 1989, a new regression took place at the instigation of investigators Keith Basterfield and Bill Chalker (note from vog: investigators like these should be regressed to their "non conception" in my opinion!) and there was then an additional information: such as a beam of light, or seeing one of the other women speaking to a male entity (note from vog: as all this is so interesting... was it really necessary to hypnotize this woman twice to get such meager results?)

(Stephan Gil) Around 8 o'clock in the evening, in Nepal, in a valley at the end of a lake, we had just taken a bath with my companion, when, towards the west, I saw some very grouped points resembling a bird migration. (...) but they had disappeared. A few minutes later, the famous birds were back in the sky. And suddenly, the points concentrated into a real flying saucer. Then the object moved slowly. (...) The object took a very vague shape; It looked like a small circle of smoke and lasted about 30 to 40 seconds. Suddenly, in the sky, in front of us, we saw an extraordinary phenomenon. Many groups of points were transforming into saucers, then into a circle of smoke. This phenomenon lasted nearly half an hour. These saucer-shaped objects were moving at an extraordinary speed. We felt that we were witnessing something incredible. (...) (Shi Bo: "China and the Extraterrestrials" - ed. Mercure de France 1983, p.172)

According to the newspaper Paris - Normandie dated April 29, 1978, an employee of an electronic components factory in the suburbs of Kuala Lumpur allegedly saw a headless ghost in her microscope. This employee was seized with spasms for two hours and thirty other employees were then victims of a collective hysteria. A few hours later, another employee observed the same ghost and fell into a trance. (Christian DE ZAN: "Guide du Chasseur de Phénomènes OVNI", ed.

POLAND, Emilcin
Jan Wolsky, an old 71-year-old peasant, was driving his cart harnessed to a mule through a forest near Emilcin (130 km southeast of Warsaw). "Suddenly I saw two small men standing at the edge of the forest path. When my cart arrived at their height, I realized that they were not normal. They were not dwarves, as I had first thought. They were not even men, but creatures of nightmare. As I am a believer, I thought I had a diabolical vision. I pinched myself and forced myself to regain my senses, but nothing worked, what I had in front of me was real. These monsters had a greenish face with two large oblique eyes. They wore a one-piece suit and sleeves came out of their webbed fingers.” These androids jumped into the cart without taking off and without effort and ordered him to continue his journey. A few tens of meters further on, they pointed out a small perpendicular path in which he engaged his mule. Arrived in a clearing, Wolsky, who could not believe his eyes, saw a strange object, the size of a bus, floating in the air a few meters high and animated by a slow rocking motion, like a boat on the water of a lake barely stirred by the wind. "The two dwarves seized me and took me under the engine. A platform came out and landed on the ground with a whistle. We took our place all three and were immediately drawn into the flanks of the ship. The room in which we emerged was dark despite many portholes. It was absolutely empty except for about twenty birds of the forest apparently alive but frozen in complete immobility. I was beginning to panic when two creatures entered the room carrying each in their hand a device emitting a rumble and clicks. One of them made me understand by gesture that I had to undress. When it was done, they moved their devices over my whole body. Then they put them away and I could dress again. Then I did not know what to do. They looked at me in silence without making a gesture. Timidly I headed for the airlock where I had entered. One of them slightly inclined his head and made a smile. As soon as I put my feet on the platform, it descended to the ground with the same whistle. I then took my cart and went home without asking for more. "(J.-L. B. - Nostra - 23.7.1980)

(cf: September 15, 1975, Industrial City) Mrs. Victor (nurse) was in the house of one of her patients, an elderly lady, when suddenly she fell as if someone had violently thrown her to the ground; during the minutes that followed she was severely beaten by an invisible entity. The old lady reported that she saw Mrs. Victor spinning and whirling on the ground, hitting obstacles in her path. She suffered numerous bruises, a splinter of wood pierced a vein and she broke a leg. She had to spend 6 days in the hospital.

BELGIUM, Quaregnon (Hainaut)
Location: an expanse of meadows at the foot of a slag heap. Four horses were grazing there. Gabriel Stoquart had finished pouring the feed into the troughs and was going to check the fences, on the side of the brambles. The boy who was accompanying him stayed to stroke the horses on the nostrils and suddenly shouted "Look there!". The witness then saw, coming towards him, a grey shape, like that of a hot-air balloon whose fabric was deflating and which was floating, oscillating. Mentally he made the reflexion that they would have difficulty getting out of this marshy place. He changed position to get a better view of this thing which was descending, which was now resting in what he called the marsh. But it was not a hot-air balloon he realised, dumbfounded. This thing started to vibrate, its greyish colour became luminous, an electric blue like one can see on certain illuminated signs. It was magnificent. Then this thing glided slightly and rose straight up at a vertiginous speed. During the ascent it was of a luminous, matt white colour. The witness and the child did not linger on the spot and returned to their home. As the witness lives opposite the police station, he went in to tell them about the event. The policemen were ready to go home, as by then it must have been around 4 o'clock. But two of the men accompanied the witness back to the spot the same day: they discovered traces of the landing with footprints of the craft and a kind of white powder sticking to the vegetation. The next day it was a team of 6 men from the Quaregnon police who came to the spot. Plaster casts were taken of the indentations (footprints), powder - like talcum - was collected in bags. Powder had soiled one of the policemen's hands. Back at the office, even after washing his hands, this powder still stuck to his skin. From the top of the slag heap one of the policemen filmed the activities with a Super 8. (Investigation reopened in 1995 by vog and Thierry WATHELET. Reasons: death of the policemen who had been in contact with the powder, accusations against SOBEPS, GEPAN, university professors, political authorities, the French gendarmerie… all of whom would have made the evidence disappear and some of whom allege that the case is a hoax. The hoax is formally contradicted by 4 inspectors of the municipal police still active in 1995. vog had the original file stolen from his home on 19 February 2000 by Claude Raffy, known in French ufology circles and since then untraceable, but fortunately there were copies in safety)

At 3:00 PM a Doctor of Science noticed a strange object in a clearing of the forest, behind his country house. He went there to get a better look. In the clearing there was an 8m long cigar-shaped object touching the ground at one end, the other being suspended at 45° relative to the horizon. Despite this inexplicable position the object did not move. When trying to approach it, the witness felt the presence of an invisible and impassable barrier (at the frequency of 7 Hz, according to the witness).

CANADA, Cabonga Reservoir, Vérendrye Park
Time: 10:15 PM. Witnesses: Two (Mr. Alain Mainville and Louis Roger) Investigator: Monique Taillon.
On the evening of June 22, 1978, Mr. Alain Mainville and Mr. Louis Roger were fishing at the Cabonga Reservoir, which is located in the Vérendrye Park. This reservoir covers an immense area of water, and is composed of many bays and islands, with different varieties of fish. The two witnesses were at the time of the observation about half an hour from their camp near the Brady Bay Campground, and were fishing in their boat. The sky was completely covered, and it was beginning to rain, the time indicating 10:15 PM when both considered raising the anchor, in order to return to their camp to avoid being completely soaked by the rain. They had just traveled a few hundred meters south of the reservoir when they suddenly saw in front of them, just above the water, an enormous disk of bright red color. Having not seen it coming, as it appeared all at once like turning on a light, one of the witnesses, Alain, taken by panic, stopped the outboard motor. His friend Louis, who was at the front of the boat, quickly lit his flashlight in order to signal their presence, as he thought that this intense light came from another boat that seemed to be rushing towards them. He then threw himself into the bottom of the boat. A few moments later, Alain shouted to him "immediately turn off your light". By doing so they realized that the object was already far enough in front of them, and they saw that it was clearly an object flying in the shape of a disk seen from the side that had a bright red color. This disk disappeared a few seconds later at full speed in a south-easterly direction. The observation had lasted about 30 seconds. The disk, as it moved away, seemed to shrink and become a little paler. It made no noise. Shortly afterwards, Louis, still at the front of the boat, distinguished glows like rays but could not say what their shape or color was. Alain, on the other hand, did not see anything like that. The two witnesses stated that they had no desire to experience such an event again. (UFO Quebec no. 25 ed. Courtesy Q.I)

At 12:45, the witness having finished her domestic work, observed a large light above the nearby hills. After a few seconds she saw the object, in the shape of a disk, pass 150 m from the ground behind the hill. Very excited, she called her son. In relation to their position, the object was moving to the right while projecting two beams of red light apparently directed towards them. They had a moment of panic. Meanwhile, Laura's husband returned home and continued the observation with them. The object measured nearly 200 meters long and was barely 3 to 3.50 meters high. It eventually disappeared behind the other hills. (Collaboration of Larry Fenwick, CUFORN, Joaquim Fernandes, CNIFO, Willy Smith, UNICAT Project; listing of Victor Lourenço; CEAFI, Lisbon)

During the night, Francisco Nunez and his son, both mechanics, were travelling in an old 1933 Chrysler when, to their great surprise, the vehicle was diverted from its route, lifted into the air, while the engine stopped but the radio continued to work. They found themselves thus "surrounded by pleasant sensations". The father, who was deaf, was able to hear what his son was saying during the ascent. They then felt a great cold and were dazzled by reddish lights, which made them look down. The panorama that was revealed was the vision of an unknown city, with towers of buildings next to each other. There was a street 5 m wide, only one; no other streets, no trees, no people, no vehicles. The windows of the houses were coloured with a reddish glow and the buildings seemed brown. This vision only lasted a short moment, as the Chrysler seemed to be "flying" very quickly. Finally, the vehicle was back on the road, 9 km from the place where the ascent had taken place, as soon as it touched the ground, the engine started up again on its own.

(Source: Patricia Mason - Witnesses: Eugene Kline, Theresa Kline and Ken O'Neal
Investigators: Ron Schaffner, Earl Jones) The Roger Kline family lived on the outskirts of Butler, their property extending to the railroad track and to the edge of the woods. On July 8th, around 11 pm, Eugene Kline and Ken O'Neal, both 17 years old, were walking in the fields when they heard a strange noise in the bushes. Turning around, they saw an unknown creature, over 2 meters tall, with an enormous head wider than the body and large red eyes. They immediately panicked and while Ken ran towards the house, Eugene was rooted to the spot for a long time before he could join his friend. Eugene's father called the police, who came to investigate the scene. On July 10th, the creature was observed by other residents of Mansfield. (names in the police report, but not disclosed to the public) It was around 10 pm when a group of young people were doing cross-country near the railroad track. They called the Bellville police to affirm that an apparition of a large black creature with red eyes had scared them. The authorities were impressed by these consistent testimonies, coming from separate people. In the evening of July 12th, Theresa Kline was helping her father spread hay in the barn, when they heard in the distance the slow arrival of a train. When the train began to sound its horn in short and long intervals. The father went back inside and Theresa, curious about the warning of the train, decided to go take a look. She had not gone far before she saw the silhouette with red eyes. The creature emitted a long, shrill cry of pain. It smelled terribly. Theresa turned on her flashlight and the creature started to run. The sheriff, alerted, could not find any physical evidence of the creature, and speculated, with ironic skepticism, that the Klines were seeing some wild animal come out of the woods. (...)

Roberto Rodriguez was sleeping in his sister's guest bedroom when he was awakened by a humming sound. He got out of bed and went to the window. There it was! Like the fuselage of an airplane, but without wings or tail. Silver in color and very polished, like a mirror. There was a row of portholes along the side, but the witness noticed no signs of life inside the craft. The object emitted a kind of pulsing green light, seeming to come from its base. It was there, hovering. Rodriguez was about to wake everyone up, but in a flash, the craft was gone. (UFO Roundup vol 2 #35, September 14, 1997, Joseph Trainor)

Looking in that direction, they saw a pair of yellow eyes in the light of the outdoor lamp. Scott Patterson, whose car was just parked, turned on his headlights, and everyone saw a large furry bipedal creature walking towards the car. The whole company took refuge in the house to call the Stark County police. While waiting for the police, the creature appeared at the kitchen window. Patterson took out his .22 caliber pistol, Evelyn loaded a .22 long rifle. The creature stayed in front of the window for about ten minutes and was clearly seen in the light of the outdoor lamp. They decided not to shoot unless it moved. Suddenly it disappeared. The Sheriff arrived 15 minutes after the call, about 5 minutes after the creature disappeared. A strong smell still lingered in the area. Shonnan told reporters that it smelled like sulfur and ammonia.

At 4:30 PM, during a break from work, a 26-year-old lumberjack saw
a "vehicle" approach and stop where he was. A humanoid form emerged from it, whose face and lower extremities he could not see. This form came towards him, hands outstretched showing the palms. The being was entirely covered in a kind of bluish mesh. Panicked, the lumberjack tried to flee, but the being pressed a button on its chest which paralyzed the lumberjack. A few moments later he found himself inside the object, without knowing how it happened. There, small beings pricked his arms. After that they released him in a difficult-to-access place, about 40 km from where he was working. (Pierre DELVAL: "Contacts of the 4th Type" - De Vecchi 1979, p. 116-117)

Suddenly she felt the car lose speed, then she felt an incredible circular shadow that engulfed the car, which was then sucked up. When she came to her senses she was very, very high up. She had the feeling that the car was falling apart, the doors were banging as if it were old scrap. Then she remembers nothing. When she came to, she was in a semi-circular, matte yellow room, and in front of her stood a very tall man over two meters tall, who said his name was Dagon. He spoke without moving his lips and while he spoke Mrs. Carvalho felt "diminished in volume", as if her clothes were enlarged and her feet were floating in her boots. In front of this man there was no car, there was nothing. It was the federal police who found Mrs. Carvalho asleep on the road to Florianapolis, on the return journey. (note from vog: coincidence?

During the South American International Rally with a start on August 17, Carlos Acevedo was the driver of the Citroën and Miguel A. Moya Herrera the assistant, replacing Hugo Prambs, who suddenly abandoned the race on September 16 in Bariloche. On September 23 at dawn there were only 1000 km left to cover. They were driving at 140 km/h and saw behind them what they thought was a competitor, approaching at a dizzying speed with dazzling headlights. Suddenly the car began to rise and the whole interior was flooded with light. The engine stopped turning. Looking outside, they saw that they were about 4 m off the ground and the car was still rising. The steering wheel no longer responded. This did not last more than a minute and they were gently deposited back on the road, engine off. They then saw the light move away, it had the shape of a cone. In the shock they still drove the few kilometers that separated them from Pedro Luro and reported in a gas station what had happened: they feared not to be taken seriously, but they were told that this had already happened to other motorists in this place. But here are the elements to add to the puzzle: the odometer reset to zero in Viedma, indicated 50 km. However, the distance to Pedro Luro is 120 km. The fuel tank was filled in Viedma, and had a capacity to cover 400 km: however, this tank was now empty. (Pierre DELVAL: "Contacts of the 4th type" - De Vecchi, 1979, p./ 114, 115)

Four boys aged 13 to 16 were resting under a tree after a tiring excursion when they saw a shiny metal saucer in the bush about 500 m away from them. They then saw two strange beings dressed in silver suits who, instead of walking, silently glided over the bushes and fences and much faster than when walking. A third figure then appeared, carrying a gray metal box at his waist. These humanoids seemed to have no face, arms, or legs that could be distinguished at that distance. One of the boys had a camera in his bag, but he was unable to use it, as if he were paralyzed. When the humanoids moved away in the direction of their saucer, the four terrified boys ran away and told their story to the local police who conducted an investigation the next day. Ovoid prints 20 cm long by 8 cm wide were found, as well as a large ovoid print 13 m long and 7 m wide with 8 deeply dug triangular holes in the ground. (...)

I had just left my fiancée living in Mouzon, taking the departmental road CD 19, to return to my home in Beaumont, when I was at the place called "Le Fond de Limon" just before the exit of the wood, I saw with stupor on my right, a strange luminous thing. It looked like a kind of green cigar, but of a dazzling green, very dazzling. When I was close enough to the object, the engine and the lighting of my motorcycle suddenly stopped working and I was spontaneously plunged into darkness, except that I had the time to notice that the powerful light emitted by the object illuminated the ground and the landscape around. I tried in vain to engage several times taking advantage of my momentum, but the engine did not restart. The object was perfectly still and silent, suspended about 100 meters above the cornfield about 50 or 60 meters from the edge of the road. After moving slowly and parallel to the road, the craft suddenly launched into a turn and crossed the road barely 40 m in front of me, at a lightning speed, like a flash. When it had disappeared above the trees on my left, the engine and lighting of my motorcycle worked by themselves without any intervention on my part. I had not cut the contact during the observation. "(Jean-Michel LIGERON: "Ovni en Ardennes" 1981, p 112)

Amateur radio operator Hideichi Amano had driven his car to the top of a mountain to make a radio transmission. The engine stalled and the vehicle was immobilized. There were strange lights in and out of his vehicle and at the windows he saw a humanoid creature. Some kind of chatter came out of a "pipe" he had in his mouth. After a few minutes this vision disappeared and the car was able to start again. (vog: this is the "reasonable" account) (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 340, 341) Amamo had gone to the top of a hill to transmit radio messages without interference, leaving his two-year-old son asleep on the back seat. On returning to the car he found his little one surrounded by light with foam on his mouth. Getting into the driver's seat to look for help, he was unable to start. He then felt like a metal object being pressed against his forehead. And through the window he saw a strange creature with a round head, large pointed ears, big round blue eyes, the head resting on the neckless body. What was touching Amamo's forehead was a kind of tube coming out of the entity's mouth. For five minutes strange telepathic messages were passed through the tube directly into Amamo's memory. Later, under hypnosis, Amamo repeated them. Then the entity vanished on the spot, and everything returned to normal. (vog: is this the "ufological" account?)

Valentich Incident. Late in the afternoon, Frederick Valentich took off from Melbourne in his "Cessna 182". He was headed for King Island. He was 20 years old and relatively inexperienced for a night flight. At around 7:06 PM, Frederick Valentich called Melbourne Flight Service (M.F.S.). The radio contact lasted 6 minutes before being dramatically interrupted. The conversation was completely recorded and widely reproduced in the Australian press:
Frederick Valentich: It seems to be a large aircraft below 5000 feet...
M.F.S.: What type of aircraft is it?
F.V.: I can't confirm. It has four bright lights, which seem to be landing lights. The aircraft is just passing over me now.
M.F.S.: Can you confirm that it is a large aircraft?
F.V.: Affirmative. Given the speed it is flying, could it be a R.A.A.F. aircraft? (Royal Austrian Air Force).
M.F.S.: Negative. Can you confirm that you cannot identify the aircraft?
F.V.: Affirmative... (then three minutes later)... The aircraft! It's not an aircraft, it's... (transmission cut off)
M.F.S.: Can you describe the aircraft?
F.V.: It just passed over me. It has an elongated shape. I can't make out any more...it's coming straight towards me now...it seems to be stationary now...I'm orbiting it and it's orbiting me...it has a green light and a sort of metallic light outside... Wow! It's vanished!... Do you know what kind of aircraft I've observed? Is it a military aircraft?
M.F.S.: There is no military activity in this area.
F.V.: (7:12 PM) My engine is starting to run rough and cough.
M.F.S.: What are you going to do?
F.V.: I'm going to continue towards King Island...the unknown aircraft is still hovering above me...
M.F.S.: Identify it!... (Then a long metallic sound is heard, for 17 seconds, and contact with Frederick Valentich's plane is definitively lost.) No trace, no debris of the aircraft were found. (CSISOP report; Charles GARREAU: "The Pilots Testify: UFOs are Among Us" Article in Historia No. 421 - Dec. 81 p. 105) Frederick Valentich, at the controls of his Cessna, radioed the presence of an "aircraft" above him, which then approached and circled around him.

I saw in the sky 400 m away from me an object bigger than a bowl. It was dragging three tails behind it, like a Chinese kite. It was flying slowly towards the west. In this huge object, I noticed something like a big electric bulb that was turning on and off alternately, throwing out a yellow light. The three tails were white and each measured about 3 m: they were waving in the air behind the main body in motion.

ITALY, Torriglia (Genoa)
Fortunato Zanfretta, 26 years old, a security guard on board the Fiat 126 of the company, equipped with a radio in contact with the Genoa central, was making the rounds of the villas to be monitored. In front of one of them, he noticed white lights arranged in a triangle and, thinking he had to do with thieves, he stopped, turned off the engine and decided to alert the central. It was then that he noticed that the radio did not work, while the headlights and the dashboard lights went out. He took a flashlight to go inspect the villa. He saw no one, only these three lights, and the silence was absolute. He shone the flashlight on the gate, which was open, as well as the front door of the villa. He turned off his light and drew his revolver. Suddenly the lights approached him, passed in front of him, disappeared behind the corner of the house. Wanting to take the thieves by surprise, he headed for the other corner, and then suddenly felt a strong push caused by a hand. He stumbled and fell onto the lawn. As he fell, the flashlight lit up, he grabbed it and shone it at waist height, but he saw only large horizontal pipes, one on top of the other... at 3 meters high he found the head, dark green, 60 cm wide, huge and luminous yellow triangular eyes, inclined upwards. On the forehead something undefined, luminous yellow, with large irregular wrinkles, on the side some kind of algal edges and in front something like ears or straight, pointed horns, turned upwards. Hardly had this quick inspection finished when the terrifying figure disappeared and the night guard fled, trying to reach the car. As he ran he heard a modulated whistle, very loud, unbearable and a strong wave of heat. He turned around as if to ward off the nightmare he was living, but what he saw terrified him even more. Against the background of the sky stood out a large flattened triangle, the base of which was hidden by an immense brightness, so blinding that he had to cover his face with his arms. This light zigzagged towards the sky. Zanfretta reached the vehicle and he fainted, for 50 minutes only waking up when colleagues arrived and found him 80 m from the car, his body and clothes burning. Traces on the ground. Under hypnosis Zanfretta revealed the other part of his contact with these horrible beings. (Continued: December 1978)

Adele Holzer (43) was driving the 15 km between these two towns to get to work. She saw a UFO and stopped her car to observe. The saucer came at a frightening speed, then stopped 70 m above the trees. A green beam came out of it and she felt paralyzed at the same time she had the sensation of a telepathic contact: she should not fear, they were friendly, they were from a binary system (two suns) and claimed that humans and them had the same origins on the planet Phaeton (5 planets) of which all the resident inhabitants perished in a chain atomic explosion. The survivors are on Mars. After this message, Mrs. Holzer's car key remained bent, as a souvenir. (in Greek mythology Phaeton is the son of the sun god Helios, travelling in a chariot so badly made that it set the Earth on fire...) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

TIBET, Qinghai Plateau
One evening, around 9 o'clock, a worker came out of the tent, saw a phenomenon he had never seen before and shouted (...) Everyone rushed and indeed saw a huge crescent, several tens of meters long. It was silver from end to end and emitted a very intense light. Going up and down, it moved quickly in the sky like a boat in the current. At these two pointed ends, there were two particularly bright lights. We heard no noise, nor felt the breath caused by its movement. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials", ed.

(cf. night of 6th to 7th December 1978) Fortunato Zanfretta was "abducted" for the second time - an undocumented case, but mentioned by GUIEU (following 30th July 1979) (Jimmy GUIEU: "Our Masters the Extraterrestrials" - Presses de la Cité 1992, p. 96) Three weeks after the first incident, he was driving in the same place at the same time when he saw the same suspicious lights again. As the first time, his engine stopped, he lost consciousness and remembered nothing of what had happened when he regained his senses around 1am. Hypnotised again, Fortunato told the same story, that he had been abducted again in a flying saucer and that this time a dozen humanoids had subjected him to a complete medical examination. These beings of around 3 metres tall had a greenish skin covered in hair, yellow eyes very slanted, big red veins on the forehead, a very narrow mouth and hands like ours. He understood what they were saying to him, thanks to a helmet they had put on his head which hurt him a lot. When they let him go, he was able to witness the take-off of the huge craft, triangular in shape and white in colour. (Maurice CHATELAIN: "The Messengers of the Cosmos" - Laffont 1980 - p. 201)

NEW ZEALAND, Cook Strait, Kaikoura
An Australian television crew was flying over the Cook Strait in the hope of filming flying saucers that had been appearing every day at the same time for ten days. They were not disappointed, they were able to film a magnificent one in front of them, without realizing that they had a similar one behind them, which was signaled to them by the ground radar operator. The photos of the film were so perfect that they were immediately declared false by the official scientists who examined them. (...) (Maurice CHATELAIN: "Les messagers du cosmos" - Laffont 1980, p. 203) Television journalists and the two pilots of their plane observe numerous unidentified lights in the Kaikoura region, between Wellington and Christchurch in the evening of the 30th. They are also detected by radar. The same night, during the return flight, a white light remains first fixed before accompanying the plane and then disappearing. It is filmed for several minutes and spotted by several radars. Other witnesses come forward in the region. (Science et Vie, special edition: 50 years of UFO, Atlas of Unsolved Cases, p. 60 to 63) Microscopic examination of the film shows a humanoid resembling a human fetus leaving the craft.

Veterinarian V.G. Paltsev, on his tour 500 miles from Moscow, found himself face to face with a ground vehicle. Three small humanoids with egg-shaped heads, with long fingers on their hands, were standing near the vehicle. As the veterinarian tried to approach it, he was knocked out by a strange force. When he woke up, he noticed that his watch had stopped. Above him the shape of a disc of fire was disappearing. Dr. Paltsev returned home, continued to work as if nothing had happened. But at night, very often, he dreamed that he had been taken aboard the vehicle while he was unconscious. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDEL: "The World's Greatest Ufo Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 36)

Dr. A.I. Nicolaev, a respected professor of history, had to be hospitalized for three months to recover from his close encounter. With three of his colleagues he was on vacation, camping in southern Russia, when they discovered an object shaped like a disk, metallic, partially hidden in the tall grass. One of the four people threw some stones at the object: the pebbles seemed to disappear into the machine. All four then felt under the influence of a strange force. Nicolaev lost consciousness, the others, although they were staggering and weak, carried him as best they could. While two colleagues stayed with the unconscious man, the third went in search of help. The two friends left on guard fell asleep, as if by enchantment. When they woke up there were two small figures, less than a meter tall, in astronaut suits and helmets. Seeing that the earthlings were waking up, the two extraterrestrials hurried to their craft. The object shone like fire as it disappeared into the sky. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDEL: "The World's Greatest UFO Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 37)

USA, on a road in Florida
In the evening Filiberto Cardenas, a technician, was driving with his 13-year-old daughter and a couple of friends in the car. The engine and lighting failed. The men got out and opened the hood.
Red and violent flashes of light reflected off the bodywork. A loud buzzing came from the sky and Cardenas felt himself becoming numb. He could no longer move. Soon his feet were no longer on the ground and his body began to lift into the air. He felt himself leaving the ground and screamed: "Don't take me, don't take me!" His friend, Fernando Marti, watched this incredible ascension. In the sky a large luminous craft passed and disappeared.
Cardenas regained consciousness in the middle of a road where he almost got run over, 26 km away. Marti swore under oath that he had seen Cardenas rise into the air. Under hypnosis Cardenas recounted that an alien was trying to speak to him in German, English, and then Spanish. To change languages this ET turned a knob on his chest! He underwent a thorough physical examination which left 108 marks on his body. Afterwards the UFO plunged into the water at high speed and Cardenas was taken to an underwater base where humans were working with the aliens. The different alien races wore costumes from different eras with capes and large chains. He saw the "throne" of their leader. Afterwards, in other encounters, Cardenas established a friendly relationship with the UFO occupants. He voluntarily got into a UFO with his wife Iris. Today he refuses to talk about his experience and has become very religious. (Marie-Thérèse de BROSSES: "Enquête sur les enlèvements E.T." - Plon 1995, p. 279, 280)

Meagan Quezet and her son Andre saw a UFO land; 5 or 6 entities
exited, speaking to each other in an incomprehensible language. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the
World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 351) A UFO landed near
her house and out came half a dozen small black men. It was around
midnight, she had just taken her son Andre, 12, for a ride, as the boy
could not sleep. They saw a red light coming from the sky. And
suddenly, they were less than 40 meters away from the craft that had
landed on the road and close to 5 or 6 small black-skinned men. One
of them had a beard and seemed to be the leader. "I said 'hello' to him,"
said Andre, "but I didn't understand what he answered me. I ran to
get my father." At that moment the entities jumped up, about 1.5
meters, and disappeared through a door in the craft. This door slid
shut, and the landing feet, long metal tubes, extended. The craft
disappeared into the air accompanied by a faint buzzing. On either
side of the door the craft had bright pink lights. The entities wore
white or slightly pink uniforms and white helmets. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDEL: "The World's greatest Ufo Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p.46, 47)

Mr. Philip S. Callaban and R. W. Mankins, researchers from the Gainesville Biological Research Laboratory, observed that UFO sightings coincided with the passage of swarms of spruce budworm moths. Experiments conducted in the laboratory by the two researchers confirmed that these moths created an ionization of the air under the influence of variable electric fields ("Science et Vie" of January 1979, cited by (Christian DE ZAN: "Guide du Chasseur de Phénomènes OVNI", ed.

Alexander Podkopaev was bringing hay into the barn when he saw two bright domes at the top of a hill 500m away. Suddenly he put down his pitchfork and started running in their direction. He was still about a hundred meters away when he saw one of the domes covered in a violet light and rise vertically into the air, then quickly move away. Despite his fear, but driven by curiosity, using tools and crawling through the bushes, the student (on vacation at his parents' dacha) managed to get within a few tens of meters of the object, which was not on the ground, but floating about a meter off the ground. "I couldn't believe my eyes. It was too crazy to be credible. In front of me, four dwarf creatures were standing in front of the saucer. They had arms and a torso of about normal size, but tiny legs. They were crouching near the machine and seemed to be spreading out shiny metal objects on the ground. They were wearing gray suits dotted with small black dots and a conical helmet of silver-blue color. A kind of breathing mask covered the bottom of their face and large glasses hid their eyes. Suddenly they turned in my direction. One of them raised an arm. It was so long that it almost doubled its size. They picked up the objects and I had the impression that they were entering the machine through the walls. I saw them for a few more moments in the dome through transparency. A green light covered the machine and it didn't take long to take off." (J.-L. B. - Nostra - 23.7.1980)

An amateur photographer took several slides of a ball of light rising from the sea on the coast of Gran Canaria. Juan José Benitez (note from vog: Spanish, ufologist, author of science fiction and ufological books) saw a UFO there, but General Emilio Garcia Conde confessed to him that it was a Polaris missile launched from a Soviet submarine diving in the Canaries and that it was to reach a target located in Siberia.

At 0:45, a restaurant (...) suddenly went dark. But at the same time, the inside and outside were illuminated as if it were broad daylight. Rushing outside, the owner discovered the entire agglomeration bathed in an intense light of an indeterminate color of blue, green, and mauve. The power outage was general. (...) His wife (of a fish farmer) noticed for her part the breakage of a wire of a high-tension line passing over the water, from which balls of fire escaped and disappeared into the water. The next day the fish farmer counted in his ponds nearly 1800 kg of dead fish. (...) The occupants of a car (...) describe the light in the form of a ball ... "of an indefinite color green blue mauve. It was motionless 8 or 10 m from the ground." The light seemed to stop two meters from the vehicle. When the car moved forward, it preceded it while maintaining a constant distance of two meters. According to their estimates, this mass could have been between 10 and 15 m in diameter. (...) After an autopsy, the death of the fish is attributed to a double cause: the passage of current in the state coming from the line that overhung it, and to a poisoning caused by aluminum in fusion.

At around 10:30, Arlindo dos Santos was hunting with two friends. As he was alone at the time, upon exiting a wood he suddenly saw a strange object landing 200 meters away from him. It was a vertical cylinder one meter high and 25 cm in diameter with a flashing light, alternately red and white, at the top end. Arlindo took out his camera from his bag and took a photo of the mysterious object which disappeared immediately. Arlindo then saw a second similar object, but a bit longer, which had the shape of a top with a propeller on top and a very thin point, 20 cm long, at its lower part. This object landed in the ground a few meters away from Arlindo, just long enough for him to take a photo, then it disappeared as suddenly as the first one. Arlindo then saw a third one a bit further away. This one had the shape of a narrow barrel, about 2 m long, with red and white vertical stripes, fins on the sides and it was topped with a large propeller. Arlindo also took a photo of this third object, which disappeared as quickly as the two others. It was then that he saw a fourth much bigger object, a classic flying saucer about 6 m in diameter and white in color, with portholes on the side, which landed a few meters away from Arlindo on four legs ending in flat discs. Arlindo then tried to take a 4th photo, but the craft directed a blinding light beam at him which terrified him so much that he dropped his camera and tried to run away, but he remained paralyzed in place. He remembers having seen then two humanoids equipped like astronauts, with a suit, gloves and a glass helmet from which a flexible tube connected to a cylindrical tank they were carrying on their back was coming out. They seemed to be talking with their mouth, but their voice was coming from behind them. The two humanoids brought Arlindo towards the saucer, each holding him under an arm (...) After climbing a 4-step staircase he was welcomed by a third humanoid who asked him if he was intelligent and educated. He answered no. The unknown one made him enter through a rectangular door. The inside of the craft was brown in color and smelled of dust and it was very cold; two humanoids equipped in the same way were sitting in armchairs. These beings had slanted eyes going to the side, straight nose, slit mouth as if they were laughing with thin lips and no beard. They looked like they were typing on a typewriter. At that moment Arlindo saw appear a very beautiful young woman, dressed in white, with gloves but without a helmet. She was quite small but very pretty, with a dark complexion, her dark hair plastered to the side and features absolutely similar to those of a young and pretty Terran. She brought him to the next room where there was a machine resembling a large refrigerator. (note from vog: let's recap: 2 men outside, 1 man at the top of the staircase, 2 men sitting in an armchair + Arlindo + 1 female humanoid + armchairs and computer keyboards + a large refrigerator: that's a lot of people and furniture for a saucer (not a sphere) 6 m in diameter!)(...)

CHILE, Antofagasta
During a training flight, the instructor and student pilot saw an unidentified object in the evening. The radar controllers had warned them of its presence. It was a kind of black triangle with two small tails. The UFO turned and moved away at a speed higher than the speed of sound. (Bob PRATT - USA who says the 29th). On May 26, instructor Danilo Catalan Farias, a pilot at the Cerro Moreno air base, made a training flight when he was warned by the control tower of the presence of an unidentified aircraft. Catalan was ordered, as was another pilot, to intercept and identify. The other pilot did not find the target. Danilo Catalan accelerated with the F-5 because he was about twenty miles from the unknown, whose echo was recorded on the on-board radar, suggesting that it was larger than a commercial aircraft. The object was then moving at a speed of 0.92 Mach and at an altitude of about 33,000 feet. Danilo Catalan managed to get close to within ten miles, which allowed him a visual contact while continuing the pursuit to be two miles from the UFO. At this distance, any aircraft in the air should be able to be identified. He described a black triangle with two small tails. At that moment the unknown accelerated and took a right-angle turn, which was confirmed on the ground. The speed of the unknown then reached at least Mach 3.
The description of the object and its characteristics resembles the American SR-71 apparatus, better known as the "Black Bird", because it is a very intense dark blue antireflective color. It is a strategic reconnaissance, espionage aircraft, manufactured by Lockheed California Co., and is the substitute of the Famous U-2. It made its first flight on April 26, 1962, and construction for the American Army began in December, under the appellation SR-71A. Its flight qualities are exceptional, it is capable of reaching an altitude of 24,400 m. and developing a speed of 3,220 km/h. (STENDEK n° 40, June 80).

… a young worker who was guarding the reservoir noticed, before sunrise, an oval silver object resting on the Gobi Desert, to the east of the reservoir. This huge luminous object 'took off, landed, without any noise or dust cloud. (…) He immediately phoned the Petroleum Fields Headquarters, which in turn alerted the unit of the People's Army stationed in this locality. Armed with tanks and cannons, the soldiers of this unit immediately went east of the reservoir. When they arrived there, they saw the shining object land again on the desert (…) they immediately dispersed to encircle the unknown object. (…) People approached the object more and more, which had a shiny and smooth surface and made no noise. To everyone's great surprise, the strange object took off and, at a dizzying speed, rose like a lightning bolt into the sky, vertically (…) When it rose, there was no gust of air, the grass and sand on the ground did not move.

At around 3am Antonio Ferreira was on guard duty at a construction site when he saw a strange craft land about 50 meters away from him. Suddenly he found himself face to face with three dwarf humanoids, each of them smaller than a meter. One of them directed a red beam of light at him, paralyzing him. The humanoids were wearing white suits that covered their heads, with a badge on their chests depicting a cross inside a circle. Antonio lost consciousness and woke up inside a small, oval-shaped, red capsule with gray benches all around and a dashboard full of instruments. He was then taken to a large room where there were about twenty humanoids: some were brown, others green, they had huge heads, pointed ears, a big mouth, and large eyes. They spoke an incomprehensible language. He was made to sit down and lost consciousness again. When he woke up he was back at the construction site and it was 6am. Antonio's dog, who had been with him at the site, was also paralyzed and afterwards refused to enter the site. The police found a perfect circle where the grass was burned. It is worth noting that at 3am all the television sets in the area stopped working and witnesses saw a luminous ball descend onto the construction site. (...)

…at 5 o'clock in the morning I was doing physical exercises on the sports field. Suddenly a fireball rose into the sky above the mountain. It was three times bigger than a full moon, was at 500 m altitude, and moved slowly in a southward direction. When it reached the zenith, a second fireball shot out of the first one, which immediately became a crown of light and gradually faded away in the distance. The second fireball, as big as the first one, also spat out a third fireball, similar to the first two, and the second one repeated what had happened to the first one and also disappeared in the distance. I saw a total of seven fireballs that followed each other and after a few minutes, the phenomenon completely dissipated. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials", ed.

From 22:45 to 22:50 (...) an unknown flying object was seen in the sky. It was a giant shuttle, in flames, whose cylindrical head had an angular diameter of 1.5° and the tail 0.5°. The whole object was red like a bar of iron taken out of the fire. Only the lower part of this shuttle seemed a bit dark. The object flew at a slower speed than that of an airliner. At a glance it moved at a height of 200 m from the ground. (...) Silently, moving horizontally, the shuttle flew over the camp of an army unit temporarily stationed in this village, then cut the road to Daba and, having made a 180° turn, it went back in the direction from which it had come. (...) When it reached the side of the mountain it was seen to rise slowly into the sky, lighting up the mountain which became all red.

This double flash is characteristic of a nuclear explosion. (...) Up to this date, double flashes had already been observed 41 times, and each time the culprits were either France or China, who were not signatories of the treaty banning such tests. (...)

At the controls were pilot Javier Lerdo de Tejada, mechanic Francisco Javier Rodriguez, and Luis de Luque Torre. At 11:05 PM, the Barcelona flight control center asked them to switch to the emergency frequency. (...) At 11:08 PM, the crew reported to the Barcelona flight control center the presence of an unidentified object on their left (...) A few seconds later, the UFO began to approach the Supercaravelle strongly: it was about twice the size of a Jumbo and had two powerful red lights at its ends. Between 11:08 PM and 11:16 PM, the gigantic object remained at the height of the plane (...) approaching to 100 or 200 meters (...) the commander considered these maneuvers so dangerous that he forced the passengers to fasten their seatbelts and informed them "that he could not continue flying and was turning towards Valencia". At 11:50 PM, the plane landed at Manises airport. During the next two hours, more than 40 witnesses attested to the presence of three very strange lights that remained motionless above the airport fuel area. At 2 AM, an alert Mirage F1 took off from the Los LLanos air base in Albacete, piloted by Captain Fernando Camara. It stayed in the air for 1 hour and 45 minutes (...) and attempted to intercept three unidentified flying objects (unconfirmed information says that the pilot heard voices of children telling him to turn back). The first UFO was spotted and pursued by the fighter aviation towards the south-southeast. The second towards Aragon and the third towards the Columbretes Islands until Mahon.

Coming out of the shadows, a voice ordered him to approach, which he did, to find himself face to face with a tall being with an ovoid head, bald, wearing a metallic-looking tight garment. The being ordered him to start. He obeyed, unable to oppose. On the hills overlooking Genoa he headed towards a small cloud descending from the sky and there his car was sucked into the cloud which turned out to be a giant spaceship. (...) Visit of the spaceship, cylinders with "a bird" and "a caveman" in a blue liquid. He was brought back to the ground. His colleagues, without news from him for five hours, had started looking for him. One of them suddenly saw a truncated cone-shaped craft take off and he drew his gun and fired several shots at the UFO. (...) With this fourth kidnapping, Fortunato Zanfretta's terrible experience came to an end. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Our Masters the Extraterrestrials" - Presses de la Cité 1992 - p. 97, 98)

1. Observation of a saucer near the ground by a pilot (December 9, 1979)
Investigation by GEPAN/SEPR4 and testimony before the Ancien committee
Former Lieutenant-Colonel of the Air Force, Jean-Pierre Fartek (F) was, at the time of the facts, a Mirage III pilot within the 2nd fighter squadron of Dijon. Today F is a pilot in a private company. F lived, and still lives, in the same village near Dijon. His house is located at the end of a subdivision overlooking the fields. About 250 m away is a cluster of trees with an average height of 15 m at most. On December 9, 1979 around 9:15 am, F and his wife observed an unusual object (called M afterwards) in the field near their house; the weather and visibility were excellent. M, which they estimated to be 20 m in diameter and 7 m thick, was hovering at about 3 m in height in front of the tree cluster, partially obscuring it. In perfect agreement with his wife, the witness F described it as:<br/><br/>
- having the shape of two overlapping saucers with very sharp contours, without windows or lights, being gray metallic in color on the upper part, and darker (bluish) on the lower part, with a perfectly defined separation between the top and bottom of the craft. This difference in color could not be due to a difference in lighting, given the position of the sun, constantly animated by very slight oscillations, whose frequency was not very fast, like something seeking balance, making no noise, causing no turbulence on the ground either during stationary flight or at the time of departure, leaving no trace on the ground. After a period of observation that he appreciates with difficulty, F sees M oscillating more strongly, he has the impression that M is leaning slightly forward (as a helicopter does after takeoff at the beginning of horizontal translation). F sees M leaving horizontally, at very low altitude, without noise, without leaving a trail, at very high speed and disappearing on the horizon in a few seconds. F testified to the Air Gendarmerie of the Dijon Air Base. He believes that other people have observed the phenomenon without daring to testify, including his neighbors and their children who would have made the same observation. This observation, by a professionally well-informed pilot of aeronautical phenomena, has never received an explanation. (COMETA Report, 1999)

CHINA, Zhejiang Province, Lanxi
Two truck drivers driving in convoy saw strange silhouettes on the road in two different places. They were entities measuring about 1m 40 tall, wearing helmets and space suits, carrying a packaged device with pipes on their backs. When one of the truck drivers got out to take a closer look, they disappeared. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 322) ("UFO Files", ed.

#1979, December 30
CHINA, Hun-Ming (Sichuan) or Yun'nan?
Astronomer Zhang Zhouseng from the Yunnan Observatory noticed an unusual flying object at 7:40 in the morning. A few minutes later, dozens of witnesses gathered to observe it as well. The thing's speed was phenomenal and it was flying at an angle of 30° in the sky. Due to its speed, it was difficult to get an exact idea of the object's shape. The back part was divided into a kind of trident with yellow and red colors. The whole shape was roughly similar to that of an electric arc with an approximate angular length of ten degrees relative to the celestial vault. Its brightness contrasted with the purity of the morning sky (Gilles DANJOU - Nostra - 18.11.1982)...; we were observing the clear sky at the Yun'nan Observatory. Suddenly the astronomers discovered at 20° from the zenith, a strange object flying from west to east. Its speed was similar to that of a high-altitude plane. We could not distinguish the shape of its nose, as the object was very high in the sky. What struck us the most was that behind it, we observed three streams of material particles in flames, very bright, red-yellow in color. From a distance, this object looked like an electric arc, with an angular length of 10°. At that moment the sun had not yet risen, an object of such brightness, emerging in the deep azure sky, offered a truly magnificent spectacle. During our observation we did not hear any noise. Judging by its way of flying, one could have taken this object for an airplane. (Apart from the astronomers of the Observatory, there were other witnesses)...
