Monique O'Driscoll and her 17-year-old daughter observed an object with several (about fifty) lights, shaped like a boomerang and silently passing vertically (at the level of the tree tops), which made her think of a bridge. There were heavy metal mesh parts with tubular parts here and there. (The object stopped above the frozen lake, and its red and blue lights were reflected on the ice ... (...) The two women finally stopped near the Nandick house, who were shocked to see the lights in the sky and did not dare to leave the house. (...) At the same moment Herbert Proudfoot and two friends in a car left the highway 84 in Danburry, when they saw the lights. Proudfoot stopped the vehicle to be able to observe better. The lower part was black and resembled the engine of the movie "Close Encounter of the Third Kind" and despite being only 1000 feet high, no sound from the object was heard ...)

FRANCE, in Yonne
At 8:00 PM, at the end of her work, Brigitte returned home in her car. "I saw, at the entrance of a wood, a light coming in the opposite direction that I identified as the headlight of a one-eyed car. I put my headlights in code and at the moment of crossing this light, it divided into many small, very bright but not dazzling balls. At that moment I had the impression of crossing a very bright zone. I had the reflex to brake, but my brakes did not respond. During this crossing (...) I had no sensation of rolling of my car. At that moment an obsession thought me: "they must not take me without Georges (my husband) and the children." (...) It happened very quickly, in a few seconds at most. Then I saw in my rearview mirror the small bright balls gathering behind the car to form only one, larger, which moved away very quickly. Then, looking at the road, I noticed that I was parked on the right side, in the grass, just in front of the road sign of the entrance of the village of V... In a state of intense anxiety I then got out of the vehicle, I noticed that the body was hot, as well as the hood, as if I had parked for several hours under a scorching sun. (...)"

In the evening of March 17, Dennis Sant, judge of Putnam County, was inside his home when he saw, along with his son and two daughters, an enormous triangular platform flying over his property. He would later compare this flying fortress to a city in the sky at 30 m from the ground and with a dimension greater than 100 m. The object flew close to his land in absolute silence and projected a powerful beam to the ground, which seemed to scan the surroundings. The observation time was estimated between ten and twenty minutes. Then slowly the object moved away without making any noise. (Jean THOMAS: "Synthèse Ovni", ed. Louise Couteau, 1999, p. 212) and for the account of other witnesses from the neighborhood: ("NIGHT SIEGE, The Hudson Valley Sightings" by J.Allen Hynek, Philip J.

For two and a half hours, hundreds of people saw objects in the shape of a boomerang. "I saw a beam of very bright white light coming from the center of the object and inside there was a small reddish object that broke away from the beam and flew very quickly towards the north. Then the beam went out. "The object was triangular and had lights all around it." "The object lit up two spotlights that seemed to be looking for something on the surface of the pond; then I could hear a very faint noise". "It was bigger than a football field". etc...

Bill Pollard, 26 years old, saw in the sky something like an airplane about to fall; the object did not fall, and he distinguished white, green and red lights blinking in a rhythm. The object rose straight up in the sky and Pollard was able to make out a large, rounded triangular shape.

USA, Mahopac (New York)
Albert Sylbert, a physics professor from White Plains (N.Y.), was driving home with his wife and two children after a bowling evening. It was around 10:30 pm. "As we approached our street," said Sylbert, "we all saw a V-shaped formation of lights. I stopped at a clear spot to get a better look at the phenomenon. I was the only one out of the car, and this thing was coming straight at us. It seemed to be about 25 feet above the trees, and it was still descending while flying at a speed of about 40 mph. As it got closer, it descended another ten feet while coming straight at me, about 300 feet away. I asked for silence in the car and I could hear a muffled engine sound, but the sound of an engine nonetheless. A bit scared by the approach of this craft, I went back into the car, and distracted for a moment from the object, it had made a very tight turn and was flying in the opposite direction. In the car everyone was screaming, and I drove like crazy to get home to get my binoculars." Sylbert is convinced that someone was playing a prank. He saw no mass behind the lights of the humming object. He supposes that the object was painted in a black night color to deceive the observers.

(Case No.: 19830524 A) At 6 pm Jürgen R. observed in a completely cloud-covered sky an object of red color, which came above a high-tension line, stopped there, and emitted a pyramidal beam which started from the top and formed gradually towards the bottom. Shortly after this beam decomposed, strangely again from the top to the bottom. During the observation there were disturbances to the CB of the witness, who was in conversation. The diameter of the red object is estimated between 11 and 23 meters. (JUFOF Nr. 30, 6'1983:161ff)

Stefan Gasparovic was literally sucked into a luminous craft (which he had already seen a few days earlier) and lost consciousness. He regained consciousness six kilometers away, suffered from vision problems, memory loss, and his body was covered in bruises. He was hospitalized for several days and later admitted to seeing "on board the ship, small ugly and fat beings, with pointed ears".

Taxi driver Benoit went to pick up the fortune teller Edmonde-Isis Athéna in the suburbs and headed towards the city center. Around 8:30 pm he descended the Rue de la Grande Armée, grumbling a bit, as for a long time now a small Peugeot 104 had been following him too closely. At the bottom of the Rue de la Grande Armée he stopped at the red light, the following car stopped next to him. He turned his head to scold it, but stayed silent, petrified with fear: at the wheel was a woman appearing to be 30 to 35 years old, with an olive to dark green complexion, wild hair with dominant brown, white and yellow strands. She was hideous, her features as if misaligned, like a human caricature, her green eyes like luminous. He asked Edmonde if she saw what he saw? She confirmed, emphasizing the details of a frightening ugliness that had nothing to do with the clownish makeup of a punk. Both of them then became aware of an inexplicable anomaly: in this neighborhood at the top of the Canebière (...) a mineral silence reigned. It was deserted, with a muffled, oppressive silence. The light turned green (...) and Benoit's CX jumped forward but seemed not to touch the ground. (...) everything returned to normal on the Rue Alphonse-Thiers.

LATVIA, Jurmala/Riga
Around 11pm, thousands of people were walking along the beach while concerts were playing. Suddenly, at least 60 bright lights descended from the sky to form a pyramid shape in the air, then a cigar shape, then a boomerang shape. The spectacle lasted 55 minutes, and then suddenly the lights disappeared, it was over. Among the spectators were musician Nickolai Schevtchenko (31 years old) and Riga Ballet dancer Normund Konrad Harris (26 years old). The latter already had contacts with extraterrestrials who answered his questions. Nickolai thus followed a few sessions with Normund and learned that the UFOs come from the Feta system, they are called "the children of Janos" and their spiritual leader is called Janos.

ENGLAND, Aldershot (Hampshire)
Alfred Burtoo (77 years old) accompanied by his dog, had settled by the side of the Bassingstoke Canal, not far from an army barracks; in order to fish there all night. He heard a nearby clock strike 1 o'clock and prepared to drink a cup of tea from his Thermos bottle. Burtoo saw a bright light descend from what he initially took to be an army helicopter. It landed on the towpath of the canal at some distance and the light went out.<br/><br/>
Within a few minutes he was approached by two beings measuring 1.5 meters in height, wearing greenish suits and visors on their faces. His dog, on the defensive, growled at them. They gestured for him to follow them and he complied (“Having 77 years, I had little left to lose” Burtoo would explain later). The trio arrived at a rounded object protruding from the towpath overlooking the canal and Burtoo bent down to cross its threshold. Once inside the craft he was asked his age and was asked in a shaky English to stand under an amber light, which he did. After a few minutes one of the extraterrestrials said to him: “You can go now. You are too old and too infirm to serve our purpose”. When he returned to his fishing rod, his dog was behaving normally, but his tea was cold. Shortly afterwards he saw the light of the UFO rise into the sky and then speed away at a dizzying speed. It was about two in the morning. (“UFO Files”, ed.

Robin Laconte, 28 years old, and Grace Jausiak, 18 years old, saw an object near Laconte's home, a little before 11 pm. "It was passing above us, and at that moment we could hear a faint buzzing sound," said Jausiak. "It went to the right, then to the left, and we watched it for half a minute. Then all the lights went out, as if it knew we were watching. (note from vog: hm!) The two women were scared and went into the house to find Laconte's husband. When they came out again, the object was moving away in a zigzag, then went straight up into the sky. (...) ("NIGHT SIEGE, The Hudson Valley Sightings" by J. Allen Hynek, Philip J.

#1983, Early September
FRANCE, Champeaux (Dordogne)
First week of September. Around 7 o'clock in the morning, Mr. Puyrabaud, 53 years old, left for the woods next to the hamlet of Mareuil in search of mushrooms. (Note: In France, one must be careful when looking for mushrooms, these events often happen...) Upon arriving in a clearing, he was surprised to see an ovoid craft resting on three legs. The craft had the appearance of a smooth metal of silver color. Each end of the tripod was terminated by a sort of rotating ball. Approaching it, he saw an open panel with a staircase unfolded resting on the ground. The top of the apparatus was surmounted by a dome with windows. The witness did not have the opportunity to further study it in detail, as the panel began to close, folding the staircase with it. The junction was so perfect that it was no longer possible to distinguish the opening. A strange silence had reigned, but a faint humming like that of a small electrical appliance was heard while the craft rose at the same time. Some small lights surrounded the perimeter, somewhat like will-o'-the-wisps. Very quickly, radiations of an intense blue took hold of the ground, preceding the departure of the craft at Mach 5 or Mach 10 or more. Instantly, the place where the object had been placed was covered with frost. An intense cold penetrated Mr. Puyrabaud's body. Abandoning the picking, he returned home to warm up without succeeding. A doctor was called: nothing could give the witness a little internal heat for about ten days. In short, the witness never felt well again and he died in 1986.

USA, Croton Falls (Hudson River)
Jim Crooke, a biological chemistry engineer specialized in laser optics for surgery, was returning home to Mahopac (New York). Around 2:15 he was near Croton Falls when he saw bright lights between the trees. These lights were approaching quickly and eventually descended above a small lake used as a water reservoir. The lights went out and the witness saw only a dark triangular shape, stationary about 5 meters above the water. "Then nine red lights lit up on the sides of the triangle. They looked like LED diodes used for digital display. Something came out of the lower part of the object, a red beam of light that seemed to inspect the water, like a probe. Sometimes the object, still silent, projected a "screen" towards the water. And the luminous probe seemed to be behind the screen or inside. If you look through infrared waves, you can see the distortion of the background. It's exactly like that." (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, p. 298)

At 3:30am, a farm employee who was riding a bicycle suddenly saw a very large, vaguely luminous figure with bright green reflections on the road in front of him. At that moment, his bicycle stopped. No matter what he did, he was unable to make it move. The being moved towards the witness. As it advanced, it became larger and thinner. It stopped and assumed a strange position, placing its right foot over its left knee, its right hand on its left shoulder and its right arm extended in the air. Having done this, it simply vanished and disappeared on the spot. The witness was so shaken that he refused to speak to anyone about the incident. It was only a year later that he agreed to be interviewed. (Jacques Vallee: "Confrontations" Laffont 1991, p. 255, 256)

Marisol Espinoza Fica, 22 years old, was driving late at night 1500 km north of Santiago, on a mountain road. Suddenly, she declared, her vehicle was sucked up by a powerful force coming from a round object floating in the air and surrounded by violet lights. The car having been deposited by the craft a few meters away from a ravine and the engine refusing to start, the young woman was forced to make a long walk to get back home. With her father she went to the police station to make a deposition and when they left, both stunned, they observed the disk in the sky again. "An enormous craft" specified the father, overwhelmed.

USA, Hudson Valley, New York
One of the most famous hoaxes is that of the Hudson Valley observations. From 1983 to 1987, thousands of people in the valley observed a boomerang-shaped craft, between 200 and 1000 feet (80 to more than 300m) long. The ship was signaled by multicolored flashing lights. In 1984, "Discover Magazine" revealed the truth, revealing that it was a giant prank set up by the "Stormville Flyers," associations of pilots of small single and two-seater planes. They had attached multicolored lights (like for New Year's Eve decorations) between their machines. On a signal, they turned off the lights, making the "ship" disappear.

#1984, March 21
USA, near Woodbury (New York)
Gordon Gebert (25 years old) was with his truck on the highway 87 near Woodbury around 8 pm. A flash of light in the rearview mirror made him blink several times. "It was still very far away," he said. "I watched it and the light became more and more intense". Then he lost sight of it. There was little traffic on the highway at that time. "Five minutes had passed when, looking to my left, I saw this huge thing that was on a collision course with my truck, at a distance of barely 100 yards and losing more and more altitude. It was an object shaped like a boomerang, dark in color, gray or black. The bulk of the mass was behind the lights, and some parts seemed to have depth. I slowed down to 15mph, rolled down the window, to better see this "plane" that I thought belonged to the US Air Force. There was no audible sound (note of vog: but the truck engine was running). It must not have been more than 100 feet in the air and was advancing in concert with the truck. It had the size of a Boeing 747. The lights seemed to rotate in a kind of prism, the purest colors I had ever seen."
He wanted to stop to see better, but thinking that he was practically alone on the highway and that this thing could be hostile, he abstained. The object stayed above the truck for five minutes and Gebert had the feeling of being watched. For a fraction of a second of inattention, the object disappeared, as if it had evaporated in an instant. ("NIGHT SIEGE, The Hudson Valley Sightings" by J.Allen Hynek, Philip J.

Bobby Boulanger, a 33-year-old engineer, and his family, were driving on 84 near Newburgh around 8 pm. They saw ten stationary red and white lights above the highway. The lights were so intense that they cast shadows on the ground. The family watched the UFO for ten minutes. Then something incredible happened: the lights went out one by one, and when the last one was extinguished, there was nothing left, it had all vanished.

At around 8:30 PM Armand Favilla was driving on the expressway when all of a sudden we saw cars pull over and stop. I looked up and saw a series of lights arranged in a V or boomerang shape. I stopped the car, the object was hovering less than 600 feet above us. I rolled down the window but I didn't hear anything. Then the thing glided, not in a motor-driven motion, but floating. We saw the lights move off to the east." ("NIGHT SIEGE, The Hudson Valley Sightings" by J.Allen Hynek, Philip J. Imbrogno, Bob Pratt, 2nd ed. 1995, Llewellyn, St Paul USA, p. 79)

USA, Croton Falls Reservoir (N.Y.)
Jack Grimsley, a 33 year old professional photographer, was driving on Route 6 around 8:45 pm when he saw the phenomenon coming from the south. "I saw large, intense white lights, about ten of them, arranged in a boomerang shape. The intensity was so strong that I had to shield my eyes. When they passed over me I saw some kind of dark structure connecting the lights, which were about 500 feet in the air. It was huge. It was flying at the same speed as my car, which was going 30 mph, so I was able to stay directly underneath it for a while.<br/><br/>
Then it turned, descended over the trees, and headed towards the Reservoir. I stopped the car and got out with my camcorder. The thing was hovering about 50 feet above the water, about 100 yards from the shore. At this point the lights were blinking different colors, and I could hear a very faint buzzing sound. I filmed for about ten minutes, and when I zoomed in I could make out the dark gray of the structure. The object was about 300 feet long. Then, all of a sudden, the lights went out and the object was gone. I stayed there looking around, but there was nothing to be seen, the object had vanished." This is when the strangest part happened. "I was walking back to my car, after what had seemed to be a quarter of an hour observation, but when I looked at my watch I had been near the Reservoir for over an hour. I must have been so stunned that I lost track of time." At home he was able to watch the footage he had taken, and he could hear the sound he had heard during the observation. However, when he took the cassette to his physicist friend to have it edited, there was nothing recorded on the film. (...)

Fred Ranaudo was camping in the woods. On a small hill he had made a fire, his vehicle was to his right, and he wrapped himself in the sleeping bag to sleep. Around 3:30 he was awakened in the dark night, without a moon. After a while, his eyes having adapted, he was sitting and looking around and heard in the undergrowth the sound of very heavy footsteps. He heard these sounds for a long time before he saw the creature. It was white, walking at a good pace, breathing loudly as if asthmatic, or out of breath after a run. It was 50 to 75 yards away, vertical, close to 9 feet in height. The creature was approaching and had not yet spotted the witness, who was downwind and whose fire had gone out. Suddenly, seeing the human being, the creature jumped, one big and two small jumps. Taken aback, the witness stood up and jumped towards his vehicle. "You know, this thing was very big, very wide, very white and covered in fur," he said. He saw it disappear into the night and then heard nothing else.

There were two rows of lights and they formed a curved V. It was hovering. The neighbor asked, 'What kind of plane is that that doesn't move?' (...) We all went outside and watched for a few more minutes. Suddenly it moved, sliding along a horizontal line. Then it was behind the trees and we couldn't see it anymore." The color of the lights was a pale green. ("NIGHT SIEGE, The Hudson Valley Sightings" by J.Allen Hynek, Philip J. Imbrogno, Bob Pratt, 2nd ed. 1995, Llewellyn, St Paul USA, p. 94, 95)

"It wasn't a "V", it was a triangle, because it had three sides, and it was flying low. I saw lights all around it spaced two to three feet apart. There was a light at each point. The object itself seemed very thin, like a bridge, you could see through the sides of this thing. The only solid parts were the base and the tip, the center was hollow. There was nothing there. There were like crossbars around it." The object was slowly passing through the sky and disappeared behind the trees. (...) ("NIGHT SIEGE, The Hudson Valley Sightings" by J.Allen Hynek, Philip J.

In the evening, around 10:30 PM, Don Duhart, a doctor of science, was with a couple when he saw the phenomenon. The arrangement of the lights gave him a feeling of déjà vu. He supposes that it was simply a large balloon carrying external lights. "The weather was very calm that evening, and when the lights went out, I clearly saw the shape, that of a rugby ball, at 1500 to 2000 feet in the air," he said. "You could see ropes or wires holding the lights. The object floated, and did not make any erratic movements at all." In his opinion, the object was made of plastic on a light structure, somewhat resembling a zeppelin, all inflated with helium, carrying a light electric motor that was remotely controlled from the ground.

The witness was 32 years old and was a programmer in a scientific company that collaborated on sub-assemblies for the Hubble Space Telescope. We will call him Bill. Around 10:30 pm he was leaving the office and driving on I-84 highway. He saw a very bright, circular object suspended in the sky to the north. As soon as he saw the object, it started to move and then Bill noticed there was a large black mass behind the light. As he continued on his route, Bill lost sight of the object. He exited I-84 to take route 52 near Stormville. Meanwhile it was 11 pm and he suddenly saw a large dark object in the fields: he first thought it was a new housing construction and, intrigued, he stopped to look. It looked like a large barn, more tapered on the facades and very smooth. While he was looking at the object, it rose without a sound. This scared Bill, as he was alone on the road. When the object was twice the height of the trees, the car radio emitted noises like when you put a magnetic tape and it turns too slowly. Completely scared, he put his foot down. After several minutes he saw a glow above a hill... when he got closer... the object was there! It was standing 300 feet above the trees and was illuminated by yellow and white bands of light. He stopped, turned off the engine and the lights... in the hope that this "thing" wouldn't see him. The object also turned off its lights and he saw the large dark triangular shape come and pass over the car. He only saw its belly which looked just like a destroyer from the "Star Wars" movies. Under the object he saw dark round spots, like tunnel entrances. In these tunnels there was a kind of white stroboscopic light. He didn't hear any sound. It seemed to be about 300 feet long. Then something strange happened: Bill had seen the object come over the car, he didn't see it leave. All he knows is that afterwards he was 200 m from the place where he saw the object around 11:30 pm. It was now 12:15 am. When he got home his wife was angry at his delay. That night he woke up and heard himself screaming: "Go away!" His wife confirms that he has been having such nightmares at least twice a week. He was so scared of having to come home at night again that he asked his boss for a change of schedule. Under hypnosis he remembered seeing entities on the road, feeling paralyzed and that these entities told him: "Don't be afraid, we have selected you. We need you." etc..

At around three in the morning, three men in a fishing boat, two miles from Campo Marino, saw a white light in the water, 500 to 1000 meters away from their position. They thought a submarine was about to emerge. But suddenly a round, grey metallic object came out of the sea vertically, turned 60 or 70 degrees and flew away at a dizzying speed. No sound, no stronger wave, no turbulence. (Investigation by Arcangelo Cassano of CISU, ITUFOR n° 10)

USSR, Belarus
The crews of two Aeroflot planes encountered a UFO in the sky of Belarus. For the plane flying from Tbilissi to Tallinn, this encounter at 04:10 was only a curious event. For the one flying from Leningrad to Tbilissi, the whole affair took a bad turn. The observation was made at 04:50, and the Minsk controller, wanting confirmation, asked them to turn in the direction of the object. The object stopped and sent a very powerful light towards the plane's cabin. Y. Kabatchnikov received the light full in the face, and the captain on the stomach. Two weeks later the captain was in the hospital, where he would die 13 months later. Kabatchnikov was still able to work for two months, then he became completely disabled.

a yellow glow on the ocean transform into two red lights blinking
alternately. The object was approaching the land and when it got close
to the coast the lights went out. It was a triangle with four white
lights on the back, and like a window illuminated from the inside with
a yellowish light on the underside. This triangle made a low, sustained
buzzing sound. It made a right angle turn towards the center of
Magnolia: it had a wingspan of about 50 meters. Suddenly it

Time: late night – 12-year old Monica Ortega was sleeping in her
bedroom when suddenly she saw two lights and felt a presence in the
room. One light was red and the other green, both were spherical. A voice
from the lights told her not to be afraid. She began to fall asleep, in spite
of the luminous globes presence ; she then felt caresses and kisses all
over her body as her nightclothes were removed. She felt something
spread her legs and a sharp pain soon after. She woke up terrified to see
a tall, blond, green-eyed being in a tight fitting outfit in bed with her. His
eyes were so green that it made her dizzy to look straight at them. She
felt very attracted to him. Apparently the tall blond humanoid had a silent
and invisible companion that never manifested itself in human form. They
told Monica that they traveled around the world and curiosity was the
motivation for their sexual contacts. (Scott Corrales, Inexplicata – The

Time : 2300 – The witness awoke feeling a sensation of heat and a strong
desire to go out into the garden. As he went out he was enveloped in a
red light that took him up into a small hovering object. Moments later the
small object entered a larger craft. He was met by several brown skin red
haired beings that took a blood sample and gave him a tour of the craft.
He was then taken to an operations base at an unknown location. Later
under hypnosis he was able to recall more details. He remembered being
taken to a cold place with white pointed mountains filled with holes. Later
he went to several different rooms and “shelters” where he was injected
with a white liquid and where other procedures were undertaken. In one of the
rooms he was visited by one of the tall blond beings that spoke to him by
using telepathy. A blond woman then entered the room. She wore a blue
jump suit with black designs on the cuffs and collar and a large black belt.
Eventually the witness was returned back to his home. (Buhler, Pereira,

USA, Inverness California
Time : after midnight – Steven Hall was overcome with a feeling that
something was watching him, when Steven and his wife looked out their
kitchen window. Surprised they saw two of the most absurd creatures one
could imagine. These creatures were no more than two feet away from the
window. One of them made eye contact with Steven, and stood there,
staring at him not moving at all. The witness said the eye contact was
“frightening” and felt as if the humanoid was « looking into your soul. » It
was difficult for Steven to break eye contact with the humanoid, but his
wife quickly closed the curtains. He then woke up another occupant and
the house that ran outside thinking someone was snooping around the
house. He ran out the front door and around the corner to see one of the
creatures from about 15 ft away for about 15 seconds. The creature
seemed surprised, and then it slowly turned its head, ducked down, and
made its way off into the thick evergreen. The witnesses described the
creatures as about four-feet tall with an extremely thin body. Their hands
extended to their knees, and they wore what the witnesses suspect was a
skintight suit that shimmered in the light. The eyes were a soft diamond
shape, there was a small rise for a nose, and the mouth was barely a slit
with a very displeasing look on it. (World of The Strange, 10/2001)

Time : late night – A motorist driving on a highway saw a star-like light
descend overhead at high speed. As the light crossed the highway in front
of her vehicle, she could see that it was part of a large metallic triangular
shaped object apparently made out of white metal with gray rivets. Three
beams of light shone down from the side of the object, which had rounded
edges. The object then began hovering above some railroad power lines.
The witness could see an opening in the center of the object. She then
noticed movement inside and saw a large round sphere pass by it. A
round object came into view, it resembled a large head with two very
large eyes, and the rest of the facial features were flat. The object then
followed the witness vehicle briefly before disappearing from view.

Time : 0230A – After seeing odd spinning lights floating around the house
the day before, the witness again saw the football size lights in the house.
The lights suddenly descended on the witness and he passed out. He then
woke up hearing three very loud metallic bangs. He then saw a light fly
from the house and into the sky. He then realized that six hours had
passed. Later under hypnosis the witness was able to recall floating up at
very high speed and entering an object. He then found himself inside a
round white room lying on a table in the center of the room. A light shone
on his face and several figures surrounded him. The beings were short,
with bald pointy-heads and flat faces. They were poking the witness with
several instruments. He was able to hear radio-like static in the
background and mumble-like words apparently coming from the beings.
At one point a large long needle was inserted in the witness navel, which
did not hurt, a dark colored liquid was injected into him. The witness was
later taken to another room where two white fog-like beings waited for
him, these two then took the witness to a huge room with transparent
floors. The witness was then escorted back to his house by the two
beings, which apparently floated him through the air. (D Scott Rogo, IUR

Time : night – The witness, who had already experienced many other
mysterious incidents in his house, was sleeping in the living room when he
heard the horses in the backyard corral whining restlessly, the dogs were
also barking. The witness looked out and saw several sparking lights near
the back of the property. When the lights approached the fence, which
separated the corral area from the backyard, he realized the lights were
really humanoid figures about 4-foot tall wearing helmets with visors on
the face area, and dark « spacesuits. » The beings appeared to be
stumbling as they tried to climb over the fence. At this point the witness
called his sister but she refused to come, apparently frightened. One of
the beings finally managed to climb over the fence and began running
towards the house. The witness then locked the doors and woke up the
rest of the family. When everyone was up the beings had already
disappeared. (D Scott Rogo, IUR Vol. 12 # 4)

Time : 0230A – A couple had been camping on the Ponderosa Caravan
Park located just east of the Pacific Highway when the husband woke up
and went outside, he then called his wife and pointed out a large cigar
shaped object with a brilliant white light at the front coming towards them
very slowly. The front light seemed larger than the full moon and lit up the
entire caravan park. The cigar-shaped object had windows along the side.
These seemed to be closed and gray in color, same as the rest of the
object. Five minutes later, three small disc shaped objects flew into view
moving towards the object. They traveled very quickly, zigzagging to join
the larger cigar. Each disc was gray, but showed an orange or rust colored
area towards the rear of the disk body, before a tail fin. One of the discs
stationed itself at the rear of the cigar and the other two on either side of
the cigar. Shortly they switched formation and flew behind the large cigar.
The wife reported what seemed to be an outline of a helmeted head in one
of the smaller discs. The cigar shaped object was emitting a low,
fluctuating humming noise, which rose and fell in pitch. The objects
eventually moved away from sight. The witnesses then went straight to
sleep. (Australian UFO Reporter Vol. 1 # 2)

circling around her. The lights vanished and the witness remembered
going to a nearby deli counter and seeing a very tall being, yellowish in
color, with tight kinky hair, a broad mouth and very large golden almond
shaped eyes. He wore a white uniform. His hands were very smooth and
his fingers very long. The being smiled at her and there was some small
talk. The witness then hailed a cab and went home. (The Communion

Time : late night – In an apparent dream-like state the witness saw a
small humanoid dressed in a
gold colored outfit come to the door of the apartment building and
attempt to enter. The frightened witness ran to her room. The small
creature then somehow entered the bedroom picked up the witness infant
daughter and struck her hard on the bottom. The witness began struggling
with the creature over the child. Suddenly she found herself on the roof of
the building with her daughter, the creature and two other persons, this
two were in a trance-like state and did not respond to her questions. The
short creature was holding a wand-like instrument, which it dipped into a
gold colored solution. The creature continued to hold the wand apparently
making a loud “whooshing” sound and gradually a large saucer-shaped
object began forming overhead. A blue beam of light came from the
saucer down to the roof like a « stairway. » At this point the witness is
unable to recall anything further. The being was described as a typical
“gray” type entity.(Duane Bedell, Heartland UFO Journal # 3, December

green sphere flying over the area leaving behind a trail of blue sparks, his
wife was at home waiting for him and watching television when suddenly
the TV image faded and became dark. She was unable to move as she
saw the door opened. A tall blond longhaired man with large blue eyes
then entered. He wore a white jumpsuit with a belt with a long black
buckle that had blinking red and green lights. Hanging from the belt was a
weapon-like apparatus. The being carried a jar and a small cup. He
poured a liquid into the cup and offered it to the witness ; she drank it and
then was given a small white pill to swallow. It was the last thing she was
able to remember. (Buhler, Pereira, and Matiel Pires Abduction at

small hovering object. There he was confronted by three short robot-like
beings. The small object then entered a larger « mother ship » type craft.
There he was taken to a compartment where a green skin humanoid was
preparing a serum like liquid. He was ordered to lie down on a bed and
the being injected the liquid into one of his veins. His body began to
shiver and then he apparently blacked out. He was eventually returned to
his home where he woke up. (Buhler, Pereira, and Matiel Pires Abduction

Time : 0400A – A 70-year old man driving back from his plantation
suddenly felt a presence in the passenger side of his vehicle and at the
same time he smelled a sweet perfume like fragrance. He looked at the
seat and was astonished to see the seat being pressed down as if
someone, unseen, was sitting there. Soon an image of a beautiful woman
became visible. She wore a beautiful translucent dress and had long black
hair. In apparent telepathic communication the woman apparently tried to
seduce the elderly man. At this point the elderly witness looked down at
the woman's feet and was stunned to see one normal leg and another leg
with goat like hoofs. At this time the terrified witness began screaming at
the bizarre entity and ran the vehicle off the road. Glancing to the
passenger set he found that the strange entity had vanished. (It seems
that this type of report is a worldwide phenomena, and cannot be
dismissed.) (Personal Communication – The Humanoid Contact Database 1984 by Alberto Rosales)

Mechanic Sergei Orlov of a freight train noticed a ball flying towards the train and eventually positioning itself in front of the locomotive. The train arrived at a slope and the brakes no longer responded. The speed increased and the locomotive became uncontrollable, the mechanic asked for the track to be reserved for him to pass at full speed. The station master went out to see what was happening and saw a red light in the shape of a disk or cigar, flying in front of the locomotive almost touching the rails. At the height of the station, the light jumped to the side and immediately disappeared. Immediately after the station, the ball returned in front of the train. The mechanics had the impression of hitting a wall, the speed dropped to 20 km/h to regain its speed shortly after. Finally the light disappeared. The train stopped, the mechanic got out to examine the wheels: then a bluish light appeared behind him and an unknown force pressed him against the locomotive. When the "embrace" loosened, the mechanic panicked and returned to his post, closing all the doors. Final result: saving 300 kg of diesel on the journey.

Russian bombers were on a mission in this border region with China, when the control tower reported a UFO at 22:35. It was of an elliptical shape and pale yellow in color. The object flew silently at an altitude of 2000-3000 meters and at a speed of about 600 Km/h from west to east. The phenomenon was surrounded by a luminous halo. The radar screens had no trace of the thing observed with the naked eye. Duration of the observation: 13 minutes. The object stopped for a long stay. Two hours later an identical object was again observed for 10 minutes. The bombers approached it at 800-1200 meters. The object emitted light from the bottom and from the top, but the ventral light was more intense. (statement of Colonel Alifanov, V., documents in possession of CISU, Italy)

Residents of six nearby towns said they had seen a UFO above Bulawayo. At 5:45 pm two Hawk interceptor planes of the Zimbabwe Air Force took off from the Thornhill base to go and see what was happening. The Bulawayo airport was picking up the UFO on its radar which was being observed by spectators on the ground. Round in shape, topped with a small cone, it shone so brightly in the afternoon light that other details were indistinct. The ZAF Hawks approached the UFO while it hovered at an altitude of 2000 meters, but then it rose to 210000 meters. The Hawks pursued it up to 9500 meters. ("UFO Files", ed.

#1985, July
AUSTRALIA, Hobart (Tasmania)
("Australian UFO Bulletin" - Dec. 1994 Victoria)
In winter 1985 (July, as it was an Australian country) Mr. G. lived on his farm 55 km north of Hobart, with his wife, three sons and two daughters. The eldest was then 16 to 17 years old, the youngest 7 years old. The eldest boy had accompanied his father to hunt on a neighboring property 2.5 km away to the northeast at the foot of the hill. It was quite cold, but the weather was nice. When wanting to return, the boy called his father, saying to turn on the spotlight, as there was a visitor. So Mr. G. put his harness containing a 12 V battery on his back to power a powerful lamp. In the north, he saw a blue luminous object in the sky about 5 km away. In the following minutes, the object was only 200 meters away and was really flying close to the ground. He then saw that lights (more than 7 - less than 11) were suspended in a row 6 or 7 m above the object: these lights were also blue. The object landed vertically, without any noise. It was so surrounded by luminosity that the whole area was bathed in an intense blue light. The object seemed to be in the shape of a huge bubble, with the upper part rounded. At mid-height there was a ring or a rim, the base was flat. The object must have measured 20 to 25 m long and 6 to 7 m thick. As soon as the UFO was on the ground, Mr. G. felt something burning on his back: it was the battery that was boiling and bubbling. The 17-year-old boy had moved away from the thing when suddenly they heard a strange noise, like something singing, it seemed to come out of the object, it could be a kind of unknown language to them. That was too much for the witnesses, they moved away from the place as quickly as they could, jumping into the car, to return to their farm, without looking back. The product of their hunt had remained at the foot of the hill. At home Mr. G. made a strange discovery: while his shirt and sweater were fine, his singlet showed a burned hole of 15 cm. As they had left the battery and the gun on the property, the father went to get them but then never returned to the place.

First week of October. At 5:15 the witness saw an object pass over his house, covering the surface of the 5 adjacent houses. The object was enormous, completely white, without any lights, although brighter than anything the witness had ever seen without being dazzling, in the shape of a disk and rotating. The witness went out of the house and, finding himself under the object, felt paralyzed. The object moved away, made a turn and at that moment the witness's son, aged 12, was also able to see it (National Uforeporting Center).

At 00:15, the airport's radar had the echo of several UFO groups and followed them for an hour and a half. The crew of a police helicopter, and civilian witnesses saw up to 60 objects in the night! The radar echoes showed 15 groups of 4 objects flying at about 288 miles/h. The control tower informed the police pilot that they had echoes but no "transponder" which automatically identifies airplanes and helicopters. The helicopter went up to 4000 feet, but the objects flew at 7000 feet. On the military side, it was affirmed that the jets had all returned at 10:30 PM. (National Uforeporting Center)

Statement of a fisherman: Around 8:30 PM, after a fishing trip "by lights" on the Razdolnaya River, when the "Vikhr" engine of my boat "Dniepr" stopped. It immediately started again and I was then navigating slowly. That's when a luminous object was coming, much faster than an airplane, from the north to the south. It had the aspect of a star, but bigger, and it was projecting a beam towards the ground. The beam had a great length, yet it didn't reach the ground, it stopped in mid-air. When the object was getting closer, the engine of the boat stopped again. I pulled the starter cord after checking the fuel level. The engine started again, but then there was a glow at the base of the coil that lasted about 7 seconds, before the engine suddenly stopped, all at once, without slowing down. At that moment the UFO was above us. It was moving away towards the south and my companion A. Khripunov and I thought it was an artificial satellite. Above Vladivostok, the beam coming out of it went out and our observation ended there. The engine of the boat wouldn't start again, so we rowed towards the shore, but the wind and the current pushed us to the opposite shore. We had spare candles, but we couldn't get the engine to turn. We rowed in the hope of meeting other boats. It was 9 AM before that happened. Those people gave us candles, but there was still nothing to do. It was 3:45 PM when we arrived, after rowing, in Vladivostok. (V.Alexandrov)

Whitley Strieber (author of horror, science fiction, and ufology novels) had set off a sophisticated alarm system around 11 PM before going to bed. He was awoken in the early morning by a strange noise, as if several people were in the ground floor room. The alarm had not gone off. A silhouette then rushed into the bedroom. The other conscious memory he had was of being sat in the woods outside his house. By piecing together conscious memories with those collected under hypnosis, it was learned that Strieber had floated in a "dark little iron bed" from his house to aboard a UFO. There, in a disordered room, he encountered four different species, a small robot-like one, a short one wearing workman's blue, and two others about 5 feet tall and very thin, one with slanted, black eyes and the other with black eyes like buttons.... (note from vog: hmm? Wasn't it specified that he is an author of horror and fiction novels?) (Dossiers OVNI, ed. Marshall Cavendish, Paris 1998, Special Issue, p. 46, 47)

Chet Snow, on vacation with a friend, took the opportunity to go by car at 2 pm to see the "Integraton", a building in the shape of a flying saucer, near Giant Rock (cf. von Tassel). Without understanding how he had veered off, he found himself on a track and got lost in the desert. By chance he discovered the small hill of milky quartz, about 20 m high, on which the contacted Van Tassel was visited by the ETs. He climbed it and lay down on the top to meditate. Just before closing his eyes he saw a big bright spot the size of a walnut and he thought: "It's funny, a walnut flying."<br/><br/>
A plane engine noise brought him back to consciousness, he felt full of energy, happy with his meditation. He heard a voice "Call it a meditation if you want. We, we are done." The plane was a small Cessna. It had just taken off. It passed so close that Snow saw the pilot's astonished face. He heard another noise: a car starting. He then saw a big American car. The voice, the plane and the car: it was simultaneous. He took his own car and checked the time: 5:20 pm! Three years later, after a seminar on altered states of consciousness, he returned to the place and then knew that he had been abducted aboard the UFO and examined by tall blond beings.

Approximately 200 people were able to see two triangular objects pass slowly and silently. "There was like a main cluster of lights at the front having a bit of a zeppelin shape, followed by a group of lights in a triangle". Another witness said "We stopped playing (football) to look at it, we couldn't understand why the lights were so far apart. The object was maybe at a height of 200 or 300 m and must have had a wingspan of 90 m. And it made no noise". (Bob PRATT - USA)

At 8pm the inhabitants noticed a red ball flying without sound coming from the northwest. Above hill 611 the UFO made an unexpected maneuver and according to witnesses, hit the rocky hill. A large beam similar to the light of an electric arc was seen. On the spot there were traces of destruction of vegetation and small lead and steel balls as well as nets that heated to 900° evaporated without trace in the air. Under vacuum, at 2800° it did not melt. After the incident, the blood of the researchers contained less than normal leukocytes and thrombocytes. The photos taken from the site were all overexposed.

Four huge UFOs, with one side a huge white light and the other side a red light, these lights coming out of sort of windows, descended from the sky to land on the side of a hill. The radio reporter spoke live from the observation site, while the Cordoba radio station had just interrupted its normal broadcast at 03:10 GMT to broadcast the news. A few minutes later, the radio station from La Cruz, 5 km from Uritorco, did the same. The reporter said that one of the objects, already on the ground, rose and flew over the spectators, to the point that people were scared. The UFOs remained on the ground for several hours and until 11:15 GMT there were news live from reporters who remained at a reasonable distance for observation.

(Source: newspaper "La tercera de la Hora" of 25.3.86) In the border region of Corrientes Province with Chile, more than a dozen farmers saw a saucer land. They spoke with the "occupants". One of the witnesses, Rito Melgarejo, explained to the Telam agency how the UFO landed, blinding him with its powerful lights. Two occupants came out, they looked like small Martians (note of vog???) and spoke to him in a language he did not understand, making signs with their hands. "I replied that I did not understand anything, and by the time I turned around, they were already gone". This sudden departure is confirmed by the other witnesses. Rito Melgarejo says he has had terrible headaches since these entities spoke to him, four days earlier. The Telam agency reports that there is a trace of 6 m in diameter of burned grass.

In the evening, balls the size of ping-pong balls, multicolored, were observed by people in the street. Their echo was picked up by the radars and jets were sent to intercept them. (Associated Press, 1986) Suddenly the radar picked up two bright objects at about 2000 m altitude and 15 km from the airport. Observed through binoculars, the objects appeared surrounded by a well-defined round halo of orange-red color and the lower part emitted flashing lights. At 7 pm the control towers of Sao Paulo and Brasilia confirmed the presence of the flying objects. At 8 pm, according to Cindacta (Integrated Defense and Air Traffic Control Center), there were already eight. At 9 pm a twin-engine plane piloted by Commander Alcir Pereira, with Colonel Ozires Silva, president of Petrobras (Brazilian national oil company), on board, detected a visual object (confirmed by the base radar), forcing the pilot to pursue it for about ten minutes. When landing, Pereira discovered three other reddish objects near the Petrobras plant, flying at low altitude. They disappeared towards the Sierre del Mar. (...) At 10:23 pm the Santa Cruz air base in Rio de Janeiro ordered the takeoff of an F-5E fighter. 22 minutes later a second fighter of the same type took off. From this moment on, the Annapolis base in the center of Brazil discovered several objects on the radar screens. At 11 pm a Mirage F-103 took off and 15 minutes later Lieutenant Kleber Caldas Marinho, on board one of the two F-5Es, approached one of the objects 11 km away. The color of the object varied between green, red and white, the latter being predominant. Kleber pursued it until about 300 km off the Atlantic Ocean, but had to return to base due to lack of fuel. The pilot of the other F-5E, Lieutenant Marcio Brisola Jordao, was followed for a few minutes by 13 UFOs that moved from left to right. One of them stopped in the air and accelerated to 1500 km/h in a few tenths of a second. The radar detected 13 points at 30 km distance. The sky was clear, the controller saw nothing with the naked eye. Captain Armindo Souza Viriato, pilot of the Mirage (...) accelerated to 1350 km/h. "I picked it up on the on-board radar while it was flying in zigzag. Suddenly, the point disappeared from the screen". (Incredible and Scientific, date?? p. 71 and 72) After the observation of luminous points by an airplane, confirmed by radar, several military aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to pursue the small multicolored balls for several hours. Some of the pilots saw the UFOs, others only picked them up on their radar screen. (Science and Life, special edition 1997: 50 years of UFO, Atlas of Unsolved Cases, p. 60 to 63)

Roosevelt Spurlock was sitting on the threshold of his house in Oneida. Mary Helton was in her Countryside restaurant where Margy Turner was finishing dinner. Vernon Stidham was at his home in Red Bird. All, however, saw the same thing: a large square object with red lights and windows, hovering just above the large Bullskin hills. Roosevelt Spurlock, a forest guard at the Peabody base, says it was not an airplane, he knows airplanes. Mary Helton said: "what I saw was really very, very big, all square, with windows." "It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen," said Spurlock. I was in front of my house and this thing was flying to touch the tops of the hills. At the front it had two red lights, and at the back too. Mrs. Helton said it made a piercing noise. "The thing was circling and came back on its path at a really slow speed," said Spurlock. No plane can stay in the air flying so slowly.

The witness was sheltering under a tree when he saw a large round object with two intense lights raising a lot of dust, producing a terrible wind, making an explosion sound before landing. The investigation revealed a small hole in the field, several burned potato plants, while the witness's shirt was also burned.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED HERE THAT XSTS LIKE THE F-117 ONLY FLEW AT NIGHT, IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS CORSAIR II TYPE FIGHTERS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CRASH, LOCAL AUTHORITIES, ASSISTED BY THE USAF, SEALED OFF THE AREA WHERE THE PROTOTYPE WRECKAGE WAS BURNING. CIVILIAN PILOTS RECEIVED ORDERS NOT TO OVERFLY THE SITE. (see 14.10.1987) (Gesag, Bulletin No. 96 September 97, p. 4)<br/><br/>
There are three visual witnesses, but no further evidence of an unusual aircraft crash. The witnesses are Andy Hoyt, his sister Lisa and Lisa's son Joey (16 years old). The aircraft crashed in the Sequoia forest near Bakersfield. The description of the aircraft seen by Hoyt, according to experts, matches the very latest secret military aircraft type F-19, which the authorities do not even admit exists. The witnesses were camping and initially they thought it was a UFO passing by. In any case, this aircraft, triangular and able to vertically position itself, pointing up, for unknown reasons, nosedived and there was a crash, with a tremendous illumination of the whole area. Just before the aircraft fell, Hoyt had taken some pictures. On Sunday evening, on his way home, Hoyt called Edwards Base to tell them what he had seen and the photos he had taken. He was just getting into his truck when he saw this black triangle, with a light in each corner. The camera was on the dashboard and he used it immediately. At the Air Force they started, with the press, to deny an aircraft accident, then to admit it, a crash with the death of the pilot. An hour after Hoyt's call to Edwards Base, someone was already at his house. "He didn't force me, but he would have liked to have the film that was in my camera." The next day, other Air Force officers invited Hoyt, his sister Lisa and nephew Joey to fly to the airport, to fly over the crash site. The place was quickly spotted and the three witnesses were invited to dinner at a restaurant, before going with them to the place where they had made the observation, to calculate the angles, said Hoyt. The military had certain measuring devices. They were then asked to speak as little as possible about what they had seen, but of course they could not be forced to be silent. Hoyt gave back his camera with the film inside. Some time later, he received the camera back, with the photos developed, of the three witnesses in their camping activities, but without any photos of the secret aircraft.

David A. Brown saw a Bigfoot looking for ginseng. (Quite the connoisseur!) He heard noises and, looking out on the horizon, thinking he had visitors, he initially saw nothing. Then he heard a noise behind him and, turning around, he saw a Bigfoot less than 10 m away. It was breathing heavily, as if it had just run a race. Brown was rooted to the spot, fearing the creature would attack him. He described it as being 7 1/2 feet tall, weighing 350 to 400 pounds, and giving off a horrible smell. It was covered in black fur that hung in large curls. Its face was simian, with large eyes, a flat nose, and large lips. It seemed to be old and had no teeth. It seemed to have injured its left arm, which ended in claws like curved nails. On the right side, the hand seemed normal with short nails. They stayed facing each other for about 4 minutes and the encounter ended with the creature growling and then leaving for the bushes.

Around 7:30 pm, two hunters saw a low-flying light with red, orange, and yellow hues, about 2 km away. (...) They estimated the size of the light to be about 100 m. The behavior of the object (note from vog: so the light suddenly becomes an object?) seemed to suggest that it was looking for a place to land. This maneuvering continued for an estimated ten minutes, then the two witnesses lost sight of the light when it descended behind a mountain, apparently to land. Throughout the maneuvers of the craft (note from vog: now the light becomes a craft), the witnesses heard no sound. In fact, an unusual, heavy silence persisted in the forest for a few days!

(Cufon Report No. 0315) At 12:05 AM, seven people (colleagues teachers) were leaving the house and saw a strange light at a very high altitude flying at an incredible speed. They saw an aerial triangular-shaped vessel and they say that this thing was flying in a crab-like manner. They were able to observe this when the object was getting closer. It was flying in a very smooth way, like a balloon low on the horizon. It crossed the entire horizon in 10 seconds from NE to SW towards South Mountain. There was no wind. At arm's length and at the closest, the object measured more than 5 cm. The lights were not headlights, but seemed to be windows arranged around the perimeter of the object.

#1986, November 17
Between Alaska, Yukon and Iceland, in flight
Japanese pilot Kenja Terauchi and officer Takanori Tamefuji of flight JAL 1628, carrying French wine, observed in the late afternoon, around 6 pm, to the right of their plane, two white and yellow lights while they were flying at 35,000 feet. They first asked Anchorage if any other planes were on their trajectory. The radar of Anchorage and that of a nearby military base responded that they were getting weak echoes around the Boeing 747. Suddenly the lights began to move erratically "playing like two cubs" said the pilot. Suddenly the lights faced the plane sending beams of light heating the inside of the cockpit. When the plane flew over the Eielson Air Force Base, near Fairbanks, the pilot noted behind his plane the presence of a "mothership" gigantic, bigger than two jets put together. He asked by radio for permission to make a complete tour of the UFO. For this purpose he then descended to 31,000 feet. The huge UFO followed the plane like its shadow. Anchorage then asked two planes navigating in the area to modify their course to intercept the Japanese 747 and confirm the observation. When they were close enough to confirm, Terauchi had just announced that the 3 UFOs had just disappeared. Finally, it was for about 50 minutes that the JAL 1628 was accompanied by UFOs. They flew at dizzying speeds, sometimes stopping abruptly. The pilot turned off all the lights of his plane to be sure that it was not reflections of light from his own plane. The radars therefore had the echo on the screen but later, when the investigators wanted confirmation, they were told that these echoes were due to a computer error! Independently on the ground, other witnesses confirmed the presence of the luminous objects. (report of the CBS network and EATHERIUS.] Three UFOs emitting green and yellow lights follow for half an hour a Japanese cargo plane. Two seem to have the size of a plane. The third, a sphere surrounded by a ring, is even bigger. The observation is partially confirmed by the radars.

The five witnesses were British airmen aboard a British Airways jumbo jet flying from London to Bangkok. First Officer Anthony Colin reported: Suddenly we saw what appeared to be another aircraft to our right. It showed two white lights, just like an aircraft. We watched it and saw that there was a green light where there should have been a red navigation light. It was coming towards us at the same level, and we banked to make sure we passed safely behind it. In front of our nose it began to accelerate, emitting a long line of small, vaguely phosphorescent lights which faded away to our left at great speed. At what distance? Impossible to say, but I estimate about one mile. It was not an aircraft, none of us had ever seen such a craft and we are all hard-bitten, cynical airmen, always with a scientific explanation for any event. But this left us speechless. (...) The director of the British Astronomical Association's "Artificial Satellites" section has an explanation: This is a standard description of re-entry into the atmosphere, with a greenish luminous colouring when the object disintegrates. I cannot say which satellite it was, but I am certain it was one. The rest was an optical illusion. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London, 1989, p. 53, 54)

#1987, late June
USA, Toms River (New Jersey)
On July 2, 1987 I was called by a woman named Gail, 36 years old, who a few days earlier, while she was in bed around 10 pm, heard a voice say to her (vog: what I'm interested in is to know if she heard this voice coming from the room, or if it was only in her head...): "We have come for you, do not be afraid." She then realized that her entire body seemed paralyzed and she could only move her eyes. Lying on her back Gail saw three entities in the entrance of her bedroom. That night she was alone at home, usually she was with her 17 year old daughter, who had gone to visit her father in Croton Falls (New York). Gail is divorced. The three entities were wearing a tight-fitting suit and were in line, one behind the other. She did not see the features of their faces in the darkness. About 5 feet tall, they had very long arms. What seemed to be their leader seemed to have difficulty entering the room, as if he was pushing against an invisible wall. From a side pocket he took out a kind of wand and turned a button that was there. The wand then shone with a green light (vog: that was his magic wand, huh..) and at that moment the entity easily passed through the entrance into the room, followed by the other two, still in line. They had big heads and big eyes. She did not hear them speak, but there were dull noises in her head when the creatures communicated with each other. (vog: so it was still IN her head then!) She wanted to scream, but could not. The leader stood to the right of the bed, the other two took their place, one to the left, the other at the foot of the bed. Those who were to the right and left placed their hands under Gail's head. The one to her left took out something like a completely white cotton swab and pushed it into her left nostril. This hurt her so much that she lost consciousness. It was as if she was falling from very high and then she does not remember anything. She woke up the next day around 8 am with a terrible headache. When she got up she started to bleed from her nose. In the bathroom mirror she saw that her nose was swollen, there was a rash on her neck, legs and arms. She had hoped that the experience of the night was only a nightmare. I learned that the same night, Gail's daughter and her father were followed by a UFO along Route 116 near Croton Falls. It was a large dark triangle hovering above the car for 5 minutes at the height of the tree tops. Examining their schedule I noticed that they too had about half an hour of "missing time". A few weeks later Gail called me again: it had happened again, with an identical scenario, at the time when her daughter had gone to visit her father again. (Phil Imbrogno)

AUSTRALIA, Babinda
Michel and Lena Desmarquet lived near Babinda. One night in June, Michel woke up, and as if driven by an external force, he wrote a note for his wife, telling her he was leaving for about ten days. Then he went outside and saw the lawn and the ground undulating. He thought he was sick. Suddenly he felt himself levitating: he saw his house and the garden from above. There was an entity there, 3 meters tall and resembling a blond human, who began to speak to him in French. Michel thought he was having a nightmare. The entity told him his name was Thao, and explained a lot of things to him. It was a hermaphrodite. There was also a blue-gray saucer 70 m in diameter, with no windows or doors. Michel felt himself transported from the ground to the saucer. The light intensity was so great that he was given a mask to protect himself. During the experience he visited the planet Thiacouba - he would tell all this in a book published in March 1993. Then he returned home, where he found his wife in distress and had to convince her of what had happened to him. (UFORA92201- Vlad Godic - Keith Basterfield.)

CHINA, Shanghai
A UFO flew over the city for 40 minutes. It was described "as an oval disc" or "like a comet with an umbrella-shaped tail" or "like a flying orange". Military planes took off to observe it more closely; later this phenomenon was identified as the excess fuel ejected from the rocket that was used to put a Japanese satellite into orbit. This fuel would have burned in the atmosphere for all this time. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 322) In the evening several people observed an object in the sky. The object changed shape and some said it looked like a spiral beam surrounded by sparks, others saw it as a luminous oval shape, others still that it had the shape of a comet but whose tail looked like an umbrella. The color of the object was orange, and it was spinning clockwise, it was moving very quickly from west to east and the duration of the observation was only a few seconds. According to another report, during the flight of this object, there was a general power outage in the Shengsi region, Zhejiang province. The whole island was suddenly plunged into darkness. (Chapter 7 - "UFOs in China 1987-88" by Paul Dong, pages 140-142. source: China News Agency of 28.8.87) Mao Xuecheng, military pilot, pursued the UFO for about three minutes. He had orders to take off at 7:35 pm and return to base after attempting an interception. "Above the Yangtze River it was in front of me, to my right, extremely bright and flying at a dizzying speed. (...) I followed it at an angle of 110° and at a speed of 900 kmh. It was then 7:57 pm. The object was in a slight descent, it had an orange light and its spiral-shaped trail was also orange. At 7:59 pm it went up, accelerated again and I was unable to continue the pursuit for more than 45 seconds at this speed. So I was allowed to return to base" The spokesman for the Chinese government assumes that UFOs are terrestrial devices on the one hand and on the other hand aerial phenomena produced by our earth and air, phenomena not yet studied in depth. (note from vog: that's also my opinion...) James Oberg of NASA says that the observations coincide with the release of excess fuel by a Japanese missile. Three hours before the incident, Japan launched an H-1A 600 miles east of Shanghai which flew over the region twice. (cf. August 27, 1987) On January 22, 1988 at 11:30 pm, a similar object was observed again above Shanghai for 30 seconds. The first time an object in the form of a spiral light of this kind was observed was on July 26, 1977, the second on July 24, 1981. (source: "Liberation Daily" of 30.8.87)

USA, Bangor (Washington)
11 PM: UFO 15 m in diameter, with two occupants, observed at 15 to 20 meters altitude near the submarine base "The Trident". The object came from the east, hovering above the house and playground, disappearing towards the NW. The 3 witnesses are aged 8 (Randy), 10 (Dennis) and 26 (Mrs. Springsteen) years old. The fathers of the two boys are part of the security staff of the base. In the saucer, a standing creature had very large pointed ears, resembling those of a cat. It was emitting a beam from the saucer which was scanning the ground. On the other side of the ventral dome they saw a similar being. Mrs. Springsteeen called the Bremerton police. The object had a circular bottom lined with several blue and red lights around the edge which shone alternately in sequence around the circumference. The children saw above the object a kind of rigid antenna. The rest of the object was not visible and remained hidden from their view. Dennis and Randy drew five square windows lit up in the upper third of the ventral dome. Two "doors" or "openings" were at the lower part and through each one a large entity (approx. 1.8 m, taller than Randy's father) was visible, and according to the children they were manipulating the projector to direct it towards them. Their arms were very long and fusiform. Their head was huge and their body very thin (barely the size of Dennis's thigh). The creatures were covered with a greenish fur. The children did not notice any clothing. The eyes were green-blue with abnormally long eyelashes, pointed ears like a cat and an oval head. The mouth resembled that of an "old grandmother". The fingers and toes were equipped with suckers, according to Dennis. He did not call them by this name but said "like the things at the end of darts". Randy did not seem to agree. Dennis's description is more explicit than Randy's. "Frog feet" webbed like the hands. When entering the house after the departure of the craft, Mrs. Springsteen increasingly felt a presence and became increasingly frightened. A close neighbor saw to the east a large stationary light from the bedroom window around 10:30 PM, but according to the calculations it would seem that she saw the planet Jupiter.

BELGIUM, Brussels, Laeken
Mr. Claude C. and his companion Marylène B. were on the terrace of their apartment, taking in the air. It was between dusk and dark on this evening. They noticed that lights (white-red-yellow) "like airplanes, but without noise" were coming from the west (Atomium) and heading east (Zaventem). They surrounded rounded red shapes. These light groups would pass by in groups for 30 to 40 minutes and at certain moments they would be stationary. "When it started to move, the whole thing moved".
The altitude of the aerial ballet was a bit higher than the tallest building (16 stories) but lower than the usual altitude where many airplanes pass. The witnesses also observed the phenomenon with binoculars, but without seeing more details. To the great astonishment of the witnesses, they noticed the lack of interest of the hundreds of other tenants of the buildings who, inevitably, could have been potential spectators. Before the passage of the UFOs there was the usual coming and going of commercial airplanes. During the passage of the UFOs, no plane flew! After the passage of the UFOs, again there was the usual movement of airplanes in the sky. (investigation by Mr. Gérard GREDE of SOBEPS)

He was ten years old. He was suddenly woken up on Monday, September 7, 1987, around 5 o'clock by a mysterious, piercing sound. When he opened the shutters, he discovered a surprising orange-colored object in the garden, resembling two stacked plates. The thing was flashing and emitting a beam of white light downwards.
He states that with the help of his radio cassette, he recorded the sound: a piercing "beep-beep" like the alarm of a motorcycle. (...) On the day of the observation, as soon as he heard the noise, he activated his recorder and placed it in front of the window. Little Laurent remembered that the morning before, as he explained (...) he had heard a strange sound when he glimpsed light through the shutters. He reported it to his parents the same day and thought it could be thieves. But they paid little attention to the story. The next day, believing he was reliving the same event, (...) he decided to record it to provide proof. (Robert ROUSSEL: "Ovni, les vérités cachées de l'enquête officielle", ed.

GREAT BRITAIN, Abbots Bromley (Staffordshire)
Four witnesses, including 3 from the Goodwin family of Uttoxeter. "My family and I were driving back from Walsall and had just crossed Baggots Wood in Abbots Bromley when my father shouted out: "Good God, what's that?" When I looked up I saw the underside of what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft. It was moving very slowly, almost stationary. I wound down my window and there was no sound. The craft gently tilted to one side and I got a quick glimpse of the top part. The underside of the craft had (around the periphery) lights that lit up in sequence and in the middle of the underside was a (large) dim red light in the shape of a cross. At each corner there were some kind of large spotlights. The craft moved away towards Abbots Bromsley. Then it stopped above the wood and all I could see then was a thin red line in the sky.

Israel, Elija's Gate (near Haifa)
At 10:25 mechanic Amiel (Ami) Achrai was driving on the coastal road. He saw, on the beach, what he took to be a crashed helicopter, less than 30 meters to his left, on the sand of Shikmona Beach. He stopped the car in the middle of the road and got out. Now he sees what this "helicopter" is. It measures a bit more than 8 m in diameter, is round, with a banana profile and it is rotating counterclockwise. Flying, the object emits sparks and occasionally flashes of light. Underneath the object there was a round and red light. It made a loud noise of compressed air and it caused a whirlwind of wind described by the witness as a "typhon". Ami watched the object on the ground for 15 seconds, before it discharged "a charge of burning coals" and disappeared into the air. Hoping to meet other witnesses of the scene, Ami was dismayed to see that the busy road was empty of people. Ami started running towards a nearby gas station, looking for the comfort of human contact. He had only taken a few steps, when the object was again there, 20 meters above the beach, and a red beam of light descended to the ground. In a fraction of a second, the thing had disappeared to the west above the Mediterranean and became a tiny orange point of light. All this happened in less than a minute, from the sight of the "helicopter", to the total disappearance. Yet, this was going to change Ami's life.<br/><br/>
At home, Ami did not sleep two nights in a row. He decided to call the police, but they didn't care and suggested he contact the fortune teller Arbel. (vog: strange advice from the police, no?) Which he did. During the two other days, Ami suffered from migraine, chills and general weakness. His eyes itched and he couldn't watch television without screaming in pain. His lips were dry and no liquid could help. On the evening of Yom Kippur, five days after his observation, he decided to return to Shikmona beach. Which he did the next day, finding the exact place, where the plastic bottles were melted into perfect little circles. He saw a strange red stone, took it in his hand: it immediately changed color, became white and crumbled into powder. The next day he returned to the site accompanied by Arbel, who set about collecting samples in a plastic bag and told him that a voice was telling him that "the affair was not over". A little further they discovered the imprint of the UFO: its exact profile in the burned sand of a dune, ten meters long, four high. (...) and the imprint of an astronaut sitting facing two rectangles. Everything was measured (vog: me, I would have made this discovery, I would have called everyone to come and see, before measuring the size of the astronaut etc...) (...) The extraterrestrial measures 1 m 05, but Arbel fills bags with sand samples... Finally, the police were warned and very strangely, it is not Ami who is summoned, but Arbel who must go to the Technion Institute, Israeli version of MIT. (...) Meanwhile Ami becomes a media star, while life is not easy for him: he constantly feels electric shocks in his body when he wants to sleep, two black spots appear under his eyes, and a kind of hard ball grows on his chest. This ball, he excises himself and gives it to his father, who puts it on the balcony, and everyone watches it bounce by itself. (note from vog: ? really... that's cotton strong!) Then he manages to fold metal just by looking at it (Uri Geller style) but the most annoying thing is the appearance of letters and shapes in front of his eyes, at the least opportune moments. (...) Strangers recognize the signs: an ancient writing from Sinai.... Then, his whole family was affected by the appearance of signs in front of their eyes: his wife, his father, his daughter.... A friend advised him to read Ezekiel, he did, found his UFO there, and became very religious. And even the fortune teller Arbel became religious, and quoted the Bible at every turn.

USSR, Siberia
Soviet troops in Siberia fired at 8:35 during their routine maneuvers at a low-altitude flying saucer. The surviving aliens retaliated by killing 23 Russian soldiers. (...) The UFO report contains 250 pages of testimony from two soldiers who mysteriously survived the extraterrestrial attack. A dramatic photo of the accident site, with sketches of aliens, was called by CIA sources "the most chilling portrait of extraterrestrial revenge on record." (KGB files in the hands of the CIA, according to the information). "They possess weapons and technologies that are superior to anything on Earth". This incident shows that when cornered, extraterrestrials use whatever is at their disposal to protect themselves. For unexplained reasons, these soldiers disabled the UFO with surface-to-air missile weapons, causing the crash of a 23-meter dimension to the east of the patrol position. The UFO crashed to the ground with a terrible impact, which literally cracked and opened the hull. And although the troops kept their distance, they were unable to move when five small humanoids with large heads and large black eyes emerged from the wreckage. The unnamed soldiers who survived the alien attack said that the creatures coming out of the wreckage huddled briefly and then merged into a single entity resembling a balloon! It is difficult to understand what happened then, but the soldiers said that the entity had begun to emit piercing cries and make a dull noise before it turned white and bright. A fraction of a second later, the balloon doubled in size and exploded in a dazzling flash of light. (...) The KGB report says that the wreckage of the UFO and the killed soldiers were recovered by Moscow for analysis.

At 5 pm, Ed Walters saw through the branches a gray-blue radiance. The light was coming from a large object that was silently flying over the houses and stood out, dazzling, against the red of the twilight. Ed Walters took out his Polaroid and managed to take some photos of the 15 m diameter cylindrical vessel, but a blue ray emitted by the craft paralyzed him. After a dull pain in his head, he felt like he was lifting off the ground and screamed in terror. An artificial voice reassured him, "We will not harm you". As he continued to rise, he smelled a scent of ammonia and cinnamon and fainted. He regained consciousness as he fell back to the ground. He had only vague memories: buzzing in his ears, a female voice, images of a dog. When he got home, he told his wife and children about his adventure: they had smelled the strange odor he was giving off. The few photos he had time to take were good.

Great Britain, Mansfield (England)
Around 1:30 in the morning many people were woken up by a terrible noise, like an explosion. One person saw a fireball in the sky doing loops and double loops, looking on in terror. In some streets the windows imploded and exploded, alternating from one house to the next. Other residents saw a bright object zigzagging in the sky making a strange noise, as if it had a motor failure. The object lost speed, descended and touched the ground in a wood near Blidworth, bounced and crashed in a place called Warren in Annesley Hall, with a deafening noise creating a terrible shockwave. Reports (vog: which ones? I would have liked to read them...) say there were three objects in the sky: one UFO (???) while the other two could have been missiles. There were huge damages to the houses, wires and electrical lines were torn off. The weather that night was very calm: clear sky, no clouds, no wind, no storm. At 2:15, seven military helicopters appeared, scanning the terrain with powerful spotlights. They flew over Normanton, Sutton-In-Ashfield and Kirby-In-Ashfield. Then the police arrived at the site of the first impact. The place was carefully delimited and the police stayed there for several days. Trees were burning and the fire brigade was called. There were fir trees burning from the inside of the trunk to the outside... (???) At the second impact site, it was the army that came to occupy the site for 3 to 4 days. Judging from the damage created, the UFO must have had a diameter of about twenty meters. The next day military trucks were on site. The earth and everything was removed, the place covered with new earth and replanted in record time. The owner of a nearby house (completely demolished) found a metal debris in a tree on his property three weeks later. As soon as he reported his find, he was visited by two people from the DScI (Department of Scientific Intelligence) taking the debris and enjoining him to stay out of the affair. Then this poor witness was harassed by phone calls. Unable to take it anymore, he drove around his property, parked there, was arrested by 4 policemen and taken to the station. He was ordered not to come back to the place (his own property!) or else he would be arrested for "obscene phone calls". (Ufo Reality - issue 4, p. 8 to 11 - 1996)

After finishing his night shift at the mine, the witness was following Huddersfield Road between 6 and 6:15. When he arrived at the intersection of Cockerham Lane he saw two bright red lights above the trees to the east. He stopped his moped and watched the lights for a long time - during this observation phase two cars passed in the direction of Barnsley. After this the lights moved closer to the witness, maneuvering at 90° to stop near him at an altitude of about 170m. The witness then saw the body of the object: in the shape of a cross, with 8 to 10 red-lit windows at its top, two red lights at the end of each wing, and on the bottom a kind of protruding circle with a red light inside blinking once per second. The bottom was metallic, gray-silver, covered with denticles, boxes and mechanisms just like the spaceships in Star Wars... The witness observed this for two minutes, engaged the speed of his moped and at that moment the object tilted in the direction that the witness was going, turning off all its lights and accelerating. There was a kind of supernatural silence that was frightening. The witness "felt" that he would see this thing again one day and was terrified at the thought. (David CLARKE - IUN - GB)

In the night, the witnesses' car (a whole family) was lifted off the road by an extremely bright ovoid UFO. They said their car was violently thrown and then dropped back onto the road. The car was damaged and investigators found it covered in a substance resembling green ashes. This substance was analyzed. Other testimonies from motorists and fishing boats reported similar events, which the police took seriously. (Reported by CBS Radio, 21.1.1988) (vog: the analysis showed it was potassium chloride, cfr Bob Fletcher of Para Net Information) During the night, a white light approached the Knowless family's car. The vehicle was shaken and lifted above the road. A shrill sound was heard. An unpleasant smell was perceived and voices were distorted. The car was covered in a deposit similar to soot. (Science et Vie, special edition: 50 years of UFOs, Atlas of Unsolved Cases, pp. 60-63) ... The car was lifted, shaken, and fell onto its right side. On impact, one of the tires burst. The family quickly got out of the vehicle and hid in the bushes until the UFO left. When it finally departed, they changed the tire and were able to leave.

They said it was in the shape of a cross, with an elongated fuselage and 3 or 4 windows lit up on top with a bright red light. They estimated that each window was the size of a house! The main part was covered like large white tiles. It was 20 to 30 times bigger than a conventional plane and flew between 300 and 600 meters in altitude. The object stayed in view for 20 minutes and no sound was heard. For 5 minutes, during this observation time, it hovered in place.

At 6:40 PM, Stephen Millard of Carlton Green looked west and had the impression of seeing a communication satellite with its solar panels. But the altitude of this thing was far too low to be a satellite. At first the object had the shape of a cross, then it inclined and he saw a small dome on the upper part. The portholes were dimly lit and blinking. He estimated the size of this object to be three times that of a jumbo jet, the central part was aluminum in color and the luminosity was that of an electric welding arc.

A witness and her 24-year-old daughter saw, at around 7:30 PM, a large black rectangular triangle suspended in the sky in front of them. They stopped the car and other people parked behind them to observe the UFO. It was in a downward pointing position and there were a lot of red and green lights in its center. The triangle remained stationary for 5 minutes. As the daughter couldn't see very well, the witnesses went home to get glasses and to come back they took another route to see the object from behind. It had moved around 400 m to the southwest and was momentarily motionless above an electricity pylon. It was huge, the witnesses think 50 to 60 m in side and flying under 100 m in altitude, its entire perimeter was lined with bright green lights and those in the center lit up in pulses. The witnesses approached the UFO up to 30 or 50 m. Later, when they returned home, they saw the UFO again at around 9:15 PM, but high in the sky and it seemed to be moving at great speed to the west.

(Source: the newspaper "Chine Nouvelle" of 20.3.88) At 21.35, on March 18, a Xinjiang 2606 flight from Beijing to Urumqi was above Qijiaojiing, Hami Province, at 11,000 meters altitude, when suddenly the passengers saw a light ball the size of a basketball, from which intense flashes of light were coming out, on the right side of the plane. The crew alerted the Urumqi control tower, which replied that no other flight was in the vicinity. In the cockpit they activated lights to make signals, but there was no response from the phenomenon. Three minutes later the phenomenon changed course and headed north, changing its appearance a bit: on top a small round light and below a kind of torch. These two lights were rotating quickly and the whole thing was surrounded by a green halo. At 21.48 the phenomenon was so far away that it was no longer visible. Half an hour later, while the plane was flying between Guangzhou and Urumqi, people on the ground in Hami Province saw a similar UFO. Among the people were television personnel, including Wu Wanjun, Shmed Jiang (Uigur), Mi Xiuchun (Hui), presenter Ming Aijun, a security guard Xu Yongchang, technical engineer Cheng Jingchun, technician Ju Huang and at least a dozen students of all ages.

(Witness: mrogers923 at aol.com) I had taken off from Phoenix AZ and was turning towards Las Vegas, when I saw a circular object whose surface could have covered several city blocks, hovering above a residential area, illuminating the roofs of the houses with a very powerful beam of light. This object was flying slowly and deliberately above the houses. I couldn't believe my eyes and I turned to the passenger sitting behind me and asked: "Do you see what I see out the window?" She asked me: "What is it?" I didn't know. She continued "Could it be a UFO?" At that moment all the passengers on that side were commenting on the sighting with excitement. The flight attendants were not available for a while and when they came back they said they hadn't noticed anything at all. However, that night on the 10 o'clock news they mentioned the observation of a UFO above Phoenix. It was amazing, it changed my way of thinking.

One of the greatest mysteries of space and of all time was the discovery, by a Russian satellite which photographed, an American warplane on the Moon. (!!!???) This image shows a bomber from the Second World War, but no one can answer this question, including scientists: "How can such a primitive plane fly in space and without a breath of wind on the Moon?" "We have absolutely no explanation and serious doubt" said Dr. Stanislav Makeyev. The Russian scientist who published the photos of the plane enlarged by computer was. "We can speculate that the plane was stolen by extraterrestrials and placed on the moon, but we have no evidence to support this theory". American officials did not want to comment on these photos. Dr. Makeyev insists and says that the photographs are authentic. Unfortunately, four months after it was found, the plane disappears from the Moon, leaving no trace. (...)

A group of 6 or 7 employees of Redfearn Glass, Monk Bretton, were leaving the afternoon shift at 10pm and had clocked out. They stopped to look with amazement at something in the sky that was absolutely still, with red, green and white lights flashing in alternation. Then two large yellow searchlights appeared, almost directed towards the ground. There was no way to make out the body, but the witnesses had the impression that it was oval and all along there was a row of "street lamps". The strangest thing was the great silence that reigned. Then it began to move, in a straight line with a series of propulsion movements, a bit like a dragonfly and disappeared in a shooting motion, still without any noise. Total duration of the observation: about 3 minutes. (IUN - David Clarke - GREAT BRITAIN)

An adolescent saw a UFO hovering above the Mediterranean Sea. She ran to the nearest police station to tell them her observation. The police officers did not believe her. Just like Amoi Achrai the year before, she returned to the beach of Shikmona. At 100 yards from the footprint of Ami's UFO, she found the footprint of her own UFO. It measured 15 meters long and six meters high. The base had the same structure as Ami's. The adolescent, Naveh, went to find the fortune teller Arbel, who began the investigation. Fortunately this time the young girl did not have to suffer the physical consequences that Ami had experienced. (...)

Above Balmoral a man and his son saw an object shaped like a lozenge, yellow-orange in color, with a large light suspended beneath it. The object was visible for a quarter of an hour during which the father took photos. When developed, the photos were not impressed. (Bob PRATT - USA)

Brazil, Parnarama
Manuel Duarte Pinheiro was outside with companions at 4 o'clock. They were preparing to go to work when they saw a light coming from the north in a zigzag pattern, inspecting the ground and making a bright spot. The eight witnesses saw the spot light up in one place, go out, and then light up in another place. When it was off, the witnesses saw nothing unusual in the sky. It was as if only the light was real. They rushed to take cover, but the beam seemed to be playing with them, chasing them. At one point Pinheiro himself was caught in the light and looked at it face to face. "It hurts the eyes," he said, "it makes the eyes water. It's very hot to the eyes. It's of constant color and intensity with very sharp edges." (Jacques VALLEE: "Confrontations" - Laffont 1991, p. 270, 271)

Dozens of people, including those from the state meteorological service, reported the observation of a UFO in the sky. "I see a source of light," said Eliezer Danziger, from the weather service. "The object changes its brightness from time to time, but remains stationary. It is not an airplane, just a source of light that does not move. A helicopter?" The army radio also reported that dozens of people had called to report the UFO. (1988. The Associated Press.)

Around 10:30 pm, five cars simultaneously broke down on Route 113. The 5 drivers began to talk, not finding an explanation for this phenomenon. During their conversation, they saw near the nearby woods lights carried by an object in the shape of a triangle with a metallic appearance: a big red light on the belly, red and yellow lights on the sides. It was moving the tops of the trees even though there was no wind and it was very close: Stanley R. Decker saw structures like "L" beams on the periphery and said that the ventral face was rounded. The observation lasted at least 15 minutes. The object vibrated and swayed from time to time and flew over the witnesses, who then saw that it was wider than the road. The red ventral light then appeared like a kind of opening filled with white fluorescent light. (Flying Saucer Review, vol. 34 n° 2, p.11-12)

USA, Mt Archuleta, near Dulce, N.M.
Mufon, Case 0749. Location: observed 5 miles NW of Dulce. The phenomenon was on a south-north trajectory observed over a course of about 2 miles, it stopped very close to the summit of Mt Archuleta. Closest distance of witnesses: 480 yards; distance of witnesses from the object's stop: 540 yards. Local time: 7:51 PM. Duration of observation: 5-6 seconds. Witnesses: Eliane Allegre, RN, Gabe Valdez, Edmund, Valdez's friend, "Jack" (pseudonym) PhD, Manuel, a local boy, Greg and Jeff, Valdez's sons, John Gille, PhD. John Gille is interested in the Dulce area due to rumors of an underground base jointly managed by the CIA and extraterrestrials, and because there are many UFO sightings in the area. A night of observation is decided, under Valdez's leadership. Since 7:30 PM, to pass the time, all present people are playing a game called OUIJA, when at 7:51 PM: the UFO is on cue! The object arrives from the north, flying south, at very high speed, on a horizontal and straight trajectory and presents itself in the form of a yellow light. It stops abruptly near the top of the mountain, becoming so bright at the same time that it illuminates half the sky. It emits rays of light of all colors: yellow, pink, green, and a shower of sparks. The light implodes on itself and disappears. (vog: example of a strangely "objective" ufology report!)

USA, Gulf Breeze
From a letter from the witness published in the Gulf Breezes Sentinel Volume 28, Number 49 of November 19, 1988, accompanied by two photos showing an object with lights in the shape of portholes around its perimeter. The witness had just finished dinner when he saw the object through the window. He grabbed his Polaroid and took 4 shots (5 to 8). At that moment he had to change film. He was still able to take one shot (number 1) before the object moved away. The object was the size of a small house, hovered for a few minutes over the area, then left. No audible noise. It made slight movements up and down. Its belly emitted light. The markings (windows?) were visible on its very illuminated upper part. It was neither multicolored, nor did it emit any beam. It was just a "gray thing". The witness asked the newspaper to tell him if other people had observed a UFO that same evening. (Gulf Breezes Sentinel Volume 28, Number 49 November 19, 1988)

The witnesses saw a gigantic triangular UFO above the Soignes Forest, to their right, at dusk. They stopped their vehicle in a small parking area. According to Claude B., the craft "had visible bolts like in the drawings illustrating Jules Verne's novels" and was moving "at a walking pace" and seemed to be "at the level of the tree tops" at a distance of about 100m. For Marylène B., it was "both modern and archaic" and was "enormous like a football stadium". After a few tens of seconds of observation, the greenish-colored craft (according to Claude B.) left very quickly, in a fraction of a second, in the direction of Waterloo, parallel to the highway. Here too, what most surprised the witnesses was the lack of interest of the hundreds of motorists who could have also slowed down or stopped to see the phenomenon.

Mufon, Case 1324, #890912 - Investigator: James Clarkson.
From their isolated house by the lake, a family was drawn outside by a bright light approaching and illuminating the trees beneath it. They then observed three boomerangs, of different sizes, the smallest measuring about 25 meters, the largest having the dimension of a football field. The two smaller ones were identical in shape, but not in size. All three hovered and passed overhead at the height of the tree tops. The wife went to get her camera and took some photos with the flash. Curiously, when the film was developed in a specialized firm, she received neither the prints nor the negatives back: they were lost!

PORTO RICO, Sierra Bermeja
At 7:45 pm almost all the inhabitants saw a large UFO.
They all saw the same thing: a gigantic UFO and the disappearance of two USAF fighters after their encounter with the object. On its front it had an elongated appendage with flashing lights. At its rear it was curved, the whole of gray metallic structure, with a large yellow protuberant light in the center. In the right corner it had yellow lights and on the left red lights. Two fighters were trying to intercept it, passing in front of the UFO which at the same time made a left turn, making a U-turn and slowing down. It stopped, so to speak, in the air. A fighter positioned itself to its right, another to its left. Suddenly, the fighter on the left disappeared into or on the object and was never seen again. The object then suddenly turned right and the second fighter disappeared in the same way, the sound of its engine stopped. The UFO then descended very close to the ground above an expanse of water called Saman Lake. It stayed there motionless for a short moment, straightened its "corners", sent a huge yellow flash from its central lamp, and split into two triangular sections that moved away at great speed, one to the southeast, the other to the northwest. During its division the witnesses saw red sparks. Around 8:20 pm helicopters with all lights off flew over the Sierra Bermeja and the Cartagena Lagoon until midnight. When questioned, government and military services claimed to know nothing of these incidents. (Bob PRATT - USA)

"Jan", a married woman, had a very vivid experience one night, so much so that she thinks it was not a dream. She found herself in a completely white space with three entities. They measured about 210 cm and were wearing robes. She had no fear because the entities gave her a pleasant sensation (note from vog: which one???) She was talking to them. When she woke up in the morning she had a very vivid memory of the night's events, except for the content of the conversation. Since this event her personality has changed: she suffers from sleep paralysis and other unusual activities. (UFORA91037. Keith Basterfield).
