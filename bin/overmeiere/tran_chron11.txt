At 8:20 PM two controllers of the control tower observed a light above the airport. A DC 3 plane of Mid Continent Airlines was taking off at the same time, the crew (Lawrence W. Vinther and F. Bachmeier) observed it at 8:26 PM. The object described a larger circle than the plane to take off, the object turned and passed in front of the nose of the plane and seemed to instantly appear on the other side, gliding under it. It had the shape of an airplane whose fuselage had the shape of a cigar and the straight wings a bit larger than a B-29. The pilot and co-pilot saw neither nacelle nor engine. The light seemed to come from the bottom of the object. (Brad STEIGER: "Ovni, le projet Blue Book" - trad.

#March 15, 1951
INDIA New Delhi
At 10:20 a.m. (local time), thousands of people were witnesses to an astonishing apparition: a "flying cigar" traversing the sky of India. George Franklin Floate, chief engineer of the Delhi Flying Club and several members of the club, observed with interest the strange phenomenon which lasted 20 minutes. - This craft, explained Mr. Floate, had the shape of a metallic cigar 100 feet long (about thirty meters), with a ring of flames at its tail. It emitted a thick white exhaust and reflected the rays of the sun. (This was confirmed by all the witnesses interviewed and undeniably proves the metallic and material nature of the craft) (note from vog: yes? too easy deduction, that proves nothing at all). "It moved silently at an altitude of 5000 feet (about 1500 meters) and at a maximum speed of 2000 miles/h (3200 km/h)." Two jet fighters of the Indian Air Force were ordered to take off and approach the singular vehicle, but it made a leap at their approach, up to 20,000 feet (6000 meters) and then suddenly disappeared. "It was there," Floate noted, "and a second later it had vanished, evaporated into the sky!" The fighters returned empty-handed to their base. That same night, the object reappeared in Allahabad (about 650 km from Delhi). It was seen by Mr. Y.R. Bahn Darkar, instructor of the local flying club. (Jimmy GIEU: "The UFOs Come from Another World" Fleuve Noir 1954 - Omnium Littéraire 1972 p.36) New Delhi, India. 10:20 a.m.
Witnesses: 25 members of a flying club, including the chief aerial engineer and his two assistants. One metallic cigar-shaped object with white exhaust which turned black when it accelerated to an estimated 1,000 m.p.h. and made a large loop. Seven minutes. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner)

#1951, March
CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, Bangui
One night, around 4 o'clock in the morning, three officers of the military aviation were on the field of the base of Bangui in ex A.E.F. The moon shone in a very clear sky. Suddenly "at a distance impossible to appreciate, but relatively low, appeared towards the southwest an luminous object (double of Venus in its fullness approximately) which approached quickly. Enormous speed, total silence: we first thought that it was a shooting star. Arrived by the traverse of Bangui exactly to the west of the base, the object slowed down strongly, made a hook of 90 degrees approximately, then accelerated very clearly and moved away, to disappear in the distance three to four minutes after the turn. All the trajectory was apparently made at the same altitude, in five minutes approximately. It was impossible to distinguish the outlines of the object, which seemed very big and of a weak luminosity." ("Lights on the Flying Saucers" - Aimé Michel, ed. Maison MAME 1954, page 136)

#April 1951
AUSTRALIA, Woomera
The British Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys, announced that automatic and remotely guided rockets had been developed. They were characterized by five times greater maneuverability than fighter planes, speeds greater than 3,500 km/h and the possibility of reaching altitudes far beyond those of bombers. More than one hundred British firms were involved in the project. The known factories working on remotely guided projectiles in Great Britain (Bristol, De Haviland, Armstrong-Siddeley, Armstrong-Worthworth, Fairy, Vickers, English Electric, Napier) and important test stations at Farnborough and Aberporth (England) existed, but the largest test field was at Woomera in Australia, where tests had been carried out since 1947 and where, in 1951, 3,000 people were employed.

SWITZERLAND Neuchâtel
On Monday, May 12th at 4 o'clock, several hundred people gathered on the quays of Corcelles, in Neufchâtel, observed the mysterious appearance in the sky, at a very high altitude, of a shining object propelling itself in sudden bursts and leaving a white trail in its wake. The phenomenon, very visible to the naked eye, lasted for a quarter of an hour. After that, the craft described a half-circle in space and overturned, presenting to the eyes the classic shape of a perfectly round flying saucer. Then, in a fraction of a second, it shot up vertically into the sky at a prodigious speed and disappeared. This was not a collective hallucination: among the hundreds of testimonies is that of Swiss professor Alfred Lombard.

#1951, May 15
AUSTRIA, Salzburg
An American soldier of the occupation army in Austria, was returning home by bicycle on a shortcut at around 11pm. From a thicket, a small figure emerged pointing a thin object the size of a pencil at him. The soldier heard a clicking sound, felt paralyzed and thought he was going to fall. The being approached and attached a black plate to his chest. Immediately the witness felt as if he was no longer subject to gravity. The being dragged him towards a large round mass about fifty meters in diameter, which was resting in a field, and he felt pushed inside through the door that had just opened. He found himself in a place with transparent walls: he could see the landscape and the stars. The structure rose into the air, the being went into another room without paying attention to his prisoner, who was able to examine him: he was bald, wearing silver tights, with an oversized forehead, immense faceted eyes, nose and ears reduced to mere openings, and very long hands. The vessel flew so close to the moon that the witness could see its craters. Then it set a course for another planet covered with red fields, rivers and bridges and landed vertically on a platform overlooking a vast parking lot where hundreds of other gray, golden and silver vessels were already parked. The pilot descended and spoke with the navigator of another craft. The witness noticed men, women and children captured like him. A few moments later the pilot returned to the vessel and flew back to Earth at lightning speed. The soldier was dropped off near the place where he had been taken, and the pilot pointed the thin instrument at him again. It was midnight twenty. The witness felt sick but did not dare to tell his wife about his adventure.

PHILIPPINES, Manila
Case of Clarita Villanueva attacked by "inter-dimensional" entities.
Witnesses: Doctor of Medicine Marianna Lana, Mayor Arsenio Lascon, two policemen, a judge, several journalists and others. It was a stormy evening in May 1951 and the police were expecting trouble. A storm was forecast and there was tension in the air. The patrol car received a message that there was a crowd in front of one of the bars along the beach. They went there and as the car stopped, they heard a piercing scream. They forced their way through to see a young woman rolling on the ground screaming: "Help! Catch him! Help me. I'm in too much pain, help!" But no one could do anything since the young woman was alone on the ground in the middle of a circle of onlookers. To their amazement they saw marks of bloody bites appearing on the young woman's neck and arms. Finally, they took the young woman, handcuffed her, took her away and brought her to the station. Put in a cell, she cried all day "Please, get him away. I can't take it anymore. Catch him... He's biting me, I'm going to die." So the police called a doctor, suspecting Clarita Villaneuva of being drunk or drugged. Dr. Marianna Lara, took a look and declared peremptorily: "She is in an epileptic seizure." She was taken back to the cell, despite her pleas not to be left alone. A few minutes later a terrible scream brought the two policemen back. "This thing is back, it passed through the walls. It has huge eyes and wears a cape. This thing can fly at mid-height!" To make sure, the policemen entered the cell, but saw absolutely nothing. While trying to calm the young woman, they noticed that the marks of bites were increasing on Clarita's arms. The police then called the mayor and recalled the doctor. When they were there, they all agreed that the young woman could not inflict these bites on herself, for example on her shoulders and in the middle of her back... Finally everything calmed down, the young woman fell asleep. The next day she had to appear before the judge, accused of "vagrancy" (note of vog: ???) But, at the time of appearing, she was screaming that "the thing was back". Everyone could see marks of bites appearing. The attack lasted five terrifying minutes before Clarita fainted. Half an hour later Mayor Arsenio Lascon was on the spot, spoke to the victim and in view of her swollen and bite-covered state, asked for an ambulance to take her to the hospital. He and Dr. Lara accompanied the unfortunate one. But in the ambulance the attack started again: this time "there were two identical creatures" biting her while the mayor and the doctor watched helplessly the appearance of the horrible wounds, on her throat and on her hands. The journey lasted fifteen minutes and Mayor Lacson has several times admitted later that it was the longest quarter of an hour of his life. Very strangely, once the young woman was admitted to the hospital, nothing bad happened anymore. She was of course kept day and night. She left six weeks later, healed, but covered with scars. "We will never know what happened to Clarita," said Dr. Lara. Years later all the scars were still visible. (A Look Through Secret Doors By John Mackim, 1969, Ace Publishing)

At the final departure, the object made a slight tilt and then appeared elliptical. (Robert ROUSSEL: "Ovni, the end of the secret" - Belfond 1978 - p. 230 to 236) French pilots Irénée Prio and Raymond Gallibert, each on board a Vampire from the Orange base, saw a disk with a metallic reflection. The pilots tried to approach the perfectly stationary craft in the air, but at the last moment, the object escaped. The pilots set off in pursuit, but the disk proved to be much faster than its pursuers. (Yves NAUD: "The E.T. and the UFOs in history" Famot 1977, Volume 4, p. 166)

(..) shortly after midnight, a red light appeared towards the southwest. Alerted, the tower's radar picked it up on its screen. Mentioned altitude: approximately 1300 m. The object remained still and red for a moment, then suddenly turned very bright white and moved away at a lightning speed. At the precise moment when the red gave way to the white, the spot on the screen had become very bright itself. The radar operators know perfectly well the meaning of this transformation: it occurs when an airplane, to turn, suddenly inclines and offers the radar beam all the surface of its wings. (note from vog: ... which would mean that the observed thing could have wings?) ("Glimpses on Flying Saucers" - Aimé Michel, ed. Maison MAME 1954, page 102)

#July 1951
FRANCE, Orange
Pierre Monnet was cycling home when, on the road connecting Orange to Courtaison, he was, on this summer evening, as if magnetized towards a UFO which was hovering a few meters above the ground. Pierre Monnet did not immediately notice the beings standing in the radiant light of the craft. There were four of them, wearing flight suits, tall, with long blond hair falling on their shoulders. It seemed to him that a voice was resonating in his head, a foreign voice, which was giving him reassuring words. The contact was both physical and psychic since - at the moment of the encounter - the witness was standing three meters away from the extraterrestrials.
Today, Pierre Monnet is still unable to say how long this "unusual dialogue" lasted. The only thing he is sure of is that he was, from the very first moments, manipulated by an intelligence foreign to his own, which engraved in his memory a long message whose parts appeared progressively over the years.

At around 9pm, the three witnesses went to the placette to watch a performance of Lucrèce Borgia by a travelling theatre. In the Rue des Martyrs, they saw from a distance of 60m an oval-shaped object, entirely transparent, 4-5m long and 2m high, 8m off the ground, on the place where the show had started and where everyone had their backs to the phenomenon. The pilot seemed thin and elderly and had a long beard. Normal skin colour and light-coloured clothing. No visible equipment in the craft. The three witnesses got to within 7-8m of the craft and called the others to witness this incredible sight. The object immediately started up with a slight whistle and disappeared in a second above the rooftops towards the NNE. The witnesses were unable to convince anyone of their observation and were thought of as "crazy". (M. FIGUET/J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, le premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 54, 55)

(..) the radar of the Wright Patterson base fell around 10:45 am on an unidentified object flying at high altitude. Spotted on the ground, the object appeared as a bright ball of intense brightness. Two jet fighters F. 86 were immediately charged to intercept it, and they climbed up to 10,000 m. There, they consulted each other. Both of them saw above them the object in question in the form of a circular body of metallic appearance moving slowly in the sky. (...) Then the two pilots armed their machine guns and went hunting. Their goal was to take pictures and, if necessary, to shoot. But it had not been three minutes since they had gone up that the saucer, suddenly accelerating with the brutality so often observed, melted into the distance. The two pilots - Commander James B. Smith and Lieutenant Donald J. Hemer - did not have time to shoot. But they had pictures. On development, the films revealed a round shape, without visible structural details.

B.M., a 57-year-old farmer, was at the local cemetery to do some work. It was 1 o'clock. Suddenly he heard a humming and simultaneously felt a very hot gust of wind. He turned around to see where it was coming from and then witnessed the landing of a strange silver, spherical but flattened craft, about 50 meters away from him. At the top, the dome had vertical fins. The dome was spinning rapidly on a kind of wide ring with round blue-colored portholes. The lower part had the rough shape of a funnel and was motionless. Gradually the object came to the ground while telescopic legs emerged in three places. Meanwhile two small hatches opened and a kind of ladder descended. Six creatures, 1.2 meters tall, wearing white suits and their heads in a transparent "globe" topped with three antennas, descended the stairs. On their backs they carried a "cylinder" connected to the helmet by a tube adjusted under the chin. The creatures' arms were excessively long. They came towards the witness, getting as close as 5 or 6 meters. They had round blue eyes, a simian face, white skin and the one who seemed to be the leader had a red beard. He smiled at the witness and showed a kind of strange drum that he tapped, making a blinding light come out, like the witness had never seen before. After that, the "leader" made a kind of salute and immediately the six creatures returned to their craft, climbing the ladder. A pink flame came out of the lower funnel, the object rose vertically at such speed that in two seconds it was out of sight. A cemetery worker, working on the other side, only saw the blinding light. There were traces on the ground: a circle of burned grass and bare earth 7 meters in diameter. (CISU, archive file 5101 - sources: report by Mr. F.

At around 9:10 PM, four professors from the Texas School of Arts and Crafts were sitting in the yard of one of their houses to observe meteors as part of a study undertaken by the school. They were W.L. Ducker, A.G. Bert, W.L. Robinson and another man. They saw a group of lights pass over them from north to south. They had the same light as a bright star but a larger surface area and they moved at a great speed. The shape formed was almost a perfect half-circle containing between 20 and 30 lights. Later that evening a similar incident was observed and over a period of 3 weeks a total of twelve passes of this group (or a similar group) were observed by these men. (Brad STEIGER: "UFO, the Project Blue Book" - trans. Belfond 1979, pp. 68-83) In front of Doctor Robinson, a geology professor, Doctor Oberg, a chemistry professor, Doctor Ducker, a petroleum engineer, and hundreds of people, a group of about twenty luminous discs in a V formation flew from one end of the horizon to the other.

9:58 p.m. Witnesses: the security guard of the Sandia base, Hugh Young and his wife. At nightfall, an Atomic Energy Commission employee and his wife had seen a UFO. They were both sitting in the courtyard of their house, in the suburbs of Albuquerque. They were admiring the beauty of the night sky when they saw a huge airplane passing quickly and silently above them. They only saw it for a few seconds but they clearly distinguished it because it was very low, between 250 and 300 meters they estimated. It had the shape of a "winged plane" and about one and a half times the length of a B-36. The wing was strongly inclined towards the back, almost taking the shape of a V. They did not distinguish the color but noticed that dark stripes crossed the object lengthwise. At the back they saw six or eight pairs of weak and bluish lights. (Edward J. Ruppelt: "Face aux Soucoupes Volantes", ed. France-Empire 1958, p. 128) A flying wing object passed above them at an estimated altitude of 800-1,000', without noise. Estimated dimension: 1.5 times the wingspan of a B-36 bomber, or 350'. Based on the dark lines and 6-8 pairs of soft lights at the back of the winged plane. Estimated speed at 300-400 m.p.h., object seen for about 30 seconds. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner)

At 7:55 two F-86s on patrol were approaching Long Beach. Suddenly the section leader called the ground control to announce that himself and his wingman were seeing an object high "at 12 o'clock", turning to the left, which was not another plane. The controller checked his radars, found nothing, and told the section leader to try to identify the object. The two F-86s set off in pursuit. The UFO continued to turn. They tried to intercept it but never managed to gain enough altitude. From time to time, when they seemed to be getting closer, the UFO casually moved away, climbing, while describing a wide circle to the left. After ten minutes the planes had to give up the pursuit due to lack of fuel. Four new F-86s took over and in pairs tried to reach the UFO's altitude, which they estimated to be 16,500 meters. They did not succeed. All the pilots spoke of a "silver plane with wings very inclined to the rear" except one who spoke of a round and silver object.

In their opinion, the two objects had the same dimensions, that is, 14 to 15 m and "between one man and one and a half" in height. Afraid to approach these objects, the people hid in the rocks and observed the strange scene. After a few minutes, something resembling a very small man had come out from under the second object and had gone to the first, entering it through the base. This creature had shiny clothes and its round (bulbous) head shone. Then the first object rose up buzzing like a swarm of insects and the second followed quickly.

(so September October) At 10pm three teenagers were riding their bicycles when they saw at a distance of 20 meters a vaporous human figure, about 180 cm tall, dressed in a robe and floating above the ground. One of the boys felt a vague communication, but all three of them fled from the scene. (UFOIC - Keith Basterfield)

MALI, Tessalit
An air force officer saw a UFO, dark yellow and circular in shape. The object seemed to descend before rising and accelerating strongly. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 342, 343) On the night of October 3 to 4, two military aviation officers and some men were sleeping outside the bordj, under the crystal clear and still desert sky. "I woke up at 2 o'clock," one of the officers said, "and couldn't get back to sleep. The night was dark, the stars very bright, the air calm. Suddenly, coming from the east and quickly approaching west or so, I saw a light. It was descending. (...) It was not an airplane. After a few seconds the shape of the object became clearly visible: it was an "object" approximately circular, with the apparent diameter of a 10 centimeter circle, dark yellow, almost orange. It continued to approach slowly descending, at the approach speed of a night DC 3 type airplane. Arriving at the vertical of the bordj-village of Tessalit, about 6 km southeast of where we were, the object made a turn of more than 90 degrees to the left, thus passing approximately at the heading of 170/180 degrees. It accelerated, its speed became astonishing, it rose very quickly, while its apparent diameter decreased, and disappeared. ("Lueurs sur les Soucoupes volantes" - Aimé Michel, ed.

EGYPT
In 1951, German technicians organized in Egypt a rocket construction, the result of which was, it is said, a new type of device with a length of 1.50 m and a range of 15 to 30 kilometers. The first flight took place successfully at the end of October 1951. ("The Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" -Hans K. Kaiser, Amiot-Dumont 1954, p. 125)

France, between Niort and Fontenay
Then Mr. Ropert, residing at 9 Place de la Préfecture in La Roche sur Yon, saw it in turn, on the road from Niort to Fontenay. It was a very bright emerald green light, passing below the clouds at about 1500 m. The green light was sometimes speckled with yellow and gave a dazzling whiteness to the clouds near it. It crossed the sky at great speed, without noise, then turned mauve when it changed direction. The same evening, Mr. Sigot, a taxi driver in Fontenay le Comte, also saw the emerald green light at the same altitude.

USA, Abilene (Texas)
An American Airlines DC 4 was flying at 1,500 meters altitude, in the east of Abilene, Texas. At 7:15 in the morning, an object of a beautiful bright green passed the aircraft. It had passed very quickly, but its characteristic shape of a ballistic projectile had not escaped the captain and his co-pilot. It was emitting a white trail like an exhaust vapor. Its heading and altitude were the same as the DC 4. Almost immediately after passing it, the craft exploded, throwing red balls of fire in all directions. (Donald E. KEYHOE - 1973 - Trans.

At 5:50am Mr. P.D. was in a train carriage at Langerbrugge station (north of Ghent). He saw an elongated object, apparently 3mm in size, appear to the west. There was a red, opaque flame visible at the back "like a nozzle with a fairly sharp outline". The phenomenon crossed transversely over the stopped train, heading east. Estimated duration of the observation was 15 seconds. (Investigation by Jacques Bonabot, 12.2.1972 - GESAG)

FRANCE, Saint Samson "Bellevue"
M. Le Haziff, his wife and two daughters, M. Jean Marteil and M. Robin (deaf-mute) observed between 8 and 9 pm a luminous halo that descended. In the halo, an oval shape soon illuminated the entire field on which it landed, 200 to 300 m from the witnesses and where cows were grazing. They observed the object but did not approach it beyond a curtain of chestnut trees. No one remembers how the thing disappeared. One of the cows was taken by "crises as if she had gone mad". She had to be sold. Discovery of a curious material about 10 cm in diameter, 3 or 4 cm thick, resembling "bread without crust". (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed.

USA, Pacific Coast base
On December 20, at a Pacific Coast base, three "Sabres" took off wing to wing for a training mission. Commander Scott was in charge of the patrol, his crewmates were Lieutenants Powell and Hadley. The ceiling was at 4000 meters. At 6000 meters, the "Sabres" burst out of the clouds and shot into the blue sky. Suddenly, the radio indicator lit up: "Unidentified flying object just flew over the base. Heading from southeast to northwest. Altitude 10,000 meters. Speed 6000 km/h. To all aircraft in the sector, try to intercept and observe. Warning, danger!" In less than two minutes, the mysterious object will be in the vicinity. Slightly below the three aircraft, a black dot quickly grew larger. Less than two minutes later, the charred remains of the three fighters were scattered over a 5 km radius, finishing burning. (Charles GARREAU: "Alert in the Sky: The Abduction File" ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1981, p.23 and 24) (note from vog: it's amazing that it's a Frenchman who tells this story, while the Americans are shying away from it, attributing it to the collision of the aircraft between them...)

#1951
AUSTRALIA, Halidon, Murray Bridge.
(Keith Baskerfield) Mrs. X. was a young married woman and at the time of the events her husband was away from the farm. They had also recently lost their first baby. Very early in the morning Mrs. X. made her rounds inspecting the livestock, accompanied by the dog. She climbed a small hill from which she had a better overall view. To her surprise she then saw an unusual object on the ground, resting on four feet. It seemed to her to be the size of a "two-bedroom house". Mrs. X. looked at this thing, then decided to go and see it more closely. As she set off she saw three creatures emerging from under the object, these creatures seemed to be floating. Mrs. X. however had no fear upon seeing this, feeling rather confident. The creatures seemed to her to be male, of the size and appearance of normal human beings, with a beautiful skin without wrinkles and blue eyes. They wore one-piece silver-colored suits and boots of the same color. On their heads they had hats. She was taken, with her consent, into the object, by some kind of invisible elevator which gave her the feeling of floating. Inside there was a creature standing in front of what we would today call a computer console. He moved his hands above a panel, without touching it, and lights began to blink in response to his movements. There was also a screen, like a television screen in this room. The conversation between her and the "men" was in English, but she did not always have to speak to be understood. Today Mrs. X. no longer remembers the subject of the conversation. The "men" told her that they knew she had lost a child, but that things would get better. She left the craft floating by the invisible elevator and when the object had gone, the four circles of the landing feet remained on the ground. When she later tried to talk to people in her surroundings about this experience, she was laughed at.

(summary) story of "Pope" Clément XV, born Michel Collin in 1905. He was ordained a priest in 1933, crowned Pope on 7.10.1950 by Christ himself, suspended "a divinis" and excommunicated in 1951; He founded in Vaux his little Vatican of Infinite Love. He claims to hold the 3rd secret of Fatima. In 1970 he excommunicates the tax director of Nancy who demands back taxes from him. Clément XV proclaims his Interplanetary Church, for he is aware that many Martians have already descended to Earth and live clandestinely among us". He dies on June 23, 1974.

USA, Arizona desert
Liliane Roth, an American artist, had her first encounter with a UFO. She was spending the night with her husband Burt Mc Guire in an isolated motel located in the Arizona desert. "Around 7 pm," Liliane Roth recounts, "I took out my three little bichons. Suddenly I saw a huge ring, like a big hoop hovering about 40 m in altitude. When this object with a metallic sheen, measuring about 50 m, was right above my head, I quickly called my husband. After about 5 minutes the UFO rose at a fantastic speed, then returned to the same place shortly after. Two minutes later, this strange craft, pierced with multicolored holes, slowly disappeared to the east." (continued: March 1952) (A. SCHNEIDER-H. MALTHANER: "The Secret File of UFOs," ed.

USA, Fairchild Base (Washington)
At 7:30 PM two Chief Sergeants, both intelligence specialists, were walking down an alley of the Fairchild Base, near Spokane. Suddenly they saw a large, spherical object of pale blue color approaching from the east. They stopped to examine it, as several UFOs had been reported by officers of the base in the preceding months. The object was moving at a rather fast but moderate speed in a horizontal plane. It passed north of the Sergeants' location. When it disappeared to the west they noticed it had a long blue tail. At the time of the observation the sky was overcast from the ceiling of 1400 meters with a thickness of 1800 meters. If the object was just at the base of the clouds, it was 3000 meters away from the observers and moving at more than 2000 km/h. It could not have been a jet aircraft due to the absence of noise. (Edward J. Ruppelt: "The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects", France-Empire 1958, p.24,25)

#1952, January 22
ALASKA
At 0:20 local time, an aviator who was monitoring the screen saw an object appear, in the form of a clear, bright point, as airplanes usually give. The abnormal fact was that this point was northeast of the station, i.e. above a region that airplanes rarely flew over and where there was only ice, snow, some Eskimos and, a little further, Russia. After plotting three good contacts, the operators knew they had something exceptional. The object was at 7000 m altitude and was moving at 2400 km/h. A few minutes later, an F-94 jet interceptor took off from the base. Suddenly, the unknown object slowed down, stopped and reversed its course, heading straight for the station. When it was about fifty kilometers away, an operator switched to a shorter range and, in doing so, lost both the object and the plane. Two other F-94s had taken off. During the fourth interception pass, the object suddenly seemed to move. Ground radar got a brief echo, but it soon went out of range, moving away to the west. (Edward J. Ruppelt: "Face aux Soucoupes Volantes", ed. France-Empire 1958, pp. 160, 161)

Radar operators of the aircraft carrier Philippine Sea, detected a UFO showing a high speed of flight, initially detected at 40 km distance and having approached to 32 km, it made a wide turn to the east, moving away on a route opposite to that of the aircraft carrier. Recorded speeds: 960 km/h during the first minute, 1440 km/h during the second minute, 2880 km/h during the third minute. It separated into two contacts distant from 9 to 20 km. Three helmsmen of the aircraft carrier saw on the deck a triple incandescent wake. (J. Allen HYNEK: "New Report on UFOs" - Belfond 1979, p. 125, 126)

ITALY, Catania (Sicily)
Customs officer Eugenio Siragusa, on his way to work, was waiting for the bus. A light in the shape of a cross and shining like liquid mercury appeared in the sky. It flew at very high speed. It came closer and closer and confirmed a cross shape, like a priest's hat. At its aplomb, the object stopped. An intense beam of light came out of it and went through Eugenio from side to side. He then felt perfectly happy. After a moment, the light of the beam returned to the object. The object then made a beautiful curve in the sky and disappeared. When Siragusa regained contact with reality, he felt completely different, he would say "redimensioned". He began to hear a voice in his head speaking to him about Poseidonia, the capital of Atlantis, where he would have lived 12,000 years ago. He started to draw the map of the lost continent, on a 6 m long roll. At the same time, his instruction by the extraterrestrials began. Messages were dictated to him for President Eisenhower (USA) and for Kroutchev (USSR) (following April 30, 1962) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

JAPAN, 20 miles north of Misawa AFB, Japan.
A report from documents contained in the files of the American intelligence services states that a small metal disc passed near an F-84 jet on March 29, 1952 at 11:20. Lieutenant pilot David Brigham, an eyewitness, reported that the craft was following a seemingly directed trajectory. The disc had a diameter of about twenty centimeters. Very thin, perfectly round, with a shiny chrome finish, it left no trace or vapor trail. The disc-shaped object moved significantly faster than the jet. It followed the jet for a few moments, oscillated, swayed, and then disappeared at high speed.

The two witnesses in the car saw a flat disc appear on the horizon, topped on one side by a dome. This dome had a kind of small porthole on one side and a dark trace outlining a hatch. This craft came from the northeast towards the witnesses and stayed hovering below them. It was luminous, silver, about 15 m in diameter and emitted light comparable to neon while it was swaying. One of the two witnesses took the machine gun from the back seat, circled the craft several times wondering if he should shoot. His friend, remaining in the car, urgently asked him not to do so for fear of a response. The stationary flight lasted at least three minutes, it put itself on song, presenting a flat surface, seemed to roll on itself and then crossed the sky at a speed higher than that of a jet plane. The witness also claims that the craft cut off the engine of the car, magnetized the electrical circuits and caused cracks in the paint. (J.

The witness was a 23-year-old woman. She had gone with two dogs to a mazet to collect the wool from two mattresses, was going to spend the night there and join Nîmes the next day with the wool bundle. She was getting ready to go to bed, it was 10 pm. The dogs were barking. She went out and saw a stranger crouching in a thyme bush. He got up and asked her: "What are you doing here?" She retorted that he was on her property. Exchange of banalities: he was a terrestrial being who had left 10 years earlier with an E.T. crew. Two other characters appeared, with a rather Amerindian look. They spoke in an unknown language. They were wearing green trousers and jerkins, without buttons. A third E.T., who seemed to be the leader, appeared. He was small and seemed tired. On his forehead shone a precious stone. He had an abdominal box attached by straps. The witness was subjected to some kind of examination. The dogs, now reassured, were frolicking, but suddenly ran away howling in pain. The leader showed a "miracle" to the witness, he made stones from the garrigue levitate, he passed a large one through the door without damaging it. Soon after they headed towards the ship, which the witness had not yet seen: like a Maurice Chevalier hat, but as big as a bus; it was purring. The object left silently. Missing time. She did not go to the appointment set a year later, day for day. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, le premier dossier complet..." - ed.

In a car, the witness, his wife and two children, saw a white object quickly descending from the northeast. It suddenly stopped and began to oscillate. Stopping at a 30° angle, the light from what appeared to be portholes dimmed in intensity. It remained there, motionless, for 3 or 4 minutes, at an altitude of about 1000 m. It seemed to have two rows of portholes, each about 3 m high: it looked like the part of the harmonica in which you blow. The craft was round and flat and must have been 60 m in diameter, then it began to drift towards Pontiac at about 160 km/h, stopping two or three times. It made no sound. The lights went off and on three times, the fourth time they changed from bright white to yellow-orange. The object disappeared behind the trees at 11:15 pm. (J.

In flight, heading to Hawaii.
Dan Kimball, Secretary of State at the Ministry of the Navy, took off for Hawaii with his entire staff. A second plane followed with Rear Admiral Arthur Radford on board. Suddenly two flying saucers appeared, dived towards Kimball's plane, circled it several times and then disappeared in the direction of the second aircraft which was 80 km away. The same manoeuvre was repeated. The UFOs circled Radford's plane before moving away at an inconceivable speed, as testified by the pilots. Their speed was estimated at 3000 km/h. Upon his return to Washington, Kimball quickly submitted a report and wanted to find out what efforts had been made to clarify the matter. The Air Force and the CIA then made it clear to him that it would be in his best interest to forget the incident definitively if he wanted to keep his post.

Joao Martins and Edwardo Keffel of the newspaper O Cruzeiro were preparing to do a report on the Island of Lovers, and were looking for famous couples: movie stars, personalities, etc. Martins then drew his companion's attention to a strange bird flying over the promenade. It was about 4:30 pm. They soon realized that it was neither a bird nor an airplane. Keffel grabbed his camera and frantically took a series of five shots at 500th. The disc-shaped craft was progressing with curious swaying, as if an airplane was losing balance. It was about 100 meters high at an angle of 45° and disappeared on the horizon.

Skeptical, I looked up and I saw... very high in the sky a kind of bright white ball whose size I could not estimate... Appearing to be motionless, the object stayed for about three quarters of an hour above the airfield before disappearing. A few moments before seeing the phenomenon, Mr. Roux had observed the passage of a white trimotor, but the sphere had appeared far from the wake of the aircraft ((private file, without reference). Mr. Roux, a shepherd, and his son Maurice, 10 years old, were near La Roche sur Yon in the place called "Les Ajoncs" former disused airfield. It was about 6 pm and they were changing parks. An airplane passed in the sky, they looked up. "Dad, look what the plane dropped off". But the object was higher than the plane in the sky. It looked like a glass ball, very bright. It stayed about half an hour, motionless, then, without any noise, it rose into the sky. "(Paris Match n° 169, of 7.6.1952, page 9) (Michel MONNERIE: "The Shipwreck of the Extraterrestrials" ed.

USA, above the Atlantic in flight
At around 1am a Pan American Airlines DC4 was flying south towards Puerto Rico. It had departed from New York and was above the Atlantic approximately 900 km from Jacksonville (Florida) and at an altitude of 2500 meters.(...) At this moment the light began to grow to the point of becoming "ten times as big as the landing light of an airplane". It continued to approach and passed like a flash at the end of the DC4's left wing. Before the crew could react and make out anything precise, two other small balls of fire flew in front of them. The two pilots later declared that they remained frozen in their seats for several seconds, sweat running down their backs. (Edward J. Ruppelt: "Face aux Soucoupes Volantes", ed.

Orfeo Angelucci is a very fragile health mystic, who studies metaphysics, the works of Edgar Cayce, and Yogi Paramahamsa Yogananda. On May 23rd he notices strange electrical symptoms, which discharge inexplicably. As he heads towards Los Angeles he sees an oval-shaped, red object flying in front of him. Suddenly two green light balls detach from it and stop quite close to him, between them he sees a kind of film and an unknown voice says to him: "We are friends, do not be afraid." (...) (continued on July 23rd, 1952) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998) In May 1952, six months before Adamski, Orfeu Angelucci would have had contacts with an extraterrestrial from Neptune and another from Orion. The latter was a female entity named Lyra. (...) Lyra took Angelucci to her planet which she designated as Lucifer. And the journey only took place in spirit. The planet Lucifer is Venus, as we have seen before (Jean SIDER: "Ovni, the unmasked invaders", ed. RAMUEL 1999, p. 75, 76)

KOREA, Chorwon
At around 4:00 AM I was on guard duty when I heard a jet engine in the direction of the north. It made a stuttering sound, as if it was running at a slow speed. At first I didn't see anything, then a small light appeared at about 1100 meters, the light began to fall at a very slow rate, and as it fell it grew in size. As it grew it spread a glow. The fall stopped at about 800 meters in altitude and it took the shape of a disk, with a dull center and a bright outline. The object left towards the east in short bursts. It changed direction, the turn seemed instantaneous, and it went west, another instantaneous change of direction to go east, it climbed at an angle of 25°, then it left towards the north at an angle of 45°. The guard at post #6 alerted his colleague at post #4 who confirmed, but there was more: a F94 had orders to intercept it. Neither on the radar screen of the plane nor on the ground was there an echo of this unusual object. (J. Allen HYNEK: "New Report on UFOs" - Belfond 1979, pp. 87-89)

#1952, May
USA, Prospect Heights (Illinois)
At an unspecified date in the month of May, Mrs. Ann Sohn put the coffee pot on and glanced at the clock: it was 10:50 PM. She went to the back bedroom of the house (on one level) to see if the children were well covered before opening the window. Sitting on her son's bed she took a moment to look at the starry sky. A little minute later her attention was drawn to a bright light to the right and she was amazed to see a bright, round, hovering object over the neighboring field to the east. There was a screen in the window opening and Mrs. Sohn pressed her face against it to get a better look at the object, which was partially hidden by the corner formed by her house. The object, which was 30 to 40 feet in diameter, was bright and hovered absolutely motionless about 100 feet above the field for 3 to 5 minutes. Underneath the UFO there was a cloud of vapor or mist that slowly slid along the bottom of the object to the right, giving the impression that the object was resting on a small cloud. Mrs. Sohn could not say where the mist was coming from, since she could not see any exhausts or other openings. Since she was laterally under the object she saw that it was round. Along the edge of the object there were about 15 square portholes and just below a line that seemed to be the edge joining the lower part to the upper part. The upper part had a dome that seemed to be made of plastic or Plexiglas. The entire object was a bright white, except for the windows. Several were black and from the dome came a pale bluish glow, as if it were lit by other elements of the UFO. Inside the dome there were two small vertical objects, resembling antennas or small masts. At the farthest part of the UFO from the witness, three windows emitted intense light and at each window Mrs. Sohn saw "a member of the crew". The two closest windows showed silhouettes looking outwards, the last occupant seen in profile, at the extreme right, examining some kind of panel on the wall. The three occupants did not move. Mrs. Sohn tried to wake her son, but he continued to sleep. Mrs. Sohn's father was resting in another room of the house, but the witness was too scared to call him out loud. She defended herself from leaving the room for fear that when she returned the object would have disappeared. Meanwhile, the silhouette at the first window (on the left) made a movement of the right hand as if to push a lever, which had the effect of increasing the emission of vapor. This occupant moved back, pushed a lever with his left hand and the vapor changed color: from white it became green with orange reflections, then became orange with green remains. Immediately, while the silhouette on the right remained motionless, the one in the center pushed a lever with his right hand and the entire UFO, except for the non-lit and black windows, became a bright orange and left, rising very little, at an enormous speed towards the north, the speed being such that in a fraction of a second the object was out of sight. At the time of departure there was no emission of vapor or smoke, and no sound was heard. The three occupants (one of whom did not move during the entire observation) wore full-body suits, head included, except for the face. The light was so intense that the facial features or the shape of the hands were impossible to distinguish. There were secondary effects but Mrs. Sohn did not make the connection with the observed UFO. In the neighboring field which contained a whole parcel of garlic, there was none left. The grass was dead over a width of 25 feet. Shortly after the observation, the ten rosebushes planted on the east side of the house withered on the spot to the great despair of the witness who took very good care of them. The paint on the exterior woodwork on the east side of the house peeled off after showing blisters. The owners of the neighboring field had planted a green hedge to mark the separation: all the shrubs died.

GABON Port-Gentil
At 2 o'clock in the morning, it was in the sky of Black Africa, in Port-Gentil, that a mysterious craft was seen. Testimony from the commander of a merchant ship and several members of his crew. The commander specified that the craft had described a double loop before diving out to sea at great speed. It was an extremely bright and phosphorescent orange light, moving with dizzying speed, following a substantially straight trajectory. The craft, visible for three minutes, made no noise. It must have been at 3,000 or 4,000 m altitude, and its apparent diameter was that of a planet. At its appearance, the "object" had come from inland, above Port-Gentil. It stopped, turned to the right and resumed its initial route after having made the same maneuver. All this excludes the "meteor" hypothesis. The same night, after investigation, it was established that no plane had flown over Port-Gentil. (Jimmy GUIEU: "The S.V. come from another World" Fleuve Noir, 1954 - Omnium Littéraire 1972 p. 49)

Good weather reigns over this corner of Germany. Suddenly the three
crew members jump: a few hundred meters in front of
them, and at a slightly lower altitude, a yellow "biroute" has just
appeared. The three men immediately think they have
got themselves into a shooting range .. The captain reduces the gas. "But
it's a glider," he exclaimed a moment later. Strange glider without
fuselage and whose oblong and orange wing shines strangely in the
ending day. Suddenly it is miraculously in front of the
nose of the plane and the captain makes a "dog leg" abrupt
to counter the crazy recklessness of the object. The shaken and
intrigued passengers put their heads to the portholes and also see
the appearance. It is clarified for a moment in the form of an orange and incandescent disk that immediately escapes at a dizzying speed.

Two experienced pilots, Messrs. F. Cavasse and N. Clément, were piloting the DC-4 of the regular London-Orly-Nice service. At 19:28 (local time) they were flying over Draguignan when a kind of luminous white egg, but not blinding, much bigger than a transport plane, crossed their path. It flew horizontally, in a straight line, at a speed of around 2 to 3000 km/h leaving behind it a trail of smoke "in dots" white and slightly bluish. This trail was twenty to twenty-five times the length of the egg. The two pilots observed it for 30 seconds with the astonishment that can be imagined.

A few moments later, this thing flew towards the house, approaching to 500 m. The witnesses, taken by panic, fled to another room, they were dazzled. The UFO stopped above a meadow of the Bramafan castle, at 20 m of altitude, at 300 m from the witnesses. Cars stopped on the road bordering this meadow and people got out of them. Suddenly, bouncing, the object took altitude while turning faster and faster, whispering slightly, attracting the branches of the trees and the hair of the people. It disappeared in 5 or 6 seconds. The object resembled the classic saucer, with a dome on the lower face, and a kind of chimney of 15 m long directed towards the ground, from which were coming out colored moving filaments. Wires or ropes were hanging, as if they had supported a gondola. (M. FIGUET/J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni: le premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 57, 58)

Oskar Linke and his daughter were in East Berlin and were returning from one of their motorcycle rides with a sidecar. (They were returning on foot because one of the sidecar tires had burst) His daughter drew his attention to something white that was glinting through the trees of a wood they were crossing (a wood 150 m away from them). It was a light so abnormal that they stopped the motorcycle. Linke hid himself under the bushes and went into the wood. (Suddenly he found two beings resembling men, wearing strange metallic suits that were carefully examining the ground of a small clearing). Very close to them was a rose-colored metal saucer (and of an impressive size). They thus arrived at 25 or 30 m of a disc of 7.50 m in diameter that was resting on the ground of a clearing.<br/><br/>
"It looked like an enormous pot without a tail that was heating up, and it seemed phosphorescent. In the center there was some kind of apparatus - a square thing - a kind of superstructure that came out of the top of the craft like a top hat. It was a bit darker than the rest of the craft which was of a polished aluminum color. (note from vog: hmm? I thought it was rose!) (Under the effect of surprise he called his daughter who had stayed near the motorcycle. Upon hearing his voice the two metallic armored beings rushed towards the craft, entered the cylinder and locked themselves in). We were well hidden and saw two small beings resembling miniature human beings of about 1 m in height and wearing shiny one-piece clothing. On the chest one of them was carrying a box or a package the size of three stacked cigarette packs, on which shone a blue light that was blinking. They arrived from the edge of the clearing and were heading one behind the other towards the craft. When they were only 3 or 4 m away, the last one stretched out his hand, touched the helmet that shone like glass of the first one. They stopped and one of them slowly turned to look to our left. Upon seeing him my daughter jumped. The creatures hurried to enter the craft through a porthole at the top of the central superstructure. We then saw that the disc had two rows of portholes around its circumference. They were about the size of those of ships. Under our eyes the square superstructure went back into the dome and at the same time the object slowly rose up. We then noticed that a square thing similar to it was coming out of the base of the craft and apparently making it rise from the ground. Then the object rose up to about 30 m, stayed hovering for a moment, then gained speed and disappeared." (Frank Edwards: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 152 to 154) (A.

(Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner). Captain William B. Nash, bringing a DC 4 from New York to Miami, and co-pilot W. Fortenberry, working for the first time on this line, saw at 9:12 p.m. a strange glow followed by six glowing discs that approached at a dizzying speed. The DC 4 was flying at 2500 m altitude, the discs were 1 km or 1500 m below, their diameter was around 33 m. They moved in formation. The leading object slowed down so suddenly that the two following seemed to oscillate briefly. During braking, the objects' glow dimmed. Then the 6 objects changed their course by 150° and disappeared, covering 75 km in 15 seconds, that is 18000 km/h! (Johannes von BUTLAR: "Ovni, we are not alone" - Presses de la Cité 1979, p. 79, 80) On July 13 at 9:12 a.m., a DC-4 of Pan American, heading to Miami, was approaching Norfolk. The pilot was W. B. Nash; his second W.H. Fortenberry was acting as co-pilot. Flying at 2400 meters altitude, the DC-4 was a few kilometers from Newport, when, in front of him, a red glow formed. The pilot and his second saw six huge discs; they were rushing in their direction, but lower; flying horizontally, these devices seemed incandescent; it was as if molten metal. The discs were approaching, echeloned. The one in the lead slowed down then straightened up vertically; the five other saucers maneuvered in the same way. Changing course, the leading machine returned to the horizontal and sped westward, the other discs did the same and lined up behind the leader. A second later, two new discs emerged under the DC-4's fuselage and accelerated to join the formation. The glow was becoming brighter and brighter. At the moment they had slowed down, before changing course, the six discs had dimmed; they had only regained their initial color during the acceleration phase. (Donald E.

Fred Reagan was flying with his Piper at 2400 meters altitude. It was 2:32 PM. That's when he noticed some kind of huge, shiny diamond-shaped thing. It was coming towards him at a very high speed. (...) In panic, Fred Reagan didn't have time to react. The object hit his Piper head-on, breaking off the tail of the plane, which after violent shakes, fell towards the ground. (...) He was outside and he felt that he was descending at a dizzying speed (note from vog: without losing consciousness?) Suddenly there was nothing. (...) He felt lifted in the air and he understood that it was the unknown vessel that was attracting him towards it by means of an immense suction system. (...) He found himself plunged into a deep darkness, then he saw three humanoid figures with the appearance of pins. (medical examination, brain tumor discovered and cured, various explanations of kindness. He awoke in a well-earthly hospital room. (...) He died on May 16, 1953. (Jean FERGUSON: "The Humanoids..." - ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1977, pp. 78-82) July 1951 (note from vog: that is one year earlier) Fred Reagan recounted that in 1951 his Piper Cub plane had been hit by a huge UFO and crashed to the ground. He himself remained suspended, attracted and lifted up towards the saucer. There he was treated for cancer with a particular blue light and then gently laid on the ground near the remains of his plane. No one believed his story. He died on May 16, 1952 (note from vog: he dies one year earlier too) in the Atlanta insane asylum: at the autopsy it was found that his death was due to extreme atomic radiation.

At 11:30 PM two radars from the National Washington Airport detected eight UFOs flying at 160-200 km/h, two of which suddenly accelerated. The control tower recorded the same phenomenon on its radar and confirmed it to Mr. Barnes, the main controller. He informed Andrews Air Force Base, since the White House and the Pentagon, located in the District of Columbia where the federal capital of the Union is located, are obviously forbidden to be overflown. Andrews AFB answered affirmatively: its radar had seen the objects. It even specified that the sudden acceleration of one of them had brought its speed to 10,000 km/h. At dawn the operators saw, with the naked eye, a large luminous sphere of bright orange color above them. Mr. Barnes, at the Washington National Airport, observed the objects with a theodolite. Around 12:30 AM on July 20th, he alerted the air defense. Reaction interceptors took off from Newcastle AFB (Delaware) since the tracks of Andrews AFB were temporarily impracticable. When they arrived, around 3 AM, there were no more objects in the sky: they returned to their base. New alert above Washington, new request for interception at Newcastle AFB, new appearance of the objects on the radars, new disappearance of these objects on the screens. Meanwhile, during this crazy night, airline pilots confirmed in their flight reports that they saw lights that they could not identify in the places indicated by the radar operators. Mr. Chambers, a radio engineer, when leaving the Washington NA radio station at 5 AM, saw five huge discs and testified to it.

He approached the place while hiding and saw a black craft two meters in diameter, with a dome on its belly, about three meters high, as big as "a room" emitting a blue light. A hose was coming out of it and hanging in the water. On the lower part there were two large and two small propellers. In the upper turret a kind of porthole came out and the witness thought he saw a man making a gesture with his arm towards him. At the same time a green ray came out from somewhere on the craft, causing a shock throughout his body. When he looked again, the craft had gained altitude and was moving away at a dizzying speed.

A flying saucer crashed in the desert and the debris of the craft, as well as the bodies of three occupants, were immediately shipped to Wright Patterson where a film was made with views taken immediately at the crash site or later at the base. The first showed the craft embedded at 45 degrees in the desert sand and an open door below, from which the humanoid corpses were extracted. The following views showed these corpses lying on tables. They were about 1.20m tall, with huge pear-shaped heads, long arms that reached down to their knees, large open eyes with holes instead of a nose and ears, and a grayish skin.

Above the Wright Patterson base, two "Sabres" were returning from patrol when the observers of an interception station had just picked up the echo of a craft moving at high speed, quite high, vertically above the airfield. The two pilots, Commander James Smith and Lieutenant D. Hemer, were given the order to try to intercept this craft. It was a round and shiny object. After quickly consulting each other, they split up, making numerous changes of direction while continuing to gain altitude: "We deliberately maneuvered in circles," they explained later, "to make sure it was not a reflection of light. At first, the object seemed red and white to us, then only white". Despite their maneuvers, the object did not change its appearance. Undeniably, it was a solid body. The two pilots armed their machine guns, released the safety catch. The sights lit up. But the craft seemed to pay no attention to their approach. It is true that, according to the spot that appeared on the on-board radars, it was flying at least 4,000 meters above the planes. However, the "Sabres" which had reached 12,000 meters, began to level off. Making a sharp turn to take a film, Smith lost altitude and could not aim his camera. Climbing back to 12,000 meters, he was luckier this time and managed to take several meters of film before the "Sabre" made another dive. A few seconds later, the craft suddenly accelerated and disappeared. (Charles GARREAU: "The Pilots Testify: UFOs are Among Us" - Historia n° 421 Dec. 1981 p. 100-101, case taken from (Donald E.

Two silver discs were spinning above the base, one behind the other. They were joined by 6 other discs. All together they took the formation of a diamond before disappearing. (Marcel J. Lefèvre - 1968 - Brussels) At 4:45 PM two huge silver discs, evolving at different altitudes, had appeared coming from the east. From the ground, pilots of jet aircraft observed the phenomenon. Suddenly they saw the upper disc dive and level off with the other. Then the two saucers began to spin above the airfield, behaving like fighter planes in aerial combat. The first to spot them was Lieutenant Swimley, who looked through binoculars but noticed no details. Meanwhile the radar of a ground interception station had spotted blips on its screen. As the pilots hastened to their F-86s, six other discs joined the first two.

Some, with reason, took Desverger's story seriously. The scout leader's arm was indeed very red, his hat burned, and when the sheriff arrived at the clearing where the incident had taken place, he noticed that the ground bore traces of fire over a small area. Nevertheless, Devergers refused to reveal anything more to the journalists, offering to grant the exclusive of his adventure to a magazine. From then on, some people, myself first, began to ask questions. (…). It should be noted that three months later the scout leader's story was published in the "American Weekly Magazine" (Donald E. KEYHOE: "The UFO File" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.102, 103 and 108) IN REALITY: if one reads all the pages that KEYHOE devotes to this case, it is a terrible hoax. In the evening of the 19th, on a field near West Palm Beach, three scouts were on a night outing with their leader Sonny Desverger, aged 30. As they entered the palm forest, Sonny Desverger saw six lights in the sky, like the windows of an airplane flying at night. These lights plunged into the woods. Sonny thought it was a plane in distress. He and the three scouts immediately set out to search. After covering 400 m Bobby Ruffin, one of the young scouts, saw the lights again: they seemed motionless at the top of the trees. Sonny lit his lantern and, armed with a machete, he cleared a path through the bushes.<br/><br/>
- If I'm not back in ten minutes, call the sheriff,
he said to his scouts.
After a while, the latter, not seeing him return, rushed to the sheriff's house. Absent from his home, he was contacted by radio and arrived 30 minutes later at the place where Sonny Desverger had left his small group. While the scouts explained what had happened, Sonny appeared at the top of an embankment. Pale, trembling, he kept stammering: - I'm coming, here I am.
He no longer had a lantern but had kept his machete. His left arm was bloody with the trace of a deep burn. His cape - or his jacket - was pierced in three places. His hair was disheveled and russet. When he was somewhat recovered from his emotions, when he was bandaged, he could tell his adventure:<br/><br/>
"(…) I soon stopped, feeling a strange impression. It seemed to me that I was not alone. Nothing apparently confirmed this strange sensation. Suddenly the air became suffocatingly hot around me. I looked up, the stars were no longer visible.
I lit my lantern and pointed it upwards. About a meter above my head I discovered a dirty gray metallic surface. I could have touched it with my machete at arm's length... and I was afraid. I clearly remember thinking: get out of here! I moved cautiously and arrived under the edge of the thing. It was a disc about ten meters in diameter with a kind of hemisphere at its upper axis silhouetting against the sky. There was no light. The machine tilted gently. Its upper surface was better visible. I was about to flee but did not dare to make sudden movements. Suddenly, in the hemispherical dome, an opening was revealed. And Sonny Desverger saw... a living creature. A strange creature no doubt. Frightening? Threatening? He obstinately refused to specify this to the journalists who interviewed him on this point. (…) .

10:15 a.m. Witness: pilot of a F-84G jet fighter, Col. G.W. Johnson. Two silver balls 6 feet in diameter flying side by side, one quickly turning grey, the other turning grey more slowly. On a turn one of the balls became an elongated grey object. Observation lasted 10 minutes. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner). Col. Carl Sanderson said "I was piloting a F-84 flying at an altitude of 10,700 meters. At 10:15 a.m. I saw two silver, round objects flying side by side above Hermanas (N.M.). One of the saucers turned right in front of my plane. Then the two craft disappeared, then reappeared above El Paso (Texas). One made a vertical climb of 600 to 1000 meters, the other passed in front of me to join the first. A few minutes later, the two machines had disappeared. (Donald E. KEYHOE: "The Flying Saucer File" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.112) 1953 (note of vog: year error?) 24 August; 10:15 a.m. Col. Carl Sanderson aboard a F-84 at 10,700 m, saw 2 UFO's circular in silver color. One of the objects made a turn in front of his plane. After an ascent of 600 to 1000 m they moved away. (Inforespace n° 8 p. 3 - 1973 - SOBEPS)

USA, Pittsburg, Kansas.
5:35 a.m. Witness: William Squyres, a musician from a radio station, was on his way to work when he saw an object hovering 3 m above the field alongside the road. He stopped and got out of the car, but his artificial leg prevented him from getting closer than 100 m to the object. It was not completely still, it was swaying slightly. He then heard a low humming sound and the object began a vertical ascent with a sound similar to that of a large flock of quail taking off at the same time. The object shot up until it was out of sight. It was lenticular, 21 m long, 3.50 m wide and 8 m high, with a dull, smooth aluminum color. There was a single window at the front from which a blue light of different shades shone, and he saw the head and shoulders of a man, sitting still, looking forward. In the middle part there were also several windows, with a bluish light, and the witness saw movements that he could not interpret as either human or mechanical, although they were not regular. At the back and underneath there were no openings. Along the entire outer edge there was a series of 15 to 30 cm diameter propellers mounted on a support, so that they rotated on a horizontal plane along the edge of the object, at high speed. (Brad STEIGER: "UFO, the Blue Book Project" - Belfond 1979, p. 115, 116) (J. Allen HYNEK: "New Report on UFOs" - Belfond 1979, p. 195 to 197 - the location and measurements between parentheses come from this author) On the morning of August 27, Squires was driving in Pittsburgh when he saw something circling above an open field. He approached to get a better look: three meters from the ground was a machine composed of two huge discs placed one above the other, between which was a kind of cabin with three or four curved portholes. A bluish light seemed to come from inside. Squires later specified that the diameter of these discs was around 23 meters. Out of his car, the musician cautiously approached the curious machine. When he got as close as possible, he vaguely distinguished movement in the cabin. It seemed, he said, to be a human form (On this last testimony, however, he expressed some reserve) At the same time he heard a curious and rhythmic sound. Before he could get any closer, the mysterious machine took off vertically and quickly disappeared into the sky. (Donald E. KEYHOE: "The Flying Saucer File" - Hachette 1952, p.104,105)

FRANCE, Crecey sur Tille (Côte d'Or)
Observation for 3 minutes by Désiré Bedele: a luminous halo with a border resembling smoke, in the center of the halo an object in the shape of a cigar in a horizontal position is drawn, the whole descends obliquely in the direction of the witness. The object wobbles in place, its movement slows down considerably and the witness distinguishes a rotation movement, the wobbling increases and from time to time the craft occupies a position of 40° relative to the horizontal. The rotation and the wobbling seem synchronized. (...) It disappears leaving a luminous trail of triangular shape, which the clouds quickly blur. The diameter of the disc corresponded to three times the length of an airplane flying at 2000 meters. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 257, 258)

The children, including Eddie and Fred, sons of Mrs. Kathleen May, claim to have seen a monster emerge from a vibrating red ball. An expedition is organized, led by Gene Lenon, a 17-year-old young man, who volunteered as a policeman, to which Mrs. May joined, armed with a powerful flashlight. They enter the forest and there they see a creature 4 m tall, whose humanoid body is covered with a green rubber suit that reflects the light, and wearing a helmet. The face is red with two huge orange-green eyes. It emits a stench. It moves but without moving its feet and seems to slide on the ground. General panic, including the dog who takes off first. (Jacques BERGIER: "Les E.T. dans l'Histoire" - J'AI LU - 1970 - p. 162, 163) (Brad STEIGER: "Ovni, le Projet Blue Book" - trad. Belfond 1979, p. 84, 85)...measured 2.70 m. Its face was injected with blood, its green body emitted flashes of light and exhaled an abominable smell that made those who saw it at close range vomit. It terrorized the region. It disappeared without a trace, but was seen in South America six years later. (Jean FERGUSON: "Les Humanoïdes..." ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1977, p. 17)

France, near Beine (Yonne)
M. R. Sommer, pilot and aircraft constructor, wrote to us: "I was driving back in my car, the night was dark, no moon, no stars. After leaving the village of Beine and having driven for about 5 minutes, our surprise was great when we noticed an unknown, shining object had appeared in the sky to the left of the road. The object had the shape of an olive and the color of gold. Its major axis was vertical. The spectacle was magical. The appearance lasted about five minutes. The minor axis of the object was slightly smaller than the apparent diameter of the moon. A few moments later I visited the neighboring villages, I examined the churches fearing that this appearance might come from illuminations or reflections, etc... But everywhere it was absolute calm and no remarkable lights were to be seen, the road was deserted.

#1952, September 22
Canada, Drum
The most troubling case was the incident at the Drum military camp during the night. For thirty minutes, the officer on duty and a small number of soldiers observed an object of round shape, red-orange, moving above the camp. At least three times they heard a noise that they later compared to the buzzing of a generator or a disc rotating. During this half hour, the mysterious machine flew, making tight turns, accelerating, rising, descending. It mainly flew at a fairly low altitude, as the buzzing was perceptible on the ground. (Donald E. KEYHOE: "The UFO File" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.135)

A large cigar-shaped craft was observed above Denmark. Below it flew several discs spinning on themselves at an extreme speed. From several points of the territory the presence of the mother spaceship and several discs in the sky was reported. (Donald E. KEYHOE: "The UFO Files" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.144)

#1952, September
FRANCE, Saint Samson (Morbihan)
At around 9pm, farmer Le Maziff stepped out of his house. He then saw a diffuse halo, in which was inscribed a shape resembling a dirigible balloon. This thing was around 30 metres long and 12 metres high. It landed in a meadow, a few hundred metres away from the farm. In this pasture there were cows. Le Maziff called his brother, his wife, and his farmhand. A slope and trees hid the craft from them, but there was a light that illuminated all the meadows. Strongly impressed, the witnesses did not dare to approach it and did not realise how it flew away. The next day, the farmer noticed that one of his cows had become like mad: he had to have it slaughtered. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 72)

#1952, September
IRAN, various locations
There were 13 reports of UFO sightings, 11 of which were at the border with the Soviet Union. The other two were from Kazerun and Seravan (at the border with Baluchistan). The luminous objects were mostly round and flew at very high speed, the observations lasting only a few seconds at most. In three reports a deafening noise was associated with the observation of the object. ("Ufo's: a Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 203)

#1952, October 1
USA, Pascagoula, Mississippi.
7:40 p.m. Witnesses: Mr. and Mrs. C.C. McLean and one other witness. An object of a milky white color, in the shape of a powder puff, hovered for 5-10 minutes before quickly flying away on an arcing trajectory. At the end of the 22 minute observation, a loud bang was heard. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner).

#1952, October 6
FRANCE, Draguignan (Var)
"This evening, we crossed in full flight a mysterious object that was moving at a lightning speed above our aircraft." Testimony of the aviators François Cavasse (32 years old) and Michel Clément (31 years old) who provide the regular service London-Orly-Nice: "At 7:28 pm, we were flying over Draguignan and the Var department, when my co-pilot Clément drew my attention to the evolution of a strange-shaped luminous object. We immediately compared its shape to that of an elongated egg. The trajectory of the object was absolutely straight and horizontal. Its speed, lightning, was regular. The "egg" was entirely lit, but with a white light, not blinding, reminiscent of that produced by neon. Thus, we were able to follow its course for 30 seconds without leaving it out of sight." The craft left in its wake a trail representing twenty to twenty-five times its length. The smoke released, white slightly bluish, had the appearance of dots. We estimated the lightning speed of the craft to be two or three times that of a jet engine running at full power. (...) The flying egg was traveling at 2 to 3,000 km/h. It seemed much bigger to us than a normal transport plane.

ITALY, Signa
Mrs. Mariska Ferruzzi Piantanida was at the edge of a wood when she saw, in the clearing, a silver globe motionless, at 40 meters altitude and 30 meters away. "It looked like a lamp post placed at the tops of the trees". After five minutes, the phenomenon began to move slowly, on a semi-circular trajectory. Excited, the witness shouted: "A flying saucer!" gesturing and making signs. The object then came towards her. It had a disc-shaped phosphorescent green color and left a black smoke tail. At the closest she saw that it was a flattened globe, thinner towards the bottom, cut like the neck of a bottle and widening in the shape of a nacelle. The object then rose slowly, then quickly disappeared from view. The entire observation lasted from 7 to 8 minutes. (CISU, file 5203, UFO in Italia I, 153-156)

#1952, October 14
France, Lens and Oléron
1400 people residing in Lens and Oléron reported another machine taking the shape of a cigar followed by a whole convoy of discs. According to the testimonies of Oléron, hundreds of filaments, resembling fibers, detached from a disc while it was performing a series of zigzags. It was claimed to have been taken as in a spider web. (Donald E. KEYHOE: "The UFO File" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.145) (note from vog: at this date and in these places I have not found anything like this in the work of French authors and researchers..., however, see October 17th...)

#1952, October 15
FRANCE, near Nîmes-Courbessac
Felix Fize and his companions saw from the construction site where they were working, around 7 pm coming from the southwest a kind of whitish cloud that was advancing quickly. When it presented itself in profile coming to their height they saw that in reality it was a metallic cylinder of a silver yellow, with a rounded nose. It measured about 30 m long by 6 m in diameter and was flying at an altitude between 600 and 800 m. The back of this cylinder disappeared into a kind of cloudy haze. The craft passed over the construction site, being almost vertical and heading towards the northeast. On the cylinder three huge portholes or windows brightly lit from an interior source very white and inside 5 or 6 living beings (they were moving) visible up to the waist. Kaki clothing, thick glasses and helmet. Very low noise, like a rustling. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V. - Fleuve Noir 1956 - p. 240, 241)

#1952, October 17
FRANCE: Oloron (Basses Pyrénées).
Yves PRIGENT, general supervisor of the town's college, along with his wife, his three children and a professor, observed a column of luminous cloud at night. (Henry DURRANT "Le livre noir des S.V. - Laffont 1970 p.29, cites Aimé Michel in "Lueurs sur les S.V.) "The object was whitish, with perfectly clear outlines. White smoke was coming out of the top. The strange cylinder was preceded by about thirty balls without clearly defined outlines, resembling smoke flakes... The objects traveled in groups of two, following a broken trajectory, marked by a rapid and short zigzag. It happened that two objects moved away: a whitish trail then connected them, like an electric arc" (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p.83) There was also the emission of "angel hair" (Henry DURRANT: "Le dossier des OVNI." - Laffont 1973 - p.149) Many witnesses saw a strange inclined cigar passing through the blue sky, accompanied by a plume and dozens of luminous balls surrounded by a ring that advanced in a zigzag. An abundant trail fell to the ground, in the form of filaments that disintegrated in a few hours. Were these Virgin's threads spider secretions? Something else?

#1952, October 27
FRANCE, Marseille-Marignane
Customs employee Gachignard reported seeing a shining object gliding between two hangars and coming to a stop a few hundred meters away from where he was. The aircraft was pointed at both ends and was about 4.50m long and 1m thick in the middle, with about half a dozen small square windows from which a soft yellow light radiated. Gachinard ran to get a closer look. When he got to about 50m away, it suddenly emitted a shower of sparks, rose into the air, and then shot forward at such a low altitude that it almost hit the fence surrounding the airport. The incident occurred around 2:30am. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 97,98). It was 2:03 when a small light appeared on the left, flying over the runway, not very bright but clearly visible. Its speed was that of a jet landing. (...) It stopped right at ground level without slowing down, 100m to its right. The witness headed towards the craft (which was his job) and in 30 seconds was about 50m away. He then became scared, stopped, and took out his gun. At that moment, the object emitted a hissing sound and instantly shot off at a lightning speed without any air displacement. It was a dark grey object, 5m long and 1m thick, pointed at both ends and tapered. Four square windows, 20cm on each side, emitted an unstable, pulsating light, first blue, then vaguely green. (M.

FRANCE, Gaillac (Tarn)
Ten days later (after the Oloron case) at 4 pm, a similar squadron slowly passed over Gaillac before disappearing with a dizzying ascent speed. But here the saucers seemed to turn and a bluish glow ran along their edges, while all the other aspects agreed with those observed in Oloron, including the fall of glass wool (Jean PLANTIER: "The Propulsion of Flying Saucers by Direct Action on the Atom" ed. MAME 1955, p.114)
At 4:00 pm, Mrs. Dore, residing on the Toulouse road, was intrigued to hear her chickens cackle in a strange way. Instinctively she looked up thinking that a buzzard or other bird of prey was flying over her farm and had triggered panic terror in the yard. Unusual objects were moving in the sky. Her son and wife and her father-in-law Mr. Corbières had come as well as neighbors.
The sparkling objects in the sun came from the southeast, slowly spinning on themselves, grouped two by two. The witnesses first saw four of them. Flying low they swayed slowly and were animated by a rotational movement. Then a dozen other similar devices joined the first ones. In the middle of these last objects was a kind of long flying, whitish cylinder, which emitted a plume of white smoke. From the whole squadron - and especially from the plume of smoke - pieces of a strange material resembling glass wool detached themselves. But on contact with the fingers - because several people touched this material - this cotton disintegrated, became gelatinous and completely disappeared. Ten minutes later this strange formation flew over Gaillac before moving away towards the Lot and Garonne. (..) some of these filaments had caught on the telegraph wires or the branches of trees. The atmosphere of ideal purity facilitated observation. The slightest details could be seen. The objects, of perfectly circular shape, had a bulging part in the center, like the hat of a boater.

(cf: August 1952, Bakersville) Two individuals appeared in the backyard of Cecil Michael's garage. Cecil recognized the two occupants of the saucer from the month of August. They were dressed in a costume from another age: a monk's hood covered their head, a Roman tunic covered their body down to their knees, and in addition to the sandals they had on their feet, a kind of calf bandage was wrapped around their legs, revealing the skin with each turn! These apparitions or visions lasted until January 1, 1953. Cecil was the only one to see these entities, but one day his dog barked furiously at them as if he perceived their presence in some way. When a customer arrived, the two figures gradually faded until they disappeared completely. Cecil claimed to have received an implant in his skull. At the time this notion was totally unknown. Yet Cecil said he was forced to follow these two tormentors who made him get into their saucer and took him to visit the Planet of Hell! During this journey (in spirit, said Cecil) which lasted 4 days in dream time for four hours of real time, something extraordinary happened. Every time the garage phone rang, Cecil was brought back, then taken away again when the problem was solved! On the planet of Hell he saw small dark-skinned humanoids obeying the orders of a normal-sized human being, who threw corpses into a gigantic sea of fire. (...) Cecil was ordered to publish the account of his experiences, which he did in 1955, while continuing to run his garage. (Jean SIDER: "Ovni, the unmasked invaders", ed. RAMUEL 1999, p 81, 82)

Two RAF officers, Lieutenants Johnson and Smythe, were flying above Kent at 7000m altitude when, to their right at about ten kilometres away, an object flying at great speed appeared. "It was like a giant tennis ball, emitting a blinding light." At the moment their plane crossed the dazzling bolide, their engine began to splutter and their compass went wild. A radar station of the 256th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment of South East London had picked up the echo of the mysterious object. (Charles GARREAU: "Alert in the Sky: The Abduction Files" ed.

On that day, a police report was filed by one Nello Ferrari, 41 years old, who was working in a field near his farm in Castel-Franco (Emilia). Suddenly, a reddish glow spread around him. Looking up, he saw a craft made up of two overlapping discs, about twenty meters in diameter, from which a motor noise was coming. The saucer was hovering only about ten meters above the peasant. At that moment, he heard words spoken in an incomprehensible language (like: Verren... iirg... unch) by three "men" dressed in rubber clothing and whose faces were protected by a transparent material globe. After that, Nello Ferrari said, the upper disc of the craft folded onto the lower disc and the craft rose into the sky at a dizzying speed. "I'm still terrified by the sight!" he told the police of Castel-Franco to whom he recounted his adventure.

In November 1952, around the same time as Adamski, a certain George Williamson had an encounter with a Venusian, if we are to believe his book published in 1957. In fact, he dialogued with the entity through the medium John McCoy! Williamson formed a small group of alleged contactees, among which was a "Mr. R" who received messages from extraterrestrial entities by radio. Other members of the team obtained communications from the same sources through automatic writing, using a Ouija board and other modes of reception by telepathy!

At Belle Ile-en-Mer, Friday evening, Mr. Pascal Gauci, a traveling salesman, driving on the road to Locmaria was surprised, upon arriving at the place called "La Butte", to see on his left a luminous ball whose diameter seemed to him to be 3 or 4 times that of the moon. This ball was motionless in the sky. After a few seconds it moved slowly to the left, maintaining the same altitude. At times this ball flattened itself as if it were pivoting on its transverse axis, losing at that moment its orange tint to take on a white tint. Then it descended slightly, stopped before returning to its right and rising back to its starting point. It thus made three or four of these maneuvers before disappearing in the southwest direction. ("La nouvelle République du Centre-Ouest") (Jean François BOEDEC: "Les OVNI en Bretagne, Anatomie d'un Phénomène" ed. Fernand Lanore, Paris 1978, p. 30) At the place called "La Butte" the witness Pascal Gauci observed a luminous ball which seemed to turn on itself at low altitude. Its color changed from orange to white. Oscillations. Diameter: from 10 to 12 times that of the moon. (M. FIGUET/J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, le premier rapport complet..." - ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 64 which dates from November 21 or 20).

OUBANGUI-CHARI, Bocaranga region
Father Carlos Maria, merchant Lasimone, and 6 other witnesses first saw a large disc briefly. The vehicle's engine stalled. A little further away, they saw 4 discs or halos of light arranged in a square. One suddenly lit up with a red light and approached. There it stopped for a few seconds before returning to its original point. The things were still there when, 20 minutes later, the travelers resumed their journey.

NEW ZEALAND, Auckland
A UFO was seen above Nedin, a suburb of Auckland, by Mr. J.P. Burke, an 8-year pilot aviator. Mr. Burke states that he was awoken by a metallic noise, quite similar to that of a jet engine. Immediately going to his window, he saw at about 1,800 meters altitude an object resembling a giant cymbal, about the size of a Dakota and surrounded by a gray-blue light. Mr. Burke estimates that the speed of this UFO was between 400 and 450 km/h. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Les S.V. viennent d'un autre Monde" Fleuve Noir 1954 - Réédition Omnium Littéraire 1972 p. 174)

BRAZIL, Angatuba
Writer Dino Kraspedon declared that he saw five UFOs on the mountains and then entered a ground machine and contacted the visitors. The device was a bell-shaped 90 m wide. One of the occupants, a man over 1.8 m tall, told him that they lived on Io and Ganymede where there were not only large races, medium-sized races like on Earth, small races, but also races with white, red, and black pigmentation, just like on Earth. No confirmation is known of Kraspedon's story. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 109) (continued April 53) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

USA, Laredo (Texas) in flight
In the night, the pilot of the F 51, who will be called Earl Fogle since the secret services forbid citing the real names of military witnesses, was 20 km from his base (Laredo) when an object of blue color almost collided with the fighter plane. The unknown device rushed at full speed towards the F 51, whose position lights were however well lit. At the last second it avoided the plane and passed along it at an astounding speed. Fogle saw the object literally buck like a bouncing ball, then come back towards him as if it was preparing to make a second passage as dangerous as the previous one. Fogle quickly turned off the position lights and started to dive. His adversary followed him in a dive until 600 m. Then it took altitude again, described a wide turn towards the base of Laredo, and changing direction again, turned at a very tight angle while rising into the night at an unimaginable speed. (A. RIBERA: "These Mysterious UFOs" - De Vecchi 1976, p. 180, 181)

USA, Gulf of Mexico, Florida
A B-29 bomber was returning to its base after a night exercise and was flying over Florida at about 5000 m altitude. On board were Captain John Harter and Lieutenant Sid Coleman. At 5:25, Sid Coleman sat in front of the radar. Suddenly two spots appeared on the screen. They seemed to be moving at an incredible speed of 8700 km/h. Then a third point joined them. At this moment Captain John Harter exclaimed: "I see four craft!" Immediately he radioed: "Unknown objects at 3 o'clock right." The men of the B-29 rushed to the portholes and saw objects rushing towards them at more than 8000 km/h. Then they disappeared. A few moments later they reappeared and the game started again. This lasted several minutes. The aircraft appeared and disappeared in turn to the great astonishment of the crew. Finally they rushed towards a huge cigar that seemed to hover in the sky and wait for them. They rushed into it and the immense object disappeared in turn.

BELGIUM, Blankenberge
(GESAG, GS 1273) On Friday, December 12th at around 4:20 PM, Mr. Undorf, the director of the Casino, observed from the Charlier slope a luminous disc with an apparent diameter of 10 to 15 cm that was rising vertically. The disc emitted a luminous ray of about ten meters behind it. When it had reached a certain altitude, it suddenly continued (without turning) its trajectory horizontally towards Zeebruges. A man from Ghent, who was in Trooz Avenue in Blankenberge at the same time, also observed this phenomenon. (Brugsche Courant, 17.12.1952, archive search by Jim Gérard on 7.12.1977)

ISRAEL, Haifa
A saucer was observed flying above Mount Carmel. Those who saw it said that they were two objects in the shape of an ellipse. The mysterious objects were seen by students and their teachers in Acco. The young people chased the saucers, on foot, for two minutes. A colonel said that the objects were flying in close formation, one behind the other and then one next to the other. (...) It was on the front page of the Maariv newspaper on December 25, 1952. There will be no more UFOs over Israel until 1978.

SOUTH AFRICA
Towards the end of 1952, the Sunday Times of Cape Town, South Africa reported that a "rocket" had been seen above Table Bay. It was said to have gone straight up and then come down again, but it is not known whether it had come out of the water or had dived in. A police launch patrolled the area as it was thought that it might be a distress rocket, but there was no boat in the vicinity.

CANADA, Sherbrook (Nouvelle Ecosse)
One night, the wife of a railway employee heard knocking at her door. As she was alone at home, she leaned out the window to see who it was. She vaguely saw two squat silhouettes and almost at the same time a large round object rose in the sky, followed by a blue-green trail. The next day, the police came to investigate and noted that the shrubs planted in front of the house had their branches torn off, chopped, as if an enormous object had weighed on them.

CANADA, Woods Lake
(cf: 1951, Labrador Desert) The third one crashed on the eastern shore of Woods Lake between Minnesota and Canada. Some journalists who arrived at the scene before the police were able to approach the last one. They said they had seen something that looked like a large plate 15 to 16 meters in diameter, very shiny, with a low dome made of steel and Plexiglas in the center. They spoke of a nuclear-powered device, but according to other details that have come to us, we tend to think that it was rather a perfected version of the vehicle invented by Miethe. Canada has admitted that it is trying to build a flying saucer (...) (Peter KOLOSIMO: "Shadows on the Stars" - Albin Michel 1970, p. 325)

NORWAY, Spitzberg
An article published on June 28, 1952, in the "Saarbrücker Zeitung" announced in the sky of Sptizberg, a large metal disc. According to it, six Norwegian jet pilots were flying over the Hinlopen Strait when their radios were jammed by strange parasites. While the formation was describing a loop and looking for the cause of the phenomenon, its leader, Captain Olaf Larsen, had seen, lying in the snow, a huge disc made of a blue-colored metal. Accompanied by a rocket specialist, a certain Norsel, several officers put on skis: the disc was empty of occupants. It measured 38 meters in diameter (etc ... with Russian inscriptions, always according to the Saarbrucker Zeiting) IN REALITY: big journalistic hoax. (Donald E. KEYHOE: "The UFO File" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.49, 50) A flying saucer was discovered in the inhospitable snow and ice of northeastern Spitzberg, (...) The object looked like a silver disc made of an unknown metal, with jet engines spinning the disc around a small dome of transparent plastic material. In this dome there were several instruments. There was also enough space to accommodate atomic bombs or others. (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970 - p. 150-151; he cites Controversial Phenomena, vol.1, n ° 2, March-April 1964, pp 13, 14 and thus locates the case in 1963).<br/><br/>
In the Stuttgarter Tageblatt there is a report dated September 4, 1955 with a statement from Colonel Gernod Darnbyl who allegedly said:
The fall of this disc in Spitzberg is a very important event (Frank EDWARDS: "UFOs a Serious Business" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 75 to 80)
In "Le Monde" of August 9, 1952, there is a AFP dispatch of Friday 8, at 12:03 dated Bonn, according to which a saucer (etc ...) The information comes from an article in the German periodical "Der Flieger". "Le Monde" specifies that it does not have the means to verify the assertions of the author: Dr. Beck, unknown to the "Wer ist Wer" - the German "Who's Who". As for "Der Flieger" it is a small magazine devoted to aeronautical questions. (Michel MONNERIE: "The Shipwreck of the Extraterrestrials" ed. Nouvelles Editions Rationalistes, Paris, 1979, p. 140, which considers this kind of press cut as a hoax to feed the myth)
