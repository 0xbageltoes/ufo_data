An 18-year-old student reported seeing a round object, approximately 3 to 3.5 meters in diameter, silver in color, with a protruding ring or circle 20 to 25 cm at its equator. It had a hatch of 1.5 meters at its lower part. The witness's watch stopped at the moment of observation. The object remained stationary at 1.5 meters from the ground and 6 meters from the witness. After 1 to 2 minutes the object disappeared in a gradual ascent towards the northeast while the engine noise increased, then, with a very rapid acceleration, it left in a few seconds. (J. Allen HYNEK: "New Report on UFOs" - Belfond 1979, p. 42, 43)

At 04:00, Eugène Coquil was in his car when he saw a light like a headlight in a field. He then saw an object pass over his car and land on the other side of the road. It was square (note from vog: drawing of the witness: cubic object, the size of at least two cars), with 4 vertical lights, resembling lamps (note from vog: with a light around the perimeter on all sides like a neon light and in the middle of each visible side a row of three huge oval horizontal lights). The witness left and did not see the object leave. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - coll.

At 9 o'clock in the morning, farmer George Pedley was returning to his farm driving his tractor. Suddenly he heard a loud whistling that overpowered the noise of the engine, like the sound of air escaping from a punctured tire. While still driving he checked his tires: they were intact. He continued on his way without paying further attention to the noise. "Suddenly I saw a large machine, of metallic appearance, rise from the marshland, at great speed, about 25 m from me. It was a bluish-gray color, 8 to 10 m wide and almost 3 m high. It seemed to me that it was spinning on its axis at an extremely high speed. It rose from the ground to about twenty meters, then it made a slight downward movement before quickly rising to the sky, where it disappeared in a few seconds at a fantastic speed. I saw no windows or antennas. Neither in the machine nor outside, I noticed any sign of life. (...) "(Henry DURRANT: "The UFO File" - Laffont 1973 - p. 158)

5:45 a.m. Witnesses: Mr. and Mrs. K.R. Gulley (two witnesses). A yellow luminous object at 500 meters altitude turning red when descending. Interference with the lights in the house and a high frequency noise that hurt the witnesses' ears. Duration: 5-10 minutes. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner). RR1. 06 h 05 - 3 witnesses - duration: 5 minutes. "Looking out the window I realized that a red glow was illuminating the whole neighborhood. (...) I called my wife telling her to come and see, that something must have happened nearby. And then suddenly I realized that the light was coming from above. Looking up I could make out the outline of an object passing over my roof, at an altitude between 75 and 150 meters. The red glow was coming from underneath the object, towards the center. It looked like a stream of light coming out of an opening. My neighbor's green truck looked brown. An airplane took off from the aerodrome and passed over the object. All the lights went out until the plane had passed. Then after blinking rapidly three or four times, it changed its westward course for a south-west route and entered the clouds." (J.

Around 7 pm (note from vog: one day and one hour earlier?) in Aluche, several military personnel were on guard duty at an ammunition depot. Suddenly, they saw in the sky a flying saucer about 10 meters in diameter, which landed in front of them and almost immediately took off, leaving three rectangular imprints in the ground forming an equilateral triangle about 1.50m on each side and 1.30m in height.

#1966, March 18
ARGENTINA, near Deseade, south of the San Jorge Gulf
At 4:00 PM, on a deserted beach about fifteen kilometers north of Deseade (south of the San Jorge Gulf), Carlos Corosan, a thirty-five year old farmer, saw a large wingless cigar-shaped craft. He said it was less than thirty-five meters away and estimated its length to be about twenty meters; it had a metallic look and reflected the rays of the setting sun. Its color was gray-black and its surface, apparently smooth, without visible markings or windows or any kind of external organs. However, gray smoke was coming out of the tail.<br/><br/>
Corosan said that "it was rocking quietly" with a sound like an automobile having engine trouble. And then "the mysterious craft stopped and emitted a brief, muffled jet of smoke (sic), after which the smoke became "very dark black". Corosan, having judged that it was not a normal craft, ran to take cover. At that moment, the object was hovering about a dozen meters above the water; it kept this position for a few minutes. Then it began to buzz and "vibrate all over as if it was going to explode". The buzzing was followed by another brief explosion, and the craft began to rise slowly, heading northeast, with the same rocking movements. Corosan was about to leave his shelter, intending to report the thing to the authorities, but he heard a much louder explosion, followed by a decrease in the buzzing. He turned around and just had time to see the object "crash" into the sea. "It didn't float at all. It just hit the water with a huge splash and went down very quickly." (Yvan T. SANDERSON: "The Invisibles Under the Seas" Albin Michel 1979 p. 75-76)

Several professors and at least 80 students from the college observed at 02:00 an exciting light show in a marsh a short distance from their college. William Van Horn, director of the Civil Defense Committee of the county, was among the witnesses. The objects had the shape of a rugby ball, had bright red and blue-green lights at the front and back, and they traveled in formation, varying from time to time. (Frank EDWARDS: "Du nouveau sur les S.V." - Laffont 1968 - p. 25) Ann Harbor.

USA, Temple (Oklahoma)
5:05 a.m. Witness: W.E. Laxson. One large object, like a wingless C-124 transport plane; 75' long, 8' high and 12' wide; with a bubble canopy on top. Sat on highway, a man dressed in military work clothes entered, and it rose after about 40 seconds. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner).
Laxson, an instructor at the US Air Force, was driving towards Sheppard at 5 o'clock in the morning. He found the road blocked by a large object the size of a Douglas C. 124 Globemaster, without wings or engines, which was resting on cushions. A man in a jumpsuit and wearing a baseball cap was examining something under the sides of the aircraft. Laxson is convinced he met an old army mechanic. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T.

AUSTRALIA, Balwyn (Victoria)
At 2:20 PM the witness was occupied in the garden when he suddenly perceived a strong illumination that made him look up to the sky. "It was as if a gigantic mirror was in my garden and was reflecting a blinding light: a shining object came towards me gliding. It must have had a diameter of 20 to 25 feet, and its altitude was probably around 120 feet. It looked like a big mushroom with its tail pointing towards the ground. It rotated around its vertical axis and thus took the position in which I photographed it. Again it started to rotate slowly but on its horizontal axis and its tail faced me. Suddenly, while it was almost stationary, it accelerated so strongly that it disappeared in a few seconds. Several seconds after it had disappeared a "bang" similar to that of an airplane passing the sound barrier was heard. (Inforespace n° 11 - p.24, 25 - 1973 - SOBEPS)

RR1 - 05:05 - 4 witnesses - duration: 1 hour 35 Deputy Sheriff Dale F. Spaur, (...) they are informed by radio that a resident of Summit County reports an object brightly lit as big as a house, flying over the neighborhood at too low an altitude. Jokes fly. (...) Spaur tells: "Neff gets out on the right side and I get out on the left side. (...) When my eyes fell on the wooded area behind us, I saw this thing. At that moment it was rising. It climbed up to the top of the trees, about thirty meters. It passed over the trees and I didn't take my eyes off it. It was so low that you could only see it if it came to us. I looked at Neff, he was watching the car in front of ours. The whole corner was beginning to light up and I told him to look over his shoulder. That's what he did. He didn't say anything, he just stayed for a minute with his mouth open and he must have lowered his eyes because the brightness was too strong. (...) The only thing, the only sound we heard was a rumble, neither loud nor piercing, resembling the sound of a transformer in charge. For two minutes I was scared and I stayed petrified and then I moved my right foot and everything seemed in order. We rushed together to the car, got in and didn't move anymore. (...) I took the microphone and I just said to Bob who was on the line: "This bright object, the one everyone says is circulating around here, well, it's there". And he answered me "Bring it down". It must be said that this thing was not a toy; Good Lord, it was as big as a house and so bright that it made your eyes water. They were asked to take the sighting in pursuit: what they did over 110 km, sometimes exceeding 170 km/h. (...) and that's how there were 2 other witnesses, including Frank Panzanella of the Conway police. (...) (J. Allen HYNEK: "UFOs, Myth or Reality?" - Belfond 1974 - pp. 125-133, 276)
The Associated Press agency reported that pilots from the Air Force stationed in Youngstown (Ohio) tried to give chase to the object, but could not do so because the speed of the UFO was much too slow compared to that of their jets. Some police officers reportedly heard these pilots talking to each other on the radio during the pursuit. Gerald Buchert, chief of the police of Mantua (Ohio) learning that the object was approaching, went out with his camera. He saw it (or a similar one) and took a snapshot.

RR1 - 21 hours - 10 witnesses - duration: 45 minutes. "As the object approached it seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. Above my head I could see nothing else, in the blur of the atmosphere, than lights emitting very bright signals at intervals. (...) If the object had not come closer I would not have run away, but I thought it was going to crash on me." Another witness said: "I started to run. (...) I looked up and I was frozen in place. I saw a large round object just at the level of the rooftops. It was solid. I didn't hear any noise but I thought this thing was going to fall on me. It was like a giant mushroom. I was fascinated, stunned, unable to think and I found myself running to escape it." One of the police officers dispatched to the scene was to add: "There were three lights: red, green and white. This object hovered above the school and seemed to almost stop. The lights shone in flashes. The object flew over the school twice, then moved away." (J. Allen HYNEK: "UFOs, Myth or Reality?" - Belfond 1974 - p. 118, 119, 276) Several people observe around 21 hours three luminous objects circling in the sky. A woman having made hand signals, one of the UFOs approaches at short distance. The witnesses then call the police and two officers take advantage of the show. The television was scrambled during the observation. (Science and Vie, Special Edition 1997: 50 Years of UFO, Atlas of Unsolved Cases, p. 60 to 63)

In the evening, the Kalnicki family had observed a UFO moving along Dorchester Avenue near their 3rd floor apartment. At 5am on the 24th, their daughter Judy, 11 years old, noticed that the object was very close to the window, so close that she could have touched it if the window had been open. She screamed in fear. There was then a loud, deep sound, as if someone had struck the house with a giant blacksmith's hammer. The windows vibrated and the girl's bed was shaken.

(cf. Summer 1874) In 1966 there were no living witnesses of Muriel Trevenard's disappearance left. The almost forgotten affair had already become part of folklore. But in April 1966 strange phenomena occurred again in Newport. (...) That evening, in Newport, 16-year-old teenager Kathy Reeves and a friend were walking back to Kathy's home at Pioneer Mountain when they had the strange feeling of being followed. At one point they turned around and saw "like a flashlight covered with a cloth". "I thought someone was playing a joke on us. So I picked up a stone and threw it at the light. At that moment a lot of big lights lit up everywhere and with fear in our hearts we ran towards the house." What they saw next made them petrify in place. Three bizarre shapes were moving in the meadow, heading towards the multicolored lights below. Aliens? Kathy described them as "three little bits crossing the meadow. They had no head or arms, and their legs looked like tree roots." The trio seemed to be wearing multicolored clothes in "orange, blue, white, yellow and <watermelon>". Screaming, the young girls ran towards the house at "v prime" speed. In the following days there were several "poltergeist" manifestations in the Reeves' house, and the harassed family finally left the house where there was no longer any way to live in peace.

James Pfeiffer had 50 combat air missions during World War II. He received 5 Air Medals and 12 citations for bravery, so it can be inferred that he was not easily frightened: "There was no sound at all and it was as big as an airliner, but without any indication of a company... My body reacted as if I had brushed against danger. I was shaken all day. Photo taken with an Instamatic camera. (J. Allen HYNEK: "UFOs, Myth or Reality?" - Belfond 1974 - p. 30) During a stop at a small restaurant by the river, a strange object suddenly appeared in the sky. In the shape of a sphere, moving 500 m above the front of the house, its diameter was about 20 m before it moved away at a speed of 200 mph. It first emitted a shrill scream, becoming deeper and so powerful that all the restaurant staff rushed outside. Mr. Pfeiffer managed to take two shots. (A. SCHNEIDER-H.

In June 1966, very sophisticated military telecommunications satellites were put into service in the "IDSCP" (Initial Defense Satellite Communication Program) series. Launched in groups of 3 to 8 units, four times, these satellites were placed in a geostationary orbit, i.e. above the equator at 36,000 km altitude. (...) This network was complete, with 26 satellites, two years later. ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, p. 91)

There is also the "Pageos" case in orbit since June 1966, this satellite was well known to sky watchers, as it was easily visible to the naked eye. It was a 30 meter diameter "Mylar" balloon orbiting at 4300 km altitude. Despite this great distance, it shone on the night sky, illuminated by the sun, with the brightness of the North Star. Its coating reflected 98% of the light received. At this altitude it took three hours to complete a lap around the Earth and it happened that one could follow it with the naked eye for more than half an hour, from one horizon to the other.

#1966, June 8
USA, BAF Edwards
(cf: 21.9.64) On June 8, 1966, the second (prototype) XB-70A took off. On board were North American test pilot Al White and Major Carl Cross as co-pilot, for its first flight of this type of aircraft. The aircraft was to be tested at varying altitudes and speeds, and it was to make a passage at Mach 1.4 at 9450 meters altitude above the base to collect information on the supersonic bang. There was another point to check, the Air Force at the request of General Electric was testing the engines of this company. These were GE J93. The tests were to be done with the participation of a Navy F-4B Phantom, a T-38A Talon and an Air Force YF-5A and a NASA F-104N Starfighter piloted by Joe Walker. A Lear Jet also participated for the photos (for publicity). The day before, John Fritz, test pilot of General Electric who would be on board the YF-5A, had asked to fly in free formation with an approximate wingspan between each aircraft. [Ref 9-7] The XB-70A took off from Edwards at 7:15, followed by the T-38A piloted by Pete Hoag and Joe Cotton. (...) At 7:59 White and Cross climbed in altitude, while Hoag and Cotton landed to refuel the T-38. White and Cross made their supersonic passage at 8:30 and were then heading for the rendezvous point, Lake Isabella. At 8:43 all the others had thus joined the large white triangular aircraft (XB 70 A) which was to fly in the lead. (...) The weather was cloudy and in flight the formation plans were changed (for the needs of the photos) and that was the accident: the F 104 N of Joe Walker was too close to the XB 70 A and its stabilizer touched the tip of the front wing before hitting it and getting its wing in that of the other aircraft. It was the crash of the F-104N and the XB-70A. (NASA website 1997 "on The Frontier") It was the jamming of the on-board instruments that cost the lives of two of the best American test pilots: Joe Walker and Carl Cross. The F 104 piloted by Walker came crashing against the giant delta-winged XB 70 bomber, powered by six engines, tearing off part of the rear ailerons. The two planes nosedived and crashed on the Edward base. Al White managed to get out of the burning debris and was taken to hospital in a serious condition. The collision took place when the F 104 was flying at 3000 km/h. (Guy TARADE: "S.V. and extraterrestrial civilizations" - J'AI LU 1969, p. 239) (vog: so this incident has absolutely nothing to do with UFOs; there was no jamming, there was certainly human error.)

Around 9:30 PM the 76-year-old grandmother saw through the window three white lights the size of a human head. They were far away and getting closer. The son-in-law was called: after a few minutes he saw one at 15 m from the house. It went out, then others appeared in the distance, every 2 or 3 seconds one of these lights lit up somewhere, then went out. So he went out. At that moment there were 6 balls spinning on a field, 50 m apart from each other. They lined up and moved slowly. There was no noise. Then they approached a huge white "shell". The witness's son also saw it. This whole scene lasted a very long time. The shell had three branches on each side and at one point each branch had a ball. (see January 6, 1967: continuation).

Miss Marlene Travers, of Melbourne, reported having observed a large silver disc that landed near her. It is said that she was abducted and raped by an extraterrestrial wearing a metallic green tunic. Investigations revealed that this case was a journalistic hoax. (Keith Baskerfield - Australian Abductees, 1989) (note from vog: this Mrs. Marlene Travers passed away in 1996...) In her childhood Marlene Travers had already observed UFOs. In 1966 she was at a friend's house in the countryside. In the evening, out of cigarettes, she went out alone to get more from a store 600 m away. Her attention was drawn to a star in the sky that grew disproportionately. Soon she saw a 15m diameter and 3m thick disc land in a field not far from her. A door opened and a tall and beautiful being, in a metallic green tunic, came out of the craft. He looked at her and telepathically announced that she would have the honor of being the first Earth woman to have a child from an inhabitant of another planet. Frozen with fear, Marlene Travers felt compelled by an irresistible force to follow the creature inside the saucer where he raped her. Just before leaving the spaceship, the young woman stumbled upon a kind of electric button: a flash burn crossed her ankle and she fainted. When she came to, she was lying in the field. No more saucer. Limping, she returned to her friends' house and learned that she had been absent for seven hours. A doctor was called to treat the burn she did not have when she left the house. It would seem that she was indeed pregnant but this state was never followed by a birth. (Marie-Thérèse de BROSSES: "Enquête sur les enlèvements E.T." - Plon 1995, p. 48, 49)

During the night, the radars of two different bases detected a mysterious object above Lakenheath. At the same time, several observers noticed the presence in the sky of several round, luminous, and very fast objects. RAF fighters took off to attempt interception. The on-board radars also recorded the presence of objects. Suddenly, one of them rushed towards one of the fighters and began to circle around it. Terrified, the pilot attempted to escape several times with extremely violent maneuvers. The object followed him as if playing. This game of cat and mouse lasted 10 minutes. And the craft moved away... Case studied by the Condon Commission. Pages 248 to 256 of the "report". Conclusion of the investigators on this observation: The participation of at least one authentic (sic!) UFO is extremely probable.

In the night, the father of the family sitting on his bed, had his eyes on the entrance that led to the sons' bedroom. In the darkness he suddenly saw a small person of 3 or 4 feet tall, dressed in clothes that stuck to his body, enter the dark room. He thought it was his daughter going into the next room to talk to the mother who was there with the boys. Ten minutes later he saw something like a luminous bar that seemed to crumble. He got up, went into the boys' room where they all had seen the bar. He had not seen the little person leave and his wife said that their little daughter had not set foot in the room. No evidence was found to confirm the presence in the house of this small person. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - coll. J'AI LU - p. 81)

Curtis Eckanbrack, 15 years old, accompanied by his two twin brothers Kevin and Bevin (10 years old) was driving a tractor through the fields near the Roosevelt airfield. Around 4:30 pm all three of them saw, at 70 meters distance, a strange device, animated by slight oscillations and flying above the treetops. Immediately they jumped off the tractor and ran 20 meters in the direction of the metallic and shining object that was silently moving at 17 meters altitude. The UFO covered another thirty meters at a speed of 50 km/h then, suddenly, like a rocket, it rose straight up and disappeared into the clouds. (A. SCHNEIDER-H.

Mrs. A. was around 5:20 PM, busy in the kitchen, five of her children were playing outside. The children called their mother to come and see the silent plane. When she went out, the object was arriving just south of the grain silo (72 feet high) going from east to west, slowly. The object was about 35 feet in altitude and the witness thought it was an airplane trying to make an emergency landing, but then she saw it in its entirety. This oval machine measured 50 feet by 100 feet, around the ends there was a bluish glow as well as around the bottom. This glow looked more like a kind of opaque mist. The craft itself was blue and seemed to be metallic and on the sides there were ribs. The object was not luminous. There was only one black window at the front. At the rear end, a part like a spur protruded. The object disappeared by raising its nose and leaving like an arrow. (Blue Book #1199, NICAP)

(..) the witness stayed in his car until the bus driver, worried to see that he was not following them anymore, came back on his route. (…) the bus had scared the monster who dropped his long hair over his eyes. As soon as he did this, to the great surprise of the motorist, his engine started again. He did not tell anything to his friends for fear of being considered crazy. … a few meters from the first incident, his engine had misfires again. Priestly then saw sparks coming out from under the hood as if there was a short circuit. He looked at the side of the road and frozen with fear he saw again the giant looking at him.

Mr. Darenberger saw on the road a dark object flattened at the base and rounded at the top. As the witness stopped, the object came within 20 cm of the road surface. A man with a dark complexion wearing an ordinary shiny blue shirt and trousers emerged and smiled at him. The witness then felt as if he was receiving a message without any words being spoken. This message described another world called Lanulos and suggested that the sighting be reported to the authorities. The man from the saucer promised to return.

were driving in a car, seven miles north of Point Pleasant. (...) They
were passing by one of the two abandoned electric stations, when they
saw on the side of the road, a strange vertical creature observing

feet tall [about 2 meters], and it had two large wings folded on its
back," declared Roger Scarberry. And his wife Linda added: "But what
struck the most was its eyes. They were huge, red, like car headlights."
The car slowed down. For about a minute, the mysterious creature and
the four passengers stared at each other in silence. Then the being
turned around and entered the electric cabin, whose door was open..

G.P., 19 years old, on a Flandria 49cc moped, was returning home at night, around 11 pm. As he approached a small hill in S, he noticed that in front of him the sky was blazing red and at the same time the moped's engine weakened and the headlight dimmed greatly. He was unable to restart the engine. "I saw on my left an circular object from which the light was coming. From 3 to 4 m high for 4 to 5 m base: a flat disc topped with an elongated dome that looked like a beehive. The dome was dark, the base of the craft illuminated with a mixture of red, yellow and white, forming a reddish halo in which the shape was outlined, it was coming towards me emitting a dull noise." The object flew so low that G.P. thought it was going to collide with him, but it certainly passed 10 or 15 m from the ground and continued on its trajectory towards the fields that it illuminated. When G.P. saw this thing up close he noticed a flat dark background circled with reddish-yellow lights, like portholes. When the UFO had moved away 50 m, the moped started again all at once, the machine jumped and G.P. had difficulty controlling it." Total duration of the observation: 15 seconds.

In flight, between Lima and Mexico
In the night of December 29, 1966, the Canadian Pacific DC 8, flight 421, was en route from Lima to Mexico, altitude: 12,000 meters. South of the equator, an object with two white lights descended towards it. "There must have been a solid cockpit between the two lights," said Captain Robert Millbank with all the authority of his twenty-six years of practice, there was also a belt of lights, very similar to a row of lit windows on a passenger plane. For two minutes, the UFO had maintained its position slightly behind the left wing of the DC 8. The entire crew had been able to observe it. Then it had glided back and had soon disappeared. (Donald KEYHOE: "The Strangers from Space" - Pocket Press 1975 - p. 265-266) Robert Milbank, captain of the Canadian Pacific DC 8, submitted a report after landing in Mexico: It was 02:00, the passengers were sleeping. We were flying at 11,000 m, off the Peruvian coast, just below the equator. Two white lights appeared. They were observed by the co-pilot John Dale, the navigator Mike Mole, the trainee pilot Wolfgang Poepperi and the flight attendant Joseph Lugs (in addition to the captain). (...) It stopped at the height of our left wing and in the moonlight we distinguished between the two extreme light points a structure that seemed higher in the middle. The thing flew at our height for a minute or two, then disappeared behind our aircraft. (Frank EDWARDS: "Something New about UFOs" - Laffont 1968, p. 196, 197, which dates this to December 30)

From January 1967, American NORAD operators noticed from time to time the satellization of Cosmos, which barely completed one orbit around the Earth before falling back, to the point that optical and radar installations could locate them precisely. The first of its kind was Cosmos 139, which was followed by several other identical satellites, launched at a variable rate. There were 9 of them in 1967 and on November 3, 1967, US Defense Minister Mac Namara could announce that the US Air Force had identified the nature of this Soviet space program, to which the acronym "FOBS" (Fractional Orbital Bombardment System) was attributed.

The man then decided to take a small path through the fields to go around the object, but the sphere followed him for 60 m before blocking the entrance of the path! The farmer called his son and they saw 6 spheres that scared them so much that they immediately went back into the house.

R0 - 22 hours - 3 witnesses - duration 25 minutes. A conversation had started between the Albuquerque control tower and the pilot of a jet Lear, located near Winslow. He had indicated that he saw a red light, first at his 10 o'clock position, which lit up and went out, then turned into four lights arranged vertically. Albuquerque radar, when the light lit up "painted" an object and remained silent when it went out. The light repeatedly generated four other lights, seeming to re-ingest the lights below it. Then, as the tower warned the plane that the object was approaching it, the latter seemed to play cat and mouse with it, notably through very rapid accelerations. After about 25 minutes and with a prodigious acceleration according to the plane's pilot, the object rose at an angle of 30° and disappeared in less than 10 seconds. Albuquerque radar "painted" the object until its final acceleration. (J. Allen HYNEK: "UFOs, Myth or Reality?" - Belfond translation 1974 p. 94, 95, 275)

They were 20 yards away when it disappeared like a puff of smoke. As the silhouette had not scared them, they kept looking for it. They saw it again on the opposite side and it disappeared again, this time to the bottom of the Dell. They then heard "voices" in the bushes and started to be afraid.

Around 7 pm the lights in the house dimmed, Betty saw a pink light shining through the kitchen window. Her father saw small creatures, just like Halloween monsters, in the yard. One of them looked at him and he felt strange. Then the lights came back on. Everyone was petrified in a kind of catatonic trance, but Betty saw four 1.20 m tall beings enter the house passing through the closed door.

At around 9:45 PM, Mr. Monin was closing the gate to his property as he did every night. When he turned around, he saw a light without a visible source in front of him. The light was sweeping the horizon above the cemetery (60 meters away from him) and it was yellow. The light was coming in a straight line from the cemetery and was increasing in intensity: it was dazzling like a neon bar. The cemetery was lit up as if it were daytime. The witness then called his wife and 17-year-old granddaughter. They were all three on the porch looking. His wife was scared and almost immediately went back inside. As it approached, the object took shape: it was a cigar-shaped object, and no sound was heard. It stopped 35 meters away from the witnesses, directly above the garden. It began to swing in a pendulum motion, and the light was now reddish. No structure was visible. After swinging, the craft descended quickly in a vertical motion. As soon as it touched down, it emitted flames at each end. The right one was yellow and the left one was red. The right one gave off a blowtorch effect. The center of the object was red. On the right side, it sounded like burning brush, with crackling. The light was still blinding, and the object was about 20 meters long and 6-7 meters high. "Then, almost at the same time that we saw the flames appear, we noticed a being, a dwarf, no taller than 1 meter 10 or 1 meter 20. My granddaughter immediately went back inside and I followed her. I asked my wife to come out and see what was happening, but when I went back out I only saw a big red ball taking off. I only saw the little man for 2 or 3 seconds: he was quite big, as if he was wearing a suit. I can't say if he had arms and legs, because in that short time he didn't move." (L.D.L.N. "Mystérieuses Soucoupes Volantes" - ALBATROS-ETAPES 1973 - p. 54 to 57) Mr. and Mrs. Monin and their granddaughter experienced a fairly typical third kind encounter. An object shaped like a cigar lit up the environment, silently approached 25 meters away from the witnesses, oscillated and touched the ground. A dwarf in a suit came out. Then, back in their house, they saw a red ball form, take off, and move away in the sky. No trace was left.

PERU, Huancayo
(cf: January 67, Lima, Peru) Pallmann and Xiti filled the trunk of the car with what they had bought and left Lima for Huancayo. There, Satura Ra was waiting for them with another car. They went into the mountains, and in a completely isolated place, a saucer came to pick them up. On Itibi Ra, they had moved their Moon (Caxa Xixan) and the people were very philosophical, devoted to Cosmophilosophy, called Amat Mayna. They lived very close to nature, nature identified with God. Pallmann visited the colony and the Dschungel plantations. After two days Pallmann was brought back to Earth, to a train station in Peru, and returned to Lima (note from vog: what does he do with his car that is in Huancayo????)

Among the dozens of witnesses: K.R. Miller and his wife, and Frank Jones, editor of the "Journal". Miller saw, from his car, a red light that was quickly approaching and losing altitude: he pulled his car to the side of the road. "The thing descended quickly, at the height of the telephone poles. It crossed the road in front of my car, 20 m away from us, just high enough to avoid the trees. It was an enormous circular craft that must have been 15 to 20 m in diameter. My wife and I had been able to see a row of lights of red, amber, blue and green colors, encircling the lower part of the craft. It had the shape of a bell, or a cup topped with a dome, we couldn't tell exactly because of the dazzling light emitted by some kind of white beacon at its upper part. I then saw two similar lights in the distance and drove towards Lane City and called Frank Jones. Miller, who had served for 4 years in the Air Force, added: "These things didn't look like anything I had seen. The one that passed over the road made no sound, no air turbulence, although its speed seemed to be around 120 km/h. I was able to see a large opening lit up at its upper part, above the craft's rotating beacons". (Frank EDWARDS: "Du nouveau sur les S.V." - Laffont 1968, p. 218, 219)

A large creature, over 2 m tall, with long pointed ears, completely covered in fur was seen in the area between 51st Street and Santa Ana Avenue. The police were alerted by a frightened man who entered the police station at 11:45 PM. Other witnesses came forward, one of them saying that the creature (hanging onto the car?) was looking out the side window while he was driving. It looked like a monkey and was moving its arms.

Two girls heard in the evening, coming from the barn, a noise resembling that of a lawnmower engine. They then saw three humanoid creatures approaching the house. A car that was passing by seemed to frighten the creatures, and a few minutes later the girls and their neighbor saw a UFO take off from a nearby hill.

At the beginning of March 1965, likely the 5th, a Red Cross car was driving through towns to collect blood from volunteer donors, on Highway 2 near the Ohio River. Suddenly, a large, shining object descended above the vehicle and lowered two long tentacles, like arms, on either side of the car. The driver, 21-year-old Beau Shertzer, was extremely frightened and accelerated. But the object followed, and the arms seemed to want to grab the entire car. Fortunately, a number of vehicles came in the opposite direction. When they appeared, the craft retracted its tentacles and fled. An nurse was in the Shertzer car and she was extremely excited when they arrived in Huntington. (Charles GARREAU: "Flying Saucers: 20 Years of Investigation" - Mame 1971 - p. 108)

RR2, around 01:05 - 2 witnesses, husband and wife, painter and hairdresser (William Wallace and his wife). As they drove along the cemetery which seemed to be covered in a blanket of fog, although the night was particularly clear. They suddenly noticed a light. Thinking that a fire was burning in the cemetery and that the fog was the smoke coming from it, they turned around and came back. Having done so, he lowered his windows and leaving the road, he drove along the cemetery towards the light which was just above. He got out of the car, closed the door (the window remained lowered, and raised his arm to point to the object.

Several events happened simultaneously then: all the car lights, the radio and the engine stopped working, he felt an electric shock, felt numb and unable to move. The arm he had raised was suddenly thrown back against the roof of the car with such force that it was imprinted in the glass that covered it. Mr. W. could no longer move a muscle, yet he heard perfectly and his brain seemed to function normally. Then the radio and the car lights came back on while the object, which had not stopped swaying, suddenly climbed emitting a kind of buzzing and was lost above the blanket of fog. (J.

At 02:00 in the night, Mrs. L.B. was awoken by the excessive heat in the room. She got up and saw a large light in a nearby field. She woke up her 25 year old daughter and together they observed the object through binoculars: it was a bright orange dome, on the ground, with a diameter of about 18 m and 300 m away from them. After 10 or 15 minutes, Mrs. L.B. opened the window to get a better view and to listen: at that moment, the object slowly rose and moved away without making any noise. (Traces).

A student from Gy in the canton of Geneva observed on March 29, 1967 between 19:30 and 20:00 an elliptical object of dark yellow color "like a storm-cloud" which moved more slowly than an airplane above the Jura, at an estimated altitude of 2300 to 3000 meters, and whose apparent diameter was that of a fist. The sky was starry, and the wind was nil. "I was coming out of my house. I saw this craft moving towards the northwest. Once it arrived above the Jura, it stopped for 3 or 4 seconds, then it went towards Geneva for 15 seconds; it went in reverse, it stopped in the same place as the first time; it continued its route in the opposite direction to Geneva, then it returned to its stopping point. Then it returned towards the southeast for 15 seconds, then it went towards the Jura behind which it disappeared. The object seemed to turn on itself. It had a small notch on each side (above and below)." (Les Soucoupes chez Heidi, cfr GREPI, Switzerland, 1997)

David Moran (Morris?), in a car, was returning home from work when he saw a glow from the other side of the hill. He arrived at the crest around 2:20am and saw the outline of an object shaped like a cone at 25 or 30 yards, to the left in a field. It appeared as a triangle 7 to 8 meters high and 3 to 4 meters wide. At the top there was a ball. His curiosity turned to horror when he saw five creatures running quickly towards him on the road. He put his foot down and in the beams of his headlights he saw that the creatures were luminous, red-orange, like the object in the field. He couldn't stop in time, heard a thud, and hit one of the creatures. He didn't dare stop, but looking in the rearview mirror, he saw nothing on the road (nothing lying down) behind him, except the whole group, running in a disordered way. (APRG, on the Internet in May 1997) It could be 13 meters high and its base must be 7 meters. It is cone-shaped and glowing red. (Jean FERGUSON: "The Humanoids..." ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1977, p. 31)

Carroll Volts, a farmer, was returning home when he saw a light where an abandoned house had been for a long time. So he veered to go and see. He then saw, at less than 10 meters away, an object thirty meters long and three meters high. He stopped and walked around it. He found a door and knocked. A mechanical voice began to speak to him, asking if he wanted to submit to a complete physical examination and if satisfactory, he could then accompany the crew in flight. The voice added that only adult male humans were selected. (APRG, on the Internet in May 1997)

At 7:45 PM, Justice of the Peace John H. Demler was driving north on Route 72 when the engine of his vehicle stalled and his headlights went out. He then saw an object 10 m in diameter hovering low above his car. The object made a sound like an electric motor and produced sparks. It gave off a smell of sulfur and camphor oil and the car was shaken as it flew away. Twelve hours later the witness experienced physiological effects: sweating and desquamation.

RR1 9:00 PM - 4 witnesses: duration 10 to 15 minutes. "I was on my way home from a Parent-Teacher Association meeting; it was night and I was driving through the countryside on a small road, thinking about the blackboard the association had promised to provide for the school. Suddenly I noticed a light above the hill and I thought, there's one of those old planes that has gone off course and is going to land in that cornfield. (...) And then this incredible object - which had a bit of the shape of a World War I helmet - passed over the hill. So I slowed down. I couldn't understand how an airplane could follow a gliding trajectory - when this huge object, which I estimate was over 90 meters long, detached itself from the hill and stayed above me for a fraction of a second, like an aircraft changing direction. Then it headed for the airfield. It was a terribly bright light. The roof of the car didn't even seem to be a screen anymore. When I looked at my friends, it was like an X-ray photo. "So I went to the airfield. Oh, I didn't have to say anything to the people on the ground. They had seen it. Two lawyers from Kansas City were still standing there, their mouths wide open in amazement. It had practically flown over the airfield. The unglazed control tower had not yet been warned. They were busy with the arrival of an Ozark. The Ozark pilot said when announcing his landing: "I see it, it's below me, it's huge". (J. Allen HYNEK: "UFOs, Myth or Reality?" - trans.

According to the driver, the accelerator no longer responded when the object approached, the engine slowed down and began to cough as if there was no more juice. At the moment when the distance between them and the object seemed the shortest, the latter no longer shone but appeared clearly and distinctly defined, lenticular in shape and of a muted amber color, like the yellow of flashing lights but more attenuated. (...) Object: ovoid, with objects embedded on the entire surface like car headlights, each sending a beam of white light, so that the device seemed bristling with rays of light diffusing in all directions.

On April 21, Mr. Crowder had left the store of his company around 9 pm. When he reached a turn in the paved road, he discovered an obstacle that looked like an orange metal tank, at least 4 m in diameter, resting on legs about one meter high and without any openings or particular features. It was just an object resembling a tank that blocked the way. When he got to about 60 m from the thing, Crowder flashed his headlights. At that moment, in a brilliant blaze emitted from its base, the object rose quickly into the air. It had gone off like lightning, but Crowder had seen it in his headlights. It was 5 to 6 m high. The blazing breath from its base had set the asphalt on fire. When the police arrived at the scene with Crowder, they found a 90 x 75 cm plate still hot from the fire. The next morning, four holes about 18 mm deep and 12 mm wide were found in the asphalt, forming a rectangle about 5 m long. (Henry DURRANT: "The UFO File" - Laffont 1973 - p. 157-158)

Elis Grahn was walking in the forest at night and glanced up at the clear, beautifully starry sky. Motionless and silent, a few hundred meters above the treetops, there was a luminous disc about three times the size of a full moon, deep green and red inside. Boys from the village arrived and were also witnesses. Soon the thing began to rotate on its axis, becoming uniformly greenish-white. Grahn ran to get binoculars and returned with his wife. The disc had moved a bit and was still shining, although its outlines were less clear. Then he soon noticed that near the edges he could see the stars through the object, while the center remained opaque. The strange disc then began to slowly disappear, maintaining the same position. It lost its consistency after a few minutes, and everything had disappeared. Independently, a couple of motorists had seen the disc vanish with the same vaporous aspect.

FRANCE, Champ du Feu (Schirmeck-Strassbourg)
Mr. and Mrs. Schirrmann, their son Jean-Luc (10 years old), and his friend Philippe Wassmer (11 years old) came to spend the weekend in the chalet at Champ du Feu. It was 7 pm, the occupants had finished dinner and were going out to the terrace to admire the sunset. The sky was very clear, without any clouds. Suddenly, a row of 7 or 8 well-aligned and equidistant objects appeared in the west-northwest, at a distance of about 2 km. Each object consisted of a dark part surrounded by a halo like a smoke ring. The objects seemed to be a few tens of meters above the woods and, since the terrain sloped in the direction of observation, their altitude was roughly the same as that of the witnesses (1000 m). In the minutes that followed their appearance, the objects slowly glided south towards the hamlet of Bellefosse. Suddenly they disappeared in place, then reappeared a little further south, dispersed and simultaneously ceased to be visible. To the west, where the objects had disappeared, the forest was all red as if on fire, although the sun had already set. Dozens of red spots were gently oscillating above the forest. Observed through binoculars, the trembling spots had shapes that evoked tomatoes or boxing gloves. It was past 8 pm, night was falling. The red spots also disappeared. Shortly after 9 pm, the four witnesses saw an enormous black object - or appearing black - in the shape of a lens with a diameter of 15 to 20 m, coming from the south, about a hundred meters from the chalet. In total silence, the saucer slowly approached the chalet. It was horizontal and a little higher than the witnesses, who could barely distinguish the underside. The saucer was now only 20 or 30 m from the chalet. Suddenly, a white-yellowish luminous ribbon appeared under the object. It seemed to end with a bulge and was animated by a movement that evoked a snake for Mr. Schirrmann and an octopus tentacle for Jean-Luc. After about ten seconds, the snake disappeared or went out. Mrs. Schirrmann left the terrace to go to the south-west facing kitchen, turned on the light and opened the window with the intention of closing the shutters, perhaps pushed by an instinctive desire to put something between the object and the witnesses. Yet, neither she nor her husband or the children were seized by panic. Suddenly, a luminous rod shot out from under the saucer, Mrs. Schirrmann screamed and called her husband, who joined her at the kitchen window, followed by the children. The saucer was there, motionless, a few meters from the chalet and at the height of the roof. A shiver ran through the Strasbourgers when a click or a slight sound was heard. Two luminous rods had joined the first. They were parallel to it, but while the first was whitish blue, the other two were greenish purple. Their sections were also different: the first rod was as thick as the thumb, the other two were finer like the little finger. These rods ended about 1 m from the ground. All three seemed to be in a non-vertical plane and were a few tens of centimeters apart. According to Mr. Schirrmann, the ends of the rods were cut off neatly like a sausage. Another curious luminous phenomenon is to be noted: on the ground, a white luminous band follows the shape of three sides of a trapezoid. This band is as wide as the hand. The three luminous rods point towards the inside of the trapezoid, whose two non-parallel sides end at the foot of the wall of the chalet. Perhaps the luminous band extended on the wall, perhaps it closed on itself? The witnesses did not lean out to observe the wall. The observation of these luminous phenomena lasted only about ten or fifteen seconds and everything disappeared or went out suddenly, with a sharp click. Mr. Schirrmann said: "I don't like this, let's go in!" and closed the window, then, driven by curiosity, returned to the terrace. The object slowly glided north, away from the house. The witnesses could then distinguish on its upper face, a greenish luminous cone. Suddenly, the object disappeared in place, still without any sound, while it was about a hundred meters from the chalet. It was a little after 10 pm, the witnesses went to bed. (..)

At around 8:30 PM, Armand Chauvot was in the train coming from Paris. Through the left window he was looking at the scenery, to the right the sun was setting. At km 28, 150 m from the tracks, an object in the shape of a pyramid seemed to be resting on the path: the witness thought of jumping off the train to go and take a look, but he decided against it. The object was 1.5 m tall, the face turned towards the train was glowing red like resistors and crossed two thirds of the way up by a horizontal white line, glowing like a fluorescent tube. The posterior faces of the object were glowing with a pink luminescence, like opalescence. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 274)

Michael Campeadore, a 25-year-old hospital employee, was driving towards Salt Lake City when he heard a noise like that of a truck, but he saw nothing. Then a yellow light became visible to his left and, thinking it was an airplane about to crash, he got out of his car. He saw the light stop 30 m away from him and 30 m in altitude. It had the shape of an upturned bowl with a dome on top and seemed metallic. The witness was scared and emptied his 25 caliber Beretta towards the craft. He heard the bullets hit the metal, and the object took off at full speed. When he told his story at a nearby gas station, the attendant told him that around twenty testimonies had been recently recorded. (Henry DURRANT: "The UFO File" - Laffont 1973 - p. 31)

Panic on the landing field of Colorado Springs. A UFO flew over the airfield at less than 60 meters altitude. Radars recorded its passage. Case studied by the Condon Commission (pages 310 to 316 of the "report"). Conclusions of the Condon investigators: This case certainly constitutes one of the most singular radar detections ever recorded, and no conclusion is possible. (Charles GARREAU: "Flying Saucers: 20 Years of Investigations" - Mame 1971 - p. 58) (...) nothing appeared to the direct view, while the screens denounced the rapid movement of a voluminous object. The operators were too trained to confuse an echo with a real object. The flight characteristics could be those of an F 100 or an F 104. From the airport tower, the flight controllers were still trying to see the mysterious object when a Braniff airline plane landed. Almost instantly, the mysterious object still invisible to the naked eye came to the right. Now, according to the radar, it was flying over the field at less than seventy meters. This is a normal procedure for an approach without an actual landing. The craft passed about 2500 meters from the tower, still invisible, even with binoculars.

At 12:15, Steve Michalak (deceased at the end of 2000), of Polish origin, aged 52, a mechanic and prospector, saw two glowing objects flying at high speed. One of them blew away the vegetation when it landed, surrounded by incandescence. Steve observed it for 30 minutes before a door opened, revealing a violet inner light. He also noted a shrill sound and a smell like that of an overloaded electrical circuit. Approaching, the witness heard voices. When he touched the craft his rubber glove burned. He was blown away by the hot air when the object began to spin. The witness felt dizzy, suffered minor burns on his face, second and third degree burns on his chest, had frequent vomiting for four days and lost more than 10 kg. Diameter of the craft: 11 m, height 3 m, with a superstructure of 1 m. (Henry DURRANT: "The UFO File" - Laffont 1973 - pp. 73-74) Stephen Michalak approaches a 10 m diameter disc that has just landed nearby while a second UFO disappears into the sky. The craft buzzes, emits a bright light and seems to cool down. Michalak takes a look inside and touches the wall of the object, but his glove is burned. A hot breath ignites his clothes and makes him spin, then the craft takes off and disappears in a few moments.

It was 2:30 a.m. when Carmen Cuneo, a miner, stepped out of one of the Domtar Quarrys barracks for some fresh air. Caledonia is located between Lakes Ontario and Erie. As he stepped out, he was surprised by what he saw: an object shaped like a cigar, about twelve meters long, close to the ground, and a circular object about 5 m in diameter hovering above him. Not sure of what he was seeing, he noticed four windows along the side of the cigar. He was even more amazed when he saw three small figures wearing bubble-shaped helmets with an amber light on top, picking up things from the ground. Not believing his eyes, Cuneo stayed there looking for about ten minutes before entering the barracks and waking up other workers. They came out just in time to see the two objects rise from the ground. However, they were still surprised as the objects hovered above the square between the barracks for another 20 minutes before heading southwest, flashing lights of all colors but without making a sound. At the landing site, a kind of oily substance was mixed with the soil. Samples were analyzed and the result was that the oil was a common lubricating oil...

At 3 o'clock in the morning, Miss de Ribas was suddenly awakened by an intense light coming from the patio. She distinguished at the window two small silhouettes that seemed to be talking to each other. They had a big head and huge eyes. In a state of extreme agitation, the young girl tried to turn on the light, but nothing happened, as if the electricity had been cut off. She changed rooms to get a coat, as she intended to flee, but when she returned, she saw nothing. She went out and noticed that there were two footprints of small feet in front of the window.

BRAZIL, Serra de Mantiqueira
Geraldo Baqueiro, 45 years old, a driver, aboard his car climbing painfully at 40 km/h to the top of the Serra de Mantiqueira, saw at 01:30 a blinking red light coming towards him. As it approached, the vehicle advanced less and less and the engine responded in intensity to the pulsations of the light. There were some misfires and then everything stopped: engine, headlights, radio. The thing stayed at 10 or 15 m high and at about thirty meters it became increasingly red and finally a disc-shaped object emerged and the light became neon white. In the lower part a square dome, and a kind of windshield 2 m long on this disc making about 5 m in diameter and 3 m high. It remained suspended silently and the white light emitted came from inside the object. At the height of the windshield an humanoid appeared, followed by 4 others: he only saw their faces: like cats! They made no sign, only looked at the car for a short time. With a violent gust of wind and a deafening whistle the UFO left from where it came. As soon as it was away, everything worked again in the car. Total duration of the observation: 5 minutes (Inforespace n° 39, p. 34, 35)

NETHERLANDS, Oosterschelde (arm of the sea)
Industrialist Stefan Danaerde is at anchor on the Oosterschelde with his sailboat. His son tells him that the radar is defective. As the evening promises to be calm, Danaerde is not really worried. In the evening he starts the engine and sets sail for the Burgsluis lock.
Then a kind of blue sun appears in the sky emitting a shrill noise. On the water floats like a dead man and Danaerde jumps into the sea to bring back the dead. That's when the "sun" presents itself as a fairly flat metal saucer and a staircase descends to the water, while a dark silhouette is outlined.
Danaerde is sucked towards the saucer and panics. He finds himself in the presence of beings 1.40 m tall, dressed in astronaut costumes with multiple ornaments. They have a very high forehead, pointed ears and speak with a mechanical voice in English. "Can understand you us?" - "Yes, I do." They thank Danaerde for having come to the aid of one of their own who had fallen into the sea and say they are from another planet but have been on Earth for a long time. Danaerde then receives, as a sign of recognition, a metal piece. Through the computer and television (note from vog: in 67? On board a sailboat?) he is taught all kinds of things about the planet Jarga, which would be 10 light years from Earth. People there live in cylinders, as the planet is overpopulated. They practice a kind of absolute communism and private property does not exist there. There is no money either. Their only goal is "omni spiritual creativity". (etc...)

On this evening two motorists saw near Mar del Plata, a flying cigar resting on the ground. The device, which was about 400 m from the road, resembled a passenger train car. After taking off it quickly gained altitude and disappeared. The two witnesses stated that a bright light passed through its rectangular portholes.

A group of young children had gone for a walk in the pastures at the foot of the woods, when the youngest girl of 6 years old exclaimed "I saw three black Chinese people". The small group saw nothing but ran towards the village. The little girl said that they were small and that they spoke to each other in a kind of music: ra, ra, lé, tré, la. It was then 3 o'clock in the afternoon. A 15 year old girl then went to the site, but saw nothing. She returned around 4 o'clock accompanied by several other young people. Sitting on a rock about ten meters from a dirt road that serves the pasture: the terrain is rugged. Suddenly they saw a small black being running on the flat part: it was about 1.10m tall and completely black. It had a head that was roughly normal for its size, but it shone: was it covered with something? Except for the belly, which was big, the rest seemed proportionate. It passed 25m from the witnesses at 4pm in the middle of summer, so they saw it well. It ran like a man and disappeared into the hedge. It was wearing some kind of black tights. They rushed after it, but in vain. The next day people found a circle of 4m where the grass was burned: a particular smell emanated from it, not comparable to the smell of burned grass. The circle was more burned in the center than on the edges. In the northeast were traces of small feet. (L.D.L.N. "Mysterious Flying Saucers" - ALBATROS-ETAPES 1973 - pp. 122 to 127)

The Reverend Anthony Polo was awoken by a noise similar to that of a science-fiction television background music. He had the impression that he was being told to come down. Which he did. Outside he saw a figure in bright clothing. He went out. The noise started again and he received the message that he had nothing to fear, that no harm would be done to him and he would do none. He approached and another message came to him: "Danger. I must go." He saw a kind of light in the sky and when he looked down again the entity had disappeared. (vog: Was the Reverend really awoken or was he dreaming? (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - coll. J'AI LU, p. 216)

Around 11:30 a.m. an object was located about 5° above the roof of the school. It remained motionless and the object, similar to aluminum in the shape of a cigar, with pointed ends and without wings. When it suddenly started moving again, a faint light lit up at the back and in twenty seconds the object was hidden by the houses.

A family was travelling in a caravan towards California. At a petrol station they saw a round flying object, it looked like a child's bonnet and the thing was surrounded by a bright ring with multicolored lights. Underneath was a kind of searchlight that swept the ground. The beam stopped on the caravan and the object quickly flew over it. Then it disappeared as it had come. The next day, after having driven a long way, the family was surprised to find the same flying device which this time came as close as 25 meters to the caravan. Taken by fear, the mother of the family fainted. When the craft finally moved away, the witnesses had another big surprise. Inside the caravan, a carrot placed on the table had grown roots so quickly that they almost touched the ground... (Jean-Marie DOUCHET - Nostra - 10.7.1979)

At 7 pm the farmer saw an object flying in the sky at very high speed and projecting beams of yellow, red and green light. Meanwhile, his two daughters, who were keeping the flock, saw with understandable fear two humanoids standing on a wall 30 meters away from them. They had big heads. Their arms and legs reflected the light of the sun. They were small, less than one meter tall. They jumped off the wall (50 cm high) with both feet and disappeared. When the girls told their father about this adventure, they went to the wall to look for traces, but there was nothing.

BRAZIL, in the vicinity of Rio
Jonil Feydt Vieira, lawyer, and the driver of the jeep Amauri Barboso
were inconvenienced by a dazzling UFO standing in front of them on the
road they were following, then were pursued by this thing. They had
the opportunity to see that there was a large dome, with a blue light
at one end and a yellow light at the other. The object made no noise.
The dome was rotating. The pursuit lasted from 8 pm to 8:40 pm. The
driver experienced a great pain in his forehead between the two eyes,
which lasted for 16 days after the observation and the lawyer had a
yellow complexion and had a feeling of lightness. It seemed to the two
witnesses that they had received some kind of mental message about
the possible life on other planets. (Inforespace n° 47 of 1979, pp. 15-17)

Ignaço da Souza, an agricultural worker, fired at the normal-sized humanoids with his Winchester 44. He was instantly paralyzed by a green beam coming from the UFO that had landed nearby, fell to the ground, became ill and died some time later from leukemia. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 66,67)
Returning home around 4:00 PM, Ignaço and Maria da Souza noticed a strange object shaped like a bowl with its opening facing downwards, on the landing strip of the property. This device had a diameter of 35 m. Between it and the house were three unknowns, of human appearance, except that they were bald. They were playing and frolicking like children, but in silence. When they saw Ignaço they pointed at him and started running towards him. He made his wife go back into the house, and she ran there. As he had his rifle with him, he shot at the closest one, at which point a green light came out of the device and hit him in the chest and he fell to the ground. His wife ran up, but by then the men had already gone back into their craft which rose vertically at great speed, making a sound like that of bees. (...) Ignaço da Souza fell ill, his condition only worsened, his whole body was covered in yellow-white spots, he suffered horrible pains, and died on October 11, 1967.

François Delpeuch, 13 years old, and his sister Anne-Marie, 9 years old, on school holidays, went with their dog Médor to drive about ten cows into the pasture of the place called "les Tuiles". At one point, the cows wanted to cross a wall separating a neighboring pasture where there were about thirty cows. François got up to call the dog to divert the animals from their purpose. He then saw, on the other side of the D. 57, about sixty meters away, what he took to be four children he did not recognize. He called his sister and, already happy for a possible diversion, she called out: "Are you coming to play with us?" The strangers did not answer. Behind them, half hidden by the fence, François and Anne-Marie saw a shining object, 2 to 2.50 m in diameter, painful to look at because of the bright light. They did not see any openings in it. Two of the strangers were standing to the left of the object and looking at each other, the third had his back to them, it seemed he was kneeling and scratching the ground. The fourth was standing and looking in the direction of the children. He was holding a rectangular object "a mirror" 20 x 30 cm with two faces. Its brilliance blinded the children. The children quickly realized they were dealing with what they called "little black men". They were long and thin in proportion, with an elongated head, arms proportionally longer than a man's, thin and short legs. A bulge near their ears gave them a kind of fluffy beard. Black hair and a beard covered their neck and chin. They were dressed in a tight, shiny black suit "like a mechanic" François said. They were all the same size, those on the left a bit smaller (1 m) than those on the right. The hands were not described. François climbed onto a small wall to get a better view. Seeming to have become aware of this presence, the beings returned to the object. First the two on the left, then the one who was kneeling, and finally the one with the mirror. They propelled themselves upwards, arms glued to their bodies, and entered through the top, head first, plunging into the upper part of the sphere. The fourth seemed to have forgotten something on the ground, he went back and then went up to catch up with the sphere which, having taken off in a spiral, was already higher than the trees. During this ascent, other details were noticed. The feet were of a special shape "webbed feet like ducks". Anne-Marie mentioned the pointed nose. After the latecomer's return, the object described a few more spirals, then a soft whistle was heard, the sound of the breath was perceived, the object became dazzling, blinding: "my eyes hurt, I was crying .." and the sphere disappeared straight into the sky, towards the northwest. The dog was barking, the cows were mooing, those from the neighbor had left their pasture and had joined François's herd, mooing, there was a smell of sulfur in the air. François took care of the cows and they returned home crying, bringing the herd back. (L.D.L.N. "Mysterious Flying Saucers" - ALBATROS-ETAPES 1973 - pp. 127 to 132)

Mrs. Lewis Berle's and her brother Harry King's horse, Snippy, had disappeared from the King ranch. It was found on the 15th, its head and neck stripped of flesh, the skin pulled back to bare the skull, and its vital organs removed. Near the carcass was a flattened chico bush, and there were 6 identical holes, 2 inches wide and 4 inches deep, in the ground. A quarter of a mile from where the corpse was found, an elderly woman had seen a large object pass almost at rooftop level on the day of the disappearance. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of the E.T.

Strange creatures are observed in the glow of an elliptical shaped light. They are observed near a barn, and howl, like the wind, when they are caught in the beams of headlights. The silhouettes, run on human legs, towards the object which fades away.
Around 9pm, two young girls at the window of the upper floor, see a large light come above a large tree, at some distance. The light appeared as big as a Volkswagen. At a few hundred meters distance, it was white and became red, dancing up and down. Alone at home, the young girls were scared. Then they heard noises in the barn a few meters from the house. It was like a coffee grinder that someone was trying to start. Looking in that direction, they saw three dark creatures, about one and a half meters tall, at some distance, standing near the mailbox. On the hill the glowing ball still shone. It was at this moment that a car arrived. The creatures started to run towards the bushes and the light on the hill went out."

I was on the ferry-boat Tulcea - Sfintul-Gheorghe, on the starboard bridge, it was 8:30 pm. A light rain was falling from the uniformly cloudy sky and it was very dark. At 8:45 pm the clouds changed color, very high above me and became luminous with a red fringe all around. Suddenly, without any noise, a luminous object appeared, shaped like a frying pan with its tail. It was going west. It stopped abruptly at 500 or 600 m from the boat and at perhaps 200 or 300 m in height. It was swaying, a bit like the flame of a candle. The disc seemed to be 5 to 6 m in diameter, as well as the tail whose base was half the size of the disc and which was getting thinner and thinner towards the end. The disc was a dark red, more precisely a garnet. At its periphery and the elongated part of the tail it had the color of methane when it burns. Globular sparks were ejected from the tail but they disappeared as soon as they came out. I was stunned, if not scared. After staying there for about four minutes, the object slowly pivoted around an axis without making any noise, then returned to its initial position. It then resumed its advance on my left parallel to the surface of the water pointing its tail towards the west. Then it stopped again after covering 200 to 300 m. Finally it disappeared into the clouds, still without a sound and without having made any lateral maneuver. The object had described a total U-shaped trajectory. I then looked at my watch again: it was 8:52 pm (Valeriu Bita) (Ion HOBANA/Julien WEVERBERGH: "Les OVNI en URSS et dans les pays de l'Est" - trad. Laffont 1976 - p. 305)

Carlos Peccinetti and Fernando Jose Villegas, employees at the casino, had finished work and were in a car on their way home. Arriving at the deserted stretch of Calle Neuquen, they saw a strange machine hovering above a vacant lot, less than a meter from the ground. It was a saucer. At the same time, the car lights went out and a powerful spotlight lit up the strange craft. Before they could realize what was happening, three dwarves with big heads were sliding towards the motorists, who were completely paralyzed, while they saw other dwarves near the UFO. Suddenly feeling extremely tired, they both lost consciousness. Upon waking up, they noticed puncture marks on the tips of their fingers and they had also received a telepathic explanation (...)

In the night, between 1:30 and 2 o'clock two men were hunting. One of them was sitting under an apple tree at the edge of the forest and the other was about to sit down too: they were waiting for a third companion. Then they saw a light like a burning car, yet everything was silent. Without speaking they advanced towards the phenomenon, guns armed. An object was there 20 cm from the ground, beautiful like a meadow mushroom (Coulemelle or rosé des prés), it looked like a fluorescent tube with a red rectangle in the center like the morning sun. The white part of the "mushroom" was 7 to 8 m long and 2.20m to 2.50m high of a bright white. They arrived at 25 m from the thing and suddenly they were both stopped dead, as if paralyzed. The white part of the mushroom dilated and came towards them like a rolling cloud. (...) Serious physiological and psychological effects on the two witnesses. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 289, 290) Two hunters were patrolling an immense field of freshly mechanized wheat. Suddenly they saw at a distance of 150 to 200 m a "car on fire". (...) It was at this moment that the object dilated in a kind of mist that rushed towards the witnesses, the red rectangle remaining perfectly clear and in the middle of this cloud. The two hunters had different reactions at this moment. The first, in a painful effort, turned around and waited for it to pass, while the second, in a reflex of fear, shouldered his gun towards the phenomenon. But he could not fire... After a few seconds, the first, who had felt nothing, straightened up and found his companion frozen in the previous position, dazed, unable to make a gesture or pronounce a correct sentence. He had felt a feeling of heat when the phenomenon passed over his head (at 2 m) and he had instantly dreamed that he was levitating holding his dead son in his arms.

(cf: November 29, 1966) There were two other Soviet satellites with identical characteristics: Cosmos 185 launched into orbit in October 1967 and Cosmos 316, later in December 1969. Only Cosmos 185, among the four, had a relatively high inclination (64°) and performed maneuvers. It re-entered the atmosphere 15 months later. Such a short life span is surprisingly short for a satellite (...) The rapid fall of Cosmos 185 could thus lead to the idea that it was hollow.

#1967, October 4
CANADA off Shag Harbour (Nova Scotia)
The Royal Canadian Air Force confirms the appearance of a brightly lit UFO, seeming to glide over the waters off Shag Harbour. Many coastal inhabitants had seen it. Then, a bubbling of water had occurred, accompanied by yellowish foam. The Canadian Navy had sent some small vessels to the scene; but the UFO had apparently eluded them. (Donald KEYHOE: "The Space Strangers" - Pocket Press 1975 - p. 158) Yvan T.SANDERSON dates this event October 4, 1967. The affair was reported in detail by the Light Herald of Yarmouth, N.S.: The object was first seen at 11:30 pm on Wednesday night, in the Shag Harbour area, Shelburne County, near Bon Portage Island. David Kendricks, who was driving a car with a friend, Norman Smith, in the area between Cape Sable Island and Shag Harbour, saw a bright red-orange light in the sky above Bear Point. According to him, the lights were tiny and seemed lined up in a row, and at one point they blinked. These lights formed an angle of 45°, plunging to the right, advancing in order from bottom to top. Approximately at the same time, Laurie Wiggins, nineteen years old, observed the object as he drove in a car with four other people in Woods Harbour. According to him, there were four lights in a row that went out and lit up in turn and leaned at an angle of 45°. They slowly disappeared into the water. As they got out of the car, they saw the lights change to become a single white light that swayed on the water about 800 meters offshore. Wiggins then called the R.C.M.P. (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) of Wood's Harbour who arrived at the scene after 20 minutes. Constable Ron O'Brien of the Barrington detachment of the R.C.M.P. and two other officers saw the light floating on the water about 800 m from the coast and reported that it was being carried out to sea by the tide and that it disappeared before they could reach it by boat. Meanwhile, a large number of other witnesses reported lights at the same time and in the same area. The R.C.M.P. immediately called the Canadian Coast Guard station in Clark's Harbour and Rescue Boat No. 101 plus eight local fishing boats began to search the area. After an hour, the boats had arrived at the place where the object had disappeared and reported a very large area of bubbling water and foam. According to one of the fishermen, the foam was 25 meters wide and it was yellowish; he said he had never seen anything like it in the area. Seven divers from the navy searched for two and a half days but found nothing and these searches were abandoned. The possibility that it could have been an airplane was ruled out by the Canadian authorities; no aircraft was reported missing. (Yvan T.

Othmar Willi observed three cylindrical objects with portholes while they hovered about 5 m above a cornfield. Each craft had a small cone and made a sound like that of a swarm of bees. Their dimensions were estimated to be 10 meters in length and 5 meters in diameter. (Jean-Marie DOUCHET - Nostra - 144 of 1979) They were turning slowly and the witness saw two rows of windows in the upper part of the craft. A very particular light was coming out of these small windows. The cylinders emitted a sound like the buzzing of a swarm of bees. Suddenly a hatch opened under one of the craft and a kind of rope appeared at the end of which was suspended an ovoid shape. A container? This stopped at the level of the corn ears, and only the container was illuminated by a light. Then the container was raised. All this lasted about a minute. The three cylinders suddenly started and left at a crazy speed.

(…) on the morning of October 20th (…) he saw a huge being partly hidden by a large fallen tree trunk due to the flooding of the stream on the edge of which it was drinking. Patterson's horse began to tremble all over, refused to go any further, snorted and finally fell on its side. "The creature was on my left, about 40 meters away on the other side of the stream. It had an almost human face but the features were much more fleeting, the forehead wide, the nostrils flared. When it walked, the ends of its arms reached almost to its knees. Its body, except for the face, was covered with brown hair between 5 and 10 cm long and appearing lighter on the surface than at the root. (…) pendulous breasts.

ENGLAND, Avon - Shopley (Hampshire)
Between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, Carl Farlow was driving a truck loaded with stoves on the part of the A 338 road connecting the villages of Sopley and Avon. He was approaching the intersection near a bridge crossing the Avon River, when the headlights of his van went out. His diesel engine continued to run and assuming a simple short circuit, he stopped to look for the cause of this sudden malfunction. Before he had time to get out of the cab, he was surprised to see a curious ovoid object moving from right to left across the road in front of him, about 7.50m from the ground. It was magenta in color with a white base and was about 24 meters long, large enough to overshadow both sides of the road as it crossed it, exhaling a smell like "a drill bit attacking wood" and making a sound like "that of a refrigerator". As it crossed the road, the craft gradually accelerated, and after a few seconds it disappeared completely from Farlow's field of vision. Farlow then realized that a Jaguar that had come from the opposite direction was broken down on the other side of the UFO's trajectory. Its driver, a veterinarian, approached Farlow and explained that his vehicle was out of service and that his passenger was in a state of hysteria. He then offered to call the police, which they did. The police joined them shortly afterwards. A preliminary inspection of the site revealed that the surface of the road seemed to have melted. The veterinarian's passenger, in shock, was taken to the hospital. ("UFO Files", ed. Marshall Cavendish, Paris 1998, Special Issue, p. 30, 31)

At 9pm, a group of rugby players training received the visit of a large lens surrounded by blue, which came to frolic above the sports field. It stopped on the ground or very close to the ground and in a strong emission of light returned to its initial orbit. The UFO produced a sound not comparable to that of an engine. (J.G.

ROMANIA, unspecified
Around midnight, while taking the air in his garden (note from vog: in December? what a heat my ancestors!) a Romanian was witness to the passage of a shining object that was moving at an extraordinary speed. The device in question had the shape of a cylinder and its luminosity resembled that of the sun when it is reflected by a window. (Jean-Marie DOUCHET - Nostra - 6.11.1979)

USA, Ashland (Nebraska)
At 8:30 PM (or 2:30 AM) police officer Herbert Schirmer, patrolling at night in his car, encountered a UFO which paralyzed him with a beam and he had a "conversation" with one of the occupants of the craft. (He saw an object with a row of blinking lights. Thinking it was a truck, the policeman "put on his headlights". The object took off (...) He returned home with a strong headache and heard a buzzing that prevented him from sleeping. He also had a red spot under his left ear) In Boulder (Colorado) he was put into a hypnotic state in order to be questioned about his encounter. It was Dr. Leo Sprinkle, a psychologist at the University of Wyoming, who conducted the hypnosis and the interrogation.

A teenage girl looking out the window of her bedroom, saw a furry creature with extremely long arms and legs, standing in the yard of the house. It was very dark but the young girl could clearly distinguish the silhouette of the being in question, swaying in the yard. (Jean FERGUSON: "The Humanoids..." - ed. Leméac, Ottawa 1977, p.169)

The voices seemed to come from a loudspeaker saying in unison the same thing, in an English that seemed translated as the words were chopped. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 186) A lady who wishes to remain anonymous had her car stopped by a flying saucer. She was driving towards her house at 7:15 pm with her 5-year-old son in the back seat. Suddenly she saw flashes of light through the windshield. She thought it was a police check. But then she saw an unusual object passing over her car. There were red and green lights, and the object was oval-shaped. The engine slowed down, all the electricity went out, so she stopped barely 40 meters from the first contact. The aerial object remained suspended above the car. Although the radio was not turned on, she heard like a choir, like a group saying the same thing at the same time, in the same tone but in a foreign language. A single voice seemed to speak in English telling her not to be afraid. Then the flying object started to move, and the car too, while the witness was not driving it, over a distance of two miles. When other cars appeared on the road, the UFO left and the witness finally regained normal control of her vehicle. (APRG, on the Internet in May 1997)

ARGENTINA, Catamarca
At around 4 in the morning, Jorge Clerici and his wife were returning to Catamarca. They were driving on a deserted road when suddenly the night was pierced by two beams of violet light, which then turned green. Mr. Clerici stopped the car and turned off the headlights. He then saw a UFO about 2 meters in diameter pass by quickly and disappear. They continued on their way. A few kilometers later, the object reappeared and began to fly over the car, only a few meters above it. Completely panicked, Mr. Clerici made a U-turn and drove back to the village of Andalgala which he had just left. The object moved away. Mr. Clerici waited until daybreak before leaving again.

PERU, Huaypo Lagoon
On a Saturday night, this merchant from Cuzco in a car towards his property in Urubamba to spend the weekend, saw around 9 pm and in a cloudy sky his car break down 50 or 60 m from the banks of the lake. He got out with his flashlight to examine the engine when a bright light illuminated the whole area and there was a very distinct sound of running water. On his right the witness then saw a disc emerge from the water, about 8 m in diameter, with a metallic shine and greenish reflections, equipped with several portholes and crowned with a rotating dome and leave at great speed passing on the other side of the road, vertically from the witness. Once the UFO was far away, the car started normally. (Inforespace n° 27 - 1976, p. 15)
