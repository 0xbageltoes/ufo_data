USA, New Mexico
(cf: 1921) One day Villa suddenly felt an impulse and felt compelled to go to the beach. There he met a man 2.10m tall. This stranger knew his name and all the things about Villa's life.
The stranger's name was Riese and he came from another planet. They went to a place where there was a saucer on the water. He got on board and saw many other people. These people were extraterrestrials and had a base on the Moon as well as another on the moon of Mars, Phobos. (continued on June 16th 63) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

#1953, January 9
USA, Santa Ana (California)
Early in the evening of the 9th, a B-29 bomber piloted by Captain George Madden was flying over California. His co-pilot, Lieutenant Frank Briggs, occupied the right seat. The night was clear and the two men could see Santa Ana some 4900 meters below them. The sky was empty of any other aircraft. Captain Madden was checking his onboard instruments when a sudden light caught Briggs' attention. Coming from the right, at a phenomenal speed, a V-shaped formation was rushing towards the bomber. The lieutenant shouted to warn his commander, who immediately veered left. For a fraction of a second, the strange objects abruptly braked, then abandoning their triangle formation, resumed their vertical ascent and disappeared. The apparition had lasted a total of five seconds. (Donald E. KEYHOE: "The UFO File" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.15)

USA, Moody, Dawson and Robin Bases
A F-86 pilot was performing a "round-Robin" flight at 9:35 PM. At an altitude of 1800 m he saw a bright light to his left and began to climb to get closer. In two or three seconds the light changed from white to red, then back to white and suddenly transformed into a perfect triangle. This triangle split into two triangles placed one above the other, then the phenomenon disappeared. Ground radar had followed the chase. (Inforespace No. 8, p. 2 - 1973 - SOBEPS) It was around 9:35 PM and the pilot thought it was a star or another aircraft. Having climbed to 3300 meters he noticed that the spot was lower than him. At that moment the strange phenomenon changed to orange before becoming bright white again, the color changes lasting a total of fifteen minutes. After that, the object changed shape; from cylindrical it became triangular before splitting into two triangles that overlapped. Finally, the whole thing suddenly disappeared, as if someone had blown out the candle. (Moustique No. 1507 of 12.12.54, p. 17, article by Bert Brem)

#1953, January 29
USA, Conway (South Carolina)
It was past one o'clock in the morning. An ex-intelligence officer of the USAF, Lloyd C. Booth, was returning to his parents' farm. He was approaching the house when he heard strange noises: the pigs penned up in their enclosure behind the barn were grunting and the horses were rearing in the stable. He told the authorities that after searching he discovered a disk hovering at low altitude above a clump of trees nearby. It was light gray in color and was radiating a luminescence as if it were lit from within. It had the shape of a half egg. Booth headed towards the object and fired several shots from his .22 long rifle. He could hear the sound of the impacts before the object disappeared from his sight. Following this incident, numerous cows and other livestock died inexplicably. (Henry DURRANT: "The UFO File" - Laffont 1973 p. 104)

At around 6:40 PM, Mmes d'Arras, Reignier and Mlle Tellier were walking back from the station on D 43. A pale blue light, surrounded by small candle flames, then an ovoid object emitting pale blue flashes, at the speed of a cyclist, approached the electric wires in a horizontal trajectory, while yellow-clear sparkles zigzagged constantly up to 2m from the witnesses and stuck to the electric wires afterwards. A loud buzzing sound was audible. (M. FIGUET/J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni: le premier rapport complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 65)

#1953, 11 March
USA, Yuma (Arizona)
Various shooting exercises were taking place on the Yuma base field. A group of about twenty officers were participating. Suddenly, to the east of the field, twelve extremely bright objects emerged at low altitude at a fantastic speed. Before the controller had recovered from his surprise, the objects were flying over the base at several thousand kilometers per hour, describing a large circle and passing again over the field at reduced speed. Then they accelerated lightning fast and disappeared while gaining altitude. They were discs of metallic appearance, moving without noise and without leaving any trails. (...)

#1953, Spring
SWITZERLAND
The machine tool factory Oerlikon, Buhrle and Co. gave birth to a DCA rocket with an nitric acid propellant. It has a length of 5 meters, a takeoff weight of 250 kg and a combustion end speed of 750 meters/second. The Oerlikon rocket takes off from a mobile launch chassis, it is guided by a director beam and can fight airplanes at altitudes of up to 20 kilometers. The tests carried out in the spring of 1953 would have gone satisfactorily. ("The Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" -Hans K. Kaiser, Amiot-Dumont 1954, p. 123, 124)

(cf. November 52) One Sunday morning, Dino Kraspedon's doorbell rang. It was an extraterrestrial! He was about 1m 80 tall. He spoke Greek and Latin, but spoke Portuguese very well and English a bit less well: he had an accent. He said he came from Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter. From 1953 to 1959, Kraspedon claimed to have regular conversations with this entity, sometimes even in public places, in the street, etc... . (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

#1953, May 16
BELGIUM, Bouffioulx (Hainaut)
At 8:15 PM many people (note from vog: this seems inaccurate, there was only one witness, the photographer in question) from the region of Bouffioulx saw a classic flying saucer pass in the sky: flat, circular, luminous. At one moment it stopped abruptly by tilting. For a few moments it stayed like this, offering the witnesses its beautiful bright round face: almost unique in the whole history of saucers, a detonation accompanied its maneuver, followed by a kind of prolonged vibration similar to that of a sheet of metal that is shaken. (...) ("Lueurs sur les Soucoupes Volantes", Aimé Michel, ed. Maison MAME, 1954, p. 202) Hermann Chermanne, photographer (of the newspaper "Le Peuple"), took two striking shots of a strange phenomenon. Reproduced by the Belgian daily "Le Peuple" of May 28, 1953.<br/><br/>
That evening around 8:15 PM, Hermann Chermanne was joining his home when he suddenly had his attention drawn by an unusual noise that strangely resembled the prolonged vibrations of a sheet of metal. Raising his eyes he saw a long white trail that was left behind by a mysterious object flying at great speed and heading towards the working-class city of the Blanche Borne district. Our reporter had time to trigger his camera once before the object, which had stopped in the sky, turned to then present, it seems, a resplendent sphere surrounded by a whitish halo and satellites that seemed to go in all directions. This phenomenon lasted about ten seconds, then the disc got back in the field before completely disappearing. In the sky the long white trail disintegrated under the effect of the wind. In the region of Bouffioulx and even beyond, many were those who perceived, at the precise moment of the appearance of the phenomenon, a deep and violent explosion. (Henry DURRANT: "Le dossier des OVNI" - Laffont 1973 p. 149- 175-176) Hermann Chermanne was photographing a picturesque site near Bouffioulx 7 km southeast of Charleroi in Belgium, when an astonishing roar "like the sound of a sheet of metal being shaken" made him turn. He then saw in the sky a "shining object, surrounded by a whitish halo, from which white particles were falling". (Yves NAUD: "Les E.T. et les OVNI dans l'histoire" Famot 1977, volume 4, p. 199) Around 5:30 PM he stopped to rest. As he prepared to photograph a flock of sheep... Etc..

Two miners, John Q. Black and John Van Allen reported that an object with a tripod landing gear had landed on a sand strip around 6:30 PM. A dwarf with wide shoulders filled a shiny bucket with water, carried it into the craft and, seeming to notice Black, jumped into the craft which took off emitting a whistle. A second being was inside the craft, who took the bucket that was handed to him. (Continued on June 20, 1953) (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed.

USA, Tujunga (Los Angeles)
Sara Shaw and Jan Whitley were living in an isolated cabin. They were sleeping when a blue beam woke them up at 2:20 AM. At the same time, an eerie silence descended. Jan got out of bed intending to get dressed to go outside and see what was happening, but she felt paralyzed, unable to think and having difficulty breathing. Sara shouted: "Jan, why are you standing there without moving?" But she saw that she herself had one foot on the ground and was sitting, while her last memory was that she had stayed in bed. She looked at the clock and couldn't believe her eyes: 4:20 AM! She too had difficulty breathing. She panicked and thought there was a problem with the butane. They both ran to the kitchen, but everything was in order. They went outside. No suspicious smell, but Jan could make out a whitish, vaporous figure with long, flowing hair. This didn't even intrigue her and she went back inside to take care of the dogs and cats. Years later, under hypnosis Sara had memories of being abducted on board a UFO and of a medical visit. Jan, on the other hand, got no such results under hypnosis. (Marie-Thérèse de BROSSES: "Enquête sur les enlèvements E.T." - Plon 1995, p. 248, 249)

USA, Burban (California)
Orféo Angelucci, in a car, around midnight, was at the level of Forest Lawn Drive when he noticed a red light on the hood of the car. He stopped on the side of the road and saw a red disc in the sky. At that moment, two green lights left the disc and placed themselves 5 meters away from him. The red object moved away and remained visible from a great distance. It was then that Orféo heard a voice, which first advised him to stay calm and that no harm would come to him. It also declared that it was necessary to gradually prepare the inhabitants of the Earth for the visit of inhabitants of other worlds. It said in particular that "daily the Earth is observed by a great number of flying saucers, from a few decimeters to several hundreds of meters (...) and that there are innumerable worlds which all possess a different degree of evolution which already visit the Earth." Orféo claimed that the voice spoke to him for 3/4 of an hour before the green lights returned to the red disc. (Pierre DELVAL: "Contacts of the 4th Type" - De Vecchi 1979, p. 98, 99)

#1953 (or 1954) May,
FRANCE, Cagnes sur Mer
Mr. P. Cavallo, a projectionist, was returning from work around 0:30am along the deserted Avenue Ziem, lined with hedges and bushes on either side. He took the opportunity to collect snails that were out in the night dew. He was suddenly surprised by the appearance in the sky of a bright orange cigar-shaped object, with blue sparkles inside, flying at low altitude from south to north in a time span of between 20 and 30 seconds, leaving behind an orange tail of sparks. All this in complete silence.
Stunned, the witness stayed in place for about forty seconds. It was then that he felt a presence to his right and, turning his head, he saw a face that seemed human, although very strange. Its expression was like a "beatific smile". It had a pale complexion, a bald head, and blue eyes. He could not make out the body hidden in the bushes. With his bicycle in hand, the witness stared at it for a few seconds, wondering who it was - "maybe a madman?" - and what attitude to take. However, fear quickly overcame Mr. Cavallo, who, without further ado, jumped on his bicycle and sped down the descent of Avenue Ziem. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed.

(cf: May 20, 1953, same location) At exactly 6:30 pm, second landing of the saucer at 50 m from the witnesses, and repetition of the same scenario. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 177) At the second encounter, in the same mining concession, both of them had gone calmly to tell the police that they had seen a little man dressed in a kind of parka coming down from a silver craft resting on the ground on a tripod. The astonished miners had seen the dwarf take water from a bucket. But, seeing himself observed, said dwarf had quickly returned to his craft which had immediately left with a roar.

SPAIN, Villares del Saz (Cuenca)
Observation at around 2 pm. Three small men came out of a hatch in the upper part of the UFO, approached the witness, and spoke to him. One of them gave the child a light tap on the cheek and then went back into the object, which flew away at great speed. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations of ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - pp. 175 and 179) A 14-year-old illiterate cowherd, Maximo Munoz Hernaiz, was sitting near the cows when he heard a faint whistling sound at around 1 pm, but he didn't turn around. When he did, the machine had already landed. It was about 1.3 m tall and about 30 cm wide. Thinking it was a balloon, he went to take it, but a door opened and small guys started coming out. They were tiny (65 cm) with yellow faces and narrow eyes. The "thing" had a door at its top and the small guys jumped out. There were three of them, who surrounded him, and they spoke but Maximo didn't understand. The little guy who was in front of him gave him a slap on the face and then they went back into their machine, hooked up to something, and jumped. They were dressed just like fairground musicians, in blue clothes, with a flat hat with a visor in front and they had a metal plate on their arm. The machine flew away very quickly like a rocket. - There were traces on the ground, examined by the gendarmerie - (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, pp. 93 to 97)

USA, Arizona
A flying saucer crashed in the Arizona desert and the bodies of the five occupants were immediately loaded, in special coffins, filled with carbonic ice, on board an airplane that arrived the same evening at Wright Patterson, where they were stored secretly. These humanoids, one of which was female, had large heads shaped like an inverted pear, with deep eyebrow arches joined in a kind of awning, large open eyes, holes instead of nose and ears, and skin of a grayish brown. These strange beings had long arms, with four slightly webbed fingers on the hands and no fingers on the feet. Their sexual parts were visibly atrophied, as if they had not used them for a long time.(...) One of these humanoids was still alive when the rescue team arrived, but all efforts to save him were in vain. This flying saucer, found almost intact, had been spotted by the radar of Mount Palomar as it crossed California, obviously in distress and rapidly losing altitude and the radar operators, who knew exactly where it had fallen, had immediately alerted a nearby air base which had immediately sent a rescue team.

Roman biologist, Alexandru Sift, was a 16 year old high school student in 1953. He saw a luminous ball descend from the sky and fall into a bush. When he approached the landing site, he was very surprised: nothing seemed to remain of this object several meters in diameter. Suddenly, as he began to move the branches with his stick, it became invisible, as well as part of his hand. At the same time, the sole of his shoes became hot and a cold push, acting on his whole body, forced him to withdraw. Very frightened, Sift ran back to town. (Gheorghita 1975) (A. SCHNEIDER-H.

USA, near Black Hawk (South Dakota)
At 8:05 PM an object in the shape of a ring, red in color, caused confusion in the minds of several witnesses. Eslworth's radar then targeted the object which was flying towards Rapid City, while an F-84 interceptor was sent for interception and managed to get within 3 miles. At that moment the UFO disappeared at an incredible speed, but when the pilot returned to base, the UFO was still following him! Another jet then took off which finally made the unknown object go away. ("UFO's: A Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 210) It was in 1953 that one of the most mysterious cases I have had the opportunity to study occurred. On the night of August 5, several people from Black Hawk, in South Dakota, reported that they had seen several strange objects in the sky. Unidentified echoes appeared on the radar screen of a nearby air base. An F-84 jet fighter, guided by radio, took off in their direction. Soon its pilot reported that he saw one, brighter than the brightest star, and going twice as fast as his plane. When he chased it, the glow disappeared completely. On the ground, five civilians had witnessed the pursuit. They confirmed the pilot's words. A little later, a second F-84 was sent towards the object, which continued to appear on the ground radar. This time, the pilot saw a shape, which emitted a variable luminosity. When he rushed in its direction, the indicator of his sight lit up: the on-board radar had detected the target, but immediately, the thing took altitude and flew north. The air base alerted the observation center of Bismarck, in North Dakota, 350 km away. A sergeant went up on the roof, saw the object which soon disappeared. I took care of this case myself, without being able to find an explanation. (Charles GARREAU cites Dr. Allen Hynek in "Flying Saucers: 20 Years of Investigation Mame 1971- p.52-53)

On August 6, 1953, from the top of an airplane, the existence of a mysterious space platform was discovered on one of the Hawaiian islands. None of the world powers knew of the existence of this space base. The pilot who discovered it said it was huge, bluish and metallic. The search order immediately launched yielded nothing; the base had disappeared. (S. DELLO STROLOGO: "What Governments Hide from You About Flying Saucers" - De Vecchi 1975- p. 135)

#1953, August 21
MEXICO, Ciudad Vallejo
Salvador Villanueva states that one of the two humanoids in his presence seemed to understand Spanish while the other spoke it but with a peculiar accent stringing words together without regard for tone or punctuation. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations of ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 186 which says August 20) At 6 pm, taxi driver Villanueva was under the chassis of his broken-down vehicle on the main road when he saw two pairs of legs covered with something that looked like "seamless gray velvet". Standing up, he saw two pleasant-looking men measuring 1.35 m, dressed in a one-piece garment from neck to toes. They wore wide, shiny, perforated belts, metal collars around their necks, and small, shiny black boxes on their backs. Under their arms they held "helmets like those of pilots or American football players". Their small size was not too strange in Mexico, where many Indians are very small, and he concluded that they were aviators, probably from a neighboring South American republic. (...) When it started to rain, they accepted the driver's invitation to take shelter with him in the vehicle. During the night, various remarks began to worry Villanueva and finally this statement came: "We come from a very distant world, but we know a lot about yours". At dawn he went with them to their craft, which was parked in a clearing 500 meters from the road, and noticed that although they had crossed a muddy terrain in which he sank deeply, the legs and feet of the little men remained clean: "when their feet touched puddles of mud their belts shone and the mud moved away" He was invited to board, but Villanueva spun around and ran away. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 109, 110) (...) standing up, he saw an apparition, a little man barely 1.20 m tall. He asked if he knew Mexico, but the entity gave him a description of his planet. Villanueva was invited on board, accepted, and took a trip into space, he thinks he visited the planet Venus. When he returned to the city, his appearance was so strange that the person where he was going to order the part for his taxi, thought he had smoked marijuana.

The stranger says: "My name is Solganda." The conversation is strange, as Van Tassel barely thinks of a question before Solganda already answers it. Van Tassel can take a ride in the saucer, which runs on a "crystal battery". The extraterrestrial also explains to him that humans were only animals and that it was thanks to them that they received spirit.

Their eyes shone like small flash lamps.. a bluish radiance enveloped their whole body.. I could not see their hands, covered by black gloves" (Jean-Gabriel GRESLE: OVNI, a pilot speaks, ed.

FRANCE, Vernon (Eure)
At 4 o'clock, many people living in Vernon (Eure) witnessed a quite impressive spectacle. Among the witnesses was a police officer, Mr. Henry Buch. (...) "As I was in the courtyard of my house, with my wife and my young son, our attention was drawn to the roar of a jet plane flying over the town. Having spotted it, we were astonished to see an object - coming from a higher altitude - flying at a dizzying speed towards the ground after crossing the route taken by the plane. To our great amazement, the object stopped its course and remained suspended in the air. After a few seconds of immobility, it took off again, describing circles above the town. This maneuver was repeated several times; it was then that, following the different phases of its evolution, we could discover the presence of three other craft, which were also moving at a staggering speed, to the four cardinal points of the locality. "These three saucers were at a much higher altitude than the first one. Their luminosity was so intense that we soon had to put on sunglasses to follow their march in the sky. As we asked our landlord to come and witness the phenomenon, my wife spotted a group of "saucers", six in number, completely motionless at an approximate height of 5 to 6,000 meters. The strange evolutions lasted about ten minutes and then, suddenly, there was no trace of "saucer" in the absolutely clear sky. (...)

A woman saw at 9:30 PM, two objects on the ground and three small men of 150 cm in height with an enormous head, wearing a helmet and boots. They ran in the direction of the devices. One entered the elongated object of 5 m in length by 1.5 m wide which extended wings like a butterfly. It put itself in a vertical position, resting on a tripod and took off, as well as the spherical object where the two other creatures had taken place. Traces were found at the location of the observation. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - coll. J'AI LU - p. 256, 257) The witness takes the air on the terrace which dominates the city. When standing up to return to her hotel she sees, near a chapel, two objects, one round, the other elongated. Then three small characters of about 1m50 appear, wearing helmets and boots, running as if they did not touch the ground. Two enter the sphere, the other in the elongated object inside which the witness sees 2 or 3 other beings through a transparent opening. The sphere has about 3 m in diameter and seems to be lit from below. At mid-height it is surrounded by a flat annular part which starts to turn very quickly while becoming luminous. The elongated object measures 4 to 5 m in length by 1.50m in height. It passes to the vertical position resting on the ground like on a tripod. Simultaneously, in a noise resembling a jet of steam, the two devices rise in a few seconds and disappear in the stars. Traces on the ground.

USA, between Philadelphia and Washington
Around midnight a D.C. 6 of American Airlines piloted by Captain J. L. Kidd had left the Philadelphia airport fifteen minutes earlier for Washington and was flying at 2400 m. There were some clouds but the moon was shining brightly. The plane was approaching the Conowingo Dam on the Susquehanna. It was the co-pilot who saw the object first: a shining thing reflecting the light of the Moon. It did not look like an airplane and did not behave like one. It had no navigation lights. At the sight of this thing, Captain Kidd reduced his speed. The thing was motionless. The D.C. 6 was quickly approaching. "Give it a spotlight!" The co-pilot already had his hand on the switch. The two landing lights soon shone their white beams on the object. A blinding white beam of light shot from the object towards the plane and Kidd realized that the thing was rushing towards him. He had no time to warn the passengers. He pushed the wheel forward. The four-engine plane dived and the passengers were thrown into the air, the dive forming a loop in reverse. At 1500 m Kidd pulled his plane out, and the passengers fell back into their seats and armrests. The pilot called National Airport and reported the accident. He was told that there were no other planes in the air and... that there would be medical personnel upon arrival. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 63, 64)

Albert K. Bender, editor of the magazine "Space Review", in his October 1953 issue mentioned that he had found the key to the mystery of flying saucers, but he could not disclose the affair, since he had been forbidden to do so. He ended his article by warning ufologists to stay vigilant. After that, Bender's magazine was no longer published. Later, in an interview, Bender claimed that three "men in black" had ordered him to stop any publication on UFOs. He would have complied, as he had a real fear of these men. Later he published a book "Flying Saucers and the Three Men in Black."

Captain Christiansson, a former RAF fighter pilot, was flying a DC 3 between Malmoe and Stockholm. Suddenly, above Halsingborg, the event occurred. (It was then 14:30 local time): "We were flying at 2,000 meters altitude," declared Captain Ulf Christiansson, "when I saw something that I initially thought to be a jet fighter. Its silhouette was very thin and it approached us at a terrifying speed. In a few seconds, it passed under my DC 3 at an altitude of about 1250 m. I immediately asked my mechanic, Olle Johansson, to observe it, and together we later compared our impressions. I had never seen anything like it. It was a perfectly symmetrical, spherical-looking object, something like a robot. Of a metallic white color, it left no apparent trail in its course above the clouds. Visibility was excellent. We were flying north with the sun on our right when the saucer cut across our route in a northeast direction. I must say that I had never believed in stories of flying saucers or other such objects until now. But I am eager to know now the result of the investigation opened by the Swedish Air Force.

At around 11 o'clock, Mrs. S. went to the grocer's, by a small sunken path. Suddenly she observed 6 to 8 orange balloons, but not luminous, which followed the path, progressing by leaps, without touching the ground. They passed very close to the witness who even thought of bringing one back for her children, but a feeling of mistrust prevented her. The night before, around 9:30 pm, she had observed a strange moon, bigger than normal, of a brilliant white and without the characteristic shadows of our satellite. (L. FIGUET/ J.L.

In 1953, a squadron of AD-35s was performing combat maneuvers when a large rocket came towards them. After a rapid deceleration, bringing it to the speed of the planes, it stabilized at about 300 m from them. The squadron commander gave orders over the radio for the planes to get to the same altitude. Instantly, the UFO tilted in such a way that its back pointed outside the attack axes of the planes. An enormous flame shot out. The craft immediately took on a considerable speed. Without this tilting movement, the powerful jet would undoubtedly have killed some, if not all of the pilots.

In 1953 I was based at R.A.F. Coltishall, in Norfolk, as a Meteor night fighter jet pilot. During one of our routine night flights, one of our crews, Captain F/OJ. Allison, and radar operator F/OI. Heavers, reported the observation of a cigar-shaped UFO, with an inner green light, visible through windows. Upon entering the flight room, they were both very excited after the landing. They claimed that the object must have been extraterrestrial due to its speed and unusual shape. The next day we learned that another night fighter jet crew from the 85th Squadron, flying near their base at R.A.F. Maidstone, in Kent (over 100 miles from Coltishall) had reported an identical incident, occurring just three minutes after that of our crew. Three minutes to cover a distance of 100 miles, that means the UFO was travelling at around 2000 m.p.h., a speed far beyond the capability of an English aircraft at that time. (...) (Gordon W.

Astonishing photo taken by the young Stephen Darbishire, on the hill where he usually went to photograph birds. He was accompanied by his 8-year-old cousin Adrian Meyer, who saw the UFO first. Stephen, stunned, took two shots without worrying about the focus of the camera. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V." Fleuve Noir 1956 - pp. 19-24) "The object shone like silver in the sun's rays. I took a photo. I had barely finished when the flying saucer rose at a dizzying speed and disappeared into the clouds. The sun's rays had strongly illuminated it and I had been able to notice that it was made of a transparent plastic material but through which I could not distinguish anything. It had three landing wheels underneath, a cabin with portholes and a dome at the top.

Cedric Allingham, a writer, amateur astronomer, and ornithologist, declared to have seen a saucer land. A man of about 1.8 meters emerged from the craft and approached Allingham. This being was described as similar to a man in all respects, except for having a very high forehead. He wore a one-piece garment, including shoes, but no helmet. He also had tiny tubes coming out of his nostrils. The witness and the man conversed through signs. Photos were taken and published of the saucer and the Martian. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974 - p. 15) He was able to take several photos. Three hours later the craft returned, quickly lost altitude, and landed on the ground 50 meters from the witness, emitting a dull noise. Allingham managed to photograph the descent. The figure that emerged from the door was slim, wearing a very tight suit, and could just as easily have been an Englishman. He was at least 1.8 meters tall, his complexion was tanned, and his hair was quite short. He had the appearance of a terrestrial. Two tiny tubes came out of his nostrils, they were face to face and smiling amicably. The stranger, through gestures and signs, made it understood that he came from Mars and not from Venus.

At 7:15 PM Mrs. Harding was called outside by her daughter, showing
something in the night sky. To the north of their position, above the
sea, an orange fireball with a black trail was zigzagging down. Its
apparent size was that of the sun, as was its brightness. The object
silently exploded, it was rather an explosion of light, but kept its
shape of an orange ball and plunged into the sea. The strangest thing
was that they saw this thing still illuminated under the water and this
for an hour after immersion. The trail changed color, it became gray
before dispersing. There was no audible sound, neither when the object
was in the air, nor when it plunged, nor when it was under the water.
Another witness saw something similar from Gwynedd. This witness
specifies that after plunging into the sea, the object rose back into
the sky and then had a gray trail. It is however not confirmed that the
two testimonies concern the same object. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern

Rubem Hellwig had encountered twice a small device that did not come from this world and had spoken with its occupants. The machine shaped like a melon or rugby ball was about the size of a Volkswagen and was not far from the road where Hellwig was driving at 5 pm. He stopped and headed towards the UFO.
The crew consisted of two tall men about 1.60 m tall, with a brownish face and no helmets. One of them was inside the device and the other was collecting specimens of grass. They spoke to Hellwig in a strange language, but he still understood what they were asking to know, the place where they could get some ammonia. He indicated the nearest town. With blue and yellow flames of great brightness, the device silently disappeared. The next day, early, he met what seemed to be the same machine but this time with a different crew, a tall man of good appearance and two women. They had light brown skin, long and silky black hair and large dark slanted eyes. All three were dressed the same way: a brown suit resembling suede with zipper closures. They said they were scientists, and were also surprised that unlike other people seen, Hellwig did not flee in terror. Hellwig specified that they could easily pass for natives of the Earth.

On that day, around 3 pm, woodcutter Roger Mougeolle, 37 years old, was cutting wood in Bois-de-Champ with another man when he heard a loud noise. He saw three UFOs passing above him. Their slow speed and size gave the impression of an enormous mass. Two of the objects flew over them. The witnesses (who are the other witnesses?) saw one of the three objects descend, with a noise similar to that of a train running over a metal bridge. The UFO landed 50 m away, not touching the ground (remaining 40 cm away). It was huge: 300 m long, 60 m high. Mougeolle approached it and walked around it. He placed his hand on a cold and hard hull, then tapped it with his fist and then with the back of his axe, then with the blade. At that moment he slowly backed away to a rock on which he leaned: he felt paralyzed, stuck to the rock and watched the departure of the craft which rose slowly. (M. FIGUET/J.L.

Around 02:40 (or 22:00?) the witness was walking home on a small path. He heard a sound like a hammer striking an anvil. 20 to 25 meters further he heard voices. After an avalanche on the path, he took a path crossing a private property. He was on a terrace, bordered by a wall of dry stones on which olives and oranges were grown. He went down a few steps to continue his path on a lower terrace. There he came across an incredible sight. About ten meters in front of him was a luminous and shining object on the ground. It was disc-shaped, more curved on the top, with a small dome on its upper part. The left side was shining like gold. The diameter was about 5 meters and the thickness 1.50 meters. On the left was a standing being, 1.60m tall and very thin with harmonious proportions: it gave the witness the impression of a single piece, very tight, enclosing the head. It shone with a white light "like a crushed firefly". The being had its back to the witness. When it arrived, it turned its head: to the witness's surprise there was a kind of veil that started from the forehead, cut off sharply at the height of the chin. There was a bulge at the height of the nose. The being uttered some words to a second character that the witness had not yet discovered. The words were not understood by the witness. The second being was presumably under the craft, it seemed to be crouching. At the call of the first one it took a step or two back while staying bent, before turning abruptly while standing up. It was smaller than the first one and with less harmonious proportions. It was dressed in the same way and wore the same kind of veil. It had something on its stomach resembling a flashlight. It brought its hand to it and immediately from this object held in both hands, a beam of white light came out.<br/><br/>The witness immediately felt paralyzed. He could no longer move but continued to see and hear. He had difficulty breathing. The two beings spoke again between them, and the n° 2 approached the witness at 60 cm: it came up to his neck, giving him a height of about 1.45 m. He then lifted his veil with his left hand and raising his head towards the witness, as if to show him well: he grimaced horribly, his lips apart revealing all his teeth. High and wide forehead, protruding cheekbones, pointed chin. Thin nose like an eagle's beak, regular and white teeth, beard sprinkled on the right cheekbone, swarthy skin. Widely spaced eyes, slightly oblique, large and globular. At first the witness thought the orbits were empty: then he saw a white globe, without iris or pupil. From the left eye a large tear of a thick and brown liquid descended to the corner of the lips: it was horrible to look at. He lost consciousness. When the witness regained his senses, the craft had taken off, being at 60 or 70 m and turning on itself. (L.D.L.N. "Mysterious Flying Saucers" - ALBATROS-ETAPES 1973 - p. 133 to 137- M. FIGUET/J.L.

The being dropped his veil which fell on his face and, with his arms, twice, he made eloquent gestures, as if to encourage the witness to follow him (...) The witness saw them disappear into the craft without being able to specify where, he did not notice any opening although he heard a dull sound of metal closure. Then he lost consciousness...

They were of a reddish-orange color and a reddish flame was coming out of them. Continuing their flight at 135mph, and after three more minutes, the men then saw other strange craft in front of them, in a linear formation. Then suddenly, at an enormous speed, the objects shot up into the sky out of sight. ("UFO's: A Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 224)

The witness, aged eight, was tending to a sheep when he heard several whistles. He then saw two objects, approximately 2 m in diameter and 1.5 m high. One was spinning in circles and the other was rising and heading north. He noted the presence of two humanoids in the other object. One of them, with long arms, seemed to be touching something while the other seemed to be looking at the witness. They were dressed in blue, a kind of cuirass, they had large heads and seemed to be seated. The witness felt paralyzed with fear.

USA, near Boston
American pilot Charles Kratovil of Transworld Airlines, aboard the four-engine line Paris-New York, saw in flight an object of white color, in the shape of a disk. The object first evolved parallel to the plane, to disappear in the clouds. A few minutes later it reappeared. It was a diaphanous spheroid of the apparent size of a basketball. Warned by radio, the eight employees of the Boston airport control tower replied that they also saw it and alerted the military authorities. A squadron took off immediately. The pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer saw the object for 10 minutes. Kratovil then received two radio messages from the military: "As the fighters approached, the object gained altitude. It is about 3000 m above them (who were flying at 15,000 m) and the object continues to climb". The second message said "that a weather balloon had been released from Grenier at 04:00 local time. At 10:19 it was above Boston and had reached an altitude of 24,000 m. It corresponded approximately to the given dimension and its diameter was about 33 meters".

Dr. Percy Wilkins made an observation from an airplane. During this trip from Charleston to Atlanta, around 10:45 in the morning, his gaze fell upon two bright oval-shaped objects, about 3 km away, remaining above a cumulus bank. He described them as having the appearance of polished metal reflecting the sunlight. Suddenly a third UFO appeared. As the two he had noticed first continued to sway gently above the clouds, the third began to move at an accelerated speed, described a curve and disappeared behind another cloud. These things had an oval shape, a shiny copper color and a thin edge. (Frank Edwards: "The S.V. Serious Affair." - Trans.

He made a turn to intercept them and found himself 3 km behind them, instead of at their level! "The two objects appeared ovoid to me, seen from the end and connected by a beam. Their distance apart was 40 meters, their altitude 9000 meters." They were moving at supersonic speed and were "wobbling".

LABRADOR, Goose Bay,
The crew of a British plane was followed for 80 miles by seven strange objects. Captain James Howard, pilot of the New York-London airliner, said that the mysterious escort disappeared when an American interceptor came to the scene. The BOAC plane was at 19,000 feet about 150 miles southwest of Goose Bay when the objects appeared. "They were suddenly there," said Captain Howard. "They seemed black, and I swear they were solid. They were about 5 miles away. They accompanied us for 18 minutes. There was a large central object that seemed to be able to change shape as if it were made of jelly. Sometimes it had the shape of a double wing, sometimes like a sphere with a tail. The other six objects were in front and behind it. The ten members of the crew confirmed the observation as well as those who were not sleeping among the 51 passengers. ("UFO's: A Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 226) On June 30, 1954, Captain James HOWARD, his crew and the 51 passengers of the BOAC Stratocruiser "Centaurus" saw at 01:05, off the coast of Labrador, a large flying saucer accompanied by 6 small objects. At 01:07 the shape of the large object changed, taking the shape of a delta wing with slightly curved sides, two small objects in front and four small objects behind. At this moment the things changed shape again, from the delta shape the large object became an ovoid narrow, then a kind of wide crescent with clearly rounded tips. It was to starboard about 5 miles away. Around 01:20 the military fighter sent from Goose-Bay base sent a message saying that he was approaching the civil aircraft. Gradually the objects began to literally vanish. At 1:23 the last object disappeared.

ITALY, Torre de Picenardi
Around 2:30 PM, Franco Premi, a farmer, was at the edge of the field near the road, on his tractor. Suddenly his dog, who was accompanying him, became agitated, while a very high-pitched whistle was heard. A strange saucer was landing in a grassy area about 20 meters away, with a kind of tripod support coming out of its belly. Once the craft was on the ground, the whistle stopped, the dog calmed down and the witness, getting off the tractor, went to hide behind some bushes. The gray, but transparent craft in its lower part had the shape of a mouse, without the tail, the lower part being slightly curved, while the upper part was very rounded. The length was estimated at 10 meters, the width at 7 m and the height at 3 meters, without the feet, which were one meter high. After 2 or 3 minutes, two beings dressed in a blue-azure suit came out from underneath. They were well two meters tall, they wore a helmet surrounding their head and descending low on the neck. At the front, a dark visor prevented them from seeing their features. These beings walked with difficulty, opened the craft in three places under the hull and took out a metal piece which they placed on the ground. After a few minutes, they put the piece back in place. One of the beings went to the wheat field, observing the plants (still small), but he did not pick any. He returned to his companion, still under the craft. Together they then looked at the countryside grasses. They took some and put the samples in a small container that seemed to be made of glass. After other looks at the countryside, they returned on board. A few moments later the saucer rose vertically and the high-pitched whistle was heard and gradually the landing gear was retracted into the craft. Once the craft was gone, the witness went to see the landing site and he felt a strong ozone smell. There were some traces of the landing gear, but no plants on the site seemed to be affected by the presence of the craft.

Six women returning home after singing in the choir suddenly saw in the night sky what looked like a missile coming from Whangarei and heading towards the west coast. They were stunned as the craft glided slowly at low altitude, with a yellow glow at the front and an emerald green coloration at the back, so intense that it lit up the whole area. An inhabitant of Hokianga Road, already in bed, was woken up. He came out of the house to see what was happening. The man was scared as the object flew so low that he thought it was going to hit the nearby hill. Nothing was found during the immediate search.

Buck Nelson, a resident of a rural area, claimed to have encountered humanoids from a flying saucer and received them at his home. During the observation of the disk's landing he said: "The most extraordinary and frightening experience occurred when I tried to signal the disk with my flashlight. A beam of very intense light, much hotter and brighter than the sun, came out and hit me violently, making me fall. As I suffered from lumbago and nephritis, I was afraid to move, to get up and take another hit. I only watched the disks until they disappeared. But when I tried to get up, I was surprised to find that my pains were gone: they have not bothered me since". (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 65)

They then saw a luminous, multicolored spherical object descend next to the barn and hover there. A kind of rod extended downwards from it and acted like a ladder, at the top of which an opening appeared and a very tall man (approx. 2.4 m) emerged. He was wearing a black "leather" suit that left his head uncovered. He was carrying a kind of machine gun. This man had a completely human appearance, of white race, but with large round eyes. He had short, black hair cut in a strange way. There were other witnesses to the scene, in addition to the children, and it lasted about an hour. (Skylook n° 92 - July 1975)

Edmond Carnpagnac (C), a former artillery officer and former head of Air France's technical services in Madagascar, now retired, came to testify before the committee. The following phenomenon occurred on August 16, 1954 in Tananarive and was observed by several hundred witnesses. At 5 pm, while the Air France agency staff was waiting for the mail to arrive, someone spotted in the sky a 'large green ball moving at great speed. The first thought of the witnesses was that it was a meteorite. The phenomenon disappeared behind a hill, they thought that the green ball was going to hit the ground and they would perceive the shock. Yet it reappeared a minute later. Passing right through the observers, it revealed itself to be a kind of metal rugby ball preceded by a clearly detached green lens with sparks escaping from the back. According to the witnesses' estimate, the "ball had the length of a DC4 plane, that is about forty meters. The green lens detached at the front at a little less than 40 m, with sparks coming out at the back. The craft flew over Tananarive at an estimated height of 50 to 100 m, an estimation made possible by comparison with the height of a nearby hill. As the craft moved, the lights of the shops went out and the animals showed real concern. After flying over Tananarive, the craft left towards the west. Passing over the city's zebu park, the craft caused a violent reaction of fear among them. Surprisingly, since normally these animals showed no emotion at the passage of Air France planes. Two or three minutes later, an identical craft was observed 150 km away above a farm school. Again, the herds were taken by panic. If the observed craft was the same as the one in Tananarive, its speed must have been around 3,000 km/h. According to C, General Fleurquin, commander-in-chief in Madagascar, convened a 'scientific commission to conduct an investigation into these phenomena. No trace of this investigation could be found in the archives of the Air Force, however number 6 of the Gepa (Group for the Study of Aerospace Phenomena) bulletin of the second semester of 1964 described this observation. (And did the GEPA, a civilian and private ufology group, at least make one or another verification before publishing???) (COMETA Report, 1999)

They began picking and then saw at some distance a man coming towards them smiling and waving his hand. He was dressed in a kind of long khaki tunic, tight at the neck, his waist was held in by a wide belt. He had long brown hair, light eyes slightly slanted, and a very tanned complexion. Surprised, they returned his greeting, as he seemed friendly. He spoke to them in a soft voice and although they knew English and German in addition to Norwegian and had some knowledge of French and Russian, they could not understand a word he said. He took out a kind of pencil and a sheet of paper and drew them some orbits of the solar system, then invited the women to follow him. They did, intrigued. In a clearing they discovered a lenticular craft resembling two overturned saucepan lids with a kind of dome at their axis. The craft, gray-blue, measured 4 to 5 m in diameter and 1.50 m at its axis. Wanting to get closer, the stranger dissuaded them by gestures. He opened a hatch at the base of the dome, entered the craft and closed the door. A faint buzzing sounded and the disc took off slowly spinning on itself. At 40 m in height it hovered for a few seconds, accelerated its rotation and disappeared at an incredible speed.

At around 1:00 AM: A column of light was seen at night by Bernard Miserey. He informed the police station the next morning; they replied that two officers on their rounds around one o'clock had seen the same phenomenon. A military engineer on the RN 181 also saw it. (Henry DURRANT "Le livre noir des S.V. - LAFFONT 1970 - p. 29, cites Aimé Michel in "Lueurs sur les S.V.") "I discovered a gigantic vertical cigar, motionless and silent, apparently stationed above the north bank of the river at about 300 meters altitude. I was contemplating this amazing spectacle for a moment when suddenly, from the bottom of the cigar, an object in the shape of a horizontal disc emerged, which first fell in free fall, then slowed down and suddenly tilted and flew horizontally across the river in my direction and became very bright. For a very short time I could see the disc face on. It was surrounded by a halo of bright light. A few minutes after it had disappeared behind me to the south-west at a prodigious speed, a second object similar to the first detached itself from the lower end of the cigar and maneuvered in the same way. A third followed, then a fourth. There was then a slightly longer interval and finally a fifth disc detached itself from the still motionless cigar. This one fell much lower than the previous ones, down to the level of the new bridge where it stopped oscillating slightly. I could then clearly see its circular shape and its red luminosity, more intense in the center, attenuated on the edges and the ardent halo that surrounded it. After a few seconds of immobility it tilted like the first four and started off in an arrow, but towards the north where it was lost in the distance, gaining altitude. Meanwhile the luminosity of the cigar had disappeared and the gigantic object which may have been 100 meters long had melted into the darkness. The spectacle had lasted about three quarters of an hour. (Henry DURRANT: "Le dossier des OVNI" - Laffont 1973 - p. 37-38).

At the Royal Canadian Air Force base at 5:40 Henry Durdle, on duty in the mess, saw a bright object coming from the northeast that rushed towards him at a terrifying speed. Durdle, panicked, thought for a moment that it was a distressed plane, but there was no sound. Slowing down its course, the object took the shape of a disk topped with a turret, with a rotating, blinding light at the top. The disk, inclined towards the ground, appeared concave and embedded by one of its edges in a kind of parallelepiped with a slightly curved surface. At the periphery hung some kind of intertwined luminous rings. The device was at the height of a streetlight pole. Through a rectangular opening in one of the lateral faces, Durdle saw control organs: levers and buttons. Durdle alerted his colleagues who were then able to see the strange device move. Soon it was only perceived as a ball of light. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V." - Fleuve Noir 1956 - p. 88, 89)

towards him, smiling, with his hands outstretched, to convince him of his good intentions. While uttering incomprehensible words
he grasped Mazaud's hands and shook them warmly. Then, before Mazaud had recovered from his surprise, he jumped over the embankment bordering the

He saw a door open in the dark object and then the object started to rise straight up, then at full speed, roaring. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 96, 97)
"It was between 10:15 PM and 10:30 PM, I was reading when the dog started to bark. My wife and the kid were already in bed. I went back to my reading, but as the dog wouldn't stop barking, I took my flashlight and went to see. Thereupon I noticed along the track a dark mass. (...) But the dog starts barking again. Instinctively I look in the direction where the beast is turning, pulling on its chain, and I see in the shadows something moving on the small path, on the other side of the house. I point my flashlight in that direction and I see two silhouettes rushing towards the railway track. I prepare to pursue them. But I changed my mind when I noticed their extraordinarily small size and their head enclosed in some kind of bell. Believe me, I felt like turning around. So I stayed two meters away from them, watching, when from the dark mass on the line a green ray fixed on me. I don't know if it was the effect of this ray or if I was paralyzed by fear, in any case I was like nailed to the ground. A few moments later the ray went out. The mass swayed, then it rose into the air, vertically, without noise and no faster than a helicopter, leaving behind it a black smoke. Once at a certain height it looked like a ball of fire and it disappeared at a dizzying speed. (...) The object reminded me more of a flat lid. It was closed on all sides. I didn't see the two little beings getting in, the green light was blinding me so much that I couldn't see anything anymore." (...) (note from vog: during the night Marius Dewilde drove 25 km to tell his story to the gendarmerie, which didn't deign to open, then he went to Onnaing to the police station. Commissioner M. Gouchet said that Marius Dewilde was trembling with fear...)

In the afternoon, a truck driver spotted a dome-shaped object approaching vertically and landing behind a clump of trees 50 meters from the road. Through a gallery surrounding the craft, human-like beings were visible. The witness stopped, ran towards the craft: at that moment it emitted a green ray that paralyzed him. The craft took off vertically and slowly moved away with a blast of air at departure. (M. FIGUET/J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, le premier dossier complet.." - Lefeuvre 1979, p. 78)

FRANCE, Saint Prouant (Vendée)
At around 5 pm, Georges Fortin was working in the fields when from the thick cloud layer emerged a luminous blue-violet cloud whose regular shapes resembled those of a cigar or a carrot. This shape had a rigid aspect and its movements were carried out in blocks: like a gigantic engine surrounded by vapors, at 400 or 500 m altitude. Everywhere in the countryside, the other peasants had dropped their tools to watch. Suddenly, the thing had been motionless for several minutes, a white smoke shot out from the lower end, first towards the ground, as if in free fall, then slowed down progressively, initiating an upward spiral around the phenomenon. After other maneuvers, a small shiny metal disc appeared, reflecting like a mirror the reflections of the large object. (...) total duration: more than half an hour. Other witnesses: Louis Grellier, Mrs. Vve Pizou, MM. Pérochau, Mercier and their wives, Daniel Bonifait (followed on 24-7-67: Simon la Vineuse) etc.. (Aimé Michel: "M.O.C." Ed.

FRANCE, Cenon
Near Cenon, a farmer encountered a being in a diving suit who made friendly gestures to him. This individual was very small and had an inhuman and incomprehensible voice. The witness was unable to move the entire time of the encounter. The being entered an object that was placed on the road and flew away "like lightning", projecting a greenish light. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" -1967- Trans. I Read 1974 - p. 36) Yves David de Montgamé was riding his bicycle to Cenon. It was 10:30 pm. He arrived at the place called Pontereau when he suddenly felt a malaise. It was like tingling, prickling all over his body. He had to stop and thus the light of his bicycle no longer illuminated. To his great surprise he realized that his malaise was not increasing but that he was simply paralyzed. He then saw an object three meters wide and one meter thick. He felt horror overtake him: he could not move and he saw this strange object. Suddenly he saw a silhouette come out of the machine: it was a small being with human features. He approached, touched him on the shoulder and spoke to him in a voice that was not human and that he did not understand. The little man retreated to the machine where he entered. It became greenish and shot off into space at a lightning speed. Yves David returned to normal and trembling with fear he jumped on his bicycle to go home.

COTE D'IVOIRE, Danane
The whole population of the town witnessed the event. It was around 8:30 pm and in the courtyard of the residence Mr. Vernhet and his wife were chatting with the chief medical officer of the medical center, the head of the gendarmerie and the Rev. Father Vyard. Their attention was suddenly drawn to a bright point surrounded by a halo that was quickly growing. The light came from an ovoid craft topped with a dome and rays of light seemed to be coming out from each side. This craft moved in complete silence. After turning around for a few moments in the vicinity of the town, it lit up a powerful beacon, sometimes pointing up and sometimes down, and continued to move like this for half an hour. When it moved away, the witnesses clearly saw two oval-shaped luminous halos forming in the presumed location of the craft. (Charles GARREAU: "Alert in the Sky: The Abduction Files" ed.

ACORES, PORTUGAL, Sta. Maria-Ponta Delgada
9:45 p.m. Witness: airport guard. An object 10'x5', light blue metallic color, shaped like a walnut, with a nose in glass or plastic, with a door, with openings or vents in the nose. Buzzing softly it hovered, before landing vertically at 50' feet. A blond man, about 1m 75, 1m 80, appeared, spoke in a foreign language, tapping the guard on the shoulder, returned to his craft, fastened his harness, pushed a button and took off with the nose of the object raised, began to hover for a few moments before climbing vertically. Observations of 2-3 minutes. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner) Time: 10:45 p.m.
(...) The UFO was oblong in shape, 10 feet long and 5 feet high, of a metallic light blue color. In the front there was a section in Plexiglas, blue too, containing the "pilot". At each end of the UFO there were two appendages with 4 arms supporting some kind of wings. An orange light shone in the front of the craft. The civil guard, Mr. Monteiro, was alerted to the presence of the object when he heard a sound like that of the wind passing through high tension or telephone cables. The object landed about 30 feet from the witness, nosing down in the maneuver; it flew over the witness at about 30 cm. Mr. Monteiro did not see any landing gear. A man with blond hair, 1m75 to 1m80 tall, came out of a door in the Plexiglas section and approached the witness. However, there was no attempt at conversation. The contact lasted from 2 to 3 minutes and ended when a car arrived. The pilot boarded and the craft rose almost vertically accelerating and quickly disappearing into the night sky. The weather was clear and visibility unlimited. (said the witness) (collaboration of Larry Fenwick, CUFORN, Joaquim Fernandes, CNIFO, Willy Smith, UNICAT Project; listing of Victor Lourenço; "Diario Popular" 3.10.54; MUFON Journal; FSR; CEAFI) (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 37)

At around 11 o'clock, two employees of the Webster Gas Company were returning from Bracken to Marshfield. (...) At 180 meters altitude and 200 meters distance to the southwest was an object somewhat in the shape of a boomerang, with a short and a long wing, very narrow, silent, covered in some kind of plastic or very thin material. It was slowly spinning. When the wing passed in front of the sun, the sunlight seemed to shine through. It was dark brown in color, with two black stripes near the end of the wing. "We watched it for a few minutes (while stopped) and it rose to a height of 450 meters, still with the same spinning motion and at the same rate of rotation. It descended more slowly than it had risen, to 150 meters, stopped spinning and then plummeted, emitting a plume of smoke or vapor, stopped all maneuvers and fell into a small wood." The witnesses rushed there, but did not find any object: only two places where the ground was completely pulverized, but did this have anything to do with the object? (J. Allen HYNEK: "New Report on UFOs" - Belfond 1979 - pp. 175 to 177) Marshfield, Missouri. 9 a.m. Witnesses: private pilot J.N. Williams, and E.J. Ash. A thin object, initially translucent, then in the shape of an asymmetrical boomerang, descended behind the trees. Ground traces found. Observation of 15 minutes.

Portugal, Almaseda
Cesar Cardoso was driving on a two-lane rural road near the village of Almaseda, not far from the border with Spain, when he heard a strange buzzing sound. Suddenly the engine of his car was sputtering and he stopped on the side of the road. There he tried several times, turning the key, to restart the engine. He only got noises resembling nails being shaken in a metal box. So he got out to open the hood. The buzzing sound he heard grew louder and there, lower than him, near the crest of a hill, he saw a silver disc about 13 m in diameter.<br/><br/>
"Three entities in shiny aluminum uniforms came out, they were about 2 m tall. The entities walked on the hill, stooping from time to time to pick up some of the vegetation that grew there: flowers, leaves, twigs and they put all this in a shiny box. The extraterrestrials saw Cardoso and three other Portuguese along the road: they began to make signs to them, inviting them to come near the saucer. We refused and they did not insist. They got into their craft which rose vertically and left at an extreme speed in a shower of sparks. ("Flying Saucers Uncensored" by Harold T. Wilkins, The Citadel Press, New Jersey, 1955, page 55. ; "Diario de Lisboa" for September 28, 1954.) [IN REALITY: this was a hoax set up by Cardoso's nephew, Francisco Antonio Fereira, who admitted the hoax in an interview, later published in the newspaper "Diaro de Lisboa" on October 1, 1954] (Janet and Colin BORD report this case on September 20)

09:00. Two women, Mrs. Widow Geoffroy and Miss Gisèle Fin, gave independent accounts of a dark gray disc, 6 m in diameter and 1 m high, seen in a clearing. A man of normal size was standing near the craft. He was wearing dark clothes and some kind of cap. Miss Fin approached to within 30 m of the craft and said that the man was busy repairing it.

BELGIUM, Wattou (Flanders)
In the night the witness was returning home by bicycle. The sky was clear and the Moon was visible. On a meadow he saw a "saucer". Crawling and hiding in the bushes, he approached. He observed how small men wearing classic helmets had come out of the device with instruments. They set something up on the ground and the witness saw a flash of light come out of it. He then saw a screen on which a face appeared that seemed to be talking. But from the place he was in, he couldn't hear anything. The devices were then dismantled and reloaded by one of the little men while the other, with a kind of shovel, took a clump of grass which he carried towards the device. He started an animated conversation with his companion during which he pointed to the thicket in which the witness was. Frightened, the man closed his eyes, unable to move. When he opened them again, he saw the little man holding a branch of the bush in his hand, who headed towards the "saucer". Immediately after, the saucer rose. The witness then left the place but, presumably, at that moment he was seen and a powerful beam of light was directed at him. He fled as quickly as possible while the light and the saucer disappeared. (Source: "Ons Zondagblad" 26.9.54, signed Walter Cabu, journalist.

At around 2:30 PM, Mrs. Leboeuf (née Lucette Salin), who was looking for blackberries (or mushrooms?), suddenly found herself, due to the barking of her dog, Dolly, in front of a creature resembling a child in a plastic bag, which she had initially taken for a scarecrow. It had eyes bigger than human eyes. In place of hair, a blackish mass, and wearing a transparent diving suit, its head in a kind of bell. It had no arms. She was petrified and when this being tried to approach her by hopping, she screamed and ran away, hiding in the bushes and trembling with fear. This creature entered a flat and circular machine which took off towards the northeast with a faint whistle. Traces. Witnesses strongly impressed. (Jimmy GUIEU: Black-out sur les S.V." - FLEUVE NOIR 1956 - pp. 157-160) Mrs. Leboeuf, terrified, sees a small being in a diving suit approaching her while her dog and those of the neighborhood bark. Then a disk rises from the ground whistling, tilts and disappears at very high speed. Traces are discovered on the ground and vegetation.

At 8:30 pm, it was pouring rain. Four children playing in the barn,
came out hearing the dog barking furiously. The eldest threw himself
almost on the "ghost" which had the shape of a piece of sugar split at
the bottom, making legs. The small stones and the rubber-tipped dart
thrown at it, bounced off the unknown with a tin sound. So it was not
a ghost and the child approached ready to play, ready to touch. But an
invisible and icy pressure pushed him to the ground. The little sister
who ran up, saw the tin ghost move away swaying. Frightened, the
children fled towards the house while the UFO, a red ball, oscillated
in the meadow. (Jacques POTTIER: "Les Soucoupes Volantes" - DE

"I wanted to approach it, but when I got to 150 m I was literally rooted to the spot by an invisible force. However, I saw it much better. The craft was resting on three legs and had a diameter of about 6m.
