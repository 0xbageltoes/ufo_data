#1989, Early January
Norway, Sande
First half of January. At around 8:30 pm, a mother and her son suddenly saw through the living room window a bright ball. It disappeared and suddenly came back after 5 minutes. The son ran to the kitchen to get a better view and at his cries the mother joined him. There was an object, as big as an airplane, with several lights, which silently moved towards the house. The witnesses were in panic and thought the object was going to hit the house. They had no idea how the thing disappeared. They saw the object from 10 meters away, with a width of 7 meters, with two big lights, two smaller ones, some kind of windows, and a lot of details that were hard to define. The bottom was described by the mother as "full of folds and edges, like a walnut". Duration of the observation: 1 minute. (Menz Kaarbo - Ufo Norway News)

Mufon, Case 1309, # 890603. Duration: 2 hours. Investigator: Dick Seifreid.
At 3:57 am a man was woken up by his dog's barking. Looking outside, he saw three oval discs above the trees bordering his property, less than 100 m away. He woke up his wife and two teenage children. The whole family watched for two hours as the objects hovered slowly over the neighboring farms, before landing. (???) They emitted bright colored lights (amber, red, green, blue and white) that covered their own surface like a bubble of light. At one point, the father and son left in a car to pursue them. Two of the objects came back and hovered over a field before rejoining the third, which was already further away. (Note: the family made a second observation early in the morning of January 27, 1989)

Mufon, Case 1336, #9008222, Time: 10:58 PM; Investigator Fran Ridge.
Four women in a car accompanied by a teenager, saw a large amber light at the back of their car. They stopped for a moment, then drove off. The object, the size of a house, passed overhead, seeming slightly tilted on its side, so that no distinct shape was observed. What they took to be the ventral part had nine bright white lights arranged in an "X" shape. Several photos were taken, and as the object seemed to be about 80 m away, the film only showed small lights arranged in a circle.

#1989, January 23
Norway, Andebu
Synnove Isaksen in a car with her children Linda (12 years) and Jan (9 years) around 8 pm suddenly saw a large bright star approach and become a ball the size of a child's balloon. It made a half turn to follow a direction parallel to the car for about 3 km before disappearing behind the trees. A little further on, having passed the Andebu power station, they saw something fall from the sky. Isaksen stopped the car and they then saw, at 500 m distance and 30 m altitude, an angular mass silently of about ten meters in wingspan. This thing was seen on the ventral side which bore a large white light in the center, surrounded by several smaller red, green and yellow ones. They were strong but did not light up. This phase of the observation lasted about 2 minutes, when suddenly the thing rose at great speed and disappeared, still in silence. About 500 m further on their route, the sphere reappeared and again accompanied the car for 3 km. It was just above the trees. Once they arrived home, the witness wanted to film this sphere with the camera, but it disappeared at great speed. (Menz Kaarbo - Ufo Norway News)

USA, Long Island (New York)
At dawn a fishing boat had just rounded Shawong Point when the captain observed a strange light on the water, which seemed to come from an even stranger craft in the sky. It was like a searchlight and the captain set a course for this light. But the radar stopped working and the captain, fearful, turned off all the lights and stopped the engine. The beam seemed to have a square shape and was about 1500 m away. It began to move towards the boat, dancing on the water. The craft emitting it was itself a kind of triangular or diamond-shaped light about 45 m long. There was only a faint humming sound. Then the object rotated and sped away to the west. Once this thing was gone, the boat's radar worked normally again. (Bob PRATT - USA)

USA, Fyffe (Alabama)
The small town in the northeast corner of Alabama became the site of UFO sightings. On February 11th the police received at least fifty calls and the next day more than two thousand. The first witness to see the strange lights for nearly an hour was Donna Saylor. She called the police saying the object looked like a banana and was at the top of the trees. It hovered at a fairly wide angle (15° to 195°) with intense lights at the top and bottom and a very large light in the center. The banana-shaped curve was outlined in green light. Police Chief Junior Garmany and another policeman drove to the other sighting locations on Route 43. They got out of the vehicle when they saw a UFO coming in their direction. The object passed over them. It was large, wide and apparently triangular in shape. They heard no sound coming from the craft. (Ron Bonds - UFONET II - 15.2.1989)

#February 1989
USA, somewhere in Ohio
It was a Sunday afternoon. I was looking out the kitchen window, which overlooks the garden, and above the garden of a neighbor two houses away (to the west) I saw a black box, the size of a microwave oven, with something sticking out of it, like a stick. This box seemed to be making hops very close to the ground, at such a speed that I couldn't see any details, while going from left to right over a distance of three to four meters. After 30 seconds it began to rise, moving away. The higher it got, the less it seemed to be swaying. Half a minute later, I lost sight of it in the sky. I have no idea what it was.

#1989, March?
Belgium, Antwerpen
A 45-year-old teacher was heading to the bank at around 2 pm in the Brederodestraat (south, but right in the city center) and had to pick up her son from daycare on the same route (note from vog: cfr Tin Vankerkom: her daughter at the nursery school). For some unknown reason, she left in a hurry, without her jacket even though it was cold, and took a shortcut behind the Museum of Fine Arts. There, she saw a UFO above the museum, which flew towards her three times, emitting a blue light and a certain warmth, which filled the witness with a kind of happiness. Suddenly, she found herself on board. She was forced to undress and lie down on a gynecological table, where small beings 1.2 m tall examined her. The leader presented himself, and the witness called him "Blue". With him, she made a journey through the universe, she saw an image of America cut into two parts, across the continent. She was taken to a sacred being whose age she estimated to be around 300 years. He lay in a coffin, but while she watched, he became younger. Later, she found herself back in town, about a hundred meters from the place where she was abducted: the abduction had lasted, because now the bank was closed. (Note from vog: Tin Vankerkom's investigation says it was 3:45 pm... banks don't close that early in Antwerp, do they?) She felt unhappy, her eyes were inflamed and tearful, and later her hair became fragile and brittle. She also had gynecological problems. At the time, she remembered nothing. It was only in 1993 that her memory gradually returned to her. [See next case, same witness, the next morning.] (cfr Bulletin du GESAG N° 95 of June 1997 cfr investigations of Tin Vankerkom, Julien Weverbergh and others)

(cf: see previous case) Woken up by the brightness of the day and a warm temperature for the time of year, it must have been between 5 and 6 o'clock (note from vog: so it certainly wasn't in March..., especially if daylight savings time is in effect, it's not that bright at 6 in the morning). Looking out the window she noticed that the floor of the building was bathed in a brightness similar to that of an afternoon. Examining the sky, she saw the saucer from the night before, but it was bigger. The witness again felt the heat and noticed the silence that had descended around her. The disc was approaching the ground, behind the house. Surrounded by buildings there was a long garden, a garage and a small shed. Modifying its size according to the available space, the disc approached the garage and stopped for a short moment at 50 or 60 cm from the roof, three small landing feet came out and the craft landed. The witness had plenty of time to make out the details: three series of three portholes, a landing gear that appeared and disappeared successively. In the blink of an eye the disc rose vertically, the air under it heated up and took on a white color with orange and blue tints. The phenomenon shrank with the distance and then appeared as three points: white, blue and yellow, arranged in a triangle. In one way or another the witness was back in bed to get up at the normal time and then mention to her husband that she had seen a UFO (note from vog: in a dream?) Later the witness claimed that there were burn marks on the roof of the garage and said that the owner had the bitumen covering replaced.... which the owner firmly denied: he did not make any repairs to the garage at that time!

USSR, Charowsk
At around 11:00 PM A.D. Golowackaja and her daughter saw a golden flame in the sky that became crimson and a silver object preceding the light became visible. It was rectangular, about 12 m long. The UFO emitted a powerful beam that enveloped the witness: she saw 4 creatures on board the craft. They were tall humanoids wearing space suits. Two of them headed towards the back of the craft, shortly after the other two did the same. Panicked, the witness went back into the house. (Inforespace n° 78, p. 32)

#1989, late April
Israel, Haifa
At Shikmona Beach at 2:30 AM on a warm Sunday morning, two teenagers, Ida Biderman and Alon Eilat, were looking for a quiet place to make love. Suddenly, a huge luminous object, described as a pillar of fire, silently descended from the sky, onto the sand, nearby. They watched it descend for 6 seconds, estimating its size to be 20 meters high and six meters wide. The object burned in vertical flames 15 meters long. They headed towards the crash site, but only made it ten meters, as the heat was scorching. The flames died out after ten minutes and there were elliptical things of an indeterminable material that kept burning. They tried to put out the fire by throwing sand on the things, but this caused the flames to flare up again. Soon after, a police car arrived, with the seer Hadassah Arbel on board. She reported that everything was vitrified, sand, stones..(...)

A fighter plane fired a laser cannon at a UFO above the Kalahari Desert. It was shot down and left a crater 150 m in diameter and 12 m deep in the sand. Two injured extraterrestrials were extracted and transferred to the American base at Wright Patterson (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "L'énigme des E.T." - ed. Guy Trédaniel 1995, p. 112) (IMPORTANT NOTE: IN REALITY: from the complete file I copied, it turns out that this case is a famous HOAX... put together by a certain Van Greunen, who repeated it with a landing-crash of a saucer see 1995, September 15 in Leribe, Lesotho according to Cynthia Hind. The author CROLARD does not seem to verify the sources, he is for example still in 1995 one of the few to cite the "disks" of Ulan Batar, another smokey hoax..)

Norway, Kodal
Around midnight, Tom Arne Kristensen was riding his motorbike back home. Suddenly behind him, a very bright light appeared, like that of dozens of headlights lighting up next to each other in a long-range road code. This light came very close to him, then moved away: everything was lit up behind Kristensen, but nothing in front of him. When he reached the top of the Gullibrekka hill, he saw the light below, which suddenly disappeared. Shortly after arriving at Risegardene, the light suddenly appeared again, coming from nowhere. It disappeared when a vehicle came in the opposite direction. Very worried, Kristensen pushed the motorbike to the limit and returned home around 12:30, in a state of shock. Normally, this journey takes him 15 minutes: that night, even though he did everything to get back as quickly as possible, it took him half an hour on this route. (Menz Kaarbo - Ufo-Norway News)

At dusk, Viera Prokofievna and Alexandra Stiepanova with her 6-year-old daughter were heading to the city park. They approached the bank of the Dniepr when they saw three people in silver suits. Their faces were pale and identical like twins, their hair long and blond-red. They had a conversation with these "tourists" who told them they were from a distant planet and that every day they brought one man and one woman from Earth with them. They showed their ship which had the shape of a silver barrel with a rotating antenna on top. The witnesses did not want to accompany them and the "tourists" replied that they would take someone else. They went back into the barrel which took off. (Inforespace n° 78, p. 31,32)

Schoolchildren observed a star in the sky which quickly became a large ball that came over the pastures, headed towards the river and landed. The children were about 500 m away from the scene. The ball split into two parts and in the meadow a humanoid appeared: it had long arms, but no head. The UFO vanished and the being headed towards the village. The being approached a woman with a red scarf on her head and both of them suddenly disappeared. A few minutes later they saw the woman leaving the meadow running. (Inforespace n° 78, p. 33,34) The children observed a luminous spot in the sky. When it descended they clearly noticed that it was a sphere. The sphere landed in a meadow. Observed from a quarter of a mile away, the children saw an occupant next to the craft. The creature, according to what they said, had long arms that went down to its knees.

A panic swept through the town caused by a creature wandering the streets. It moved strangely as if it was floating and emitted strange sounds. The being left a silver trace on the ground that gradually disappeared. When the being approached people, they were either paralyzed or felt heat. It had some kind of aura around it. A motorist was unable to brake in time and stopped only 15 m after the impact site: he and the car were covered in a silver substance that gradually disappeared, meanwhile the being moved, without moving its legs, towards a bridge where it disappeared.

20:50, two witnesses. (...) very low, about 100 m from the ground, a curious object made of a rusty-looking, brown sphere passed quickly. Four vertical appendages made the whole thing look like the first Sputnik. It seemed that the object was slowly rotating counter-clockwise. It moved in total silence, at a constant and fast speed, maintaining the same altitude. Distance from the witness: about 200 m. (VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 209)

Between 11:45 PM and midnight, two people were stopped in their car at a rest area called "La Combe Fusil" and were listening to the radio. As a loud buzzing, similar to a tractor sound but deeper and without resonance, came from the north. They then saw two lights connected by a kind of bar appear. The spheres of light were about 2m in diameter and the rectangular bar was 150 cm long. The light did not radiate more than a meter in front of its source and did not illuminate anything. They had the impression that this phenomenon was skimming the ground, close to the road, but was actually flying 15 m above the ground and advancing at the speed of a walker. The phenomenon disappeared on a constant trajectory towards the south, hidden by a hill. Duration of the observation: 2 minutes. (Phénoména -SOS OVNI, Nov-Dec 1995, pp. 7-9)

Due to the rain, a couple stayed inside their home. They received a strange phone call (psychic ability?) saying they could look outside to see UFOs. When they went outside, the sky was clear. Shortly after, they observed an oval light passing slowly in the distance. Ten minutes later, they had to go back inside due to a violent storm in the area. (Note: the woman would later experience an intrusion by an undefined being in the bedroom. She would experience many experiences, alone or with a triangular object, related to the observations of Fyffe...) (...) There were many observations throughout Alabama to Colorado: (..) IN REALITY: it was the second stage of a Soviet missile which was then observed in South Carolina, and whose trajectory was supposed to take it to fall into the ocean a hundred miles from Georgia. Expert Marsha White explained to the viewers that, in principle, anything launched should either come back to Earth or move away, but that generally, things fell back... over time.

The painter Malachev was set up in front of his easel in the middle of a field. He had the impression that someone was tapping his shoulder, he turned around and found himself facing a flying saucer in front of which two men and a woman were standing. They telepathically offered him to follow them and he got into a craft that took off. He claims to have seen a planet with three moons, a face on board the saucer looking at him through a huge screen and even a recently deceased friend. Then the humanoids brought him back to Earth and dematerialized. Landing traces were found in the field. Examined by psychiatrists, Malachev was found to be perfectly normal. The adventure would have lasted 40 minutes. (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "The Enigma of the E.T." - ed. Guy Trédaniel 1995, p. 80, 81)

Various military witnesses for the observation between 10:12 PM on July 28th until 1:30 AM on the 29th reporting unidentified objects. The testimonies come from military personnel sometimes 45 km away. The three objects were seen at distances ranging from 3 to 5 km up to 300 meters. The objects were shaped like discs 4 to 5 meters in diameter with a luminous hemisphere on the top. The objects flew silently, descended, ascended, hovered, coming to hover over a terrain at only 20 to 60 meters from the ground. The weather conditions were excellent for good visibility. The commander (name censored) of the military unit (name censored) of the BVS polygon, (city of Akhtubinsk) conducted the investigation.

A multiple witness case in a Russian missile base (July 28th-29th 1989) At the head of the UFO reports declassified by the KGB in 1991, is a file relating to an army missile base near Kapustin Yar, in the Astrakhan region, which is mentioned in the work of Marie Galbraith (see chapter 9.1). The English-speaking public became aware of it through the Moscow magazine AURA-Z in March 1993. Military personnel belonging to two centers of the base made handwritten statements about their visual observations, made under good visibility conditions. The incomplete file does not deal with any possible radar detections. It begins with a brief summary of the case, written by an anonymous KGB officer, followed by the report of seven handwritten testimonies (...) In a report, consistent with that of his superior, the soldier Tichaev insisted on the absence of noise caused by the object, even at short distance, which prevented it from being confused with a helicopter. The two witnesses, joined after a while by the guard team, had witnessed the object's maneuvers over the center and its surroundings for two hours. (COMETA report, 1999)

At around 3pm, Aristides Medina was sailing along the mangroves when he first thought he saw a group of children: "Their size varied between 90 cm and 1.10 m, like that of 5 or 6 year old children. I got closer to get a better look. They all looked alike. They were slender, of the same build, and wearing very tight, silver-gray suits. These clothes seemed to be fluorescent - they had a kind of inner luminescence. Two of these creatures were standing there in front of me, staring at me, and the others were half-hidden by the mangroves. Their heads were bigger than ours, but not much, and a bit more elongated, egg-shaped - and without a single hair! These things were pale!...with grayish reflections on their skin. Their eyes were extremely almond-shaped and pitch black, and their nose was rather small; the mouth was practically nonexistent. When I tried to approach them, they ran away at full speed and disappeared into a valley of the Sierra Bermeja. Since then, I have seen them two more times...". (Timothy GOOD: "E.T.

At 9pm (WST), the driver and other members of the Kalgoorlie railways saw a UFO the size of a fighter plane come over the train. This UFO emitted a very dense white smoke from the back so that the passengers could not see anything in the express train for several minutes. The Traffic Information Management System (TIMS) reports that similar incidents occurred affecting three other trains during the same evening and that the reports were received at the Port Augusta Rail Control Centre. This happened within a radius of 600 km. The driver of the Transline, Lou Beccarelli, said: "In my 25 years of service I have never seen anything like it. I was the first to see the thing, 14 km east of Zanthus, it was a light in the shape of a pencil, standing vertically in the sky. In the 20 seconds it was above the machine at a phenomenal speed. The thing was surrounded by six white lights, each emitting white smoke. Despite its colossal size, it was completely silent (note from vog: and the train? also to affirm such a thing?)
To Greg Bourne, I put the train on the sidetrack and stopped it. The guard also saw the UFO, as well as the co-driver; But as soon as I stopped the train, the object disappeared, in a kind of light mist that remained hovering along the tracks to Zanthus." The other reports come from Hesso, Watson and Manguri - all hundreds of kilometres away. The passengers and crew of the trains all describe large objects with white lights and emitting a very dense white smoke. (OZTRAIN.AUS)

At 6:30 PM, on a warm day, many people were in the street.
In Jenia Blinov Park, Vassia Sourine and Youla Cholokhova were playing football. On the edge of the park, people were waiting for the bus. In the sky, a pink light appeared, then a bordeaux ball about 10m in diameter - some sources say the object had the shape of a banana.<br/><br/>
This thing circled the park several times, disappeared, came back a few minutes later, and stopped. On the lower part, a hatch opened. The many witnesses (about forty according to REUTER) saw a 3m tall creature appear, with three eyes, wearing a silver suit with a disc on its chest, and bronze boots. The hatch closed and the object landed on the ground.
A large humanoid came out shortly afterwards, accompanied by a small robot-like entity. The large humanoid said something and a triangular light of 50cm by 30cm appeared on the ground. At this moment, the large humanoid touched the chest of the small robot, which started to move. Frightened by this spectacle, a child in the crowd screamed in fear, the humanoid looked at him with glowing eyes and the child was paralyzed. The crowd started to scream, and the sphere disappeared along with its occupants. It was visible again 5 minutes later. The large creature was armed with a rod which it pointed at a 16 year old teenager in the crowd: he disappeared on the spot. He would only reappear when the humanoid was back on board the craft, which then took off.

At 6 pm, Dr. Christian B. was on his way to visit a patient on Rue de Chenée. Above the Cointe hill, he noticed a bright light. This surprised him so much that he stopped and got out of the car to observe it. The sky was still clear but slightly foggy. The object passed directly overhead. It had a strange, very wide, very flat construction with two projectors at the front pointing downwards, a flashing red light at the back, and white fixed lights at the wings' ends. Between the front and back lights was a kind of hatch for a possible landing gear. As his stop on the road was disrupting traffic, the doctor went to turn off the headlights of his car that had been left on. At that moment, the object disappeared from his field of vision.

#September 1989, 
USSR, Voronezh 
several spectacular UFO landings had been reported. This news spread around the world; Igor Yadigin, 29 years old, an aviation technician, was heading to the base located on the airport grounds. Igor started his work at 8 pm and, to take a shortcut between his home and the airport, he had to cross a ravine. As he left the bottom of the ravine and started to climb the other side, he saw something bright and emerald-colored a little further to his left. The light was actually a spherical object with a diameter of no more than 70 cm; it was standing still above the ground level. Quickly glancing at his watch, Igor noted that it was 7:40 pm. He kept walking towards the floating object and was about 6 m away when he suddenly heard cracking branches to his right. He turned his head in that direction and saw a very tall and well-proportioned man wearing a silver outfit. He must have been at least 2.50 m tall and had his head covered, up to his shoulders, with some kind of helmet, with a rectangular visor that seemed to contain a liquid, preventing him from distinguishing the man's features. (...) At the same time, there was a faint flash at the level of the man's visor and something made Igor turn back towards the sphere. He was greatly surprised to see a "living" and perfect image on its screen: that of the Chernobyl power plant (which he knew well). (etc... explosions etc...) Then the image was replaced by that of the Novovoronezh power plant (about 45 km from Voronezh), where Igor had been several times. (...) (note from vog: re-projection catastrophe). Igor lost consciousness. When he came to, there was nobody around and the sphere had disappeared. A month after the incident, Igor made an interesting discovery. He noticed that when he placed his hand at about 40 or 50 cm from the screen of his television, he reversed the image.

Shortly after, the witness noticed that people were no longer looking at the fire fighters' intervention, but were looking up and moving towards Rue Masson. And there, at the end of the street, he saw in the sky like a circle formed by 6 to 8 large white lights that slowly crossed the street in absolute silence. There was nothing else but these lights. Another witness who was about sixty meters away on a cliff path said he had seen at that moment a large object resembling a saucer. (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, p. 53, 54)

Dark, cloudy and rainy night. At 8:15 PM, Mr. and Mrs. Dupuis in a car, observed at the exit of the village of Forest a luminosity coming from behind a bakery and a group of houses. They then saw above a house located 20 meters away, a device with headlights arranged in an equilateral triangle. The building, of large dimensions, was bathed in intense light. Mr. Dupuis stopped the car, turned off the engine and then saw a large dark triangular mass with lights at its base. The object had a wingspan of about ten meters. Between the spots he noticed a fairly wide dome, similar to a cheese bell while he perceived a movement through the dome. At the back an outgrowth in the shape of a tube is visible. Mr. Dupuis got out of the car and cautiously approached the place where the device was going to cross the road. Suddenly, directly above the road, the device descended one or two meters and emitted a red flame tinged with blue, coming out of the rear tube. Simultaneously, Mr. Dupuis heard a slight whistle. The object was less than 10 m from the witness and flew over the road at 5 m altitude, the beams strongly illuminating the ground. The device continued on its west-east route and headed towards a high voltage power line located 300 m away. Suddenly, Mr. Dupuis perceived a movement through the dome and saw a white shape. He made big signs with his hands and suddenly the object became invisible. The observation lasted a good 5 minutes in total. Follow-up: sleep disturbances for Mr. Dupuis, nervous depression two months later for his wife. (Inforespace No. 79 pp. 4 and 5 and VOB 2 SOBEPS 1994, p. 169)

Ivar Spilde, a college professor, saw at around 11 pm, at an altitude of about 100 m and 150 m away from him, a strange object. His attention had been drawn by a deep and dull sound and he first looked out the window, then went outside. On the bottom there was a row of lights, topped by a barely visible structure. The underside was roughly rectangular, but with the long sides of unequal length between 15 and 20 m long, one of the widths was greater than the length. The surface had 5 or 6 rows of small white-yellowish lights that were reflected on it. On one of the corners of the back, a large white light seemed to not be part of the "fuselage". This object left towards the southeast at the speed of an airplane. Duration of the observation: 30 seconds. (see December 15, 1989) (Menz Maarup - Ufo-Norway News)

23:50: 3 witnesses. "A deep sound, similar to that of a large transport helicopter with double rotors or a diesel locomotive at idle, drew our attention. The three of us went out onto the illuminated terrace behind the house and, almost vertically, at an altitude that I estimate to be 150 meters, there was an immobile object. According to the triangular position of the white headlights, it seemed to me that the object was triangular in shape, but I could not make out the exact shape. The headlights emitted a strong white-yellowish light of fixed intensity. In the center of this triangle there was a red light of fixed intensity as well. We observed this phenomenon for 3 or 4 minutes, then it began to move with the same sound, in the direction of Andrimont (SO). The dog spent most of the time from November 26 to December 1, 1990 hiding under the furniture. (VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 194)

In a village near Butgenbach, Mrs. D. accompanied by her daughter Evelyne, 16 years old, was at the cemetery in front of the tomb of her eldest daughter who had died in an accident at the beginning of the year at 7:15 pm. A large light approached from the west and stopped at 30 or 40 meters in height, just above the pines that border the cemetery, about 150 meters from the witnesses. The light had a certain volume but the contours were blurred. Sometimes a shape could be distinguished: a diamond. One point was directed upwards, but the diamond seemed to take different inclinations and it was drowned in a strong light of changing colors. It was usually white but a part could be more red or orange or even green-blue. The daughter found this quite worrying while the mother found it really beautiful. When they left the cemetery after 10 minutes at the insistence of the daughter, the mother walked as far back as possible so as not to lose sight of the light. (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, p. 32, 33)

At around 5:10 PM, André R. was driving towards Liège when he saw a large, apparently stationary, luminous object in the sky. The object struck the witness with its unusual shape and exceptional size. It had two far-apart headlights, and the dark triangular body with rounded corners stood out clearly against the sky "like a ray fish without a tail". The witness then saw a second object, further away than the first, flying quickly on a horizontal, undulating trajectory, describing roughly reversed S-shapes from NW to SE. Duration of the observation: between 8 and 10 seconds. (Inforespace n° 84, p. 16)

Gendarmes Von Montigny and Nichols in a van on the N 68, arrived at 17:20 at the height of "Grosse Weide". They observed a large dark triangle with two cut corners (dimensions 30m base, 25m height, cut part 6m, thickness 2m) with three huge circular headlights pointing downwards, diffusing cones of light. This object was at an altitude of approximately 120m. A small red flashing light - or a small rotating beacon - was located at the center of the object. The object was motionless, then moved forward, flew over the gendarmes, stopped, turned in place and left in the opposite direction, towards Eupen. It was the silence of this machine that most surprised the gendarmes. (.. .) (VOB 1 - Sobeps 1991, p. 16 to 19)

Two witnesses arrive in the street where they live and then see an enormous dark mass motionless at about 500 m from the ground. It has the shape of a triangle with 3 big white headlights near the corners. A red light is blinking in the center of the triangle. The witnesses are convinced that this blinking corresponds to a ball placed under the flat underside. This ball is spinning like a beacon. When they get out of their car they are surprised to see the object hovering above them. The car engine is stopped, but they don't hear any noise coming from the craft, not even when it slowly starts to move, base forward. (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, p. 28)

At around 6 pm, an electrical technician happened to look in the direction of Ans and Bierset. He then noticed the presence of an enormous triangle with a wide base and rounded corners. It had three very bright white lights near the corners and a red flashing light in the center. It was perfectly still. For Mr. K., the witness, it could not be the Awacs. He knew them well since he lived near the Bierset base. (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, p. 42)

At 6:30 pm, a shopkeeper and another witness observed a triangle stationary in the middle of a meadow, 100 m away from them, at the end of a 12 m high electric pole, emitting a cone of white light towards the ground similar to an elephant's trunk; then in motion as the van approached while a large red light began to blink in its lateral thickness. It was a dark, rounded shape at the back. At the back, two rows of red lights could be seen, like eight rectangular windows. As it moved away, it emitted a buzzing sound, audible despite the noise of the van's engine. (Franck Boitte, Inforespace n° 85 p. 36 and VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 209)

Belgium, Membach
Two gendarmes, Nicholls and von Montigny, stopped the van around 6:45 pm on a hill called Kortenbach. The object had stopped above the Gileppe lake a bit to the left of the lit tower. The stationary UFO was repeatedly and simultaneously emitting two thin beams of reddish light in opposite directions. These beams were straight, very thin, and of constant section. They left the object at great speed and remained visible for a certain time. When they disappeared, a red ball persisted at the ends of the beams. These fireballs returned to the object by turning around the white ball for a few moments. Then the process started again identically. The UFO stayed there stationary until 7:23 pm. They suddenly saw a second triangle emerge from behind the pines, rising into the sky as if catapulted. It slowed down, inclined slightly and turned. It exposed its superstructure where the gendarmes clearly discerned a dome placed like a spherical cap in the center of a thin plate. This dome had rectangular windows lit from the inside. This object headed north. (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, pp. 23, 24) Paul Van Brabant, an independent Belgian researcher, tried in December 1996 to almost prove that the light observed to the left of the tower corresponded exactly to the location of Venus that evening with a magnitude of -4.6, almost the maximum. (Bulletin du GESAG No. 94, March 1997, pp. 5-11) Professor Meessen proved in February 1997 during a meeting with the skeptics that if Venus was in the sky, for the gendarmes Venus was to the right of the tower at the indicated time and not to the left. (vog: by hearsay, but I don't have the proof)

At around 7 pm, Mrs. B. observed a triangle with points of light on its underside. Through the window of her kitchen, she first saw two bright headlights. They were so close to the ground that she initially thought it was a truck, but there was no road in that area. Gradually, she made out a large dark mass and realized, along with her son, that it was a flying object. It made a turn that brought it in their direction. She switched off the light in the kitchen and saw that it was a triangular object with rounded corners. It flew very low, slowly, and without a sound. When it flew over the house, its size was such that it would cover two attached houses. They then noticed many small yellow lights on the underside of the craft "like little stars". Around the object there were small red lights that moved independently "like fireflies". (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, p. 32)

Linda Cortile Case.
Two policemen, whose car had broken down near the Brooklyn Bridge, saw a large, luminous craft hovering at the height of the top floor of a nearby building. They saw a woman in a white nightgown and three strange little creatures being carried into the craft by a beam of light. The woman had come out of the window and had floated in the air, just like the other three. The object flew away, flew over the FDR Drive where their car was broken down, and plunged into the East River. They were sure that the woman was dead and were going to investigate. However, this person, whom we will call Linda, revealed these facts under hypnosis to Budd Hopkins. In April 1991, Linda was kidnapped by the "policemen" who were actually security agents attached to the person of Javier Pérez de Cuellar, then Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was also a witness to the incredible scene that night. Another independent witness, a woman in her sixties, also saw the phenomenon. In total, no less than 18 people were witnesses to the event.

The witnesses noticed a geometric figure made up of 3 lights: one white, one blue, one red. This object moved in a straight and uniform manner, a bit faster than a tourist plane. The phenomenon passed at an estimated altitude between 50 and 100 meters above the witnesses. The children claimed to have heard a sound of an electric motor.

From 18:15 to 18:50 two witnesses, one of them a public servant, observed a grey matte triangular object surrounded by several red glows; this object ejected twice clusters of 6 to 10 orange luminous balls in the direction of the stopped car of the witnesses: distance of these balls relative to them: 10 meters. (Franck Boitte, Inforespace n° 85, p. 37) This cluster passed under a high tension line and was immediately returned towards the luminous structure; a new cluster of these small red lights made the same journey, under the high tension line. The red elements remained grouped. They came out of the lower part of the object and the cluster they formed had the size of a car. There must have been 10 to 20 of them, without forming a precise shape. Dimension of the craft: the size of a football field. (VOB 2, SOBEPS 1994, p. 165)

Object in the shape of an egg, more rounded at the front where the witness distinguished a window or a dark windshield that had the aspect of plexiglas. The object was gray-matte, dull, without any shiny effect. A kind of horizontal band resembling a throat in which several small lamps of a bluish and reddish brilliance encircled the object. At the back, an orifice in which was planted a kind of fin or oar of the same gray-matte aspect. The underside had three protuberances where spotlights were housed, turned off at the beginning of the observation. At the back of the large window, a kind of logo, three intertwined ellipses that made one think of the trajectories of electrons around a nucleus. The size: about twenty meters. The witness had the impression of contemplating a material but "blurry" object, although it was only 80 m away. When leaving, the object lit up the three spotlights under its body. Suddenly, no more sound or light: it was over. (...) (Inforespace n° 80 p. 32 to 42)

(cf: 11 10.1988) The aeronautical specialist of the Flemish daily newspaper "Het Laatste Nieuws", Herman De Wulf, stated that the description of the phenomena observed above the eastern cantons was close to that of the F-117A. Lt. Col. Billen of the Belgian Air Force compared it to "a kind of delta wing with a rotating beacon". In the US, the aeronautical press assumed that the F-117A had carried out test flights over the European area to see how it operated in wartime. Herman De Wulf mentioned that the aircraft would have come from Gellenkirchen or Bittburg (Germany) and that it was operating in the north of the Belgian Ardennes in the TR 13 zone, where NATO flights are authorized at an altitude of 250 to 500 feet (note from vog: this was confirmed to me by the military themselves, with the restriction "from September to the end of January") (see 1912.1989) (ABSOLUTELY SEE: 30.3.1990) (Gesag, bulletin n° 96 September 97, p. 4)

The appearance was solid but the contours were blurry. There were 4 projectors or large headlights in a line that shone their light forward (towards the witness). But the object, although matte, illuminated the slag heap with its brightness. The shape of the object was oval for the upper half and almost flat, but still curved for the lower part. It made no noise. At one point the object tilted 30 to 45 degrees and began to move, first slowly (10 km/h) then suddenly faster than lightning. (VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 210 with illustration)

Suddenly Alain called his mother and sister because a "big star" was approaching. They looked with the naked eye and binoculars before going outside to call the father and continue the observation. The thing was still getting closer. Strangely, the brightness decreased and they could distinguish with the naked eye a strange dark shape, with three lights arranged in a triangle and directed downwards. In the center a much smaller flashing red light. Simultaneously they saw a second identical object, much further away to the west, which was apparently following the same trajectory. It looked like a flying wing with a kind of protrusion at the back, and on the front edge three reddish portholes. A bit like a Boeing without the whole fuselage, said Mr. F.

At around 6:00 PM, on a rainy afternoon, Rolf Kaster, a chemistry student, was riding his bicycle along the Ruhr when, without knowing how, he found himself in a meadow. It was 10 PM, night had fallen. He thought he had had an accident and had fainted. He went home in a state of incomprehensible fatigue. Soon after, flashes of memory assailed him. He had met giants, he had been on board a spaceship. As he pedaled through the woods, an animal or what he took for an animal, leapt out of a thicket 10 m away from him. He got off his bicycle and saw a female silhouette appear that grew and grew until it reached 3.50 to 4 m high. The giant was slim and rather beautiful, wearing a metallic suit that only revealed her fingers and face. Kaster asked her if she came from the future and the giant, after telling him that she was from the Wolf (note from vog: Wolf = Wolf? Would this be a Ummite?), invited him to follow her. They arrived in a clearing above which a cloud floated at a hundred meters altitude. The cloud suddenly burst into three columns of rain that flooded three small circular portions of the ground. A large chain with a bar at the end descended into one of these columns. The giant dragged the student, who she had placed on her shoulder, grabbed the chain and both were sucked through the column of rain up to a disc a hundred meters in diameter. Inside were other naked giants, male and female, with whom Kaster could not communicate. However, he discovered that he could make telepathic exchanges with a funnel-shaped creature with multiple gray-green eyes that floated at the bottom of a large aquarium. For the student, this monster was undoubtedly the "captain" of the UFO. He was given a helmet and connected to a computer to take a series of mental tests. The computer answered all his questions, and he thought it gave him access to all current and future knowledge. He took advantage of this to obtain revolutionary pharmaceutical formulas, new solutions for producing energy. The only questions left unanswered were about the "giants". Kaster thought they were only biological robots with a quasi-human form meant to reassure. When he wanted to take off the helmet he felt such pain that he could no longer breathe and... found himself in the grass of the meadow. (The student himself said he was embarrassed by the absurdity of his testimony and specified that if he had wanted to invent a story he would have imagined a more intelligent one. - He remains convinced that the information given by the computer is applicable and tries to obtain patents to prove the reality of his testimony.)

Together they saw two distinct luminous masses, yellow and red, connected by a gray rectangular shape passing over the electrical wires, then making a turn and going up, while a sound similar to that of a turbine was heard. One of the witnesses said that for her the object resembled the shape of a "dog bone". Another witness specified: I saw two rounded parts connected to each other by a more rectangular part. The rounded parts were respectively red and yellow, the part that connected them was dark, gray mouse or black. This object crossed the road very low, skimming the electrical wires. There was no noise or breath. However, one of the witnesses heard a sound similar to that of an ULM or a remote-controlled plane, when the object went up turning, the buzzing increased producing an acceleration sound.

Wolfgang Gutschke of Bergendorfer Heirweg, an amateur astronomer, got up around 1am and wondered if he would be able to observe stars. The sky was clear and a low horizontal mist was dimming the city lights. The moon had already set, and looking for Sirius, he located it as well as several other stars, even of lesser magnitude. He was suddenly interrupted in his search by the arrival on his right of a large flying object, flying quite low and very quickly, passing overhead. It was milky gray and faintly lit, a triangular shape with rounded corners moving point forward. In each corner there was a downward-directed ring of light, rather pink in color. As it moved away, these rings had an oval shape and seemed to be tubes directed towards the back. Completely silent flight. Apparent size of about 10.5. Calculations made in three different ways: this object measured at least between 58 and 73 m on each side. (personal doc. of vog)

She was alone in the car, and strangely, there was nobody else on the road. She had to stop at a red traffic light. 150m further, suddenly, she was driving in the opposite direction and 5km away from the place. This change happened abruptly in a fraction of a second. She immediately stopped and got out of the car. She felt nauseous, had difficulty breathing and a terrible headache. Shortly after, she noticed a "missing time" of 25 to 35 minutes.

At 9:07 PM the three witnesses were in a car in Karthause in a residential area where the speed limit was 30 km/h. The mother was the first to see two lights descending in a straight line towards them. The driver, fearing that the object carrying the lights would fall to the ground, steered the car to the right side of the road and stopped. Meanwhile, the object had stopped above the road, almost vertically above the car. The driver turned off the engine and lowered the window. She saw a large triangular object absolutely still, without any noise, at the height of the roofs of the houses, which corresponds to about 25 meters. The sides of the triangle measured about 20 meters. Three milky yellowish white lights were distributed on the corners of the triangle. In the center was a much larger light, its color changed but the dominant color remained gray-blue. They only saw the underside of the object, of metallic appearance, dark gray, without color, solid and sharp contours, faintly lit by the lights. They saw some kind of lines and rivets. The object remained still for 2 to 3 minutes. It suddenly left in the direction of the houses and the driver then felt a strong current of air.

It came so close to the ground that it was clearly visible: it was silver in color and seemed to be piloted, given the intelligent maneuvers it was performing. During their observation, the object hovered at the bottom of the hill, as if it were going to land. When the young witnesses approached it, it shot off at lightning speed into the sky and disappeared. When they arrived at the landing site, the witnesses saw a kind of large "+" sign marked in the ground with some kind of very black substance, like powder. They did not touch it, still frightened by the sudden disappearance of the object. The next day, it had rained during the night, and in that area a 5 m diameter zone showed the grass as if it had been treated with insecticide and the black substance had disappeared. (...)

At 6:40 in the morning, the witness was driving to work in the snow showers. Suddenly he heard a sound like one of his tires was beginning to puncture. He slowed down, turned around, and saw through the rear window a magnificent triangular craft with three huge white lights (2 m in diameter) and a red light that seemed to be at the end of a thin antenna. This light did not seem to be connected to the antenna. The edges and corners of the craft were rounded, made of a black metal so polished that it was shiny. There were no bumps or distinguishing marks. It was moving more slowly than the car (40 km/h), without making any noise and at a low altitude. According to the witness, the cloud ceiling was about 250 m and the object was absorbed by the clouds. The nervous tension caused by the observation gave the witness a migraine for 48 hours.

At 10:10 PM two motorists, former military personnel, saw above the trees a strange orange glow approaching them. They stopped to observe better: it was an object in the shape of a flying wing, passing at an altitude of 300 to 450 m, as big as a Boeing 747, wider than long. At the front it had a pink light, on the left an amber one and on the right a blue one. It emitted a strange "oscillating" sound, said the witnesses. Duration of the observation 4 minutes. Speed of the object's movement: approx. 200 km/h. The underside was like tiled with rectangular elements in rows, alternating somewhat like a brick wall. (Ufo Intelligence Newsletter 21, April 1990)

Observation starting at 11:30 PM of an immense triangular object, with a spearhead at the front, or like a small triangle planted at the top of a larger one, which arrives in a "crab" motion, equipped at the front with a lamp of the apparent size of half a moon diameter. The four witnesses are flown over very closely by the object, at about 35 meters altitude and the main witness, equipped with a flashlight, illuminates it: they see that the material is of a black graphite aspect on which are drawn sorts of rectangular plates of all different sizes assembled in an anarchic way in a sort of unicolor mosaic. All around each rectangle are darker protuberances which make one think of rivets embedded in the material. The whole is stocky with rounded shapes, and sorts of nozzles at the back, its width is at least that of a Concorde. The object continues to pass and after long minutes they can see the back where there are two large yellow egg-colored headlights of 2.50m diameter each. When it passes at the zenith of the witnesses they hear a sound similar to that of a small electric motor. Speed of displacement: from 3 to 5 km/h. Duration of the observation: 10 minutes (investigation by Jean-Marie Bigorne presented by Franck Boitte for the Sobeps) (note from vog: the sketch of this phenomenon looks exactly like the SAAB 35 VIGGEN aircraft, which can take off even from a 500 meter stretch of highway. In 1971 it is considered as the most advanced and sophisticated combat aircraft in Europe, cfr Encyclopedia of Combat Aircraft, Bill Gunston, Elsevier-Séquoia 1979, p. 192-193; in 1990 there are still several dozen Viggen in service)

Mrs. Y.B. was watching television between 10 pm and 10:30 pm when her eldest son complained that he couldn't sleep due to an unusual brightness. It was as bright as day in his room. She parted the curtains and saw three powerful beams of light arranged in a triangle with a smaller, flashing orange light. The whole thing was about 400 m away and the beams were directed towards her house. The lights belonged to a dark structure that was moving slowly from right to left, covering 400 m in 10 minutes. Then the object stopped and the witnesses could make out structures underneath that looked like scaffolding. A cylinder of metallic appearance detached itself from it and headed vertically towards them, stopping at 200 m before rejoining the main object. This process repeated shortly afterwards. Taking fright, the witness and the two children (11 and 6 years old) left the house to go to relatives 2 km away. When Mrs. B. returned home around 11 pm, everything had disappeared. She made a statement to the police. (Inforespace n° 90 p. 41; VOB2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 199)

At 9:30 PM, in Schriek on the road from Tremelo to Heyst op den Berg, a family (father, mother, 7-year-old boy - and two 4-year-old twins who were sleeping) observed a UFO. It was the 7-year-old boy who exclaimed first "God the Father"! while the father thought it was a helicopter. In any case, the driver stopped his car without really knowing how or why and the 3 awake witnesses observed the luminous phenomenon each in a different way and at very different distances: for the father it was next to him, near the road, for the mother it was at the top of the trees, for the boy it was quite high in the sky. Back at home they didn't talk about it anymore, they didn't even talk at all. However, was it that day or later that they realized they had a "missing time" of 20 minutes? (note from vog: 3 deviations on the road and a stop to observe the UFO, aren't those the 20 minutes? Case highlighted by the person (T.

Belgium, night of the F 16s...
Shortly after takeoff we had it clearly on the radar, the screen showing the altitude, speed and direction of the target. When we got it, it was at 5000 feet (1600 meters) and its speed was very low, not more than 50 miles (90 km/h). In aviation terms it was almost like hovering, the thing "was just there, at ease". When the radar locked on, it was 48 km away from us. When we set course for it, it didn't react at first. But when I was halfway there we saw on the screen its speed accelerating fantastically. And it was like that for all the pilots. A sudden acceleration to mach 8, mach 9 or mach 10 (= 9000, 10000 or 11000 km/h). Incredible. The radar only indicates mach 2 (1800 km/h) and the indicator estimates the speed based on the rapid elevation it saw. It's as if the thing said: OK guys, that's enough. And those altitude levels: from 10000 feet all of a sudden to 60000-70000 feet! In a fraction of a second. (a pilot in a technologically advanced plane would simply not survive such altitude changes). At that moment there was no more radar contact. There was no more lock-on but we still had a bit more information on the recording band. (article by Jan Hertoghs in the magazine HUMO of 24.9.1996). Several gendarmes from the Wavre region, unidentified echoes on the Glons radar, and two F 16s taking off from Beauvechain, staying in the air for an hour. Hundreds of civilian witnesses. (VOB 1, pp. 173 to 188 + pp. 225 to 235). (Note from vog: Explanation by L. Clerebaut (Sobeps) in August 1996: "the gendarmes confused the stars of the Orion constellation... "... Poor Belgians, whose Army would send two F 16s to conquer... stars! According to other sources it was only plasmoids... and the Doppler effect, but as Professor Souriau said "it's like measuring the Doppler effect on macaroni boiling in a saucepan. You will never find as a result that the saucepan is fleeing" To the detriment of Sobeps. It is therefore surprising that the NATO bases of Belgium, Germany and England were on red alert that night... they were expecting a "massive invasion (by hundreds) of UFOs.. So? What kind of a foolish Earth is it that can't tell the difference between the Orion constellation and hundreds of UFOs... Did someone say disinformation?)

I could see that it cut its lateral lights three times. Two very large rectangles were on either side of the two lateral lights; between these two lights was an alignment of two rows of small, parallel "tile" rectangles divided by a fairly deep groove where countless small, sparkling points of light like sparks shone along the entire length.... The structure of the back was made of rectangles of all sizes, separated by wide, very dark joints. At the back of the craft I could distinguish two long rods (like antennas) or tail fins that curved outward. (VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, pp. 156, 175, 177; VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, pp. 205 and sketch)

Tolin refused to mention which country it was. During this same press conference (flight logs of May 1990). A member of the press raised the question of whether the F-117A had been used operationally outside the US: "We are not allowed to answer this kind of question" was the response. Another question was about the participation of foreign pilots on board the F-117A. The response: "As in any other unit, we have visiting pilots.

The headlights in the corners emitted colors like a rainbow, with a predominance of red-orange. One of the faces of the object showed a square in its center and when this face was seen the object looked like a pepper. The object was at an altitude of about 700m and moved without noise.

From her living room on the 6th floor of Parc Peterbosch in Anderlecht, an elderly lady saw a flying object arriving around 8:50 PM: first 4 lights, two white ones on the right, two white ones on the left, and a small red light that seemed to oscillate, the object passing by showed its triangular shape, and only made a very light noise. Around 9 PM another witness saw a perfectly triangular shape with white lights in the corners and a small red light in the center passing by the Porte de Namur in the center. Around 9:10 PM some young people observed a flying object above the cemetery of Ellezelles (near Renaix), without noise, at the level of the clouds. Around 10 PM in La Hulpe two witnesses saw a metallic gray triangular shape under the clouds heading towards Wavre. This object had white lamps in the corners and one or two blinking red lights forming a blinking band in its center. Passing under the clouds it illuminated them, so it must have had lights on its upper face as well. They observed this object with binoculars and a telescope, passing in silence.

Between 11:45 PM and midnight, the first witness of the night shift of Engrais Bataille first saw two huge headlights coming from the direction of Mons. He realized that these headlights were on a trapezoidal platform (width 100m, large base 50m, small base 30m) metallic gray in color, flying at 45m high and at 30 to 40 km/h. He ran to warn his colleague. The base of the object continued to pass over the entire surface of the courtyard. Structures (six or seven) in the shape of rectangular plates seemed to be attached to the platform. The large side of these plates was about 20m, the small side between 10 and 15m. Towards the end of the platform appeared a circular plate occupying the entire width. Two circular areas of orange light flanked it. The object slowly moved away in the direction of Tournai, without noise, without turbulence in the air, nothing. The structure resembled an "upside-down aircraft carrier". (Note from vog: less than a year later the Bataille factories were ravaged by a fire) (Inforespace No. 79 pp. 17-20, VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, pp. 209, 210 and sketches middle pages; VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, pp. 200, 201, 205)

Four witnesses on the terrace in Ellezelles were enjoying the nice weather. It was 10:30 PM. Suddenly, Mr. H. saw a dark mass coming from the south-southwest and they all could follow the triangular-shaped object with two blinking red lights on the bottom and a fixed white light in the front. Mrs. L. thought that the light in the front was produced by the rotation of several lights. The wingspan of the triangle was 20 to 30 meters and gave the impression of a three-story structure, that is, the lights seemed to be arranged at different levels. The object was traveling at about 40 km/h and emitted a modulated sound "as if in a whisper". Suddenly, on its trajectory, the object pivoted at a right angle, then again, to resume its initial trajectory but slightly displaced. It seemed to be swaying in a kind of undulating movement. Later, in the night, coming from the northeast, the witnesses saw groups of objects reappearing: they counted about twenty. The whole observation lasted about an hour and a half.

At around 11:15 PM, Joseph D. went out to close the door of a small greenhouse in the garden. He heard the strange-toned barking of several dogs. He then saw at about a hundred meters away a kind of pale, bright but dull light, not illuminating the surroundings, total height about ten meters. Joseph's wife had come out at that moment and together they watched this apparition which had a "religious character" (sic). Suffering from leg pain, the woman went back inside after five minutes, but Joseph went back out and noticed that the phenomenon was still there. He crossed the fields to get closer and called out when he was 50 meters away. The light came from a conical structure whose surface was like corrugated sheet metal and seemed to hover one meter above the ground. It was topped with a darker dome with the look of a "turned-off television". The dome was framed by four one-meter-long square-section pillars pointing upwards. There was a great silence, Joseph became very nervous and scared, so he went back inside. The next day he would find traces on the ground, a fine yellow dust. In the two months that followed, the dwarf goats that were in an enclosure 30 meters from the dome would die one after the other. (...)

In broad daylight, a gigantic disc-shaped object flew over the city of Mary at an altitude of about 1000 meters. It was of a yellow-orange color, with what could be interpreted as portholes all around; its diameter was estimated at 300 meters. Military personnel were able to observe it from a distance of no more than 3000 meters. The Mary sector was under the command of the famous 12th Army; this division of the Air Defense had Colonel Anatoli Kurkchy at its head. When he learned that a UFO was reported in his sector, he ordered the launch of air-to-ground missiles. Colonel Kurkchy then authorized the takeoff of two interceptor planes. But at a point about 1000 meters from the strange disc, these planes dived towards the ground and crashed. The crews, that is, four pilots, were killed. Colonel Kurkchy was immediately relieved of his duties by the army commander and brought before the court martial of the 12th Army (...)

As reported in "The UFO Report 1992" and "Alien Liaison", many witnesses in Cabo Rojo saw five small creatures apparently from outer space. One of the witnesses, Miguel Figueroa, approached them and reported that they were gray in color, with extremely thin bodies, large heads, pointed ears, a slit for a mouth, a tiny nose, and immense white almond-shaped eyes. As he approached in his car, Figueroa remembers that the creatures' eyes emitted blinding light beams, forcing him to stop. The small beings turned around and continued on their way, then jumped over a bridge and followed the course of a river that emptied into Laguna Cartagena, leaving behind three-toed footprints. A little later that same day, an anonymous phone call warned Figueroa to stay quiet about what he had seen, and the direction the creatures had taken, or else he could be in serious trouble; Figueroa was scared, especially because his phone number was listed under a different name than his own.

Penetration above Spain and trajectory above France, the Gulf of Gascony, to Germany (Nuremberg) in one or two minutes. (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, pp. 252-255)" but SOBEPS does not cite its sources.] An "armada" of at least 70 triangles was observed in France. These objects seemed to fall from the sky and then, once they reached 300 m from the ground, take a horizontal trajectory. (Jan Hertoghs: Humo du 24.9.1996) At the same time "400 UFOs flew over 74 French departments at the same time". 500 testimonies, including from military personnel and gendarmes, were collected. What did they see? Black masses, sometimes as long as 1 km, triangular objects 100 m in size. 75% of the witnesses affirm that these flying objects moved without noise at less than 500 m from the ground. All these testimonies were recorded in the survey "Ovni Contact" published by Franck Marie. (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "L'énigme des E.T." - ed.

#1990, November 5
France, Neuilly sur Marne
Let's start with the case of Mr. Jean Pierre Sandoux: between 18:55 and 19:02, Mr. Jean-Pierre Sandoux was on the 11th floor of a building, and he immediately went out onto the balcony to observe the phenomenon. First phase: a set of three large green points visible in the direction of south-southeast, the two lower points being below the horizon line. The witness then estimated the distance to be 50 or 100 meters, and the altitude of the phenomenon relative to the ground to be about thirty meters. This first phase lasted about 5 seconds. The set of three green lights began to rotate around its center. The witness then stood up, pulled the curtain, opened the window door, and rushed onto the balcony. Second phase: this phase lasted between 3 and a half minutes and 4 minutes. Arriving on the balcony, the witness discovered a set of 4 lights (three red and one, larger, orange). The whole was absolutely motionless; no vibration, no noise. If a structure connected the lights, the witness could not distinguish it in the darkness. Yet, it seemed to him that the phenomenon was only about thirty meters away from him, roughly at the other end of the building. To see the two red points located in the lower left corner of the triangle, he had to lean slightly on the balcony railing: these two points were roughly in the extension of the building facade, barely above the witness's eye level. Each side of the triangle was visible at an angle of 25 to 30º. The witness had time to observe the end of the truncated "beam" coming out of the orange "nozzle", downwards and to the right. Its end had the shape of a line of crenellations whose minima and maxima alternated as indicated by the arrows on the drawing, as if the beam was a juxtaposition of tubes sliding on each other, animated by a sinusoidal movement. Third phase: the whole slowly moved away towards the east, that is to say parallel to the facade of the building, in a straight line and at a constant altitude. After about thirty seconds, it disappeared in the distance, in the mist. (Joël Mesnard: LDLN 303-305-306-309-310-313-318)

FRANCE, Air Base 123, Orléans-Bricy (Loiret)
7 PM. Air Base 123 is located northwest of Orléans. It is, along with Evreux, one of the two main bases of the CoTAM (Military Air Transport Command). The planes based there are Transall and, more recently, C-130. We owe this investigation to Mr. Joël Sauvette. It was 7 PM when the technical standby team, busy closing the doors of an east-west oriented hangar, had their attention drawn to a strange phenomenon, which they all regarded with amazement. Indeed, an enormous mass, whose contours could be determined by the presence of lights on its periphery, was flying from southwest to northeast without emitting any sound. The particular shape, linked to the placement of these lights, made many of the observers believe that it was a formation of transport planes returning to their base. Only the total absence of the characteristic sound of turboprop engines made them change their minds. The observation lasted about a minute, during which the witnesses were able to detail the phenomenon: in addition to the peripheral lights, delimiting a chevron at the front and a quarter moon at the back, the inside of the silhouette was filled with small lights of lower brightness, both in the front and in the back. As for the central part, the witnesses are imprecise, and cannot say with certainty if it was the light of other small lights, or that of the stars that were lighting up in the sky. At the front and at the base of it appeared two beams of light. One of them (1 on the diagram) was somewhat reminiscent of a helicopter searchlight, as one often sees in American TV series, and the other (2) was a bit bigger than a motorcycle headlight. If the most powerful of the two beams was directed parallel to the object, the other, slightly lower and forming an angle of about 30º with the first, was directed towards the ground, as if it wanted to illuminate something very far behind its position. It should be noted that no spot of light appeared on the approach radar of the Local Airfield Control. Only the inter-base telephone conversations allowed the lookout to observe the phenomenon. The two beams of light strangely resemble those drawn by other witnesses, in particular in Brétigny-sur-Orge, where the two ladies of the rue de l'Orge specified that the thing was coming from Orléans! On the other hand, there is no very striking resemblance between the description made on Air Base 123 and the following one, although very close. (Joël Mesnard: LDLN 303-305-306-309-310-313-318)

At around 7:05 PM. The drawing of the witnesses from Olivet presents a remarkable axial symmetry. This characteristic is also found in the description provided by Mr. Jean Jacques Prévault: "It was extremely clear, perfectly symmetrical. As it made no noise, I imagined it was a glider decorated with Christmas garlands! But it had a triangular shape, it looked like the Concorde. I only saw this thing for about ten seconds, because I live in the forest, and very quickly, it was hidden by the trees. I don't even remember if all the lights were fixed or blinking. There could have been about twenty or thirty of them. As for the colors, I'm sure I saw yellow and white, but there may have also been red and green. In any case, if it wasn't a craft with lights everywhere, it was really well imitated!" The direction of movement was "south-north, or southwest-northeast". The trajectory passed to the east of the witness's position. (Joël Mesnard: LDLN 303-305-306-309-310-313-318)

At around 7 pm, a retired couple saw an enormous celestial phenomenon: a triangle shaped like a delta wing. The supposed object passed between the witnesses and Mont Valérien in the background. This mass, which was 40 cm between the hands with arms outstretched, blocked out Mont Valérien at one point. When the husband called his wife, the triangle was between Mont Valérien and the towers of La Défense (Paris) and it was only 13 cm at arm's length. This corresponds to a craft of around 500 meters in wingspan! Yet, these witnesses seem to have been the only ones to see this aerial phenomenon, even though Nanterre is the close suburb of Paris with a very high population density.

At around 7:05 PM, Mrs. Carmen Bosserelle wrote, for the readers of LDLN, the account of the observation she made with her children: "I was about to park my car in the basement, around 7 PM or 7:10 PM, when my eldest son (14 years old) called me: "Mom! Mom! Look! What is that?" I looked up. At that moment, I seemed to hear a dull humming, but I cannot affirm it. What a surprise! An enormous "device" (obviously bigger than the house) was there, just above the tops of the acacias. It was "sliding", at a very moderate speed, from southwest to northeast. It had the shape of a perfect equilateral triangle, with at each vertex a fixed light surrounded itself by other small blinking lights of light colors (white and yellowish), except for the light of the upper vertex, which was red, that's for sure. It was flying with one of the vertices in front, and from the back three or four white, distinct and fixed light beams were coming out. They were not moving, they were not blinking. It looked like the tail of a comet.<br/><br/>
Inside the "empty triangle", nothing could be seen. One of my children affirmed to have seen the sides of the "triangle", as bordered by a white halo. Me, I didn't see the sides. They were invisible. The fact of thinking of a "triangle" came only from the position of the lights. We followed it with our eyes for about one minute thirty or two minutes, maybe more. The time seemed relatively long, because it kept going on... what slowness! It seemed like it wanted us to observe it well, and from all angles... It was magnificent, with all these lights, and so impressive! It was advancing at the pace of a pedestrian, then suddenly, when it reached the height of some bushes, it turned off everything! Finished! Nothing more! Complete darkness... My children say that it made no noise. Indeed, if it was accompanied by any noise, it was a very dull noise... I don't dare to affirm it. I was dazzled by this beauty and this symphony of colors... I draw no conclusion as to the impressions we felt when this thing passed. One of the children was terrified and worried, the two others, amazed. As for me, I was in an incredible state of excitement. I didn't sleep all night...

Around 7 pm. Now a bit further south, there is a double testimony, which is quite extraordinary. It was Mr. Pierre Bosc who conducted the investigation. The witnesses, who wish to remain anonymous, and whom we will call Mr. A and Mr. B., were in a locality in the Dordogne department, located about twenty kilometers from Villefranche-de-Périgord. The sky was clear, the stars visible. There was no wind, but it was cold. Testimony of Mr. A.: "I was talking with Mr. B., in front of his house, sitting in my car with the engine running. Suddenly, Mr. B. draws my attention to a luminous formation coming from the 266º West direction. It is first a line of white lights. Some yellow ones, whose luminous intensity fluctuates. This formation progresses in silence, at low altitude, it seems, without it being possible for me to provide more precision. The appearance of this formation takes, as it advances, the shape of a triangle with rounded corners, whose sides bear white and yellow lights of variable intensity. The inside of this triangle is opaque, since it hides the stars, which remain visible all around the luminous formation. Wanting to make sure of a possible noise, I cut the contact of my car: silence! The thing is evolving at such a low altitude that, convinced that it will crash not far away, in the 80º East direction, I take the wheel again, not without having noticed, at the back of the craft, a luminous beam slightly to the right of the middle of the side. This luminous beam has the remarkable character that its light does not diffuse on the sides. It is clear, as if cut off at its end, where it has the same diameter as at its source. (...) The evolution of "the thing" was accompanied by a noise comparable to that of a flight of doves: a rustling, a light displacement of air. (Joël Mesnard: LDLN 303-305-306-309-310-313-318)

In the evening around 8:30 pm, the mother (main witness) and her three children decided to go for a walk. They were 300 m from their home when they saw a small red point seeming stationary in the sky at 40°. This point became bigger and bigger, turned orange, and stopped for a few seconds, causing one of the children (14 years old) to be afraid. The fireball moved towards the north, first slowly, then so quickly that it disappeared instantly. "The light in the ball was stationary and decreased in intensity to reveal another, smaller and more distant ball, which increased in intensity"... (...) It was at this moment that they felt a powerful but short breath, one to two seconds, and the 14-year-old child lost his balance, while the other two were also afraid now. ... (...) a central yellow and round light surrounded by a diffuse halo, a slightly curved dark structure at the back, with luminosities around the edge, three lights in the corners. In front white-yellow, in the back blue-green. A very short trail. The phenomenon made no noise. (Inforespace n° 88 p. 38 and 39)

At 1:15am, a farmer observed a dirty gray parallelepiped 20 x 10 x 4 meters in size, with two 2-meter diameter white headlights resembling large tops at the front, spaced apart from the structure; two headlights at the back. The object moved at 5 km/h at a low altitude (thirty meters) and all the lights were blinking. (Franck Boitte, Inforespace n° 85 p. 40)
1:15am, single witness. The object passed over him and over the house at about 30 m. altitude. It took up the entire width. The shape was rectangular, 20 m. long, 10 m. wide and 4 m. high. The front headlights were at mid-height of the object and each measured 2 meters in diameter. The outer blue lights were not part of the mass but protruded. The appearance of the object itself was gray and dirty. The witness was very impressed by the absence of noise and the lightness of the movement for such an imposing mass. The witness also described the top of the object as a cap held to the lower part by large rivets. At the back two white headlights were seen, identical to those observed at the front. During the entire observation, the witness noted that the lights were pulsing. Then the object turned 90° to the right, turned off all its lights, then started at a lightning speed to disappear into the night.

17:50, 2 witnesses. "At the front of the craft, as if coming from inside, two beams of very intense light, comparable in intensity to the light of an electronic flash or a strobe light. This light did not disperse but remained concentrated, as if channeled by two imaginary tubes. At the back, a third yellowish light, less intense, was directed towards the ground and at times seemed to move around an axis. Below the craft, towards the center of this imposing triangular surface, small red lights arranged like on the surface of a disk, blinked in a disordered way. They did not seem to be firmly attached to the craft, but rather seemed to be suspended under it." Dimensions of the craft: approximately 25 m x 10 m.

At 0:07, the controllers of the long-range radar station in Kuybyshev saw a spot appear on their screens, estimated to be about 100 km away. They later described the spot as being comparable to that of a strategic bomber. The automatic and electronic identification system stopped working. Two and a half minutes after its first appearance, the large spot scattered into a multitude of small returns. They were then less than 40 km from the station and the largest one had begun to take the shape of a triangular object and was now heading straight for the radar post. As it approached, a team of soldiers wanted to go out and see what it was: the thing flew past them, less than 9 meters away, as they stepped outside. Then it stopped and began hovering about 90 meters away, behind a barbed wire fence less than 45 meters away from a mobile row of short-range radars, known as post number 12. There was a flash and the twin antennas caught fire. Soon after, the upper antenna collapsed. All the metal parts of the antennas of post 12 had melted. The mysterious triangle seen was described as black and smooth, not like a mirror, but like a thick layer of soot. The sides of the object were about 14 m long and it was nearly 3 m thick. There were no openings or portholes. It continued to hover for about 90 minutes after destroying the radar. Then it set off and completely disappeared into the night. (“Dossiers Ovni” - ed.

End of 1990 or beginning of 1991. (source: conference of Dr Johannes Fiebag, Germany) Hans-Joerg was a merchant. At the end of 1990 or beginning of 1991, he was living with his partner, something was happening to him that made him panic in fear of the darkness, in his own apartment. One night, he woke up and saw a small man pass by him. "He was about one meter tall and was wearing something like a hat. He wasn't looking at me, but kept going to the corner of the room, where there was no door. There, he disappeared. I didn't dare wake up my partner and almost didn't dare breathe. However, in the morning, she found me curled up in the bed. My fear paralyzed me so much that I stayed like that, curled up, unable to even speak, for hours."

Two large, very powerful blue headlights were directed towards the ground. The object seemed to have portholes. The entire structure was clearly visible, it had a raw metal look. The witness spoke of bolted construction and a gray-blue color, like Tefal. Three white lights were visible at the back. All the lights were fixed. Other neon-like lamps were visible on the edge, sometimes long, sometimes short. The movement was stable and regular. A sound of a small muffled engine could be clearly heard. Distance 100 meters, size of 30 to 50 meters in diameter. At 7:55 PM two independent testimonies (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, p. 257, 258 and sketch, 259; VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 212)

Shortly after 11 pm, Vidar Gjosund and his wife saw through the living room window a gigantic thing, with 4 bright yellow and green lights, seeming to fly very slowly. They rushed into the veranda and saw the phenomenon better as it approached, in complete silence. The lights were square-shaped and each one had 4 distinct lights. They were fixed on a very dark circular surface which seemed to be part of an undefinable structure. They estimated that this thing flew over the house at an altitude of 500 to 700m, and they ran to another window on the opposite side to see the phenomenon move away towards Romslo. It was then 11:07 pm. (Menz Kaarbo - Ufo-Norway News)

Between 8:20 and 8:25 PM, a driver accompanied by his wife and two children stopped their car to better observe what the youngest had just exclaimed: "Mom, look, it looks like a UFO!".
The object was at a low altitude, about 50 m, and seemed to be motionless above a farm no more than 150 m away. It was a triangular structure with well-defined contours and a light at each angle. The only relief was a flat glass dome attached to the underside which was then inclined towards the witnesses.
Wingspan of 15 to 20 m. The object began to move and turned towards Tongres. The witnesses had no difficulty following it for a few kilometers until the Momalle crossroads, where they took the highway towards Liège. (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, p. 260, 261)

Between 8:00 and 8:30 PM, Mrs. S was watching television when she saw a strong light moving in her direction. This light was in the lower part of the bay window. It seemed to come from the east and was soon directly above the house at an altitude of less than 300 m. Mrs. S called her son and husband. The object had the shape of a dark gray triangle, large like a Boeing. At each apex was a blinking red light. The object tilted, made a sharp turn and disappeared towards Huy. For a few seconds, the three witnesses saw the profile of the craft. They counted between 7 and 12 lit rectangles, like lit windows of an airplane. Towards the front, above the object, Mrs. S saw for a brief moment a white lamp. The son noted the silhouette of a second thickness on the bottom, forming like a longer slice than the first, which suggested to him that it might be two superimposed triangles. A faint monotonous sound similar to that of a turbine was heard when Mr. S went out to follow the craft with his eyes. (VOB 1 - SOBEPS 1991, pp. 261, 262 and sketch)

A large white light, but also a more or less oval shape. The contours were clear. The light produced by the craft was dazzling. It sometimes swayed from left to right. I was able to distinguish a bump on the upper part, like a dome, but not lit. The large white light illuminated the ground. It moved away slowly, leaned and then flew away at a faster speed.

A UFO made an appearance above a sensitive site in Leningrad: an unidentified target remained on the radar screens between 4 pm and 4:20 pm. The object was making chaotic movements just above the atomic research reactor in the vicinity of Gatchina. It is interesting to note that a potentially catastrophic incident occurred at this site in 1991. Kotochigov (the radar operator from the Pulkovo control tower) told me that the UFO left the area at a speed of approximately 2,243 km/h (Timothy GOOD: "E.T. Connection" 1993 Trad.

In the night, between 2:45 and 2:50 the witness was awoken by a feeling of presence, although he is not usually subject to insomnia. Glancing out the window, he was surprised to not see any stars. He got up, opened the curtains of the closed window: very low, at the level of the roofs he saw a generally rectangular shape whose front was hidden by the ridge of the house opposite (13 m high this house). This shape moved slowly, seeming to follow a downward inclined trajectory towards the Woluwe valley. On the underside the witness thought he could make out added pieces, sort of plates or cubic casemates, of a lighter color than the rest of the surface, a grayish anthracite. This object had a thickness (30 m long, 15 to 22 m wide, elevation 25 m, speed less than 20 km/h), but nowhere was there any light or halo. However he heard a continuous whistling "like ultrasound close to ultra-auditory frequencies or hyperfrequencies beyond 12 KHz" (he is an electronics engineer). Wanting to wake his wife he noticed she was deeply asleep and he was unable to move: he attributed this to the whistling. To convince himself he wasn't dreaming he did some simple mental calculations and pinched himself. When the whistling was no longer audible he was again free to move. (...) He climbed into a small attic and still saw the object moving away to the ESE, presenting a 3/4 profile. The witness diverted his attention to the right, then back to the craft, which had suddenly disappeared without a trace. (investigation by Franck Boitte for SOBEPS)

Great Britain, Rushton, Staffs.
(Investigation by Doug Pickford of the "Green Dragon" ufology group of Staffordshire) The testimony comes from a well-known entrepreneur in the region and he insists on the strictest anonymity. In the evening this witness was returning from Chester from a business dinner where he had only drunk coffee. He was returning home by quiet secondary roads from Congleton to Leek, near Rushton, north of Rudyard Lake, when the effects of so much coffee drunk during the evening forced him to stop to relieve himself. It was 1:30 in the morning and he was near Bridestones - with its standing stones. He had no interest in archaeology and had never visited these places, although he knew they existed. The sky was still quite clear and he could clearly see the silhouettes of the standing stones from his stopping place. However, above them shone a light, like a giant torch, which illuminated the whole area. For a moment he wondered if he should go and take a closer look, but then a shower of golden sparks like those of a firework appeared, so he thought there were probably drugged people there and it was better to withdraw. He returned to his car, but it would not start: the engine seemed dead. He tried again and again, nothing worked. So he got out with the intention of lifting the hood, but at that moment he saw that the light above the menhirs, in the form of a golden ball, came towards him. He watched this ball with a certain surprise mixed with fear. The light passed over him with such intensity that it hurt his eyes. He lost all consciousness. He came to himself, lying on the ground, under a group of trees, about 600 meters from the road and the place where the car was. He was extremely disoriented and was aware of only two things: when the light was closest, he started running in a panic of fear. Through the brambles, hurting himself cruelly on the thorns, and hitting a tree full on. When he had the courage to look up, the luminous object had disappeared and the region was calm. It was then that he realized his state: he was still wearing his trousers, but no shirt or shoes. Automatically he rubbed the trousers, full of dust, and golden sparks fell from them, like static electricity. The return journey to the car, less precipitous, was still as painful through the bushes and brambles. He found the car, door open, key in the ignition, and on the ground, a small bundle: his shirt and shoes. He put them on and had a feeling as if they were very hot. He desperately hoped the engine would start: it did, on the first try. The dashboard clock showed that it was now 03:05... When he arrived home, he explained his delay to his wife as being caused by a road accident. He did not want to talk to her about the event. Knowing Doug for fifteen years, and knowing he was involved in ufology, he finally confided in him, making him swear not to divulge anything that could lead to his identification.

Truck driver Steve Hallett was driving on the A7 National Road in the Selkirk region, not far from a television antenna, when he was surprised to see a huge, disc-shaped, illuminated object in the sky right in front of him. Its diameter was estimated to be about 13 m. The object had colored lights and apparently a dome at its top. The needles on the gauges inside the truck went wild. Steve stopped the engine and, fascinated, watched the UFO for about fifteen seconds before it disappeared into the night at an astonishing speed. This report was sent to me by John Hay of St Mary's Loch, Selkirk, who had noted the interview of Steve Hallett by Jill McPherson on Radio Borders the day after the incident. (Timothy GOOD: "E.T.

Ytturia Garza: It was the day of the last total solar eclipse of the century. Mexico was one of the countries where this natural phenomenon could be observed very clearly. Scientists, television stations and all ordinary Mexicans were ready to film it. A few minutes before the eclipse appeared, at a good distance under the sun and to the right, an object of metallic and disc-like appearance. The device made no noise and moved hardly. Most scientists and cameramen had all their attention on the sun and did not see anything. But those from the Televisa television station had noticed it and published the photo in the evening newspaper. Then other video images appeared, some of Mexicans who, while waiting for the eclipse, filmed a little at random. These images were taken in the municipalities around Mexico City, which consolidated the testimony. When the computer analyses showed that it was a solid object, we knew that it was a real UFO in the Mexican sky. Since then the media have not let go of the subject.

At night, Mrs. Marisol Camacho, a young woman, received an unexpected visit, to say the least, from two strange creatures at her home: "I was sleeping when around 2 o'clock in the morning, I heard strange noises outside, near the balcony. I got up and went to the window. Someone was mumbling in an incomprehensible gibberish. I opened the blinds very quietly and - Oh! Lord! - there were two of the strangest creatures you could imagine standing there, on my balcony! They were examining my flower pots, and more particularly my Quezo Suizo (Swiss cheese whose scientific name is Monsterosa deliciosa, a tropical vine that can take gigantic dimensions and whose alveolate leaves are pierced with holes like so many portholes) They were cutting leaves and exchanging comments. They seemed literally fascinated by this plant. On my side, I was just as surprised and - curiously - I could no longer move. I was paralyzed, and, too, fascinated. These creatures had a size of about 1.20 m, with large skulls, egg-shaped, rounded at the top and more pointed at the chin. They were very emaciated and all gray, and also completely naked. The eyes were black and very elongated on each side of the head, without pupil and without white part like us. The faces were flat, with a small slit for the mouth, without lips, and two small holes for the nose. Not for a single moment did I feel fear - I was simply amazed by what I saw; It was like children... Their arms were longer than ours, and their long bony hands had only four slender fingers. These creatures did not seem to notice me at the window. They took two leaves from my plant and left, still chattering in this kind of senseless gibberish. They walked slowly towards the Laguna Cartagena, sank into the thicket at the end of the street and disappeared. I couldn't believe my eyes. (...) After their departure, I could move again. I went back to bed and later I told this scene to my husband. (see continuation on 28/8/91) (Timothy GOOD: "E.T. Connection" 1993 Trad. Presses de la Cité 1994 p. 250)

Argentina, La Matanza (Victoria)
Around the same time, in the "Esuela Hogar General San Martin" boarding school across the road, night watchmen and students saw a bright object land 200 meters from the refectory. They went out and approached it to within 40 meters. There the children and watchmen saw three humanoids come out of the craft. These beings seemed to float a few centimeters off the ground, while staying very close to their ship. There were no other details: the object dazzled the sight of all the witnesses, so much so that they thought they were seeing "spirits" while feeling great anguish. The sound of a truck on the road made the object and entities disappear. The next morning they found no trace of the landing and the management thought it was a case of collective hallucination. However, a week later the trace appeared, but 200 meters further! It had the shape of an elongated horseshoe 25m long and 15m wide, compacting the ground in depth as if a huge weight had weighed on it, with three deeper imprints still.

Belgium, Soignies
Around midnight, four young people aged 19 to 24 were on the Place du Jeu de Balle when suddenly two, then three strong white lights illuminated the place as if it were broad daylight. The three sources of bright light each measured between 1 m and 1.50 m in diameter, spaced 6 to 15 m apart in a triangular arrangement. The altitude was estimated to be 20 meters and the distance 60 meters. No breath, no sound, no smell, no smoke. In the center of the configuration a fixed blue light. The white lights sparkled like the mirror balls you see in dance halls. (VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 20, 21)

Two weeks later, the extraterrestrials returned to Marisol's (cf. 13/8/91). "Just like last time, it was late," she told us. "First, I recognized the same strange noises; I jumped out of bed and ran to the window, which was only half-closed; it was indeed the same little creatures again! (...) they were still examining my plants in every detail, mumbling among themselves. This time, I could move and I tried to say something to them. I started to pull the curtains, but the creatures heard the noise; they turned towards me, gave me a quick look and ran away at full speed towards the lagoon where, just like last time, they disappeared.

#1991, late August
USA, Cuesta Blanca (Puerto Rico)
Ulises Perez was riding his motorcycle on the dirt road that crossed a large farm in the Cuesta Blanca area, between Parguera and Laguna Cartagena. It was 11:30 PM and it was in the last days of August 1991: "...I was riding, and all of a sudden my motorcycle nose-dived into a puddle. The engine stalled and died. I was trying to see what I could do and after, supposedly, solving my problem, I revved the engine. At least I tried...that's when my gaze fell on the irrigation canal - and that's where I saw the thing. I saw something that was sitting or crouching on a log, next to a tree. The creature seemed to have a raw skin - you know, like when you cut a thickness of skin and at the cut the flesh appears white with pink spots. That's what it looked like. A whitish skin, very pale, like that of some salamanders. We looked at each other for a moment, without moving. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was scared and that I tried to start my bike again. But as soon as I made a move, the thing jumped into the canal water and disappeared. I even saw its feet disappear under the water lilies. My motorcycle started again...and so did I.

USA, Loudon (New Hampshire)
At 7:30 pm, a woman was driving home with her daughter (6 years old) and son (10 years old). As the car entered the driveway leading to their house, the car radio suddenly started emitting loud static, so loud that it had to be turned off. The mother parked the car in the driveway and immediately went into the house to let the dog out. That's when the daughter called her mother outside. The children had their noses in the air and were looking at two huge white discs passing just above the roof of the house. The two discs were similar in shape and in the configuration of their lighting. All around, there was a ramp of multicolored lights, in pastel tones, blinking apparently randomly. Under the belly of the discs, three dark circles could be seen in a triangular formation towards the back. Each disc had the dimensions of a small house and they were moving side by side. A very faint buzzing could barely be heard. The mother estimated the altitude of the two objects to be around 30 or 35 meters. Their brightness was such that the woman could perfectly make out what was on the ground as they moved away in the direction of Canterbury.

#1991, September 28
Belgium, Brussels (Berchem Ste Agathe)
Observation between 0:35 and 0:45. J.P. went out as usual with the two dogs, going around the house to the back garden. The dogs didn't follow him as usual and huddled against a wall; in the back of the garden a mist floated above the garages at 60 m from him, and from behind the garages a sun-like light rose slowly and three spots appeared. The very wide light ensemble rose slowly and the triangular object stayed still at 7 m altitude, diffusing light in all directions. The mist above the garages gradually dissipated, the ensemble rose, and a central rotating beam appeared. After the stillness, the ascending movement resumed. The central beam operated a circular sweep, sometimes interrupted by other non-circular movements and moments of stillness. The ensemble stopped at 18 m altitude and the craft moved horizontally OSO. The speed seemed to be less than 1 km/h. The central beam stopped at a precise point in the bushes, the witness was caught in the beam of light and felt all his hairs stand on end: the distance between the craft and the witness was 25 to 30 m. The phenomenon continued on its route, approaching the square and entering an area lit by public lighting. The spots decreased in intensity (as if regulated by a regulator), the central spot went out and in its place the witness saw a crown of small multicolored lights that lit up and went out simultaneously. At this moment the witness saw the structure better: "It was all black, immense, it had red-orange reflections". He estimated the length of each side to be 20 m. At constant speed the phenomenon was in front of a four-story building at the corner of Rue des Combattants and Avenue Josse Goffin. The object stopped in front of the building. There, it pivoted at an angle of about 90°, it accelerated and disappeared behind the houses. At the back the witness saw a small flame similar to that of blowtorches and when it accelerated he heard a faint whistling sound like "psst.." Secondary effects: for two weeks the vegetation that had been illuminated by the phenomenon grew in an unusual way; the next day the dogs were taken by fear, whimpered and stayed glued to their master's legs, this lasted three days and the witness himself had feelings of unease; the witness has restless sleep compensated by long periods of daytime sleep, he has considerably lost weight, feels weak and has barricaded himself at home devouring one book after another about UFOs, he also had a rather particular nightmare. (note from vog: first investigation by Mrs. Claire Hauzeur. One year later counter-investigation by Franck Boitte: the witness did not contradict himself in any way, while the counter-investigation came unexpectedly) (VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, pp. 22 to 25 and 187)

Belgium, Brussels-Forest
Andrée V., a retired employee, and her mother Suzanne D. observe something from 5:00 to 6:10 in the morning. Andrée gets up and goes to the toilet, which is outside. When she comes out into the courtyard, she sees the house in front of her extended as if by a huge, triangular, luminous building. The base is more than 5m25, and the height is about 8m. Held at arm's length, the base measures 11cm, which is nearly 30 times the diameter of a full moon. The mass is dotted with a multitude of luminous rectangles, which appear to be 1/6 the size of a normal house window. The rectangles blink in an irregular, unsynchronized way, and the light is a red-orange that is difficult to look at. At 10m, a point of light bigger than a star but smaller than the moon is also dotted with blinking lights. Andrée wakes up her mother, and both of them observe this extraordinary event, which illuminates the garden and the inside of the house. They go about their various activities, and at 6 o'clock they notice that the phenomena have decreased in size: they are beginning to disappear, rising up into the sky.

Israel, Beit She'an
"It was a bright object, huge compared to other objects that could be seen in the sky at that time," said the local police chief who had come to see a UFO above the city of Israel. District Superintendent Yitzhak Mordechai told the army radio that it was a taxi driver who first informed him of the sighting. It was about 3:30 in the morning. The driver, Yossi Ben-Ha'ash, said the object looked like a half-elliptical light.
"We went to the scene and, indeed, we saw the object that we tried to follow eastward," Mordechai said. "It was about 200 meters above the ground and it lasted until the early hours of the day. Around 6 in the morning, it disappeared." (...) (Jerusalem Post, November 7, 1991) (Timothy GOOD: "E.T. Connection" 1993 Trad. Presses de la Cité 1994 p.274) Shortly before 3 o'clock in the morning, Yossi Ben Maos, in a taxi outside the town of Bet Shean, in the Jezreel Valley, about halfway between Haifa and Tiberius, saw a strange "vehicle" with a beautiful illumination, crossing the road at 150 meters. (...) The object stops and remains hovering above the industrial area of Bet Shean. That's where Yossi finds a phone and calls the police, who are quickly on the scene. Chief Inspector Yitzhak Mordechai is also alerted at his home, waking him up. He orders to alert the army, the border guards, and the local kibbutzim. When Mordechai arrives on the scene, the area is already full of armed men. The UFO at this moment, slowly sets off in the direction of Jordan, dragging a whole military convoy on the ground behind him. Upon reaching the border, the UFO turns back towards Israel. After half an hour of this kind of chase, at 150 meters above Kibbutz Maoz Chaim. On the ground, a hundred armed men, believing they were dealing with terrorists. At five o'clock in the morning someone gave the order to shoot. Shots were heard from everywhere. The next day the police blamed the army, and vice versa, for ordering the attack. The object was not damaged, however. An hour later, at sunrise, the object rose and disappeared from view. The observation had therefore lasted more than three hours. The next day Mordechai held an honest press conference. As he was about to leave, the object was first 200 m from the ground, it began to swing and turn on itself, once well stabilized in this position, it stopped and remained there, suspended.

At 4:05 in the morning, Thierry M. drove his car out of the garage to go to work at the post office in Arlon. When he looked up, he saw an enormous light: a long metallic fuselage with lots of lights like portholes, yellow, green, and red. The object was motionless. As he drove towards Arlon, he saw the object cross the sky above the road at Houdemont. (VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 32)

Belgium, near Arlon
At around 4:10 AM Michel L., another witness, while driving towards Arlon suddenly saw through his windshield a large fuselage without wings, full of yellow lights, moving slowly towards the south-southeast. While driving he still turned his head but the object was quickly hidden by the trees. Duration of this brief observation: 15 seconds. (VOB 2 - SOBEPS 1994, p. 32)

Belgium, Alleur (Liège)
Jean Marc Hauglustaine, 1st MDL in the Verviers gendarmerie district,
in a car with his wife and two children observed a phenomenon
apparently motionless suspended at 50 m altitude at the vertical
of a bridge on the left side of the E 40. The general shape suggests a
winged craft of about twenty meters in wingspan and whose upper part
has a fairly massive volume evoking a kind of
fuselage. At the front a windshield or a cockpit of more or less
rectangular shape lit from the inside with a bright white yellowish light.
Further back four powerful white lights each emitting a beam
towards the ground, towards the center a series of 4 or 5 lights emitting a
tinted orange light. (...) Suddenly, scattered over the entire surface
of the device, countless small flashing red lights appear. Then the object marks a backward movement to go
forward like a rocket, making a turn on the wing to the
left. Total duration of the observation: 7 minutes. (Inforespace n° 83, p.

Belgium, Rosières (Brabant)
Claude H., a postal worker working the night shift, and his driver M.P. saw, from the E 411 shortly before the La Hulpe exit 3, an object that did not look like an airplane, seeming to come from Tombeek and moving quickly perpendicularly to the road axis. It was around 3:15. The craft was enormous and clearly visible, moving at an altitude between 50 and 75 meters, was triangular with rounded edges, black, measuring 30 to 40 meters across. The witnesses observed 6 dim white, powerful lights, without a beam, one light in each corner and one in the middle of each side. Each light was directed in the direction of movement with an angle of 30° relative to the surface of the craft. In the center was a kind of hatch whose diameter was larger than that of the lights. This hatch was lit with dim, powerful red lights around its perimeter. The witness estimated the size of the object to be 2.5 times that of a Jumbo jet. No lights were blinking and despite the presence of the moon in front of the witnesses, no projection was observed. The witness had the impression of being in front of an immense camera with a huge red lens. Once the craft had crossed the road, its departure was lightning-fast in the direction of Genval.

#1991, December 5
Belgium, Erbisoeul (Hainaut)
Very long observation which began at 6:10 PM and did not end until around 7:30 PM. The first witnesses were Mrs. Laporte and her daughter Isabelle. Driving on the RN 56 Mons-Ath, the driver observed an unusual light in the sky which she showed to her daughter. It was like a Christmas ball, bigger than a star, moving little. Upon arriving in Jurbise, Mrs. L. did some shopping and Isabelle stayed in the car, studying her English exam. Looking up, she saw a "plane" flying low in the sky from south to north, with lots of small lights and pipes on the underside, like those of a power plant, with bends. This craft made no noise and seemed to hover a few tens of meters. But at that moment Isabelle did not seem to be aware of seeing anything other than a plane.
Shortly after, the witnesses left Jurbise on Rue Champs des Bois, and they saw three "enormous platines" as big as house gables, in the shape of a lozenge. They headed towards the D. farm and it was then, in the company of Mr. D., his daughter and his 15-year-old grandson, that the 5 witnesses together saw 30 or 40 red-purple or white luminous balls arrive, which gradually took on the shape of a lozenge as they approached, flying at 50 or 60 meters altitude. On the median they had rectangular portholes with a yellowish light inside. These craft, as big as helicopters, made a slight noise like a "kitchen hood". The spectacle lasted until around 7:30 PM. Strangely enough, seen from the underside or in profile, these things always had exactly the same appearance and the binoculars provided few other details.

Another encounter near Laguna Cartagena was reported by Eleuterio Acosta, an 80-year-old trustworthy man who lives in the Olivares area, right in front of the radar installation. He said that one day he was surrounded by five of these small gray creatures when he entered his house. He faced them with a stick, shouted, and a sixth creature, larger this time, appeared, and all together they jumped out of a window and ran away quickly towards Sierra Bermeja. (Timothy GOOD: "E.T.

ISRAEL, Burgata
A 11-year-old boy of Yemeni origin disappeared on his way back from school to his father's house. He finally returned late at night and found his parents in a state close to hysteria. He had no explanation for his delay and could not remember what had happened in the hours before his return home. Two weeks later, his memories returned in a jumble. Giants had caught him and taken him to their lair. He had undergone a medical examination and something was surgically placed in his arm, near his wrist. His parents quickly took the boy to the clinic where, indeed, something was removed from that spot. The father then ordered the family never to speak of the incident again.
