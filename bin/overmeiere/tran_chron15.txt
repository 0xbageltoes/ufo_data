At the same time, the X-15, another rocket-powered aircraft, helped to better understand the problems of flight in this still poorly explored zone, which no longer belonged entirely to aeronautics and not yet completely to space. The first X-15, released from a B-52 bomber, made its first free flight in 1959. (continued June 1962) ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, p. 162)

The experiment was attempted by the Russians. They launched "Lunik I" towards the Moon, but the craft missed its target, passing about 7000 km from the lunar surface and continuing on its route. It eventually fell under the influence of the Sun and was condemned to perpetual orbit as a planet. (following September 12, 1959) (Astronautics - Pierre Rousseau, Hachette 1965, p. 53) Let us cite the measurements taken by the space probe "Lunik I". At first glance, the number of 26 impacts recorded in 36 hours of interplanetary flight per square meter of exposed surface may seem alarming. But the meteorite detector was in this case sensitive to the shock of masses of the order of a millionth of a gram... (...) It has become a planet of the Sun under the name of "Metchta" (Dream) ("Conquest of Space" - Thomas de Galiana, ed. Larousse Pocket, 1967, p. 33 and 235)

POLAND, Gdynia
Dock workers at the Gdynia port see a glowing object fall into the middle of the harbor basin and their description is so precise that the exact location of where it fell can be determined. The maritime authorities then send three divers who enter the icy water and first announce that their search is hampered by a thick cloud of mud. They eventually manage to surface with a metal piece. After being previously examined by the Polish Navy, the piece was sent to the Gdynia Polytechnic University. (...) Several days after the glowing object plunged into the port waters, men assigned to guard the surrounding beaches stumbled upon a strange figure: a kind of man crawling, completely exhausted, on the sand. This creature spoke no known language and was dressed in a kind of uniform. Part of his face and hair seemed burned. He was brought to the University hospital where he was kept in isolation and examined. But it soon became clear that it was impossible to undress this creature because the uniform had no means of opening: it was not made of a usual substance such as wool or fabric, but of a metal that could only be cut with special tools and after much effort. The doctors noted that the organs of their patient were very different from ours: the circulatory system was completely new to them and the number of fingers and toes was not normal. The creature remained alive until a kind of bracelet was removed from him. The remains were then sent to the USSR for further examination. The Polish ufologists quickly established a link between the metal object and the creature on the one hand and UFOs and everything related to them on the other.

Horst Raps, 26 years old, is taking a walk (on medical prescription, he suffers from his lungs) Around 8 pm he sees a light descending from the sky. He approaches it and sees a shining object hovering one meter above the ground. It is a saucer of blue and purple light, topped with a dome that sends out beams of light. Fascinated, he sees a staircase come out and a large humanoid figure in multicolored uniform appears. The apparition speaks correct German and comes to warn the witness of great dangers. It sets a rendezvous and forces him to return to the same place three days later. (continued April 1, 59) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

In flight, between Alma Ata (Kazakhstan) and Moscow (USSR)
A TU 104 was flying normally when suddenly a glow was noticed inside the passenger cabin, near the corridor leading to the cockpit. This glow suddenly took on a solid form, becoming a luminous disc about 50 cm in diameter. It remained motionless in a vertical position. The passengers were alarmed, someone shouted "Fire!" A pilot from the crew immediately came with an extinguisher, but he saw neither fire nor object, as it had disappeared! The situation had just returned to normal when, suddenly, the object reappeared! Slowly it moved through the cabin, from window to window. Paralyzed by fear, the passengers did not make the slightest movement. After making its inspection tour, the disc returned to its initial position and vanished forever.

Excerpt from notes taken by Reverend Gill:
Time: 6:45 PM. Sky: some low cloud formations. Saw a bright white
light to the northwest. 6:50 PM: called Steven and Eric. Steven arrives,
confirms, not a star. 6:55 PM sent Eric to get people. Object at the
top moving - a man? Now three men, moving, luminous, doing something
on the bridge. Gone. 7 PM: men, 1 then again 2. 7:04 PM gone again.
7:10 PM cloud cover at 600m altitude. Man 1, 3, 4, 2 (appeared in
this order), thin blue electric projector. Men gone, projector still
there. 7:12 PM men 1 and 2 reappeared, blue projector. 7:20 PM
projector off, men gone. 7:20 PM UFO passes through a cloud. 8:28 PM
sky cleared above, big cloud above Dogura. Saw UFO up high. Called
people from the station. Seemed to be descending, growing bigger. 8:50
PM new cloud formation. Big UFO stationary. Others going back and
forth in the clouds. When they descend through a cloud, the light
reflects off the cloud like a big halo - no more than 600m, probably
less. All UFOs very distinct. The "mother" ship still big, distinct,
stationary. 9:05 PM cloud formations, numbers 2, 3, 4 gone. 9:10 PM
number 1 gone above us in a cloud. 9:20 PM "mother" back. 9:30 PM
"mother" gone, crossing the sea towards Giwa. 9:46 PM UFO reappears
above us, hovering. 10 PM still stationary. 10:10 PM hovering, gone
behind a cloud. 10:30 PM very high hovering in a break in the sky
between clouds. 10:50 PM very cloudy, no sign of UFO. 11:04 PM heavy
rain.<br/><br/>
The following night they returned (...) It was still luminous and
sparkling, but it seemed closer and clearer. And then there was this
figure on the bridge, well that's what I call the top. And it was the
teacher who said: "I wonder if it's going to land on the playground".
I replied: "Why not?" And then we made big signs - Hello, Hello! - and
you can imagine how surprised we were when they returned our signals.
And then Eric who was still with me - he never left me - and another
boy waved their arms and the figures also waved both arms in response.

The Argentine Navy was perplexed in not being able to identify a submarine.
It had the shape of a huge fish (it might have been a huge fish!) with a wide tail like the stabilizer of a B 17. It moved and maneuvered very quickly.

Mrs. Frederich Moreland was crossing a paddock to milk her cows. She looked up and noticed a bright green light among the clouds. (...) she saw two large intense green lights quickly descending from the sky. (...) Everything was bathed in this green light described as "sticky and horrible". (...) She took shelter behind some trees planted in the middle of the paddock (...) It was then that she realized that the two green lights were part of a large bell-shaped object that was emitting a strong heat. The object stabilized at the height of the roof of the house. The witness estimated its wingspan to be about 10 m. She heard a low humming. Two rows of openings located on the middle part of the craft emitted orange glows. The lower part, on the other hand, had a metallic green color. Suddenly the portholes went out. The top of the dome-shaped object made of a material as clear as glass lit up and Mrs. Moreland clearly distinguished two men wearing shiny costumes (...) the material of these uniforms had the shine of aluminum or silver paper. Their faces were covered with a translucent mask. One of the beings stood up and seemed to look at something specific inside the craft. Then he sat down next to his companion. Then the openings on the side of the object emitted orange flames, the craft tilted slightly and shot into the sky where it disappeared with a soft noise that seemed sharp to the amazed witness.

At 5am a gigantic UFO slowly descended towards the earth and stopped 65m above the head of police officer Robert Dickerson. After a few minutes the object rose and flew over the airport, stopping again to the northeast of the landing field. Wertz from air security and other officials followed the object with binoculars, its radiation now less intense: at the circumference of the disk they saw yellow, red and green beams of light. At 05:10 fighter jets took off from Portland base, while Klamath radar operators were already observing the object. The Redmond employees heard the fighters arrive, and as soon as they dived towards the object, the light beams disappeared, but intense radiation came from its lower part and the object suddenly rose as if catapulted into the sky. One of the fighters narrowly avoided a collision. Three others tried in vain to chase it. (Johannes von BUTLAR: "UFO, We Are Not Alone" - Presses de la Cité 1979 - pp. 141-144)

Retired policeman Cavalheiro Mendes, alone in his cottage, sat down on the terrace at around 00:15. After 5 minutes he felt a fear that intensified so much that he felt uncomfortable, while a heat oppressed him in general but especially on his face. His hair stood on end. He wanted to go inside, but as soon as he stood up he headed towards a small path, crossed the fence: his will seemed dominated by an unknown force. Barefoot he walked, until he reached the beach, he felt weak, wanted to sit down but felt compelled to stagger forward. He then noticed at 150 m an orange glow of a lenticular craft. At 20 m from the craft appeared a male human bust, with large protruding eyes, tanned skin, no beard, straight blond hair combed back. The bust wore a coarse lead-colored jacket with a high collar, without closures or pockets. When he arrived close to the bust the being inclined his head to the left and right and smiled. A kind of banal telepathic conversation ensued. With his arm he made a circular gesture to the right, open hand, fingers joined. In the direction indicated the witness saw a small man of about 1m60 heading towards the craft and disappearing from view. Then the witness heard the sound of the latch of the fence and all of a sudden regained his normal state: it was 01:30. (Inforespace n° 34 p. 24, 25)

He saw it rise and realized he was only about a hundred meters away from it. Almost immediately, he and his wife saw, on the right side of the road, in the light of the headlights, a mass the size of a large bag of potatoes that quickly shrank, seeming to collapse in on itself. He then saw, as well as his wife, a number of these light gray-brown masses, smaller than the first, moving around in the grass. At least two of them crossed the road and disappeared into the ferns.

"As we were driving in a break to the evening service, Friday (January 29, 1960), an oblong thing, similar to a torpedo or a giant cigar, suddenly crossed the road, at man's height, in front of the horse, without the latter being frightened, which is really strange," wrote to her niece Mrs. Marie Morgenthaler, from Ursenbach in Emmental. "The envelope of this kind of torpedo seemed to be composed of horizontal colored and luminous bands," she specified. "The colors were moving and I had never seen such before this apparition. I have the feeling that they are not from this Earth. The torpedo arrived through the fields: it looked like a vehicle beacon. The thing then passed between two farms that border the road, and it was only at the moment when it emerged in front of us that we saw what it was. And imagine that this torpedo silently entered the side of the hill, on the other side of the road."

Edgar Schedelbauer, a war-wounded reporter, managed to take the most unusual photograph known as the "Leibnitz Spider". He was returning home on his motorcycle at 1:30 in the morning when an illuminated object appeared above the edge of the forest in the east, flew over the clearing, crossed the road and began to loop over the sloping terrain. It also briefly presented its upper part, which had the shape of an overturned bowl, orange in color. The alarming thing approached and remained motionless for 6 or 7 seconds. Schedelbauer, who had thrown his motorcycle into the ditch, clearly felt a thermal radiation and heard a machine noise. Crouching in the ditch, he managed to adjust his camera and capture this extraordinary moment on film. Suddenly, the hovering object above his head emitted a whistle similar to that of a jet engine, rose and quickly moved away to the east.

An electronics engineer who was night fishing, heard a shrill whistle and saw a round object with a rotating light land on the shore. Through an opening, two dwarves with abnormally large heads emerged with a hose and pumped water from the river. Later they appeared to be playing like children. Their bodies sparkled with changing colored lights. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 101)

Or early May. M. Germain Tichit, a baker, was kneading dough around 2 o'clock in the morning. He heard an unusual noise at the same time he saw flashes of all colors through the window. He went to the doorstep and in the middle of the sloping field was an object in the shape of a spinning top, 10 to 15 m in diameter and 5 m high. The central pivot looked like a bellows that inflated to give the object a horizontal plate on the sloping ground. A metallic cutting sound on top of the noise of the object itself caused a staircase to lower beneath the right side of the object and a small humanoid descended the three steps, stepped onto the ground and advanced. The small being was well built, rather handsome, wearing small boots, dressed in tight trousers and a jacket buttoned in front, gray-green in color, and wearing a helmet similar to that of a fireman of the same color as the jacket. He had a curved saber in a scabbard on his right side, the handle clearly visible. A real whirlwind blew under the object, a kind of hot, stinging wind which M. Tichit felt on his left cheek. The witness advanced towards the creature with the intention of capturing it. The dwarf pilot saw him and pointed a long tube at him which emitted an intense light. The witness then experienced difficulty breathing, bent forward, hands in front of his face, and continued to advance. The being seemed to be frightened, turned around, climbed the ladder and disappeared. The craft rose to about thirty meters, with a whistling sound, and then moved horizontally in waves. (M.

Departing from Pakistan to reach Norway by flying over the Urals, aboard this astonishing apparatus capable of covering more than 5000 km at 27000 meters of altitude, he was to take detailed pictures of certain regions or installations of interest to the American secret services. The photographic device equipped on the U-2 allowed to discover details of only 1 meter. (...) Due to its vulnerability, the U-2 spy plane program was interrupted.

More than a hundred people observed a circular craft of a polished and dark grey, maneuvering and hovering above their heads. It had a bright light on its top and seemed to measure 20 meters in width. At 4 o'clock in the morning the following day, Raimundo Dos Santos saw two discs on the beach and several entities similar to men, small and pale, standing next to them, apparently in conversation. Seeing the farmer, the entities made a gesture to him, but he turned his back and ran away. Coming back later with other men, he discovered the marks left by the discs on the sand.

At around 00:15 the driver, with her husband asleep next to her in the car and the two children sleeping in the back, was negotiating a right turn about 24 km from Globe, heading towards California, when she saw a small figure on the right side of the road about 100m ahead. It was as if it was ready to cross, and she let go of the accelerator and the car immediately slowed down as if they were going uphill. Simultaneously, the being faced her, pivoted and ran into the bushes out of the headlights' beam. She stopped abruptly and woke up her husband. The creature was about 90 cm tall, broad shoulders, long arms, dark in color, head shaped like a flattened pumpkin almost. In its head shone two yellow-orange eyes. When it was in profile there was a light radiating beyond its face. She did not see a nose, mouth, or ears. The body was less well defined than the head and she had the impression of hair or fur.

Observation at 03:30. Beings were seen moving around a landed UFO. Shortly afterwards it was seen flying over the region and disappearing. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 175 and 179) At 3:30 in the morning the witness was returning home with his dog, after a walk in the fields. He saw what he thought were the lights of a car. These lights suddenly becoming bigger and brighter, he hid in the bushes. From this hiding place, he observed, terrified, the coming and going of 6 humanoids around a UFO on the ground. The dog panicked and ran away. After a few minutes the object shot up vertically into the sky. The witness took off running towards his house. He was still surprised to see a searchlight directed downwards, scanning the ground 50 meters from his position.

At 3 o'clock Carlos Sabinos, 25 years old, and his friend Filipe were out for a walk when they saw an object they took for a car. As they got closer they noticed the craft had a saucer shape and was emitting an unusual and bright light. They hid behind a mound and were able to observe six small beings who were moving around the disc. Later they entered the vehicle which soon rose vertically and quickly. (exactly the same story as the one in Portugal on the same date???)
The two men left their hiding place to run towards their house, but while they were running the craft reappeared and swept the ground with an intense beam of light. (Jean FERGUSON: "Everything about Flying Saucers", ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1972, p. 200)

Canada, Chapais (Abitibi)
Three workers were inspecting and repairing the Canadian National Railway at a place called Sub-Anville, in the Chapais region. Mr. Georges Godbout, a man in his fifties, communicated this case to us which he witnessed with his two companions. (...) The railway workers were hard at work. Suddenly a shrill noise rises, amplifies, to the point where the men feel unwell. (...) It is then that they see, 300 m in front of them, an object advancing on the railway track. It is dazzling like a well-polished metal that shines in the sun. As only one train passes per day, the men are perplexed. (...) Suddenly the object moves away from the track and hovers a few meters above an inaccessible savannah where it stops and stays a few meters from the ground. The men, disturbed by the noise, "a whirring of a top", can see its profile. It is an object in the shape of a top of a metallic green, throwing off luminous flashes. (...) An opening appears in front of the astonished witnesses and a kind of small ladder is placed on the threshold of the craft. A "being" well proportioned advances and descends about three rungs. He wears a fitting, greenish uniform. He is about 1 m 60 tall. His head is covered with a helmet that encloses it, and on his face there is a mask like that of a basketball referee. When he comes out he casts a circular glance, but his head does not seem to be mobile, the whole body turns at the same time. (...) He immediately climbs back up. The object rises with an unbearable noise, it flies over the railway track and moves away a little, rises into the sky and quickly disappears into space. (Jean FERGUSON: "The Humanoids..." - ed.

Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Hiot were driving from Noulle to Morhinghem around 0:30.
Their father-in-law noticed a distant light, and as they left Moulle, they saw a red ball the apparent size of the moon.
The object crossed the road obliquely, 3 or 4 meters in front of the car and 2 meters from the ground, forcing the driver to brake suddenly. Then the 5-6 meter wide phenomenon, with a bright red light radiating from a kind of half-sphere larger than a horse-drawn carriage wheel at the base of the object, accompanied them for a kilometer. As they arrived at the first houses, it seemed to go out from bottom to top, as if it was veiling itself starting from the bottom. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed.

Klaus Dieter Kaufmann, had to undergo a spinal surgery in 1990. "How many years ago was the previous operation?" the surgeon asked him, looking at his medical file.
"But I have never been operated on," Kaufmann replied. The surgeon showed him the radiographs to prove the contrary. A strange story from his adolescence then came back to him: he had observed a UFO.
The craft shot a blinding flash at him and Dieter-Klaus fainted. He returned home four hours late and suffered from migraines and difficulty concentrating for several days. He had a painful mark on his pelvic region and a wound mark on the lower back. Kaufmann tried to remember the adventure and the memories gradually came back to him. He had entered a state close to trance when he was confronted with small armed creatures with some kind of oxygen tanks on their backs. He became friendly with them and followed them on board the ship, noticing that it did not walk but floated. He found himself in a brightly lit room where two beings with huge, black oblique eyes were standing: frightening. He tried to escape but was unable to move. After a medical examination carried out by beings with webbed fingers, he learned that he could go home and this time he felt like he was being carried out in the arms of someone he could not see but could hear breathing loudly, as if through a tube. He wanted to feel but only found a belt, no chest. A force pushed his hand away and he fainted, regaining consciousness at the place where the adventure had begun.

In 1991 a 31 year old woman reported being abducted by a large entity and groups of small entities. The abductions occurred in her bed and through her bedroom door, throughout her life. The small entities measure 120 cm and have large ugly heads, with prominent eyes without pupils, dark blue to black in colour. They have only a slit for a mouth, and a very small nose. The larger entities measure 210 cm and seem to command the small ones. She levitated or was carried out of her bed, floating into a circular room, where medical examinations took place, while she was laid on a metal table. Then she would wake up in her bed. Hypnotic regression confirmed the abductions. Throughout her life she was surrounded by poltergeist activity, sensations of presence wherever she lived, children's toys moving by themselves, such as their tricycles, etc. (the whole paranormal panoply). She claims to have implants in her face. The investigation revealed that she was a victim of sexual abuse during her childhood, not by entities from elsewhere, but by men from her very close family.

In 1960, electrician Edwin found a job as a radio mechanic in Durban. His firm hired an inspector named George. George lived in a hotel room and soon the two men became friends, and went fishing together on the weekends. On one of these fishing trips, George brought a radio apparatus, and soon a saucer appeared in the sky while a voice on the radio announced "This is Wy-Ora (name of the vessel) We are a people from the planet Koldas." It turns out that George is actually an extraterrestrial and his name is Valdar. To prove this, George/Valdar speaks in his extraterrestrial language and the saucer begins to perform incredible maneuvers. The world Koldas is in the universe of antimatter. In 1962 George/Valdar returned to his country, leaving the apparatus as a gift to Edwin, to continue to communicate. Which he did until 1964. Edwin was then warned against extraterrestrial saboteur groups, and also learned that a new planet called Epicot was being prepared to cater to the eventualities of repopulation.

At around 11am Joe Simonton was drawn by a curious sound of studded tires on a wet pavement. He went into the yard and saw a silver saucer-shaped object, brighter than chrome, hovering close to the ground. The object was 12 feet high and thirty feet in diameter. An opening appeared about 5 feet from the ground and Simonton saw three men inside the craft. One was wearing a two-piece black suit. They were about 5 feet tall, clean-shaven, and resembled Italians: black hair, swarthy skin. Their shirt was trimmed with a turtleneck collar and they wore woolen caps. One of the men lifted a pot apparently made of the same material as the craft and it seemed to Simonton that he was asking for water. Simonton took the pot, filled it. On his return, one of the men was cooking food on some kind of flame-less grill. The inside of the craft was black like raw iron. He could make out panels for instruments and heard a sound like that of a generator. When he made a gesture indicating he was interested in the prepared food, one of the men, also dressed in black but with a narrow red braid on his trousers, handed him three small cakes about 3 inches in diameter with small holes in them. All this had lasted about 5 minutes. The man closest to the witness fastened some kind of belt to a hook on his clothing and closed the opening.

Around 9 pm, forest guard Vassili Brodski was walking along the 600 m long and 150 m wide frozen lake without seeing anything out of the ordinary. The next morning he walked back and found a stretched out ditch that started on the high bank and disappeared into the lake through a huge hole in the ice: the earth that had been excavated to make this 27 m long, 15 m wide and 3 m deep ditch was nowhere to be found: yet it was about 1000 cubic meters. He informed the military authorities who arrived with their equipment a week later. The submerged part of the broken floating ice was green. On the shore the military found grains of a black material that crumbled between their fingers. Upon analysis they seemed to come from a metal that had been heated as if for welding. (Boris CHOURINOV: "The two faces of ufology in Russia" - May 1994, p. 6 and 7) On the morning of April 27, a group of twenty-five hunters and foresters saw an unknown aerial object descend and crash into the ground near a bend where a stream emptied. According to the witnesses it could have been 8 or 10 in the morning. The object was oval-shaped, as big as a long-haul plane and shone with a gray-blue light. It was flying at low altitude and at high speed. It was heading east to west when the crash occurred near the north shore of the lake. There was a loud noise like a strong explosion. (...)

Four people were chatting in the boat, engine stopped, off the Italian coast. Suddenly they were shaken by waves of increasing amplitude. They then saw the water swell into an enormous bubble 1 km away from them. A strange object in the shape of an overturned plate topped with a cone emerged from this bubble of water as if the object was pushing the water away, as if it was surrounded by an air cushion. Once out of the water it stopped for a few seconds at about ten meters from the surface, forming a halo around its base. Then it left at a lightning speed.

A metal object in the shape of a disc, approximately 100 m in diameter, hovered above the Rybinsk anti-aircraft missile launch base north of Moscow. The object, apparently at an altitude of 6000 m, was first detected on radar and then seen with the naked eye. While it remained stationary, smaller discs emerged from the giant object and began to fly over the base at low altitude. The commander gave the order to shoot down the craft. A first series of surface-to-air missiles were launched: the projectiles rose towards the UFO but exploded in the air when they were 2 km away. The UFO remained stationary and intact in the same place. A second attack was ordered, with the same result. Preparations were being made for a third attack when the small discs descended very low and the electricity was cut off, including that supplied by the emergency generator. After ten minutes the small objects rose back up to the large craft, then it disappeared. The electricity then returned normally. (Antonio RIBERA: "Procès aux OVNI" - De Vecchi 1977 - p. 101, 102) (Internet, WUFOC site, which reproduces this account attributing it to Thimoty Good "Above Top Secret" with the comment that Good claims his source is a very serious Italian scientific journal….) Defensive missiles were installed around Moscow. At one of the bases, a radar detected a UFO flying at an altitude of 18000 meters and escorted by smaller UFOs. The commander of the Rybinsk base responded with a salvo of missiles. The escort UFOs descended towards the base, whose electrical equipment then stopped working. The missiles exploded well before reaching their targets. When the UFOs rejoined their mothership, the energy returned to the missile base. (“Dossiers OVNI”, ed.

Americans resume their lunar adventure with probes of a new type, weighing 330 kg. These devices, called "Ranger", are to take physical measurements during the approach to the Moon, photograph the surface, and drop a capsule containing instruments and a small rocket onto the Moon's surface. This rocket, by means of retro-propulsion, is to allow the capsule and its contents to land without damage. The first two "Rangers" were two failures due to malfunction of the rockets.

Case: Betty and Barney Hill.
Returning from their vacation in Canada, the interracial Hill couple was driving late at night on a deserted road, when they saw a UFO descending. It eventually landed, blocking the road in front of them. They were approached by humanoids. A few hours later the Hills found themselves back on the road, but 55 kilometers away and without any memory of what had happened during that time. This persistent amnesia caused them to experience various physical and psychological problems, and eventually they went to see Dr. Simon, famous for his amnesia cures. Having been put into a hypnotic state several times, each of them separately recounted the facts. Their respective versions were quite precise. They reported that they had been taken aboard the craft, treated well by the occupants, more or less in the way humans treat laboratory animals, and then released after being hypnotically instructed to totally forget their experience.

As work continued on the development of more sophisticated telecommunications satellites, an original but controversial formula was tested, known as the "Westfort" project. The US Air Force had been working on the project since 1958, which involved launching no less than 350 million 2 centimeter long copper hairs into space. It was expected that these angel hairs, once released from their container in orbit, would stretch out around the Earth to form a belt, a kind of miniature Saturn ring. The size of these metal needles had been calculated to reflect radio waves preferentially on a frequency of 8400 megahertz, or a wavelength of 3 to 4 cm. (...) The first attempt took place in October 1961 from the MIDAS 4 spy satellite. But the needles remained grouped in packets. Two months later, radar observations showed that the ring measured more than 8 km long. This experiment had obviously caused a real stir among scientists, who accused the military of polluting space. Astronomers in particular, led by the Englishman Sir Bernard Lovell. (continued May 1963) ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, pp. 88-89)

As they were driving around 21:30, two Navajo Indians, Willie Begay and Guy Tossie, were blinded by a powerful white light. Once recovered, they noticed a small UFO floating 2 m above the ground in front of them. The car began to slow down abnormally without Willie being able to do anything about it. The object had a diameter of 1.70m to 2.10m with a dome on top that was overturned as if it had hinges for opening. The two men noticed two small beings in the cockpit, whose appearance scared them. Immediately one of these beings flew away like a bird and descended to Willie's height. He was 1.10m tall, had a head 70 cm wide, coarse features as if he had undergone a rudimentary plastic surgery, huge ears, round eyes, no nose or lips. One of his hands had two fingers. The two creatures wore very tight-fitting suits to the shape of their body and a kind of empty backpack that extended above their head. (...) The little being jumped through the open window into the vehicle and grabbed the steering wheel with what served him as a hand. The car started moving again but the creature was too small to reach the accelerator: it became obvious that the car was being towed by the UFO.

A garage owner was driving in the evening in a pouring rain when he suddenly saw a group of silhouettes 80 m away. He slowed down as they were leaving by jumps and he observed that they were strange and looked like birds. As they leapt towards the car, terrified, he drove through them and then he saw them return to a bright blue object hovering above a field. They entered it as if they had been sucked in, a dull sound was heard before the object flew away. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances - DENOEL 1972 - coll. J'AI LU, p. 298)

At the end of the DISCOVERER program, the US Air Force had thus succeeded in twelve recoveries and the series ended with number 38. But, from November 22, 1962, three months before the end of the program, an unnamed satellite launched from the same base by the same rocket (Thor Agena) quietly gained a low altitude orbit around the Earth. A few hours later it released a small capsule, which an airplane recovered in flight over the Pacific. This first satellite was to be followed by many others of the same type. (...) The first generation consists of small satellites that remain welded to the last stage of their carrier rocket, the Agena. For its takeoff it is propelled, of course, by a first stage, which is none other than a Thor missile. About three days later, a small capsule, baptized "E 6", is ejected to be recovered in flight. The detachment from the orbit takes place over Alaska, the capsule ending its course off the Hawaiian Islands. There, a Hercules C-130 cargo plane is waiting and circling over the planned arrival point. Its role: to catch the container in flight, by the suspension of its parachute, using a curved cable. Originally this aerial fishing number only succeeded once in two. It continues, perfectly perfected, to this day ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, pp. 27-28)

A police officer, Francesco Piania, saw in the city center two Martians. "I was doing my inspection round when I heard a whistling behind me. At first I thought it was my ears (note from vog: !) but the noise became louder. As I was going towards the park I saw a silver-aluminum disk, shining in the moonlight, landing. When I turned around I was petrified and couldn't move. I saw a strange entity about 1.85 m tall coming out of the disk. Its space suit was silver and fluorescent emitting a bluish light. It wore a black helmet and made a gesture towards the rotating dome of the disk. Then another person appeared at the entrance. The first man made a sign for me to come closer to him, but at that moment the other entity called him and both of them boarded the disk which took off."

This 65-year-old bar waitress had never seen anything like it in her life. On a hot night, a customer entered the bar wearing a raincoat and a scarf. He asked for rum and demanded to add Tia Maria to it. After drinking several of this concoction, he seemed completely drunk. One of the bar guards then approached him with the intention of gently putting him out. The visitor disappeared on the spot, his body and clothes vanished into nothingness before their eyes.

Continued experiments nevertheless took place, particularly under the responsibility of the Lewis Center of NASA. Three types of "hypersonic gliders" were then built: the HL-10, the X-24 and the M2-F. All are ancestors of the Space Shuttle. The MF-F1 was the first to fly in 1963, the same year the X-20 project was abandoned. The X-24 pilot was to reach 1610 km/hour at 22,000 meters altitude in 1971 after being dropped from a B-52 bomber. ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, p. 161)

My father was returning from work in the mountains. We had started to have dinner at 8 o'clock in the evening. After dinner, my younger brother and I wanted to go and play with our neighbors. Having opened the door, we saw a strange object flying in our direction. It was an unusual and bright thing with a diameter of more than one meter. It was surrounded by an orange, non-luminous band. The thing, which was two stories high, flew without making any noise and had a particularly bright point. It was heading at a uniform speed towards the southeast. Having noticed this phenomenon, I screamed in terror and immediately called my parents who ran and looked with us. This huge, luminous thing disappeared behind the mountain.

#1963, April 21
POLAND, Warsaw
We lived on the ground floor of an apartment in a dead-end street in Warsaw. I was about to go to bed, around 11 pm on April 21, 1963, and I was standing with my back to the window, whose curtains were closed. My wife was already asleep. Then I heard a woman's voice saying, "Look! Look!" in a pleasant but urgent tone. I immediately knew I had to look out the window into the street, where a gas bottle was hissing. Suddenly, the room was lit up by a light like that of a full moon, although the curtains were still closed. I rushed to the window and opened the curtains. I then saw a strange, frightening light. It was raining, but the raindrops seemed to be part of this pale, moon-like light. Then came a third, equally impressive vision: a hail of fire began to fall, with hailstones the size of hazelnuts that had nothing of the appearance of pieces of ice, but rather that of drops of steel running off during welding. These hailstones quickly covered the street and made a dull sound as they hit the shutters. I hoped to be able to pick up some of these hailstones as soon as they were cold. But as soon as they hit the ground they only kept their shape for a moment, immediately losing their steel-like color: they became gray and completely disappeared without leaving any trace. I woke up my wife. She was able to observe these strange things with me, which amazed us. As the rain crackled and the hailstones pounded against the shutters, we heard every ten seconds a curious explosion - a dry sound like that of a cork popping - which announced a renewed wave of rain and hail. At greater and more irregular intervals we also heard a kind of whistling and crackling similar to that of tram and trolleybus cables short-circuited by the pole when it has jumped. This lasted about an hour. In the morning we had confirmation from all our neighbors who had observed the phenomenon exactly as we had done ourselves. (Ion HOBANA/Julien WEVERBERGH: "Les OVNI en URSS et dans les pays de l'Est" - trad. Laffont 1976, p. 262-263) Metal balls the size of hazelnuts fell on Warsaw in the night of April 22 to 23. These balls shone with the red color of fire. They covered the streets and electric crackling was heard. (Internet, http://www.wufoc.com, WUFOC site)

At about 11pm I was outside in the street when a strong light made me turn around. (...) I then saw behind and above me a sphere at 500 or 600 m altitude which, in a few fractions of a second, was above my head, very low, like an airplane dropping medicine boxes in inaccessible areas for rescue. The thing had the apparent diameter of a handball and it emitted a very bright white light with orange spots. The street was illuminated as if it was day by this thing which came from the south and went at full speed (constant) towards the north. When it reached far away (...) it stopped. Its passage, even at the closest, was accompanied by no noise except for a slight whistle when the blinking red-white light became visible. A feeling of cold, I think caused by my fear, seized me at the moment of its passage above me and even afterwards, while the night temperature was very mild.

Three young boys in the garden around 7:50 pm, were drawing water from the well. Suddenly a sphere came hovering above the trees. They were even able to see 5 or 6 rows of people inside the sphere. An opening appeared in the bottom of the sphere and two beams of light were projected onto the ground, a thin being, 10 feet tall, descended sliding down the beams. Once on the ground he walked with a stiff back, bent legs and open arms, swaying from side to side. Then he sat on a rock. The giant wore a transparent helmet, he had an eye in the middle of his forehead, and he wore boots with triangular tips. His shining garment inflated as soon as he was on the ground, the trousers tightly fixed to the boots, on the chest a square packet that emitted light jets. Inside the sphere, still suspended, occupants were manipulating buttons and levers. When the giant made a gesture to grab one of the boys, one of the three picked up a stone, but was unable to throw it when the man looked at him. The giant stood up, but this time he walked with his arms tightly along his body and used the beams as an elevator and went back up into the craft. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T.

At dawn, in a driving rain, Eugenio Douglas was driving his coal truck. Suddenly he saw a bright point on the road, a single blinding light was approaching. He stopped and pulled off to the side. He got out of the truck: the light had disappeared. Through the rain he saw a round object about 35 feet high, an opening appeared and three men wearing what looked like antenna helmets appeared. They were at least 12 feet tall. Douglas was scared, and when the men saw him a red beam was pointed at him and burned him. Grabbing his revolver he shot at the entities and ran towards Monte Maize. The red light followed him to the village where it interfered with the street lighting, changing it to violet and green. He knocked on a door where a family gathered in a wake heard him: at that moment the candlelight turned violet then green and there was a strange smell. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - J'AI LU collection, p. 165, 166) On the night of October 17-18, Ernesto Douglas (note from vog: different date and first name, slightly different story too) was driving in a violent storm when he was suddenly blinded by a bright light that enveloped his truck from all sides and moved along the same route as him. He suddenly felt a burning sensation on his face. He braked, but his truck skidded and then left the road to get stuck on the side. At that moment he got out and found himself in the presence of three strange beings that seemed to be robots, near which was a vehicle of oval shape equipped with portholes and emitting a bright light. Panicked, Ernesto Douglas took his revolver and fired four bullets at the creatures. They took refuge in their spacecraft which started moving. Several times it flew over the driver and his truck and each time Douglas felt violent burns all over his body. Exhausted, his clothes in tatters, he presented himself at the police station in Monte Maize.

In the night of the 21st to the 22nd, several UFOs stopped near the railway of Trancas. From there they emitted non-dispersive red beams of light (like those produced by our current lasers) of very high intensity. The workers of an agricultural company who had gone out had to run and take refuge in their dwellings, pursued by these heat beams. Inside the houses the temperature began to rise. A witness, Kairus de Moreno, gave a coherent description of these beams to Captain of Frigate Omar R. Pagani of the Naval Information Service of the Argentine Military. Following his investigation, the latter declared that this light passed through the walls of the houses and entered the rooms without windows, illuminating them as if it were broad daylight.

Without hesitation, he headed towards the craft. At that moment "the smaller one shrank, the bigger one shrank and both moved away". The pilot resumed his route towards the Michell base when he noticed that the two objects had merged into a single, very "compact" mass. Finally, the witness reported, the large craft broke apart into about ten bright points that faded away on their own.

Four young people were walking along Sandling Park in the evening. The light, yellow-orange, came out of the sky at an angle of 60°. As it approached the ground it seemed to hover more slowly. Suddenly a gold-colored light appeared in the nearby field after the first object had disappeared behind the trees, floating 100 yards away from them at 10 feet from the ground. It seemed to follow their movements and as if it was observing them. It was oval, 15 to 20 feet wide with a bright and hard center. It disappeared behind the trees and a few seconds later a dark silhouette descended heavily. It was all black, the size of a man, but without a head. It seemed to have wings on either side of the body, like a bat. The young people did not wait to find out the rest.. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - coll.

Four boys, aged 5 to 12, were watching a disc-shaped object land behind a small wood near where they were playing. A humanoid, dressed in a space suit, small, about 1.2 m tall, came out of the wood. The boys threw stones and clods of earth at him to provoke some reaction. The entity then shot at them with a small black rod which caused a slightly painful tingling sensation throughout their bodies. When the boys were questioned separately according to the information in the NICAP files, their description of the entity was identical and also corresponded to that of 200 other witnesses in the Ohio River Valley. The boys' mother noticed she had received a telepathic message in her head and felt compelled to call the University of Louisville immediately after she had phoned the National Guard to report the children's encounter. Small footprints and clear signs of the landing were found. The next day, two unidentified people visited the site and erased the footprints. They claimed to have been sent by the University of Louisville, but when enquiries were made there, this seemed not to be true. (By DON ELKINS with CARLA RUECKERT , CASE NUMBER 1, Investigators: Col.
