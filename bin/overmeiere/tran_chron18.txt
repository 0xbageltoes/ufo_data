Axel Aberg was on the beach around 11 pm when he saw, astonished, a luminous craft emerge from the sea in a shower of water. The object approached the beach and stopped about twenty meters away from him. A luminous beam shot out from it and the witness felt as if he was paralyzed. As if in a nightmare, he saw two beings appear standing next to the UFO. Their height exceeded two meters and one was taller than the other. They seemed to be made of crystal, they moved stiffly as if they had no joints or were mummified. (Jean-Marie DOUCHET - Nostra - 20.11.1979)

Mr. Serafim Sebastiao, married, 36 years old, security guard in a military installation was working that night and noticed that the radio receiver was not functioning properly. He went outside and saw an oval-shaped object, of metallic appearance with, on the upper part, a "glass tower". He first saw two humanoids. He stepped back to get a different view and then saw that there were two more, making a total of four: two inside the craft and two outside. When the witness directed his flashlight towards them, all he saw was that they seemed to be dressed in lead. He heard a sound like that of a bee hive. The object had a diameter of 6 m and a height of 3 m. The witness does not know how the two entities on the ground got into the craft which then took off at a lightning speed, enveloping the witness in an immense light beam, then in "fumigations" or gases which left him unconscious, just at the moment he decided to call for reinforcement by radio. It was there, at 5 o'clock in the morning, that he was found, still unconscious. He had to be hospitalized for 5 days.

USA, Groveton, Missouri
At 3:20 a.m. the farmer heard his cows mooing in the field near the house, as if something was frightening them. He rushed to the window and saw, a hundred meters away in the dark night, a bright light of such luminosity that he could move around inside without turning on the lamp and outside he saw his animals in a semi-circle to the left of the light. It was an enormous circular craft, and the greenish light came from the concave side. Its apparent size was 30 cm, it remained stationary 6 or 7 meters from the ground, in the middle there were 7 openings or portholes which in real dimensions must have been between 60 and 75 cm in diameter. The cows were standing 30 to 60 meters from the craft and some were looking towards the object. And then, suddenly, one of the cows turned around and ran, tail in the air, towards the barn, the others followed. In a few seconds the field was empty. Throughout the time there was a noise (...) like the whistling of a piece of iron spinning, but it was also jerky at the same time. At the moment of departure this noise became louder and the jerks more rapid. It left quickly towards the southwest at an angle of 45° without ever changing its horizontal position. (J. Allen HYNEK: "New Report on UFOs" - Belfond 1979, pp. 189-191)

An explosion occurred. Several people had previously seen an object flying over the virgin forest. After hearing the explosion, people went to the site and found a hole and also metal fragments. They brought to Bogota on February 20, a piece of 3 m in diameter and weighing 57 kg. The witnesses had tried in vain to break the metal to be able to transport it more easily but in vain. No tool was able to cut the piece. The surface of the metal was covered with small grooves, but even with a hammer or a chisel one could not trace grooves on it. (vog: so there is a fairly substantial UFO piece? we want to see it, touch it, make sure it's true, read the analyses that have been done, everything...)

YUGOSLAVIA, Sremcica
At around 8:30am, the owner of a restaurant, Sekul Medenica, heard
an explosion near his house in Sremcica (18 km from Belgrade),
which broke several windows. Three trees were burned and a crater
had been dug in the ground right next to the restaurant. The crater
contained a striated, dark gray metallic body. Ovoid in shape, about
20 cm in size, it weighed 1900 g and appeared to be made of magnesium.
(vog: yet another piece of unknown origin? let's see it then! I bet
it was a fragment of an artificial satellite..)
Unknown origin. (Ion HOBANA/Julien WEVERBERGH: "Les OVNI en URSS et

At 04:00, a group of ten students were awoken at the university residence by Mr. A. Branco Rodriguez from the Chemistry department. They observed for five minutes an orange, slow-moving object. It alternated between round, like the sun, and triangular with what seemed to be helicopter blades at the ends. It then took an elongated shape before disappearing towards Figueira da Foz. Photos were taken: on one of the photos the object resembled the cone of the Apollo capsule, and on another a shape like an egg was seen resting on a plate. (J.G.

Mr. Manselon, 37 years old, operating a small quarry, was returning around 7:50 PM from the hut where an employee was stopping the generator. Still lost in his thoughts, the witness walked with his head down. Suddenly a bright light made him look up and immediately he felt immobilized: he tried to back away, in vain, to advance: in vain. To call out: impossible, no sound came out of his mouth. In front of him there was a kind of luminous barrel, 1.50 m from the ground. It was 2 m high and 1.50 m wide. It was a very bright white but not dazzling. Two very bright antennas topped it: the object was 5 or 6 m from the witness. However, the upper edge was indistinct and blurred: the object did not light up around it. He stayed facing this thing for a minute, then it rose slowly vertically. As it rose, the witness was more relaxed. When it reached 8 or 10 m in altitude, the thing tilted and went out. He saw nothing more, heard nothing more, felt nothing more: he was scared and started to tremble. He ran towards the hut but the employee there had not noticed anything (after investigation this seems to be true: from that place he could not see) (L.D.L.N.

Gregory Wells was leaving his grandmother's house, just a few steps from his home, around 8:30 pm when he saw a large oval object hovering above the trees. It was red and very bright. Suddenly, a tube emerged from the bottom and headed towards the boy. A beam of light shot out and Gregory was thrown to the ground, screaming in fear as the top of his jacket caught fire. He was taken to the hospital with second-degree burns. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDELL: "The World's Greatest Ufo Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p 146)

BOLIVIA, Otoko (Uyuni)
At around 6:00 PM, Valentina Flores went out to bring in the flock of sheep and llamas that were grazing a kilometer away. She had just finished locking up the sheep and was returning with the llamas when she noticed that the enclosure she had carefully closed was open and a kind of net was covering it. Inside the enclosure she saw a small man about 1.10 m tall, busy killing her sheep with a large tube with a hook at the end. Thinking it was a sheep thief, she threw stones at him. Then the strange creature headed towards a box resting on four legs, resembling a radio: he turned a wheel on the top of the post and it quickly absorbed all the net stretched over the enclosure. Mrs. Flores armed herself with a stick and approached to punish the thief. But he advanced towards her with the same instrument that had been used to bleed the sheep, throwing it several times against her, inflicting slight cuts on her arms. Each time the instrument returned to his right hand, like a boomerang. Then the humanoid picked up the box that had absorbed the net and a kind of plastic bag containing the viscera of the killed animals. The creature wore a helmet with a visor topped with a rod about 3 cm long, double-curved in the shape of an S. He wore a dark suit, his legs tucked into thick boots that seemed to be lined. On his back he carried a bag with sharp angles held by two wide, thick, light straps crossed over his chest. A rigid rod came out of the bag. Holding the net device in one hand and the viscera bag in the other, two large tubes emerged from under the backpack, on the side, until they touched the ground. Then the little man began to rise into the air and then, accelerating his ascent with an extraordinary whistling noise, he finally disappeared. The alerted police soon arrived: they noted the loss of 34 sheep and on each of the corpses small sections of the digestive tube and organs had been taken. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 98, 99 which dates from March) Mrs. Valentina Flores was busy in the kitchen when she heard her sheep stirring, etc… (Jean FERGUSON: "The Humanoids…" ed.

At 8:30 the witness saw at a hundred meters above the ground, an object that was gliding slowly and had an elaborate shape: the middle part in the shape of a disk with at the front a kind of conical cabin attached by a neck to the disk and divided into rectangular lamellas; at the back the tail looked like the rudder of an airplane. The observer noted no noise, did not see any smoke but was surprised by its sudden disappearance (Dan Fleseriu).

A bus driver was participating in a youth excursion to Tossa de Mar. All the passengers observed a bright and circular object that was clearly trying to land. It stopped and a tall man emerged. The young people fled and the driver remained alone. The strange visitor had a shining ball in his hand and he walked around his vehicle, then he got back in. The craft rose and flew away. The witness noticed that his watch had stopped. (Jean FERGUSON: "Everything about Flying Saucers", ed.

BRAZIL, between Florianopolis and Laguna
At 8:45 PM, in a VW minibus, José Da Silva, the driver, and passengers Manuel Gonzalez, Flavio and Moises were driving with the windows closed because it was raining and the radio was on. Suddenly they saw a bright light and a noise like the sound of an electric drill. At the same time the van was lifted and held in the air (estimated height of 50 cm from the ground) for a moment, after which it fell and was immediately lifted again and placed with less force. After stopping they saw in front of them at 100 m altitude a strange intensely bright craft that suddenly accelerated and stopped at 500m. Frightened, the witnesses did not take their eyes off the thing: it was circular, appearing to be no more than 2 m in diameter, on the lower part several openings like portholes, through which indefinable movements passed. A reddish light seemed to rotate around the upper part. The UFO remained motionless for a few minutes, tilted and flew very quickly towards the sea. A truck driver arrived who had seen it all from a distance. The two vehicles did not leave each other until they reached their destination. Secondary effects: Moises was vomiting, Gonzalez had lost all the hair from his eyebrows and was suffering from itching, Da Silva who had a thick head of hair, became bald in less than a year. On the roof of the minibus a round burn with blisters of broken paint in the center. (Cuarto Dimension N° 20 pp. 26 to 28)

At 5 o'clock in the morning C.S. Dos Santos, a night watchman, returned home after finishing his work. In the courtyard of his house he found a small metal cylinder partially embedded in the ground. It was of a fairly high weight (like a car battery) and at each end it had dials, protected by glass or plastic lenses, resembling manometers, (vog: there is no doubt that 1968 is the year when UFOs lose their sheets and bolts anywhere ...), said Dos Santos. Dos Santos took a snack before going to bed and placed the cylinder on the window sill of the bathroom. That night he went to work as usual and had completely forgotten his find. At 1 o'clock in the morning, he goes home to see if his wife needs anything (she is pregnant) and finds his wife, his son and the neighbors outside, in lively animation. His wife told him that she had been awakened by a buzzing like a large transformer and by an immense, suffocating heat. Fearing a short circuit, she got up to turn off the electricity. At that moment she saw an intense bluish light in the bathroom and the noise that seemed to come from there was indeed the one that had awakened her. Frightened, she went to call the neighbors. As soon as they were in the courtyard, an enormous crash resounded, the moment after the heat and the light had disappeared. In the bathroom there was a hole in the ceiling and debris of tiles everywhere. The object he placed on the window sill had disappeared. (R.

A 19-year-old girl saw a tall, blond humanoid holding a crystal sphere emitting violent flashes in his left hand. (Erich ZURCHER: "Les apparitions d'humanoïdes" - ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 203) At around 0:40, Maria Eliada Pretzel (19 years old) said goodnight to her fiancé and some guests as they left the family motel La Cuesta. Her father had gone out for the evening. She turned off the lights of the motel, then noticed a glow in the hall. That's when she found herself in the presence of a blond man over two meters tall, wearing a tight-fitting suit made of shiny sky blue scales. He held a sphere, also sky blue, in his left hand that kept moving. Smiling continuously, he waved his right hand, adorned with a huge ring in front of her. Light shot out from the tips of his fingers and Maria felt lethargic, while feeling "kindness and goodness" emanating from the creature. At the same time he muttered a language that made her think of "Chinese". (vog: really? It sounded like Chinese, really???) Maria was petrified, but after a few minutes the being slowly headed towards the side door and left. Maria fainted and was discovered around 0:50 by her father. (“Dossiers OVNI”, ed.

CUBA, Cabanas
Shortly after midnight, the reserve units heard several bursts of machine gun fire in the area where Isidro Puentes was supposed to be, who was on patrol alone. It was only at sunrise that they found him lying on the ground unconscious. He was taken to the hospital in Pinar del Rio while the military intelligence services went to the scene. They found 48 shells from Isidro's machine gun and 14 flattened projectiles, as if they had hit a particularly hard surface. They also found a depression formed of a central hole one meter in diameter surrounded by three smaller marks. The radars had also detected a strange object. Within a radius of 5 meters the ground was charred and covered with gray dust. The Soviet specialists arrived and carried out detailed analyses. Isidro remained in a state of shock for 15 days, unable to express himself. He was taken to the naval hospital in Havana. (...) When Isidro was finally able to speak, he said that shortly before midnight he had seen a whitish blue light filtering through the trees. He approached within 50 meters of the object resting in the middle of a clearing. He thought it was an American helicopter and fired at the craft, which changed color to orange. The last thing he remembered was a loud whistle. (Jacques VALLEE: "Confrontations" - Laffont 1991, p. 145)

At 5:30 in the morning, the inhabitants of a small town were disturbed by an extremely shrill noise, which woke them up, while at the same time they were bathed in a light that penetrated the walls, while everywhere dogs were howling to death. Gradually both the noise and the light diminished, but it took a while for them to completely disappear. (The 1962 Ufo-Flap Remembered, Joseph Trainor, Saucer Roundup)

Pedro Dema Filho, residing at Conceiçao Street No. 12 in Rio de Janeiro, was at 11 pm on the main road of Sao Paulo near the Dom Bosco seminary when he heard a buzzing sound that grew louder. Suddenly he was blinded by a powerful beam of light and two green lights that appeared near him. When the lights disappeared he saw an object whose horizontal door opened, letting out four entities no more than 50 cm tall. The creatures were greenish and wore something like headphones on their heads. They ran in his direction. He tried to flee but found himself immobilized. He could still see, hear and think, but could no longer move or speak. The little creatures spoke to him in Portuguese, but he thinks it was telepathy because he never saw their lips move. Grabbing him by the arms, they pulled him inside the craft, which looked like a laboratory. He was subjected to a questionnaire and a physical examination. Bringing him outside, the abductors informed him that after their departure everything would be in his mind like a dream. Terrified and confused, he stood at the side of the road and watched the craft take off. (R. Jack Perrin: "The Mystery of UFOs" - J'ai Lu/Pygmalion 1976, pp. 225 and 226)

ESTONIA, Vesti (Otepaa)
Three 14-year-old girls, at a summer camp near Lake Kaarna, were sitting around a table at the back of the house between midnight and 1:00 a.m. when they suddenly saw a star moving at great speed, joining a cigar-shaped object that had suddenly appeared and entering it. It was quite frightening, but since it was late, they were going to bed. As they were undressing, their room was flooded with light, and the large, shining cigar was then 150 m away. It was like a bus, surrounded by orange and yellow beams of light. The large light disappeared, but there was a luminous mist that shone with a bluish-green color. Around the object there was a belt of the same color. The object seemed to become smaller and finally there was only a disc. The blue light was very frightening to the teenagers. This had been going on for five minutes when they heard a very faint buzzing and the object disappeared, they do not know how. One of the young girls felt the need to go out and see, and at the corner of the house she saw a small human figure, a little woman with a silver ribbon crossing her chest. This good woman simply vanished into the air, and the young girl quickly returned to her room with her friends. They did not sleep all night. The next day, where they had seen the craft, they found an almost circular trace of 2 m in diameter with burned grass, and then another and another: over 180 m there were several of these imprints.

It was in the morning on an airfield. The four military personnel were intrigued by an intense glow on a rescue track. They went to the site in a jeep and saw a round craft, equipped with landing gear and equipped with headlights of different colors that was stationary on the ground. Three beings descended. Their size: 2 m. They had a human appearance but were dressed in phosphorescent uniforms. The frightened military personnel saw that the beings were coming towards them. The brigadier who commanded the group decided to shoot them, but in his nervousness, he fortunately did not hit them. The beings had luminous balls in their hands and these balls shot rays at the soldiers who were paralyzed. Immediately the strange visitors returned to their craft which flew away at full speed. (Jean FERGUSON: "Everything about Flying Saucers", ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1972, p. 201). The corporal ordered the "invaders" to surrender and as they did not obey, he fired a burst of machine gun, which had no effect either on the craft or on the invaders. But at the same time the military personnel were paralyzed, for three minutes, by rays from bright spheres that the beings held in one hand raised above their heads. When the military personnel regained their senses, the UFO had left and was only a small point fading in the sky. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on Humanoid ET" - Laffont 1977 - p. 67, 68)

Around 9 o'clock, Luce Fontaine, a farmer (...) was picking grass
for his rabbits in the Plaine des Cafres when he saw in a small
clearing 20 m away from him, an oval-shaped object, measuring about 5 m
in diameter and 2 to 3 m thick, hovering 1 m above the ground. The central
part of the craft was transparent and Luce Fontaine could make out two small,
wide shapes inside the unknown vehicle, about 1 m tall, resembling Michelin
men. One of them spotted the farmer and immediately there was a blinding
light that erased the landscape in a fantastic explosion of white light.
Luce Fontaine lowered his eyes to protect himself and when he looked again,
the object had disappeared. Afraid of being mocked, Luce Fontaine did not
immediately inform the authorities. (Henry DURRANT: "Le dossier des

Four patrol boats of the Lüda naval patrol, (...) were patrolling the sea not far from the coast. Suddenly the soldiers discovered a luminous object, which, of golden color, of oval shape, skimmed the surface of the water at an incredible speed. Shortly after this object disappeared to the right of the fleet. Almost at the same time, all the radars and all the wireless telecommunications installations of the four patrol boats broke down. The ships continued to patrol for half an hour and found that two large warships were rushing towards them. (...) The situation was very tense. At this critical moment, the communication instruments began to function normally again. (...) (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials" ed. Mercure de France, 1983, p.52)

A small flying saucer approximately 6 meters in diameter landed on the Nellis Air Force Base. Witnesses had seen it emerge a few minutes earlier from a huge saucer that had been hovering stationary above the base for three days, but at an altitude too high to be seen up close. To greet the visitors, a colonel was sent with an armed patrol in case of incident, but without any aggressive intentions. Then a small humanoid emerged from the craft, perhaps misunderstanding the intentions of the colonel or his men, and directed a blinding light beam at him, paralyzing him in place. Seeing this, the patrol leader ordered his men to shoot, but their automatic weapons jammed immediately and they too felt completely paralyzed by the blinding beam of the humanoid. (vog: we are in full fantasy fiction with this Chatelain...) The humanoid then calmly returned to his craft, closed the door and took off vertically in front of the astonished witnesses, who saw the small saucer join its mother in the sky.

The two women had reached a vacant lot when suddenly everything became dark: there was no more moon. A pitch black darkness that lasted a few seconds. Then the moonlight reappeared. Then the two women noticed in the vacant lot two small figures passing in the round disk of the moon, which was at the horizon level at that hour. Two beings, one of which was visibly smaller than the other. The larger one must have been 1.70 m and the other 1.60 m. (vog: not so small, and such precision on their size!) They were all black. They were wearing a garment that seemed to be made of one piece (...) They had a human appearance and a human-looking face. One of the two figures had a kind of pick (fork with two branches) and seemed to be probing the ground or scratching the earth. They were floating instead of walking. (...)

FRANCE, Villers en Morvan (Côte d'Or)
Witnesses Marius Carré and Paul Billard were in a field almost at the top of a hill with a cart pulled by a tractor to collect bundles of rye. It was about 10:30. First Marius Carré noticed to the left of a pine forest, on a small hill 2 km away to the southwest, a very light white spot that had the appearance of a lozenge. He compared it to a picnic blanket spread on the grass. Paul Billard spoke of a mass on the ground the approximate size of a small car. Without thinking further, the two farmers began to load a cart. Half an hour later, the operation finished, they bring the cart back into a path, hitch another empty cart to the tractor and start to load it. They then see, from the point where the "white blanket" was, a kind of luminous extension in the shape of a tube or factory chimney, which lengthens approximately in their direction. In 5 to 10 minutes this luminous tube reaches the record length of 2 km and comes to a sudden stop on a hedge (a bush hedge marking 30 to 40 m from the witnesses, the limit of the field). This luminous tube is extremely bright and almost unbearable to the eye. Paul Billard nevertheless tries to look. This is perhaps why the next day he will have sore eyes and have to wear sunglasses. The two witnesses agree to describe the end of the tube of 1 or 2 m in diameter as a kind of bright, moving spider web, like the luminous points on a lit television screen. This situation lasts about ten minutes. Marius Carré, mainly concerned with bringing in his rye, the work continues undisturbed while the end of this fantastic thing is there, forty meters away, and follows the tractor in its progress. A hundred meters traveled in ten minutes.
Then, just as slowly as it had lengthened, the tube begins to contract, disappearing completely after 5 to 10 minutes. The object seen on the ground about three quarters of an hour earlier is still there but Marius Carré now sees it green, like some wrapping paper. Suddenly it disappears. Paul Billard then believes he can see, in the pine woods, like a 2 CV going away. (Henry DURRANT: The UFO File - Laffont 1973 - p. 137 to 140) (L.D.L.N.

Dona Maria Cintra, a receptionist at the Clemente Ferreiro sanatorium near Lins, early in the morning, heard a loud noise and a prolonged whistle. (...) Then as suddenly as it had begun, the noise stopped. A few minutes later, Dona Maria heard knocking at the door. She went to open it and found herself in front of a tall woman with light eyes (...) her face looked as if it had been powdered with rice powder. She addressed the receptionist in an unknown language with staccato intonations as if she was having difficulty breathing. (...) Dona Maria thought she understood that she wanted water as she was holding a very pretty bottle engraved with incomprehensible motifs. Dona Maria then let her in and filled her bottle with water. She walked with the stranger outside to the car park (...) That's when she saw in front of the stranger, at some distance, a circular, silver vessel that was oscillating slightly above the ground. The visitor got on board. Completely shaken, Dona Maria turned around and ran back inside the sanatorium, where, with other witnesses, she saw the craft rise and disappear 5... (Jean FERGUSON: "Les Humanoïdes..." - éd. Leméac, Ottawa, 1977, p. 40, 41) Mrs. J.M. Cintra gave water to a humanoid who said several times "Rempaua" or "Abaura" probably to thank her. (Henry DURRANT: "Premières enquêtes sur les Humanoïdes ET" - Laffont 1977 - p. 187) Maria Jose Cintra was woken up by a noise. At the entrance door stood a woman with a strange look. She spoke in an unknown language and handed Maria a cup and a glass bottle covered with beautiful engravings. Maria filled them. The woman said something resembling "Rempaua" and headed towards a shiny object, shaped like a pearl, which flew away with a great noise of wings. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

Two employees of the Mendoza casino were returning home when their car stopped inexplicably. Immediately they were surrounded by three beings, no more than one meter forty tall, bald and with an abnormally large skull. These creatures were dressed in sky blue jumpsuits and seemed to come from the circular craft that the witnesses saw on the ground. "We have just landed for the third time," the strangers said. "We are studying the customs of your planet. The Sun is good," they added sententiously, "without it we would not exist." Then the three of them had fun engraving characters resembling Chinese writing on the Argentines' vehicle with a tool similar to an electric welder. Then, using a beam of light as a bridge, they got back into their craft, dragging the witnesses with them, offered a short "television" program featuring waterfalls and explosions, and finally took off with a great noise. The witnesses also declared that they had been paralyzed by these beings who pricked their index and middle fingers to take a few drops of blood. (Jean-Marie DOUCHET - Nostra 2.4.1980)

I was not able to see the child in its entirety because according to this lady, laboratories from around the world were fighting over its pieces...

At around 11:45 PM the witness, intrigued by a glowing shape at the top of the hill, got out of his car and climbed the hill. He saw four bright shapes with metallic reflections, which he described as "eights" composed of two balls, the lower one bigger than the upper one. The things quickly climbed the hill towards the object, taking a bouncing step (the upper ball stretched and seemed to pull the lower part, producing a faint whistle. The "eight" measuring between 40 and 50 cm long then fell back into its original shape and so on) and disappeared underneath the large orange dome (5 m high). They seemed to ignore the witness's presence. The object immediately flew away at great speed.

Early in the morning, 52-year-old fisherman Juan Ballesta saw two strange beings with yellow faces on the Cargol islet. They had a device similar to a buoy and were wearing tight black clothes. Ballesta described their faces as "yellow and terrible", so he rowed away with force and once on the coast he alerted the Civil Guard. (Jean FERGUSON: "Everything about Flying Saucers", ed.

In the night, around 03:00, Henrique Schneider, witness of the landing of a conical craft, was momentarily paralyzed and had the opportunity to converse for 10 minutes by telepathy with... some kind of metal plate that slid out of the craft along an inclined plane. The answers to his questions were brief and stereotyped. In addition to an oil smell that permeated the landing site for a long time, the next day the footprints of the tripod on which the device rested were found. Inside this triangle, a circle of 65 cm in diameter was burned and 3 years later nothing had grown back yet. (J. Scornaux and Chr. Piens: "In Search of UFOs" - Marabout 1976 - p.108)

Two young witnesses were walking back at 03:00 on a small road, after having abandoned their moped due to lack of fuel. At the turn of the road, hidden by the grove, they saw a round object on the ground, of a luminous orange-red color, resting on metal feet about 1 m from the ground. All around was a luminous halo produced by numerous projectors arranged like portholes. The upper part in the shape of a dome was of a dark color. The length of the craft was 15 to 18m, the height 1.20m. Surprised, they hid in a ditch and observed the object from 150m away, as well as three beings moving with very strong light sources in their left hand. They seemed to be looking for something and ran without touching the ground, above the grass, at about 60 cm. One of the beings approached the witnesses, who fled in terror. They did not see the craft take off. One of the witnesses, Guy Lemarque, reported to the investigators that the three beings sometimes moved by making jumps of 100m, as if they were sliding, so quickly that the movement could not be followed.

Farmer Louie Maule, 35 years old, was driving north towards his home from South Johnstone when he saw a large black object descend from the night sky, surrounded by red lights. It was gigantic, he said. He stopped to observe. The craft was flying towards South Johnstone at about 100 mph. The altitude must have been 50 feet, the diameter 60 feet, very visible by the ring of red lights surrounding it. At the end of the observation, the object sped off and disappeared into the clouds.

A farmer found a dead cow near 7 circular traces of burned grass. A few days later, mushrooms the size of basketballs grew on these traces. Around the date of the discovery of the dead animal, the neighbors had noticed unusual lights in the sky. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 307) A civilian pilot had noticed a strange drawing on the ground and went there with the military. As they headed towards the place where a saucer had previously landed, they discovered a circle of 6 feet in diameter where the earth was scorched. In the circle, eight giant white mushrooms had grown. One of the mushrooms measured 3 feet in diameter. - In the province of Santa Fé, other extraordinary mushrooms were discovered under the same circumstances. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T.

A whole family was drawn outside by the furious barking of the dog. They were then able to see an object of purple color moving at three meters from the ground and a strong smell of ammonia was felt. The object was spherical in shape and its diameter was about ten meters. It was possible to distinguish two occupants, as the UFO was partially transparent. The pilots looked like normal human beings. The observation lasted a few minutes, after which the craft suddenly rose and disappeared into space. (Keel 74) (A. SCHNEIDER-H.

A few days after the Americans had put their first occupied Apollo cabin into orbit, the Soviet Union had already launched a space vessel "Zond 5" towards the Moon, which was nothing more than a Soviet Soyouz without an orbital compartment. On October 19th, Cosmos 248 was propelled to 520 km in altitude by a Scarp rocket and began to orbit the Earth at an inclination of 62°. The following day, an identical rocket, launched from the same place, reached an orbit of the same inclination, but much higher; it evolved between 840 and 3380 km. After several trajectory corrections, Cosmos 249 passed in a flash above Cosmos 248 and exploded. At the moment, the NORAD specialists who recorded the explosion did not understand well. The radars recorded 81 different fragments in place of Cosmos 249, while they did not yet know that it was a decided explosion.

André Kesteleyn was at 04:00 in the morning at the bus stop of Steenakkerstraat, to go to work. He heard a whistling that was getting louder. He thought it was a fighter plane, but then he saw the UFO. It was a saucer with a dome and round windows that were lit up. The UFO was coming from the city and flew at a very high speed above the roofs of the houses. For a fraction of a second the object stopped in front of the witness. The object was very close, the witness hoped to see the "pilots" through the windows, but he saw no movement. When the bus arrived, he was still shocked by what he had just experienced. For the record: since this observation, André Kesteleyn has never been sick again, not even a cold.

Famous case of "Doctor X", born in 1930, biologist and musician. The doctor was awoken shortly before 04:00 in the morning by the crying of his 14-month-old baby. He found the child very excited, making gestures towards the window. Through the shutters the doctor saw flashes of light but didn't really pay attention and gave the baby a bottle of water. It was raining very hard. There were more flashes coming from the south, but no thunder. When he opened a window onto the terrace he saw two disk-shaped objects, horizontal, silver-white on top, bright red underneath. On top there were several vertical and one horizontal antenna and a white beam illuminating the fog beneath the disks, which were approaching each other until they made contact, the beams overlapping, the flashes ceasing while the two objects merged. After a while the disk turned vertical, swept the house with a beam of light, there was a kind of explosion and the disk left behind a whitish glow slowly dissipated by the wind. In the following days the doctor noticed that not only had the bruise he had sustained disappeared, but also the after-effects of a wound he had received during the Algerian War. However, he had lost weight, felt very disoriented and after a day of cramps and abdominal pain, he developed a triangular pigmentation around his navel. Now, in the night of November 13-14 the same triangle appeared on the baby's belly. This pigmentation remained visible for 2 or 3 days before disappearing. But its appearance was recurrent each year, as it was filmed again in 1985. (Michel Aimé 1969; Lob/Gigi 1975; Jacques VALLEE: "Autres dimensions" - trad. Robert Laffont 1989 - p. 198 to 200) etc..

From 18:58 to 20:00, 20 passengers of the "Armor" train observed the maneuvers of a white luminous ball that followed the train. This ball of intense brightness moved on a trajectory that faithfully followed that of the train. It went up and down, sometimes passing a few hundred meters in altitude, sometimes at ground level. Near the agglomerations it lingered above the houses, then caught up with the train a little further on. At Lamballe it stopped vertically to resume its curious game until its arrival in Rennes where it took altitude and suddenly disappeared into the clouds. (M.FIGUET/ J.L.

On his night patrol around the buildings of the "Ultrasonic" factory, Mr. Drivière was very surprised to hear a high-pitched and powerful voice say: "700 K... 700 K... 700 K". Believing he was dealing with pranksters, he circled the building, when the same voice again uttered the words "700 KA". He then observed the object 100 or 150 meters away from him, moving quickly from the south-east to the north-west. (M.FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - Ed.

Apollo VIII: presence detected of a space disc during the circumlunar voyage. (Philippe SCHNEYDER: "Ovni, premier bilan" - ed. du Rocher 1983, p. 233) On December 21, at 6 pm a mysterious, luminous object remained visible for about an hour and moved towards the west. The object was photographed at 7:26 pm by the photographic telescope of Professor Furia of the Campo dei Fiori Observatory. The "Corriere della Sera" of December 22, 68 reported: "...the specialists were unable to give any explanation to this phenomenon, at least one of them located it in a hypothetical field." (S. DELLO STROLOGO: "Ce que les Gouvernements vous cachent sur les S.V." De Vecchi 1975 p. 186-187) Apollo 8, Dec. 1968 (Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, William A. Anders) Frank Borman and Jim Lovell reported the presence of a "bogie" (ghost) at fifteen kilometers altitude. (J. Allen HYNEK and Jacques VALLEE: "Aux limites de la réalité" - ed. Albin Michel 1978, p84) During this flight, at the moment when the command module emerged from behind the moon, Lovell transmitted: "We have just been informed that Santa Claus exists!". As it was the eve of Christmas, most people on earth understood that it was a message given with Lovell's humor, for the many children watching television. Others suppose that this term, used for the first time by Walter Schirra in the Mercury 8 flight, has another meaning. The eve of Christmas Borman and Lovell nevertheless reported having seen a UFO.

(Before the 20th) The primary school students saw a UFO at close range and were all scared. They noticed a window and an antenna on the saucer-shaped object which hovered at low altitude around a clump of poplars making a kind of "tic-tac" sound. It was as big as half the school swimming pool. The children had reported the object to their teacher. Suddenly the object shot up and flew off in the direction of Hastings, leaving behind a trail of vapor. In Hastings a teacher saw for about ten minutes an object making a kind of come-and-go motion. The nearby aerodrome and civil aviation in Napier confirmed that at the time of the sighting there were no planes in flight in that region. (Bruce CATHIE/ P.TEMM: "Harmonic 695" - ed.

As he approached, a being emerged from behind the object and circled around to meet him. It was a humanoid about five and a half feet tall with a youthful face and long hair. It was wearing a silver-colored material. A conversation ensued in English, which may have lasted three minutes, during which the being declared it was from Saturn. After that, it ran back to the object, which rose about fifteen feet, stayed stationary for a moment, then took off. The man had time to take four photos before it disappeared.

Two people in a car saw a bright disc in the sky. They slowed down, stopped to get a better look, as it moved in sudden jumps and rapid maneuvers. Finally it descended behind the trees and the witnesses continued on their way. However, on the part of the journey between Burford and Stratford one of the witnesses understood surprising news which she described as "Nature" and "Reality" and which were related to the appearance of this bright disc. After dinner at friends that evening, she went out and saw a strange silhouette and she was seized with a cold panic. It had goat or dog legs, was covered in a silky, dark and shiny fur in the darkness. It was crouching and staring at her with green grape-colored eyes without blinking, slit upwards and without pupils: its eyes shone and it was frightening. It had pointed ears and a long muzzle. If it had stood up it must have been 1.50m tall, its hands and fingers were thin like sticks. The witness went back inside to let her panic pass. She then went to see if the creature was still there: it was but had moved further into the shadows. The witness then did not dare pass near that window for the rest of the evening and linked the appearance of this creature to the observation of the bright disc.

Around 10 pm there had been a noise near the house, "like something hitting metal". Larry, his father and a relative, Arnold Hubbard, went out to see what it was. Then from the other side of the house, they heard rustling in the grass. "We went to get a flashlight," said Larry, "and then we saw... The monster emerged from the bush about 15 meters away. It was walking towards us and seemed to be more than three meters tall, with shoulders about a meter and a half wide, and arms as long as a monkey's." In the light of the flashlight the body seemed hairy and rather brown, the eyes shone above a nose that Larry said he couldn't describe. The teeth protruded, the ears pointed. (...) "The thing put me in a kind of trance," said Larry. "I couldn't speak." When Larry shone the flashlight on the monster, it fell to the ground and disappeared. Then a few minutes later, they heard it again, near the garage. Frightened, Larry's father went back home and brought a .22 long rifle and passed it to Hubbard. As the men crossed the fields, the monster suddenly stood up, clearly visible, fifteen meters away. Larry shone the flashlight on it and Hubbard fired. The first shot hit. The monster gave a horrible cry. (...) Then, inexplicably, in front of the three men, the "creature" was suddenly enveloped in a white mist. In less than a minute the mist disappeared, then darkness.

The beings were 1.1 meters tall, wearing metallic-looking suits with ringed joints at the shoulders, elbows and knees. The helmet was round with a tube at its base. They spoke an incomprehensible language in a hoarse and guttural voice. As Hanse and Joana approached, they returned to the craft by floating. One of them directed a weapon resembling a blowtorch at Machado, from which a red-bluish flame emerged, hitting him in the knee. The witness fell. Many witnesses saw the craft take off.

Luis Flozino had been married for nine years and was the father of eight children. At 5:40 in the morning, after finishing his breakfast, he was rolling his first cigarette of the day when he heard a noise of branches being crumpled in the nearby woods. Without transition he felt himself seized by a force that was pulling him out of the house, whose door was open, and dragging him in a semi-suspended state in the air. In his efforts to free himself he was braking with his feet on the ground and was losing his shoes. This force was irresistibly taking him to a small wood 200 m away. There he realized that all this was the work of two strange beings, about 140 cm tall, and "very ugly" by our usual standards. Their eyes were asymmetrical, their hair on their shoulders, a beard that covered the lower part of their face, he was seized again while these creatures were talking between them. He received three blows on his right ear, but Flozino, a strong man, managed to free himself. He was getting up, still dizzy, while the unknowns were coming back to the attack. He decided to face them, but they were agile. He still managed to knock them down one on top of the other. They exchanged some words between them and said to him in Portuguese: "Now we are leaving, because with you we cannot..." They were turning on their heels at the same time and were entering the wood without hurrying. The witness, furious at this aggression, pursued them, caught up with them and seizing their long oily hair tied them together by knotting them. These beings continued their way imperturbably without undoing their hair. The thickets in which they were progressing easily prevented Flozino from following them, so he had to give up the pursuit. The dog that accompanied Flozino everywhere had first started to bark furiously, then to howl and to roll on the ground moaning.

In the fields, 20 m away from him, he saw a disc-shaped object resting on the ground on a tripod. Around the ramp of the craft stood three small beings: one was holding a tube about 35 cm long and was illuminating the henhouse with this instrument that emitted a pink light up to 250 m. A second one was looking into a "box" camera, the third one had a tube, longer than the first one, and was using it to examine the ground. When the witness turned around to alert other people, these beings finally noticed his presence. They were wearing a shiny metallic-looking suit and short boots. Immediately the craft took off. Duration of the incident: 3 minutes. (CICOANI - Brazil) (vog: now follows a completely different version….:)
Jose Antonio Fioco (...) became the witness of several successive UFO landings near his farm. In one particular case (...) he was able to give details about the object and its occupants. (...) Fioco revealed that on several occasions he had noticed interferences in the images received by his television. This is how he had noticed that the programs of channel 4 of the Sao Paulo station were sometimes replaced by images showing women with strange clothes that went down to their feet and a kind of ruff around their face, as well as helmeted men, all of small size. These beings were speaking in a curious unknown language, which resembled the idiom of a Hungarian who had stayed for some time in the countryside with words containing very few syllables. The voice was deep and the phrases badly pronounced. The images received were unstable, blurry, rarely clear. The whole family was able to witness these strange interference phenomena.

Mr. and Mrs. X and their two daughters were lying down around 4 o'clock in the morning when an intense light coming from outside woke up the father and the whole family. From the window of the house, at the entrance of the beach, near the woods, they saw an object flying at their height at 60 m of distance. It had an octahedral shape with a semi-spherical dome, two kinds of antennas on the upper part of the dome, several portholes and three support points similar to legs. It measured from 5 to 6 m long and about the same in height. Its aspect was metallic, very bright, of a celestial blue. It descended slowly swaying and landed on the 3 legs. A light beam came out of the object and three beings of humanoid aspect descended through this beam which gave the impression of a solid inclined plane. They could not distinguish the features of their faces. They measured 2 m in height. A kind of suit covered their whole body, the gloves and shoes forming a whole with the garment, which had a vertical line all along resembling a closure and one could see like a kind of metal badge on their chest. They walked on the beach: each of them placed in the sand ten small tubes which must have had 10 cm in diameter and 25 cm in length, according to the traces found later. They then picked up the black stones (pumice stone) that were in that place so that the next day the witnesses could not find any more. Then, these beings dressed in dark blue picked up each of their 10 small tubes and went back into the object. The object rose diagonally swaying. During the observation a suction noise was heard. The witness's watch stopped at 04:38 marking the end of the observation. The witnesses had desquamations which healed three days later.

Next to the object and in the tunnel he saw about ten individuals: they looked like clouds without outlines and seemed to be floating, about 130 cm tall and 30 to 40 cm wide. The witness wanted to call the police but realized he couldn't move. (UFO INFORMATION No. 6 - 1972)

At 10:30 PM Marcel Baud was at the doorstep along with the Pointurier couple, Alcide Pointurier and Jean-Marie Reddat. Suddenly it seemed to them that a farm was burning a few hundred meters away. As there were no buildings in that direction, it seemed strange to them. Looking carefully, they saw that the phenomenon was moving slowly to the right in front of the ridges separating Evillers and Septfontaines. It was a black, rectangular object with symmetrically 4 or 5 openings in the lower part and 4 or 5 openings in the upper part. These openings were of a dark red color illuminating the black rectangular mass. The phenomenon was advancing at a very low altitude. Observation until 10:45 PM: it passed behind a house and was not seen again. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 330)

On the Chanturgue hill, Mrs. B. observed in the afternoon three small human shapes. They were of a uniform grey color and "squat". The three gnomes did not touch the ground and seemed to jump several times before moving horizontally all at once, then returning to their original place, still without coming into contact with the inclined ground. These three silhouettes made these maneuvers together for 3 to 4 minutes, then disappeared literally on a horizontal movement forward. (Continued: October 1969, same place) (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

BRAZIL, Bebedouro (Belo Horizonte)
José Antonio da Silva, a military man, was fishing in a lagoon north of Belo Horizonte and saw shapes moving behind him. He saw a flash of light hit his legs and felt a numbness that made him drop his fishing rod and fall to his knees. He was seized by two masked individuals, about one meter twenty tall, wearing metallic suits, who took him to a machine resembling a vertical cylinder. Inside, the beings gave him a mask similar to theirs and tied him up before taking off. The higher the aircraft flew, the harder it was for the soldier to breathe. He felt a fatigue similar to paralysis. After what seemed like an interminable journey, the aircraft landed with a jolt. He was untied but a band was put on his mask and they dragged him, his knees scraping the ground. He was placed on a seat without a back and the band was removed. He found himself in a room about 9 by 13 meters, 4.5 meters away from a robust dwarf who fixed him with an obvious satisfaction. The dwarf was very hairy. He had green eyes. Other similar dwarves arrived, until there were 15 of them. The three walls in front of him had neither door nor window. On the left, a platform held the corpses of four men, one of them black. He had to drink from a stone cube with an inverted pyramid carved into it, a dark green liquid. On the left wall there were paintings of animals, vehicles and very earthly houses. The dwarves examined his fishing equipment and took a double of each item: one of each type of hook, one banknote. A conversation by signs was established with the chief dwarf. At one point José Antonio had a vision of an entity resembling Christ. Then he was taken back. He lost consciousness and woke up alone near the town of Victoria, in the state of Espirito Santo, three hundred and sixty kilometers from where he was fishing. Four and a half days had passed.

In the morning around 7:30am, Georges Kaiser went out to his tractor. (...) He crossed the farm yard when he had the sensation of an unusual presence. Surprised, he saw 6m away from him a being who, for two minutes, paid him no attention. It was at least 2.50m tall, standing but leaning forward. Its arms were the same length as a normal man's and its musculature seemed very developed. It had no neck, its head resting directly on its shoulders. Its hands had normal fingers (...) It had long hair falling down the back of its massive head. Its whole body was covered in hair, except for its face which was black and the palms of its hands too. Georges (...) made a movement to retreat, which drew the attention of the being. It immediately emitted a growl and turned around to flee. It jumped over the ditch bordering the road and disappeared. It was running at an astonishing speed. (Jean FERGUSON: "Les Humanoïdes..." - ed. Leméac, Ottawa 1977, p. 164)

José Perreira Sacramento lives at 190, P. Eustaquio Street, last house on the street. Around 1:00 AM the witness was woken up by a rumbling engine and he thought his scooter was being stolen. Hurriedly getting up he went to check: the scooter was still there, but now he heard the dog growling. He was heading towards the animal when he saw a luminous spot on the ground and looking up he saw a dark circular object hovering at about 500 m altitude. Very quickly the object grew bigger, as if it was descending, and scared the witness wanted to run back to the house: he was unable to move. When it reached 1 m from the ground, the witness saw an opening of one meter diameter and he was sucked inside into a circular compartment of about 14 m diameter brightly lit. Standing in this place he saw to his right and left a group of three small beings each time, 80 cm tall, sitting on round stools without legs. They were covered with a kind of flexible fabric wrapping the head and the visible part of the body: only the thorax. These beings had a language made of grunts and yaps and were only occupied with a panel in front of each of them. This lasted about 5 minutes. Then, the light increased even more in intensity and the witness lost consciousness. He woke up at 6:00 AM in his bed with pain in his shoulders and red and irritated eyes. (CICOANI - Brazil)

At 8:30 PM two children saw a bright object about 300 meters away. They grabbed a flashlight and sent signals. The object approached them until about 60 meters away. (10 meters and they could see an entity inside the object) The children called the rest of the family and the 13 (11) people living on the farm observed the light as it flew away and disappeared behind a hill, while the glow remained visible. The father, Arcesio Bermudez, 54 years old, took the flashlight and went to investigate. When Arceso returned, he was terrified. From a distance of less than 6 meters, he had seen a small being inside the upper part of the object which was transparent, while the rest of the vehicle was dark. He saw the being when he turned on his flashlight. The object became bright and flew away. (...) 48 hours after the observation Arcesio felt very ill, he was cold, his temperature dropped. He was unable to eat and had dark blue spots on his skin. There was blood in his stool. On the 7th day after the incident his family took him to Bogota(...)

Armstrong and Aldrin, after walking on the Moon, returning to the Lem to rejoin Apollo 11, would have exchanged surprising remarks picked up by North American amateur radios and censored by NASA which, for this purpose, often retransmitted with a difference of 5 seconds the words of the cosmonauts (according to journalist Sam Pepper in the Canadian newspaper National Bulletin of September 29, 1969). (...) On their return Aldrin and Collins confirmed that on their way to the Moon they saw a huge cylindrical craft orbiting between their capsule and the lunar surface and Collins declared himself "shocked by the traces on the Moon." (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "The Enigma of E.T." - ed. Guy TREDANIEL 1995, p. 36, 37) Apollo 11, July 1969 (Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin) It is supposed that two UFOs were hovering at the moment when Armstrong was about to descend the ladder of the LEM placed in the Sea of Tranquility. The magazine "Modern People" says that Aldrin took some photos, which they published in their June 1975 issue. They would have obtained these photos from a Japanese source. (..) The halos seen around the astronauts is due only to a reflection on their spacesuits. (...) Timothy Good writes that HAM radio amateurs would have received VHF signals from the conversation, filtered by NASA: ("They are here and they are watching us") Timothy Good uses an excerpt from "SAGA UFO SPECIAL #3" as the source of his assertion. But the technical debriefing of Apollo 11 speaks of an object (debris?) very close to the Moon. Collins also said he felt a shock, but thought he might have imagined it. Armstrong also said that the distance was not evaluable, and therefore the size of the observed thing, either. They observed it with the telescope and found it more or less in the shape of an L: like an open suitcase. Or like two rings connected, difficult to specify, because the vision was very bad. (...) In his book "Carrying The Fire" astronaut Michael Collins makes no mention of this incident. (1989 - listing and research by Harvey S. Stewart)

The observation began shortly before 7:30 PM. Moonless night, visibility 20 km. Capt. Cullum and First Officer Faircloth had just taken off for a routine flight on a Bristol-cargo of the Straits Air Freight Express, from Wellington to Blenheim. Suddenly the control tower calls: the airport radar has an unknown object located 6.4 km in front of the Bristol, which is flying at the time towards the north, then turns towards the west facing the coast, then towards the southwest towards Blenheim. It is at this moment that Faircloth locates a fluorescent, blue, bright, pulsating light, on the right rear of the Bristol at about 3.2 km. The radar is informed. The UFO flies very slowly, from 92 to 111 km/h. Its light pulses every two or three seconds and is as bright as a first magnitude star. It is heading south. During the return flight, 90 minutes later, Faircloth spots the same object resembling a group of lights, about 24 km off the coast of South Island, near the Cape Campbell lighthouse. The Wellington radar confirms the observation. (Henry DURRANT: "The UFO File" - Laffont 1973 - p. 182)

Suddenly, near the wood, about 150 m away, they saw an object on the ground, with three men outside, who were bent over, and two inside the craft, with their backs to them. The men were tall, about 2.30 m, and thin, wearing suits. The craft was oval and about 5 m high. The witnesses remained motionless observing for 10 minutes, then turned around to go and get the husband. When they returned to the spot with him, everything had disappeared. (J.C.

The witness was walking his dog around 8 pm. Suddenly a craft appeared in the sky: it came from the north and moved in a sparkle without emitting any sound. It stopped, its shape was triangular. "This extraordinary delta wing had a murky luminosity, a mix of white and blue around the tail, a bit like the glows of neon lights in the city at night. The hull was a mix of dark red and dark yellow. Suddenly a second craft appeared and placed itself to the left of the first one, still motionless. It had an identical structure, but the fuselage was illuminated. This second object stayed motionless for a few minutes before disappearing all at once. An astonishing disappearance. The object was no longer detectable. The craft that had appeared first was still there, motionless, with its emissions of light and sparks. It was facing me slightly inclined. How long did I stay there? I don't know, five minutes? It was my dog pulling on the leash that made me realize I had my feet on the ground." (Jean-Marie DOUCHET - Nostra - 19.11.1980)

Jacques Yerna, 16 years old, on horseback, saw at around 7:45 PM, 4 blinking lights arranged in a square, in a straight line, slowly, without any noise, hovering between 50 and 100 meters in altitude. White flashes of light at irregular intervals, suggesting a round shape. Arriving at a small grove of birches of 100 x 30 meters slightly elevated, the horse shivered and pricked up its ears. Suddenly, from the corner of the wood, from a field of beets, an electric flash of the same type as those emitted by the craft. He turned in that direction and saw, vertically above the trees, at an elevation of 10°, a black round shape with a small dome, motionless, with 4 red blinking lights arranged in a square. This second object seemed to be of smaller dimensions than the first and was about 6 to 7 meters long and 2 to 3 meters high. Suddenly, the second object moved very quickly and placed itself at 60 or 70 meters behind the first: the 8 red blinking lights then flew together in a straight trajectory. Total duration of the observation 15 minutes. At 100 meters beyond the witness encountered a car stopped with all lights off and a man standing about thirty meters away in a field looking south. At this moment the horse suddenly became very afraid, as did the witness, and so he returned directly to the stable. (Inforespace n° 8, pp. 14-16 - 1973 - SOBEPS)

At 6:15, in the place called "Les Longues Raies", the road worker Amédée Luquet saw, in the morning fog, 150 m away in a meadow a bright white light partially hidden by a hedge. A lighthouse rises and finally a dark mass (black ovoid block 12 m long or the size of a 4CV according to one or the other of the two investigators) dotted with red lights (6 to 10 for the investigator M. Lesbros) (5 to 6 for MM. Barthel and Brucker) Everything is strongly lit. The craft made a loop that brought it almost above Mr. Luquet at an estimated height of 50 meters. It made a complete loop and disappeared in the direction of Buicourt. At the closest, the witness heard a noise similar to that made by the wind in the foliage and a slight whistle. The cows in the meadow had no reaction. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 331, 332)

Very many witnesses, including military personnel, observed the landing of a 6m diameter disc. On top, a lid lifted and two beings of about 1m10 emerged, while two others remained inside in a kind of glass cabin. Their complexion was greenish, they wore aluminum clothing and a helmet from which a rubber tube emerged. Through this tube, rough sounds were heard. They seemed to show a globe to the witnesses and something that fell. As the closest spectator smoked, they seemed intrigued and attracted the packet with their hand like a magnet. Men arrived shouting. The two beings then retreated without looking back and floated in the air to enter the craft. When the last one was half introduced, he directed a kind of blowpipe at the closest witness and a blue-red ray reached the young man's legs, paralyzing him. Then the craft took off. The two little beings had yellow eyes without pupils or whites, the end of their nose was flattened and their teeth interlocked with each other. Crushed vegetation and visible furrows on the landing area. (Pierre VIEROUDY: "These UFOs that announce the Superman" - Laffont 1979, p. 101, 102)

(...) (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "L'énigme des E.T." - éd.

On the first day of the trip, the astronauts informed the Ground Control that two flashing lights were seen above the capsule. After rejecting the possibility that they were spinning debris from the Apollo booster, the ground suggested that they might be protection panels dropped. "It could be," replied one of the astronauts, "but one of those lights just passed here at a dizzying speed". It is however reasonable to think that they were indeed debris from one or the other satellite, not always American, orbiting on a different orbit. (1989 - listing and research by Harvey S. Stewart) Ground observatories observed the capsule accompanied by two bright UFOs near the Moon. Then, on approach to Earth before landing, a large UFO with red lights was observed.

At around 5 pm, the witness was waiting at her window to feed the pigeons she usually feeds every day. Coming from her right, in front, at the level of the roofs, behind a chimney she saw a transparent dome with two heads visible. At first she had no reaction, went back to the kitchen and suddenly, surprised, she returned to the window. From behind the chimney, the object slowly emerged from its hiding place: a curved metal disc in grey, with a transparent dome from which only the heads of the two occupants were visible. Numerous lights like car headlights composed the underside of the craft. "But it's a saucer," she said out loud. And she heard, as if whispered from the outside to her ear: "Yes, it's a saucer, don't be afraid, you have to look." The two beings looked at each other, turned their heads towards the witness with a smile, then their heads disappeared inside the craft. In front of a tall chimney, on its trajectory, the object performed a loop. At the same time, two other UFOs, entirely identical to the first, with two humanoid figures visible, skimmed the roofs at 70 m from her. The first object joined the two others and the formation moved away towards the Rue d'Amerval (NO). The witness then wanted to warn her neighbors, but when she turned around she saw herself in the mirror and was stunned to see that her face and hands were swollen and that a bump, as big as a pigeon egg, adorned her forehead. (In 1978 a red scar still persisted). The swelling and the bump disappeared half an hour after the observation. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed.

At 8:30 PM it was pitch black and raining. Mr. Carlet saw in the middle of the road an immense white mushroom-like object, 3 m tall, that was moving. He noticed that the thing was moving at 50 cm from the ground. It seemed luminous and ghostly, its contours were sharp and its base undulated like it was striped. The thing was moving at the same speed as the motorist and he considered overtaking it, but there wasn't enough room. He then flashed his headlights to force the mysterious intruder, which was about 80 m away in headlight range but 20 m away in dipped beam range, to give way. He then played around with the lights, convinced of the unreality of what he was seeing. Suddenly he accelerated and drove through his "mirage" in order to play a trick on this hallucination!<br/><br/>
Alas! He actually drove into the thing. There was a metallic sound, the object passed over the hood, veered to the right, brushed against the windshield. The witness then braked and, turning his head, saw the thing outside the range of his headlights crossing the ditch and disappearing behind a wall. He returned home in the grip of a terrible headache. The next day he looked for the point of impact on his car: the hood was intact. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed.

At the same time (with the launch of the BMEWS alert satellites since Spring 1960) "IMEWS" (Integrated Early Warning System) were launched, equipped with two infrared cameras, one of which was equipped with a large diameter mirror, in order to discriminate between real rocket launches and simple reflections of the sun on clouds, which were the source of very numerous false alarms for the previous satellites. (...) The alert, if any, is transmitted to the nearest receiving station, in particular those of Guam or Australia. (...) These IMEWS are placed in geostationary orbit and not simply geosynchronous like those of the BMEWS. They are huge drums 3 m high and 3 m in diameter flanked by four solar panel panels giving them a wingspan of 7 meters. ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed.

(Source: From Our UFO Visitors, by John Magor) It was close to five o'clock in the morning when Miss Doreen Kendall, a nurse at the Cowichan District Hospital, noted that one of the strangers in her care was agitated. Deciding that he was too hot, she opened the window. As she drew back the curtains, she was met with a flash of light in her eyes. It was still dark outside, and about 20 m away, above the children's pavilion to her left, there was a large luminous object, lighting up the area as if it were broad daylight. It was a circular object, the base was silver, but like a ball. All around it were lights in a necklace. The dome was transparent, made of glass and she could see inside. There were two figures, men, she thought. The one in front seemed taller, or was on a raised part. She looked on with immense curiosity but without any fear. Their heads were in something dark, tightly closed. She saw the craft rise, tilting, and she saw the figures from head to knees and they seemed to be facing chairs. They wore tight clothing of the same color as what they wore on their heads, but their hands were free and seemed human, with skin like that of the Earthlings. She saw a kind of panel, like a huge dashboard, going from the back of the object to the top, as if embedded in metal. This is how she forgot about Nurse Frieda Wilson, who was in the same room. She felt that she must not make any noise, nor call her colleague. The man in front slowly turned towards her, but his face was also covered, he touched the other man on the back, and the latter deliberately maneuvered a kind of lever and the saucer began to rotate slowly, still close to the building.

Aarno Heinonen, 36 years old, and Esko Viljo, 38 years old, were skiing in a forest 16 km north of Heinola. At 4:45 PM, as the sun was beginning to set, they decided to rest. A kind of buzzing sound was then heard and, looking up, Heinonen saw in the air a light of strong intensity that began a wide turn and came in their direction. It descended and stopped right in the space, surrounded by a kind of luminous grayish mist that manifested itself by pulsations, 15 m from the witnesses. Through the mist they saw an object of metallic appearance, the base of 3 m in diameter had three globes on a rim and in the middle a kind of large tube of about 25 cm in diameter. The mist gradually dissipated and when the object descended to 4 m from the ground the buzzing stopped. A beam of light came out of the central tube and a creature of about 90 cm appeared at ground level in this tube of light. Its face was pale like wax, on the head it wore a shiny conical helmet, and it was dressed in a light gray overalls that shone. The humanoid was wearing green boots. In his hand he held a black box from which a blinding flash suddenly emerged. The mist reformed around the object and the illuminated circle emitted green and red sparks. The fog thickened, the light trembled like the flame of a candle and returned to the tube. Then it was as if the mist scattered and everything had disappeared. Heinonen felt weak, paralyzed on the right side. It took them two hours to cover the 2 km that separated them from the village. He had headaches, vomiting, his blood pressure dropped, his balance affected. He was cold, despite the sedatives he had very sore neck, stomach and back for a while and could not return to work. Viljo had a red and swollen face and lost his sense of balance. He felt a kind of lightness in his legs and his chest and hands were covered with red spots.

The witness, having parked his car, began his usual jogging session in this rural area. After a journey, he followed a field with wide furrows. Suddenly he saw a vertical wall of blue and fluorescent light as if placed on the furrows. The shape of this wall of light was regular, a few meters from the path. Despite his astonished fear, the witness approached this palisade of light which, suddenly, collapsed like a mass of light snakes, forming a single entity with interruptions whose ends were like cut off. This wriggling agglomerate stretched like a rope and flew undulating through the fields, progressing in waves, as if it followed the height and hollows of the furrows taken across. Then, without stopping, it disappeared towards a wooded area. The witness then discovered the traces of the phenomenon on the crest of the furrows. He returned the next evening to the scene without discovering or observing anything. (J. G. DOHMEN: "To Identify and the Adamski Case" - ed. Guy Dohmen, Biarritz 1972, p. 85)

Saturday, early evening, around 7:30 PM. Mr. Herbosch was walking in the middle of Avenue de la Réserve when his gaze was drawn to something faintly luminous, about 20 meters in front of him, to his left, on the vacant lot, raised at this point by about 75 cm. It was then 7:45 PM. The witness stopped and saw that it was a kind of "stain on the ground", oval in shape, several meters in size, 7 or 8 meters at first glance, which suddenly became very bright, like a phosphorescent light green color. (...) He was looking for the lamp or light source that should have produced such an effect. Indeed, it was logical, only a powerful projector could have been the source of this stain on the ground. But no beam of light or any device was visible. There was NOTHING. Suddenly, when he was barely 10 meters away from this stain, the witness stopped dead in his tracks, so much so that what he saw seized him, bewildered him and scared him. (What follows took place in 20 or 30 seconds maximum). The stain became brighter and brighter; it seemed to vibrate, then it swelled or inflated, a bit like a balloon, first laid flat on the ground, then suddenly inflated. The luminous bell thus formed grew even more, and the top reached a height of about 5 meters. It also looked a bit like the dome that could be seen on old steam locomotives. The coloration became almost blinding and the green color became paler, tending more towards neon white. This mass of light vibrated in a frightening way but still kept a clear bell shape and seemed to be made up of thousands of tiny luminous particles moving and swarming in all directions inside the bell. This gave the impression of terrible nervousness. When it reached its maximum height, this insolent apparition violently illuminated the whole landscape, as well as the curtain of trees at the end of the vacant lot. These trees, which are about 100 meters from Avenue de la Réserve, were illuminated in their entire height, as if by a flash of extraordinary power. Mr. Herbosch was also able to notice through the bell which was translucent despite the strong brightness, that the base was perfectly elliptical. The spectacle was quite frightening, all the more so since it took place in total silence. No heat effect or smell was noticed. At that moment, in the face of this quite unusual and unknown phenomenon to him, Mr. Herbosch was seized by extreme fear, but he stayed there, frozen, paralyzed in front of this strange scene. Immediately after illuminating the landscape, which lasted a few seconds, the bell suddenly collapsed or deflated to take its initial form of a stain, identical to what it was at the beginning of the observation. The brightness became weak again and again of a pale green color. Then the stain moved on the ground of the vacant lot and moved away from the witness (perhaps at 10 or 15 km/h) and disappeared towards the northwest, in the direction of a villa under construction at the time..

Leona Nielson was with two friends in her mountain cabin. They had had a pleasant evening and had gone to bed around one o'clock in the morning. But Leona couldn't fall asleep. Her room faced the Flat River flowing down the hill. Suddenly the room was brightly lit by a light coming from below and she went out onto the balcony to see what it was. She then saw, in the field on the edge of the river, an enormous flying saucer about 20 meters in diameter with a platform 2 meters wide all around it. Two strange beings were busy on this platform as if they were making a repair, and probably using electric welding, as sparks could be seen. These beings were of normal size, bareheaded, wearing white overalls and seemed to walk and work like human beings. With her two friends who had joined her, Leona watched the repair which lasted for nearly an hour, then the sparks stopped. The two humanoids went back into their saucer, it immediately started off at a fantastic speed and disappeared into the clouds.

Nicolas Santos was driving when he could follow the maneuvers of an object of discoidal shape surrounded by portholes and surmounted by a dome. A reddish halo surrounded this thing that came to stop two hundred meters from the witness. Suddenly, under the object appeared several beams of bright light directed towards the ground. (...) "Suddenly the object started to move. It was something extraordinary. It gathered its light beams like a bird gathers its wings. The light folded in on itself gently and simultaneously the halo surrounded the craft again and it moved away."
Following the observation, the witness had to be treated for conjunctivitis. That night, for an undetermined cause, there was a power outage in the dam's installations. (Jean-Marie DOUCHET - Nostra - 24.12.1980) It was, the witnesses said, something extraordinary, an enormous disc of about 15 m in diameter and 3 m high, flying horizontally, "majestically" and without noise. Very slowly, impressive to behold. The spectacle lasted 3 hours. It was evolving at an altitude of about 200 meters. A dozen powerful light beams illuminated the ground: a very particular light, very similar in intensity to fluorescent light, but of a slightly yellow-greenish color. On the side of the craft, portholes were faintly lit. Fairy spectacle more than frightening since one of the main witnesses, Mr. Santos Nicolas, a teacher in Guijo de Grenadilla, said: "I couldn't believe it. It had been more than an hour that I could contemplate something wonderful, something so unusual that it really couldn't belong to our world..." This long observation caused the witness's vision to be altered, a burning sensation in the eyes. The ophthalmologist diagnosed conjunctivitis.

One night at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, I went out to do a natural need. The weather was nice, the sky was all clear. On the porch, I instinctively looked up and saw, in the sky, to the northeast, something huge higher than the moon. This thing was luminous, 1.30m high and 1m wide, more than 2m long. The object looked exactly like a transparent door suspended in the firmament. Its luminosity seemed to me similar to that of a cinema screen. I was very surprised and stayed in the courtyard for about ten minutes without moving. (...) I went into the room to wake up my two other companions, but they were sleeping deeply and I didn't succeed. As I was cold and scared, I didn't dare go out again to see the strange phenomenon. The next day I fell ill and, for three days, I had a headache, I was always feeling like vomiting. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials". ed. Mercure de France, 1983, p. 103)

Finally, there was the aborted Apollo 13 mission, which forced the return to Earth of the lunar module that was supposed to rest on the moon forever. Inside its sides, however, was a small nuclear generator (4 kilograms of plutonium) destined to power the scientific equipment that the astronauts were to deploy on the moon. This module fell into the Tonga Trench in the middle of the Pacific. The surveys that have been carried out since then fortunately show no modification of the underwater environment.

Joao Aguiar, a policeman, drew the attention of Mrs. Nazaré to what was happening in front of them in the sea: was a boat capsizing, with water spraying out in all directions? The occupants of the boat were in the water and gesticulating in their shiny clothes with something on their heads. They then seemed to be working on the boat's dome! It had a non-shiny metallic look and measured 4 to 6 meters. The policeman went to get help, Mrs. Nazaré and her family watched through binoculars. The phenomenon was 700 or 1000m away. After 20 minutes of immobility, the object approached a rocky outcrop 100m from the beach and stayed there for half an hour. Then it took off towards the southeast, gliding on the surface of the water with the sound of a motorboat. At that moment the policeman returned and observed the UFO with other witnesses. Its lower part was hexagonal with colored lights, green-yellow, white-red. Appearing metallic on the water, once in flight it seemed transparent and they saw two passengers seated inside. It disappeared silently. At the spot where the craft had been, one of the children saw a kind of white hoop, which disappeared, reappeared in the company of a yellow body, which floated half-emerged, it floated towards the beach and was followed by a green fringe. The yellow body made a 90° turn and left towards Gavea. The white hoop did the same and the witnesses lost sight of them. (Inforespace n° 8, p. 34, 35) Mrs. Maria Machado was looking out the window while preparing dinner and saw a gray disc, topped with a transparent dome, sailing on the ocean.

... one evening at 9 o'clock, my comrades and I were walking on the way back after a movie session. Hardly arrived in front of the improvised office on a deserted ground, we saw in the sky, in the northeast, a yellow lantern. More than ten people were already there to watch. (...) It was a luminous object in the shape of a hat inclined of 90°: its apparent diameter was more than one third of a meter. The whole seemed to be in a glass mask. The part of the dome appeared less transparent than the rest. The central part was brilliantly illuminated as if there was a powerful lamp inside. The luminosity remained stable during two minutes. When the object passed above us, it was at a hundred meters of the ground. My colleague Zhou Paizhong ... immediately had the idea to go and get a long view ... The object occupied the whole field of the eyepiece but we did not see the details of the inside of the luminous hat, which was heading towards the southwest and was getting further and further away, to finally become a small point in the eyepiece of our theodolite.

At around 5 pm, a UFO descended slowly from the sky and landed in a field (...) The witness is named Cheng Gangdang. He was in a field with his wife to pull out wild grasses, when they suddenly heard a strange noise above them. They looked up and saw an object flying as bright as a diamond. The object was transparent. Its diameter was about 3 arms. The bottom was pointed and the top was conical. Several lights were seen on the body of the object, like electric bulbs, which lit up in turn. Inside, it seemed that there were many instruments. The object flew quickly spinning on itself and it was surrounded by a misty halo. (...) The unknown object descended slowly near a fruit tree and landed without ceasing to spin like a top. This object did not make any noise when it turned (...) Its rotation speed resembled that of children's tops. On the ground it did not leave any clear traces. Ten minutes after its landing, the object raised a cloud of dust and it rose quickly spinning. First it moved back to the north, then when it reached a certain height in the sky, it flew away in a flash towards the south. In a blink of an eye it had disappeared.

He felt he was suddenly suspended in the air and made desperate efforts to get off his bicycle. This lasted a few minutes, he tried to scream, but no sound came out of his throat. Finally he felt the bike gently descend to the ground and started pedaling again but again he was lifted, but this time in complete silence. The episode otherwise resembled the first one.

Etienne Géry, 16 years old, an apprentice baker, decided in the afternoon to go for a walk with the hope of discovering mushrooms. He took a familiar route, climbing a small slope. He passed the summit, the vegetation was very dense at this time, the ferns almost reaching the size of a man. Suddenly, between the ferns he distinguished something abnormal: a kind of dome of metallic appearance was there barely 15 m from him. At first intrigued, he stopped, then driven by curiosity he took two more cautious steps. With a stick he parted the curtain of ferns. In doing so, he was dazzled by a very bright yellow-orange light emanating from three kinds of rectangular tiles located just under the dome. In any case, the intensity of the light was such that it seemed to him that the top of the dome was separated from the lower part of the object. Etienne's curiosity turned into intense fear. He felt paralyzed, unable to make a move, neither to advance nor to flee. The cupola suddenly began to rise slowly, followed by the shell and the whole of the machine emerged from the screen of ferns. The orange beam followed the ascent of the object and Etienne was no longer dazzled. He then distinguished 3 or 4 circular portholes in the middle of the lower part as if they were part of a row that would have gone around it. He estimated the length of the machine at 5 or 6 meters and the height at 2.50 m to 3 m and compared its mass to the importance of a Renault Estafette. On the dome he noticed 3 antennas: the one on the right measuring about 1.50 m, the one on the left inclined to the left 60 cm and the one in the middle standing vertically 45 cm. The antennas seemed rigid to him. They did not oscillate during the ascent. He did not perceive any silhouette behind the portholes. Suddenly the object began to rise, accompanied by a shrill whistle. On the underside four absolutely identical supports were as if they had come out of 4 holes. Each one ended with a flat or slightly convex sole, longer than wide. The four feet retracted into the lower part, the object tilted, took a normal attitude and moved away. During the elevation of the machine Etienne felt a feeling of heat. Once at an altitude of about 100 m the object took off at a lightning speed and disappeared in 2 or 3 seconds on the north-north-west horizon. (L.D.L.N.

It was 10:45 pm when the dogs started barking violently. When they went outside, the people found themselves in front of a two-meter-long rectangle standing on the ground. It could have been likened to a door or a window. It was visible on a moonless night and was luminous with a matte white that suggested a "screen" to the witnesses. The dogs stayed about fifteen meters away from the thing, attacking it from time to time with their hair standing on end. One of the two men present approached up to 10 meters and addressed the apparition in these terms: "What do you want? Who are you? Come on! Let someone come out!" The other went to get his gun. When he came back, the thing was off, it no longer existed... (Jean-Marie DOUCHET - Nostra - 18.2.1981)

At 10:50 PM, Evald Hansen Maarup, a police officer, was returning to his home in Knud, in a police car. Between Kabdrup and Fjelstrup, as he was driving down a slight dip, the witness recounts: I was driving alone in the patrol car. Suddenly the car was plunged into a light of whitish-blue and at the same time the engine stopped. All the lights of the car went out, even the ignition light. I pulled over to the side and stopped. The dazzling external light, like neon, was so blinding that I couldn't see anything. To protect myself from the light I covered my eyes with my arm and managed to find the radio by feeling around. When I had my hand on the microphone and tried to call the station, I noticed that the radio was just as dead as the rest of the electrical equipment on board. The temperature inside the car rose and became pleasantly warm. It was like driving in the sun in summer. After a while the light rose. It was a light in the shape of a cone, with a base of 4 to 5 m in diameter. As I looked up, leaning forward, I could see that the upper end of the luminous cone was at the base of a large gray thing. No sound came from this object. After a few seconds the light was drawn inside. It is difficult to explain how. The light did not go out but its inner surface rose in such a way that the space under the luminous cone was plunged into darkness. The light was pulled up in about five minutes. I got out of the car and saw how the last part of the cone of light disappeared inside the lower part of the thing, through a hole whose diameter was around a meter. When the light had disappeared inside the object it began to move. It disappeared in a few seconds, rising vertically into the air. It accelerated strongly, still without the slightest sound. As the object moved away all the lights of the car's electrical system came back on. (Henry DURRANT: The UFO File - Laffont 1973, pp. 140-142)

The television film had just finished when an intense whistling sound was heard, the image blurred. It was impossible to restore it. As it was late, the witness turned off the receiver and went to the garden door to find the cause of the whistling. Astonished, she saw in the middle of the garage driveway a thing equipped with many lights, near which a man was standing looking at the lucerne field. She was so scared that she went back and locked herself in. After a moment she heard the same whistling again. Soon after, looking out the window, the thing had disappeared. The craft was about the size of a car: 4 m wide, 2.50 m high, of which 60 cm for the supports. An ellipsoid silver with a transparent hemispherical dome, at the top a white-bluish light that turned slowly. On the circumference of the object a gallery of small lights of various colors: white, violet, yellowish. The man was about 1.80 m tall, was dressed in a tight dark garment, his head tightly in a bonnet of the same color. Around the wrists, ankles and waist, he wore shiny bracelets. He looked at the field and suddenly walked quickly towards the UFO. At the place where the craft landed the ground shone: up close there were dark marks, like boot prints. These traces persisted for several days: during the day they were black, at night they shone slightly. (STENDEK n° 11 - December 72 - p. 3 to 8)

This Sunday, Altamiro Martin de Freitas of the dam security was making his rounds in the rain. Around 9:30 PM he saw something floating in the air emitting multicolored lights. As he approached the object he noticed that all the lights belonged to a silent and motionless structure, shaped like an elongated shell or bus, floating one meter above the ground. There were 15 rectangular portholes, about one meter long and 80 cm wide, with rounded corners. The object must have measured 20 m long and 3 m high. He started to crawl and drew his 9.4 mm Taurus 38. He fired once at 12 m from the object, which started to blink faster. Aiming carefully, he fired a second time. The blinking rhythm became so fast that he could no longer distinguish the extinguishing. A higher-pitched sound than that of a jet engine was heard. He was about to fire a third time when the object emitted a light in the form of a very intense white-blue ray that blinded and completely paralyzed the witness. Taken to the Guanabara hospital, he gradually recovered his mobility, but he remained blind for more than ten days, although ophthalmologists could not detect any serious injury. The investigation revealed that at the place where Altamiro had seen the object, the ground was dry in the middle of a bog resulting from continuous rain. Moreover, a woman from the state of Minas Gerais experienced a similar adventure.

Lellier Case. Ms. Gabriel Lellier (59 years old) from Latourelle Street was the victim on October 5, 1970, of numerous physical discomforts, caused by a very bright object and a kind of vapor that she had seen from her apartment around 4:30 in the morning. She had gotten up because she could no longer sleep, as often happens to her. She headed to her living room to sit down; suddenly she saw bright orange beams entering her living room through the window that faced the house across the street and Laruelle Street. She rushed to the window and, looking up to the sky, she saw a very bright orange disc. She then realized that her gaze was fixed on the object, that she could not move, her body was completely paralyzed. After 30 seconds the object descended to almost the top of the house across the street. It had tripled in size. It was now surrounded by a very bright white halo that lit up the entire sky. In the center of the red ball, Ms. Lellier could make out a black object spinning quickly, giving her the impression that it was a camera. Thirty seconds later she saw the object rise up at a dizzying speed. Its ascent was accompanied by a long luminous trail. Ms. Lellier could now move and she headed to the door that opened onto the gallery, opened it, put her foot outside and suddenly saw a series of two or three small white clouds, floating in a kind of thick fog that was only in the back yard. Without wanting to, she entered the first cloud and immediately felt her throat seized. A horrible gas smell had taken her and in one go she felt suffocated. Feeling faint, she ran back into the house and collapsed onto her bed, losing consciousness. An hour and five minutes later she woke up and her eyes hurt terribly. Looking in the mirror she saw that her hair had turned yellow and she had the deep feeling of giving off electricity. (...) Health problems for weeks...

The cow was tied up not far from the paddock and the one-month-old calf was free at 5 m from its mother. The herd began to stir and moo, as well as the separated cow, which was looking at its calf with insistence. The calf also began to bellow. Astonished, the farmers saw the calf being carried in the air at 1 m from the ground, horizontally, towards the meadow, until a point at 20 m from its starting point, while they themselves felt paralyzed, unable to make a move. Suddenly, the calf, which was now silent, made a vertical ascent that lasted from 3 to 4 minutes, and suddenly disappeared from their sight in a cloud. (R.
