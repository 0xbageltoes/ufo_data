FRANCE, Toulx-Sainte-Croix (Creuse)
M. B. was awoken by an intense light that illuminated his room. Going to the window, he saw a luminous globe moving slowly and silently to the north of the village. The size of a full moon, the object then moved in various directions, stopping from time to time. The inside of the globe was dotted with multicolored luminous points. It remained visible for about half an hour. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p.257)

#1940, January 8th to 10th
Canada, near Lake Abitibi
(Note from vog: brief summary) L. Hormidas and Damase Landry were around 2:30 in the afternoon and -60° Fahrenheit on an expedition, snowshoeing through the snow. First they saw a nearly white wolf come out of the pine forest, the wolf stopped and sat on the snow looking at the pine forest from where it came. It was less than 35 meters away from the witnesses. Six small men, all the same, dressed in dark green, with slanted eyes and yellowish faces, came out of the woods. The wolf was bristling. The small men didn't seem to see the witnesses. They turned towards the wolf and pointed at it. They spoke very quickly among themselves. One of them advanced, up to a few feet from the wolf, raised his hand while pronouncing words. The wolf threw itself at the small man and tore him apart: limbs, entrails, all of it fell on the snow. No steam or vapor rose from the killed being, the 5 survivors didn't move and watched. Their breath didn't make any vapor either. Damase threw a dead branch towards the wolf which left howling. One of the small men took out a kind of bag from his clothing and started to gather the scattered pieces of the small creature killed. L. Hormidas, unable to take it anymore, vomited from disgust. The 5 small men left towards the pine forest. The two witnesses put on their snowshoes and followed them. It was easy: they left very small marks in the snow. They arrived at a big hollow in the ground, free of snow, and the tracks stopped there. On their way back to the scene of the drama, Damase found a small gelatinous rubber piece of the same color as the creatures' clothing. He wanted to give a piece to Hormidas, but he was unable to, even with an axe, cut it in two. (Jean FERGUSON: "Enigmes du temps présent" éd. Leméac, Ottawa, 19 79, p. 75 à 82)

BELGIUM, Liège
Mr. and Mrs. Delsa, ambulance drivers, returning from a mission, in an ambulance, were driving along Quai St Léonard at around 2:00 a.m. "The night was dark, the blackout being in effect. That's when I saw in the sky a luminous shape like two overturned plates, very large, followed by a long tail of fire. The object must have been about 300 meters high and its diameter was twice that of the full moon. Seeing this thing rushing straight towards us, I screamed in fear and asked my husband to accelerate. At that moment the object deviated from its trajectory, the trail disappeared and it seemed to pause. I didn't know what to think anymore, I was trembling all over. The phenomenon soon resumed its initial trajectory and the luminous trail reappeared. It disappeared in the south, towards the center of Liège. My husband had stopped the ambulance to try to calm me down because I had started to cry out of fear. I beg you to believe that that night I did not close my eyes."

#1940, Summer
DENMARK, Jutland
In the middle of the afternoon, a 15 year old boy was going to the watering hole with some cows, when he suddenly saw three curious characters advancing from the northeast. They were dressed in a dark green one-piece suit that even covered their neck and a good part of their face. The face seemed to be protected by a glass plate. From the shoulders to the feet there were two thick bulges of about ten centimeters. The three beings were of normal size but they were progressing by slightly swinging their arms in the manner of robots, the witness specified. At about thirty meters from the young Dane, they suddenly turned south and disappeared behind a hill. Our witness then rushed to this place and saw a shiny hemispherical object on the ground: near him, the three characters. Suddenly, without seeing any door open, the witness noticed that these characters had disappeared. The object emitted a sharp whistle like the one produced by quickly spinning a metal rod at high speed. The UFO rose slowly and after 6 to 7 seconds it took the direction of the southeast where it disappeared. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p.258)

CANADA, Dalesville (Québec)
Walter and William Gunn were observing at around 10:30 PM, a luminous object rising from a hill about 350 m away from them. With an apparent size equivalent to a full moon, this body seemed to be the lower part of a much larger dark mass on which two or three small lights were also visible. With a regular noise, it rose at an estimated speed of 80 km/h above the witnesses, brightly illuminated some nearby barns and disappeared between the mountain peaks.

M. Bracoval was suddenly woken from his sleep in the middle of the night. More than two thousand people in the bush were thus awakened by the noise that echoed for 60 km around. For the next half hour, it was as bright as day. What is more curious is that all the clocks and watches stopped at the precise time of the phenomenon and many of them never worked correctly again. The next day, bush runners were dispatched, but nothing abnormal was detected. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 - p.259)

#1941 (or 1942) Summer
NORWAY, Maroy/Nordhordland;
Irene Skram and her cousin, and independently the husband of the cousin and a friend, saw a silver disc around 11 o'clock in the morning, while the whole company was outside, admiring the plantations.
The disc was rising from the ground to 300 m from the witnesses, to the northeast of their position. Turning slowly on itself, it was rising gently up to about 100 m, altitude from which it seemed to descend again somewhat. It was followed by three opaque trails in the shape of a thin spiral.<br/><br/>
These things were falling towards the ground, detaching themselves from the disc. The two women then saw the disc disappear. But the two men, being at another point of the property, were heading towards the place where the "trails" had fallen, at about a hundred meters from the house. They found at this place, only three heather cocks, stunned, but still alive. Knowing that their neighbors were raising birds, they went to ask if they were missing three?
It was the case. The witnesses did not talk about the flying saucer with the neighbors. The saucer had been seen for about two minutes, it seemed to have 10 m in diameter. The "trails" each had a length of about 12 to 15 meters, and were separated from each other by 5 to 6 meters. (Ole Jonny Brænne)

#1941, Autumn
NORWAY, Skar/Osteroy;
People had gone to the cinema. The evening was calm, the sky clear and well starred. Suddenly they saw a luminous phenomenon to the west, flying towards the northwest, at very high speed. The phenomenon looked like a huge ball of fire and at first, they thought it was a bolide. But then, the phenomenon slowed down and seemed to hover above Osterfjorden - in reality, from their position, the witnesses overlooked the phenomenon and saw it below them. It was visible for about half a minute, no sound was heard. (UFO, 2/1992, 9. Listing of Ole Jonny Braenne) (note from vog: Peenemunde is not so far away, is it?)

Mrs. Concepcion Cuenca, widow of Contador from Seville, was 13 years old in 1941. Walking with her father and brother on the road between Belmez and Valsequillo at 5 o'clock in the morning, they were suddenly illuminated by a light that seemed to be in the air. The intensity and brightness exceeded anything she had seen as light since. The phenomenon lasted only a second in total. All three intrigued, yet none made any comment as they continued on their way. (investigation by Ignacio Benvenuty Cabral, Seville)

Austrian inventor, Victor Schauberger, who lived from 1885 to 1958, is said to have built the first saucers for the Third Reich. The first models had a diameter of 1.50 m and weighed 135 kg. More advanced models followed, with a saucer designed for a crew of three as early as 1945-1946. At the liberation (end of the Second World War), the Americans seized both the work and the person of Schauberger, who was forced to work on a military base in Texas until his death.

#February 25, 1942
USA, Los Angeles
At precisely 2:00 am, diners at the Trocadero Club in Hollywood were surprised to see all the lights go out while sirens screamed the alarm throughout and around Los Angeles. Searchlights began to scan the sky, anti-aircraft batteries opened fire. In the following hours more than 1400 shots were fired at a single unidentified object, slowly passing through the sky. It resembled a blimp or a balloon. It was the 65th Coast Artillery (Anti-Aircraft) Regiment from Inglewood and the 205th Anti-Aircraft Regiment from Santa Monica that were shooting. The "cigar-shaped white" object received some bullets, but continued its imperturbable flight towards the east. Ground observers would have counted up to 25 silver UFOs.

The editor of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, Peter Jenkins, wrote: "I clearly saw the V-formation of 25 'silvery planes' (silver planes) slowly passing through the sky towards Long Beach." The Chief of Police of Long Beach, J.H. McClelland, also looked at the sky. He did not see the "planes" but younger people assured him that they saw them. A veteran of the army was looking through Carl Zeiss binoculars and in the beam of the searchlights, he counted nine. The objects passed from one searchlight beam to another, from one salvo to another, without flinching and continued towards Redondo Beach and Inglewood, then towards Santa Ana and Huntington Beach.

"The shots were so loud that we could not hear the sound of the engines of the 'planes'. At 2:21 a.m., Lt. Gen. John L. DeWitt declared a ceasefire.

At around 3:00am, the crew of the Dutch Royal Navy warship "Tromp" could observe "like a large aluminum disc" which was approaching at a great speed - estimated at 6000 km/h - of the ship, it circled around it and then moved away towards the open sea. For three hours it circled at altitude above the cruiser and finally disappeared at a very high speed. (Henry DURRANT: "Le livre noir des S.V." - Laffont 1970 - p.84).

For more than two hours the seven escapees stopped to observe two strange creatures. "They were at least 2.50m tall; one of them was smaller (...) Their heads were rather square without apparent ears. The chest seemed powerful and the arms long reaching down to the knees. In profile, the neck fitted directly into the shoulders (...)".

NORWAY, Banak (Finnmark)
Report of observation from the secret air base of Banak, addressed to the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe in Berlin. At 5:35 PM the watch post gave the alarm; the men went to their combat posts, the pilots to their aircraft. Through binoculars, the observers saw an engine approaching silently. Hauptman Fischer (an engineer in civilian life) took off in a Messerschmitt 109 (fighter) to intercept it. At 3,500 meters altitude he approached it, observed it, and gave a description by radio: it was an enormous streamlined body, without any support plane, without any visible opening; its length was about 100 meters and its diameter about 15 meters; at one end (front?) a group of rods resembling radar antennas. The aerial whale, as Captain Fischer immediately nicknamed it, maintained itself horizontally; suddenly it rose vertically at great speed and disappeared. The pilot concluded that it could not be a machine made by human hands. Report signed by Captain Fischer, countersigned by the base commander. When Hermann Goering in Berlin took cognizance of it, he concluded that the harsh solitude of the Far North had played a nasty trick on his pilot.

NETHERLANDS, above the Zuiderzee
Commander-pilot Roman Sobinski was returning from a bombing operation above Essen (Germany, Ruhr). Passing above the Zuiderzee north of Holland, his tail gunner signaled him an orange-colored luminous disc that was following them. After various maneuvers to get rid of it, the order was given to the gunner to shoot: several projectiles seemed to penetrate the luminous circle, but without result, although the object was at a good range (about 150 m). Finally, the flying disc disappeared at great speed. (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970 - p.76)

ALGERIA, Ouallen (Adrar-En-Ahmet)
One fine morning, the weather station's sub-officer observed an object directly above him, like a small, bright point of aluminum white. About forty people were able to observe the phenomenon. One of the witnesses recounts: "Observed more precisely with our field binoculars and with the theodolite's telescope, the "planet" looked like a small moon or a five franc coin. It had pale, metal white reflections and seemed to be suspended at an altitude of 5 to 6000 m. Apparently it stayed still, but a prolonged examination with the theodolite revealed that it was moving in a slow rotation: we were thus able to observe three rotations in eight hours. The next morning it was still there, always directly above us and we began to get used to it, thinking it was some lost star or a new satellite captured by the Earth's attraction. At dawn of the third day, everything had disappeared..." (the author cites Aimé Michel: ("Glimpses of Flying Saucers" - Aimé Michel, ed.

The rocket, slightly oscillating, rose up and disappeared into the low cloud layer. For several seconds more the roar of the rocket engine was heard. Then suddenly it stopped and a few moments later the rocket reappeared, without tailfins, swaying horizontally, after which it sank into the sea with a terrific explosion.

FRANCE, Cussey-sur-l'Ognon (Haute-Saône)
Or early July (or 1943). On this day it was hot and Mr. and Mrs. Bonardi had taken the afternoon to rest not far from a wheat field where some peasants were busy. Around 4:00 pm, the witnesses suddenly had their attention drawn to a bright light filtering through the foliage of the undergrowth. At the same time they felt a wave of heat. Soon an oval object of dark blue color topped with a dome of silver gray like aluminum appeared. On the dome there were two vertical tubes, in the center of which a more slender antenna could be distinguished. The witnesses clearly saw portholes and a tripod arranged at the base of the object. Astonished by the appearance, the peasants stopped working. The object was then about fifty meters from the Bonardi, hovering a few tens of cm above the ground while emitting a fan noise while turning on itself. Suddenly lights came out of the portholes at a regular rhythm: "as if they were sending us Morse code" said the witnesses. When they were about twenty meters from the strange object, Mrs. Bonardi heard a muffled sound, like murmurs of conversation. The peasants were getting more and more agitated. The UFO continued its slow course at the edge of the grass, then suddenly it took off vertically and disappeared into the sky. At the place of the almost landing a circle of about 1.50 m in diameter was found, where the grass was trampled in all directions. The object must have had dimensions between 2 m and 2.50 m. The duration of the observation was 6 to 10 minutes.

AUSTRALIA, Tasmania
(After the Japanese attack of February 19th 1942.) A major of the Royal Australian Air Force noted in his report: "We were given orders, after the Japanese attack on Darwin, to patrol the Bass Strait where fishermen had reported mysterious nocturnal lights. At around 5:50 PM, at the very beginning of twilight, we were flying a few kilometers east of the Tasmanian peninsula, when suddenly, from a bank of clouds, a strange craft emerged. It was bronze and shining and must have been 45 meters long and 15 meters in diameter. There was something like a beak or a spur at the front and the surface of the object seemed to vibrate. At the top there was a dome or a cupola from which flashes of blue and green light emerged. The other end of the craft ended in a fin. It circled around us, turning very sharply, and I was then surprised to see, at the front of the dome, a white circle inside of which I thought I recognized the image of a grimacing cat. (note of vog: in my opinion, this story should be taken with a grain of salt. The pilot must have known, for example, the Martin Marauder, Martin Mariner and other planes - which had emblems - shark heads, cats and others, on their noses... ) Then this damned craft flew parallel to us for a few minutes. It then suddenly made a U-turn, presenting four fins on its ventral side. It left at an incredible speed and plunged into the Pacific, disappearing under the water which was stirred by regular waves. As if it were a submarine! No, it is not possible that the Japanese could have such craft, nobody could have built such a mysterious amphibious bird!". (See FLYING SAUCERS UNCENSORED by Harold T.

Around 10 in the morning, with a beautiful sky containing high altitude fluffy clouds, Stephen J. Brickner, Sergeant of the Marine Division, was cleaning his rifle when the alarm was sounded. He immediately entered his foxhole sitting, facing the sky. He heard the formation before he saw it, but did not recognize the sound which resembled some kind of echo in the air. A few seconds later the formation of silver objects passed overhead. The sergeant was very excited, it was only his fifth day at the front in the war against the Japanese and he immediately thought that they were Japanese planes. It was a formation of 150 flying objects not in a V formation, but in straight lines of 10 or 12 objects, one behind the other, their speed slightly higher than that of the usual Japanese planes. This formation quickly disappeared out of sight. None of these objects had wings or a tail and they seemed to sway slowly, shining in the sun like silver.

GREAT BRITAIN, Newbiggin-on-Sea (Northumberland)
(end of summer) Albert Lancashire was on guard near the radar post. The night was dark and the soldier was standing in front of his guardhouse about thirty meters from the sea. Suddenly a light lit up in the sky at 100 meters altitude and began to move above the water. All around there was a dark cloud and Albert Lancashire wondered what the Germans had invented again. He immediately went back into his guardhouse to try to observe without being spotted. The yellow light seemed to roll over itself. Soon a second light appeared less than a meter above the witness's head. That's when the story becomes "incoherent". Albert Lancashire followed a kind of beam of light and found himself on board an aerial vessel. There he met a crew of people with a human appearance whose captain had jet black hair and wore thick glasses. The witness was invited to lie down on a table above which shone a very soft blue light. He saw one of these beings dressed like a doctor approach him with a smile. Lancashire remains convinced that he must have undergone some medical examination at that moment, but he no longer remembers the details of the events. All he remembers is that he found himself back in his guardhouse shortly after. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p.262-263)

Germany, Peenemunde Island 
(cf. August 16, 1942) The rocket that would become the V-2 was officially born this day. Indeed, today was the final test. It presented itself as a steel rod, 14 meters long and 12 tons in weight. Propulsion was obtained not by the ignition of powder, but by that of alcohol mixed with liquid oxygen. The nozzle was fed by a complex system of pumps and turbines, and the rocket, guided on its trajectory by an equally complex set of gyroscopes and electronic devices. This day it rose to an altitude of 92,000 meters before falling 192 km from its point of departure ("Astronautics" Pierre Rousseau, Hachette 1965, p. 12). Meanwhile, series production was also undertaken, which in the end amounted to around 400 examples per month in the underground factory of "Mittelwerk" in Niedersachswerfen near Nordhausen. (...) In the autumn of 1942 two examples of the other rocket (Rheinbote, test model of 800 kilos) were dropped from an airplane at 6,000 m altitude and then automatically directed during their flat flight; the A9, which was to result from these tests (failed) did not reach the stage of its realization.

In the middle of the afternoon, 4:00 PM, Adriano Paris, a librarian, was observing along with other witnesses an object the size of a bicycle wheel in the sky of Bergamo. The UFO was not luminous but it emitted an infernal noise. It moved in a zigzag above the city and disappeared towards the village of Seriate 5 km away. On the cloudy sky, the witness clearly saw two pincers at the front of the object. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 263) Adriano and D. Paris were walking in one of the streets of the old city, when they observed a strange flying object, a few centimeters above the ground, passing along the sidewalk in the street at great speed and causing panic among the pedestrians. The thing was round and flat, in the shape of a pincer head and it flew in undulating motion. It seemed to come from the center and head east, disappearing from their view at the end of the street. On the same date there were other observers of the same kind of phenomenon. (CISU, archives dossier 4201 - sources Ufo in Italia I, 73, GDM 10, 114, 8 and Ufo Info 12, 48, 17)

The rear gunner, in the plane, suddenly saw a massive, wingless object appear behind the plane. He alerted the crew, as well as C.J.J. who was in the turret. The thing was visible for 15 minutes and Sergeant M.F.B. took photos of it with a K-20 camera. The object gained altitude, made an abrupt 180° turn and disappeared. Only one of the photos was successful and according to C.J.J. it was clear and perfect. To this day, this photo remains classified top secret.

CHINA, Kuangsi-Guishou
One afternoon, at 3 or 4 o'clock, it was very nice, no clouds in the sky. Having heard a buzzing, we thought that enemy planes (Japanese) were flying over our depot. We went out to see. In the sky, we saw a square object reflecting the sunlight falling. We thought that this object had been dropped by an airplane, but we saw no plane in the air. The buzzing was getting closer and stronger, and the square object was also getting bigger and brighter. (...) It was 1000 m from the ground and remained suspended for a certain time. We clearly saw that the lower part of this square was flat. Each side measured more than a third of a meter/ The height of the object was about 10 cm. (...) No wing, no rudder, no propeller. The object was made of one piece, without opening or porthole. After a moment of suspension in the air, it began to rise straight up into the sky. The noise diminished as it rose. Finally there was only a bright spot (...) My observation lasted almost two hours. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials" ed. Mercure de France, 1983, p.81, 82)

Mr. Delmeire, 41 years old at the time: "I was coming back from work which ended at 7 pm and I remember it was still light. For more than a minute I saw a very bright, red and round object with a shape of a beer barrel. It had an apparent diameter of one meter. It passed about 1 km from me at an altitude of about twenty meters. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it made no noise. As it passed near the roofs it lit them up with an intense light. It left in the direction of Courtrai, towards Wevelgem (West Flanders) (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 264)

BELGIUM, between Valmeer and Z.Z. Bolder (Limburg)
J.V. and his friend, then aged 12 or 13, were looking for shells (after an air attack, while the adults were still in the shelters) and saw a silent and circular object descending to a hundred meters in altitude and 500 or 600 meters away from them. They ran towards the thing, but the fear of being "shot down" (it was war) made them stop at some distance. Meanwhile, the object that seemed to be on the ground (hidden by a fold in the terrain) rose vertically, silently and in a fraction of second it was at 1000 meters altitude. There, at this altitude, were 6 or 7 other balls, the size of a fist held out, which seemed to be waiting for the object that had descended. Together they then disappeared at a higher altitude. More than 50 years later, the witnesses are still stunned by the silence and speed of these objects. Their color was a dirty gray, their diameter 8 to 10 meters, the total height 2 meters, of which 1 meter for the rounded upper part. (personal doc. of vog - identities of the witnesses known)

The Philadelphia Teleportation Affair
Alias Carlos Allende: The Mystery Man Behind the Philadelphia Experiment
The key figure in the bizarre saga of the Philadelphia Experiment is a man known as Carlos Allende, who claimed to witness the teleportation of the USS Eldridge at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on August 15, 1943. Allende reported his experiences to a UFO book author, and his story became one of the most popular unexplained legends of the 20th century. But who was Carlos Allende? ParaScope is pleased to present this classic article from FATE Magazine, in which Robert A. Goerman revealed the elusive individual to be Carl Allen, a "master leg-puller" from Pennsylvania who single-handedly fabricated the Philadelphia Experiment myth. (in brief: the affair was invented by the author Carl Allen, or Carlos Allende (his pseudonym) and the Philadelphia teleportation affair never took place)
First 'Philadelphia Experiment' Crew Reunion
'It Never Happened' By Lacy McCrary
The truth is out here. It is in a hospitality room of a boardwalk hotel, with some old salts sitting around white-clothed tables laughing at reports that their ship was involved in a top-secret World War II experiment. Sailors who served on the USS Eldridge, the ship that legend says vanished briefly in 1943 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, met here this week for their first reunion in 53 years and spent part of their time joking about the so-called Philadelphia Experiment. The Eldridge, they said yesterday, may well have been invisible to Philadelphia because it was never in Philadelphia.
The ship's log and several veterans who were on the ship from its launching on July 25, 1943, at Port Newark, N.J., say it called on many East Coast ports, but never Philadelphia. Two movies, two books and several Web sites have kept the myth about the Eldridge alive. As the story goes, the destroyer escort was surrounded by a greenish fog, disappeared for a few minutes, then reappeared.
But none of the veterans believes it. (…)
The legend says the ship became invisible on July 22, 1943, but ship records and the veterans say it was not launched until July 25. The second experiment, in which the Eldridge was sent to Norfolk and back to Philadelphia, was supposed to have occurred on October 28, 1943. The ship's log says it was at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on that date, but did spend two days in the Norfolk Navy Yard in November 1943.

ARGENTINA, Oncativa (Laguna Larga)
It was very early, 04:00 this morning when René Navarro Ocampo was driving in his car on the road from Rosario to Cordoba. As he passed near Oncativa he suddenly saw an object on the road about 500 m from his vehicle. The object looked like an immense disk, wider than the road and it emitted a light of a bluish-green color. As soon as René Ocampo's car approached, the object began to whistle a bit like a fan. The disk then rose to an altitude of 1000 m and then, turning abruptly at a right angle, it disappeared quickly behind the horizon. When he arrived at the place where this object had been stationed, the witness saw in the beam of his headlights a small metallic body that sparkled on the ground. It was a kind of "paperweight" about 10 cm long. Curiously, it was cold, while the witness expected to find an object overheated by the presence of the UFO. This amazing unexpected gift was analyzed in various laboratories, but the results of these studies have not filtered down to us. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 264)

A UFO in the shape of a disc was observed near Pouchkino by Spanish volunteers of the Azul Division, who were fighting with the Germans on the German-Russian front. While they were in a fort, sheltered from an air battle between German and Soviet aircraft, soldiers Jésus Aria, Pas and Tomas Carbonell noticed an object discoidal that flew around the area somewhat like a spectator of an air conflict and that had to disappear at a fantastic speed. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 265) The Spanish troops of the Azul Division saw a UFO in the shape of a "basin" hovering close by during the battle.

GERMANY, Schweinfurt (in flight)
As the 384th Group had just passed the Initial Point, the fighter attacks suddenly ceased. The pilots wondered, as did all the crew members, where they were now and all the men questioned later were categorical in declaring that at that moment there were no enemy aircraft above them. It was then that the pilots and the gunners of the upper turrets, as well as several men of the crews in the Plexiglas nose of the planes, reported on the route they were following like a string of saucers approaching the Fortresses. The exclamations that burst out drew general attention to this phenomenon and everyone on board the aircraft began to discuss it animatedly. The discs in question seemed to be silver, and measured three centimeters thick and nine in diameter. They were easily visible and descended slowly fluttering in a regular string. At that moment the impossible happened: B-17 No. 26 was quickly approaching one of these strings. The pilot tried to avoid hitting it, but his maneuver failed. As he declared at the debriefing, his right wing crossed this string without any effect on the engines or the aircraft body. The intelligence officers tried to learn more and he then added that he had heard one of the discs hit the tail but that no one on board had seen or heard an explosion. He also said that at about 6 meters from the discs, his men and he had seen a number of small bodies of varying sizes in a string from one meter to one meter twenty long.

GERMANY, various cities.
A report states that an object was successively reported by the bases of Helgoland, Hamburg, Wittenberg, Neustrelitz. The timing between these bases gives it an average speed of over 3,000 km/h. It was observed above Hamburg by a patrol of two Focke-Wulf 190 fighters, at 12,000 m around 11:15. The object was a cylindrical body with a nose cone at the front, a large hole at the back with a panel. It seemed to be composed of a large number of rings, whose surface seemed convex. Reported on the ground, followed for a few kilometers, it disappeared at great speed. (Henry DURRANT: "Le livre noir des S.V." - Laffont 1970 - p.84-85)

#December 1943; Norway, Oslo (Oslofjörden)
At around 10:30 pm, a secretary and three of her friends approached a small fjord. Suddenly, the engines of the cars stopped abruptly and the passengers had to continue the rest of the journey on foot. That's when they saw an orange object with blurred outlines, but resembling a church bell. There was a hissing sound and the UFO rose up, taking on a very dark blue hue. It hovered for a few moments then crossed the fjord at great speed. In the snow bordering the small lake, a depression of 1.50 m in diameter and 1 m deep was found. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 266)
Some friends were at the table when they saw a light appear above the port. Fearing sabotage, they rushed into their cars, in the direction of the phenomenon. At some distance from the port, the three cars stopped and could not be restarted. So they got out of the vehicles and continued on foot towards the light, which seemed to have the shape of a bell, of orange color, blurred. As they approached, the witnesses then heard a whistle, like air escaping from a compressor. A moment later the object descended to 3 to 6 meters above the water, before catapulting itself at a dizzying speed, without acceleration. At the end of the observation the object took on a color of deep blue. The four witnesses, after the disappearance of the phenomenon, discovered depressions in the snow, in the shape of craters, 4.50 m in diameter and 90 cm deep. All around these craters, the snow had melted over an area of 15 to 16 meters. (AUSTRALIAN FLYING SAUCER REVIEW, 7/1968. Phillips: PHYSICAL TRACES ASSOCIATED WITH UFO SIGHTINGS., 1975, 5.

From a clear spot, she saw an aerial object coming from the direction of Brussels, having the shape of a priest's hat. It was moving quickly, going up and down as if it was looking for something. The disc was topped with a dome shining like aluminium. When it was closer, it appeared as big as two full moons. Below it, 4 white lights side by side, and she heard a faint buzzing. It was moving away towards the town of Wavre (J.G. DOHMEN: "To Identify and the Adamski Case" - ed. Guy Dohmen, Biarritz 1972, p. 155).

Madeleine Arnoux wrote: "The facts date back to 1944 during the summer. I was then 13 years old and I went by bicycle every week to a farm a few km away to get some "supplies". So I left Toulon-sur-Arroux on the charming RD 42, bordered by woods in the direction of the hamlet called "Verger". Just before arriving there, I got off to pick wild berries that I knew I would find there. At this place, a dirt road leaves the road and goes to the right through the woods. So I advanced on this path, slowly, looking for fruits. Automatically I raised my head... further, a few hundred meters away, the path rises a bit and forms a pronounced curve to the right to disappear from view in the woods. Right at this place "the thing" was stopped. I remember it was very hot, stormy and the sky was quite cloudy. So, there, something was stopped along the woods and beings were standing close by. Now I think the device could have been the size of one of our small current cars (like a Volkswagen) of metallic gray, dull color. I do not remember observing any openings. The beings who were standing next to it must have been less than 1 m tall and were wearing brown jumpsuits. They made no gesture in my direction and for my part I was frozen in place. How long did this mutual observation last? I cannot say but I remember the oppressive atmosphere, further aggravated by the stormy weather and my impression of not being able to move.. Suddenly I could react and wanted to take my bike that lay a few meters away. The time to bend down and, raising my head to look again at the strange apparition, there was nothing left. ...

Sumatra. At that moment my co-pilot signaled me an object passing us
at 500 m, at that distance it appeared as a spherical object, 5 to 6
feet in diameter, and of a very intense and luminous red-orange
color. It seemed to have a halo. This thing seemed to vibrate or
pulse constantly and I thought it was a radio-guided thing to locate
us, so I made evasive maneuvers constantly changing direction at 90°
at 200 feet of altitude. This thing was always behind us, in each
maneuver, for 8 minutes. Finally it left, abruptly turning at an
angle of 90°, accelerating and disappearing from our sight." (The

They waited for the Germans to launch the counterattack, the night was clear and peaceful. "I saw this thing flying at the speed of a Piper Cub, in a straight line, silently. I tapped the sergeant Ness's shoulder, signaling him to look at the sky. Seeing this, the sergeant stood up in the trench, forgetting the war. Me too. We were so shocked that we forgot everything. It looked like a railway wagon, rectangular, but five times as big as a wagon. It had no wings, no propellers, no tail on the three sides we saw. It crossed the sky at less than 90 mph. We could follow it with our eyes for a long time before it disappeared in the distance over the sea. For a brief moment the object obscured the entire surface of the moon. Neither the American nor the German antiaircraft opened fire.." (The Mysterious Foo Fighters of WWII. - Jeroen Wierda UPORI, 19.5.1997)

USA, Mattoon (Illinois)
In the early morning hours, a resident woke up feeling ill and went to the bathroom to vomit. He asked his wife if she could give him a glass of water, but the woman was unable to get up, she was like paralyzed. In another block of Mattoon a woman was woken up hearing her daughter coughing. She got up and could barely walk.
The next evening, September 1, Mrs. Bert Kearney, who was sleeping in bed with her three-year-old daughter, was pulled from her sleep by a peculiar smell. "First I smelled a very strong sweat smell that made me nauseous," she said. "I thought it might be coming from the garden. But the smell got stronger and I felt my legs and lower body gradually becoming paralyzed. I was scared and I screamed."
Mrs. Kearney's neighbor searched the garden and the neighborhood to detect the source of the foul gas. Without result. The police did the same with a negative result. But at midnight, when Mr. Kearney returned home from work, he had a fleeting vision of what was called "the Mattoon Mad Gasser". According to Mr. Kearney, the stranger was very tall, dressed in dark clothes and wearing a cape. At the moment Mr. Kearney saw him, the stranger was standing on the window sill, and upon seeing Kearney the stranger fled, pursued by Kearney who could not catch him.
On September 5 the police had received four more calls for "gas attacks". Each time the people said they had first felt something nauseating that paralyzed them for a period ranging from 40 minutes to an hour and a half.
On the night of the 6th there were three new victims. At 10 pm Mrs. Ardell Spangler smelled a fetid odor, felt her throat dry up and had nausea. Shortly after midnight Mrs. Laura Junken experienced something similar and Fred Goble told his neighbor Robert Daniels at 1 am that he had just seen "a man running out of his house". Richard T. Piper, eminent criminologist, told reporters that it was one of the strangest cases in years. The last attack took place at the home of Miss Frances Smith, director of the Columbian Grade School, on September 7. At the moment the smell entered the house, she heard an outside buzzing sound of an engine and she said she thought the madman was using machinery to disperse the noxious gas. This was the last attack, the prankster never showed up again. (MYSTERIOUS AMERICA by Loren Coleman, Faber & Faber Inc., Winchester, Mass. 1983, pages 192 to 200; The Mattoon, Ill.

I then saw a luminous globe heading towards the front. It could have been between 90 cm and 1.20 m in diameter. It was made of a material like smoked glass and let out a very soft white light. It was moving at about ten meters in altitude. As soon as it was out of sight, five other similar objects arrived. So I alerted other people so they could see this strange spectacle. We were not impressed, knowing at the time that the Germans had several new weapons; we thought we had seen one of a particular type that night.."

The object was clearly not pushed by the wind but was directed and was advancing at 30 mph at about 40 feet (15 meters). When it disappeared from view, others emerged from the front line, there were five in total. (...) Later I questioned people and at least five other people also saw these objects.

BELGIUM, southeast of Brussels
(Source GESAG, GS 1049) Letter written by John V. Crisp, part of the entourage of a British officer, wrote these notes during his stay at The Cottage, West-End, Essendon, Hertfordshire, England. The notes were transmitted to the authorities through the US Embassy in London: "On November 23, 1944, the men of the British anti-aircraft unit located a B-17 Flying Fortress, a few miles southeast of Brussels, approaching their firing site. It had the landing gear out and was losing speed quickly. The British immediately called the Troop Commander and almost at the same time the B-17 landed in a plowed field, near the machine guns, bouncing on the uneven ground 30 yards from the anti-aircraft position. At the last moment the tip of a wing touched the ground, sinking into it and making the plane spin. The propeller of the nearest engine was thrown into the air, but the other three engines were still running. The shooters waited to see the crew come out and welcome them, but no one came out. They were about to go around the plane and did not notice any sign of life. It was at this point that the Troop Commander called me to the operations room at Erps-Kwerps near Kortenberg. In 20 minutes I was on site and I examined the B-17. I had never had anything to do with planes, but finally I could enter through an entrance under the fuselage. The plane was empty of occupants yet there were signs of presence everywhere. I sat in the pilot's seat to stop the three engines that were still running, which I succeeded in after several attempts. On the navigator's dashboard the logbook was open and the last words written were "Bad Flack" (note of vog: two possible translations "bad flak jacket" or "bad anti-aircraft fire"). With curiosity I traced the route that should have taken the plane from the Ruhr (Germany) to Hertfordshire (England) and I wondered what had happened to the crew. We all started searching systematically and our most extraordinary find was in the fuselage where we found a dozen parachutes neatly folded and ready to use. This made the question about the crew even more mysterious. The Sperry (to follow the bombs) was still in the nose, having suffered no damage and its cover was neatly folded next to it. Behind the navigator's dashboard was the Code book giving the numbers and letters of the day for identification. Several pilot's fur-lined jackets were in the fuselage with some chocolate bars, some of which were partially eaten. No damage could be found on the B-17 except for the landing. So I went straight to the 83rd Tactical Air Force at Everberg to give them my report and the B-17 logbook, several navigation maps, but the story of the landing of an empty B-17 of occupants remained a mystery to this day. The crew was never found. (Martin Cardin, Cape Kennedy, Florida, "Flying Forts" Ballantine Books Inc. Ed. 1968, pages 10-12). .

Lieutenants Henry Giblin and Walter Cleary were on a mission above the Mannheim region when, above Speyer, they saw an enormous orange glowing ball moving at a speed of 400 km/h barely 500 m above their aircraft. The radars remained silent.. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 271)

#1944, November
AUSTRIA, Black Forest
(Document from June 8, 1967, declassified by the FBI) This paper concerns an individual born on May 3, 1924 in Austria, who immigrated to the USA on January 7, 1952 and was naturalized as an American in 1958. This person was a member of the Luftwaffe in 1943 on the Russian front. At the end of 1944 he was assigned as a test pilot on a top-secret project in the Austrian Black Forest. He was said to have observed an engine in the shape of a saucer 21 feet in diameter, controlled by radio, with several reactors arranged around the outside. The apparatus had a dome in its center, which did not move. He took a photo of the engine in full flight at 7000 m altitude (copy of the negative is attached to the document). He also took a photo of an engine parked in a hangar (copy attached). This engine was designed and built by a German engineer, Mr. ... (...) He gave the following details regarding the fuel and engine: Mixture of N2H4O in methyl alcohol CH3OH rather than in an oxygenated mixture like H2O2; 2 rocket engines 7 m x 1.3 m, smooth flight, speed 2000 m/second.

#December 4, 1944
USA, Laredo, Texas
During the night, a U.S. Air Force pilot landed in Laredo. He showed unmistakable signs of fear, let's call him Lieutenant Fogle. He reported that near 20 km from the Laredo airfield, a light blue object had almost collided with his F 51. At the last moment, the object diverted from its course, narrowly avoiding the aircraft, and disappeared at a terrifying speed. Greatly disturbed, Fogle saw the thing shoot vertically, describe a circle as if it was again rushing towards him. The pilot quickly turned off his position lights and made his aircraft descend in a spiral. The mysterious machine descended to nearly 700 meters, circled above the Laredo airfield, gained altitude and finally disappeared into the night. (Donald E. KEYHOE: "Le dossier des Soucoupes Volantes" - ed. Hachette 1952, p.12)

Two pilots from the 415th Fighter Squadron based in Dijon, Lieutenants David MacFalls and Edward Baker, were flying over Hagenau at an altitude of 3000 m. When they were 32 km north of Strasbourg and 26 km west of the Rhine, the pilot made this communication: "It is 18:00. Two very bright lights have left the ground and are heading towards us. They are following us for now." They were two orange spheres that remained in the wake of the plane for two minutes. Then suddenly, these lights left the aircraft and disappeared. Two nights later, on the eve of Christmas 1944, MacFalls and Baker made the same encounter again. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 272) "December 23. More Foo-Fighters were in the air last night...In the vicinity of Hagenau saw 2 lights coming toward the A/C from ground.

The Vega oil refinery had just been destroyed by bombing, when, late in the afternoon, an elongated yellow object came to hover over the devastated region. The UFO was not luminous and left a kind of whitish trail behind it. According to witnesses, the object moved four times faster than the planes they were used to seeing above the city. For 15 minutes various witnesses including engineers Farmacke and Zmeuranu saw this UFO circle the stricken area then depart in the direction it had come from.

(cf: 1939-1940?

According to the engineers, the speed could have been increased to more than 4000 km/h. It is impossible to make any hypotheses about what was said about these saucers after their tests because all the observations, notes etc... that remained in German offices were sequestered by the Allies when they entered Germany. It is not doubtful that much was expected from them because the Reich had not hesitated to unlock the millions necessary to have materials that could withstand extraordinary speeds and staggering temperatures.

At first it rose, then it went out and was lost from sight in the valley south of Massa. At the beginning the ball emitted sparks. It was not identified by the Mosquito Mark XXX as a Jet A/C. No other air traffic in the La Spezia - Parma area."
- Mission No. 562, from 20:10 to 23:10 hours, GCI patrol Leghorn to La Spezia: "At 20:45 a sparkling light was observed by the Mosquito Mark XXX at a distance, at least 20 miles, too far away to intervene. It seemed to move near La Spezia and was seen for 45 seconds. At 21:30 a white reddish flashing light was seen at a distance of 6 to 8 miles, still near La Spezia, at an altitude of 10,000 feet and traveling towards the NE. It was chased at a speed of 280MPH for a minute and a half. The light took an erratic trajectory and went out. At 21:40, the same light, or another identical one, was observed 10 miles south of La Spezia, flying first towards the north, then towards the east, at 9000 feet altitude. The pilot approached it up to 5 miles, suspecting it to be an Ack Ack trap. At 21:55, 10 miles south of La Spezia another (or the same) one headed towards the city and was chased by the pilot. It went away 10 or 15 miles north of La Spezia, the speed of the plane, 300 MPH, was insufficient to catch up. Information taken: no Ack Ack operation at La Spezia. However, at 22:50, 5 miles south of Pisa, an identical light was seen at a distance of 10 miles. It was chased for about two and a half minutes on its course towards the north. At 10,000 feet, it disappeared beyond the mountains." (source CPT C. S. Miller, A. C., Adjudant. cfr Archives Nationales)

#1945, Summer
AT SEA, near the Aleutian Islands
(or March?) 14 members of the crew of the USAf Delarof saw a dark spherical object emerge from the water. The thing made a turn in the air around the boat before flying away. (Marcel J. Lefèvre - 1968 - Brussels) This event is mentioned as dating from the summer of 1945, then again in March 1945, by: (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 169, 306) 1945, Summer: At sea, off Adak. The incident was observed by members of the crew of the U.S. Delarof, loaded with ammunition and supplies for Alaska. The witness, author of the report, recently interviewed was Robert S. Crawford, now geological consultant to the Indiana Soil Testing Laboratory of Griffith, Indiana. Crawford is a graduate of the University of North Dakota and, while he was studying, he reported his observation to Professor N.N. Kohanowski, Department of Geology, also advisor to the NICAP ... The Delarof incident occurred in the summer of 1945 while Crawford was serving on board as a military radio. The boat, returning to Seattle, was off after Adak. The sun was setting and Crawford was standing on the starboard side, near the radio cabin, when he heard crew members shouting. He turned around and saw a large round object that had just emerged from the sea. (Several crew members even saw the UFO appear under the sea, about a mile from the Delarof.) The unknown craft, silhouetted darkly against the setting sun, rose almost vertically for a few moments, then curved its flight to come horizontal and began to circle the boat. All the observers were convinced that it was a very large object. Comparing it to the width of a finger held at arm's length, Crawford estimated that it must have been 45 to 75 m in diameter. Turning around the Delarof, the object was within easy reach of its guns. But the gunners did not shoot, while watching for any sign of hostility. The UFO made two or three turns around the boat, flying regularly and without any noise. All the witnesses estimated that it was self-propelled; otherwise the strong wind would have visibly affected its movements. After several minutes, the flying object disappeared towards the south or south-southwest. Suddenly the crew saw three flashes of light coming from the place where it had disappeared. (Yvan T. SANDERSON: "The Invisibles under the Seas" Albin Michel p.49-50)

George P. Miller was hunting not far from Belfast when he saw an elongated object flying very slowly, swaying in an inclined position towards the ground. It headed towards a clearing and even broke some branches before landing. The witness found the UFO which had suffered no damage: the object stayed on the ground for a few moments then, with a buzzing sound, it began to spin on itself, releasing a multitude of silver threads. In a few seconds it rose and disappeared into the sky. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 273)

As he was on his 37th mission above the Brenner Pass, the pilot of a B-25 saw a foo-fighter. The object came like a shooting star and stopped one meter away from the right wing of the aircraft. The size of a basketball and with a bright white color, the UFO accompanied the bomber for two to three minutes, then suddenly it left as it had come, speeding through the sky. Coincidentally, the next day, on his 38th mission, this plane was shot down above the Brenner. All the crew perished, except for the pilot, the main witness of this observation.

I had a clear view of the sky from my position. At first I thought it was an airplane, but as it got closer I saw that it was round and flat, not spherical, and it had neither propeller nor wings. It hovered silently in the sky and suddenly disappeared. Like a soap bubble bursting. The object had a silver color. It's the way it disappeared that I can't forget. It was still war time, so I talked about it with a friend, who confirmed having observed the same phenomenon. (The Mysterious Foo Fighters of WWII. - Jeroen Wierda Pufori, 19.5.1997)

While Abbot X. was picking mushrooms around the path connecting Renève (Côte d'Or) to Poyans (Haute Saône), he suddenly saw an astonishing little person of 15 to 17 cm tall pass close to him, completely scared and out of breath. The tiny person had the exact proportions of a human being and was wearing a kind of bordeaux suit that also covered his hands and feet. He seemed to be aged 70 to 75, with grey hair and a sparse beard. A kind of thin, widened at the end, stick was coming out of his back and was exceeding his head by about 2 cm. No words were exchanged, the priest and the humanoid were staring at each other for a few seconds. Then, in the most absolute silence, the person disappeared into the nearby thicket. What or who was it? [IN REALITY: an investigation by the Dijon Association of Ufology and Parapsychology revealed in 1983 that it was a small pet monkey, dressed as a soldier by the soldiers of an African regiment.] (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 274)

William A. Mandell was then a captain of artillery and stationed to the north of Okinawa. From their bivouac they were facing east of the China Sea. One evening, by moonlight, he suddenly saw a patch of light coming from the south, flying parallel to the coast. As it got closer he clearly saw the phenomenon, in the shape of a cigar, with a single light at its end. This object passed about 350 m from him, at an altitude of less than 200 meters relative to the sea, since Mandell was at 200 m altitude and saw the thing at eye level. The object was 10 to 15 meters long, with a diameter of 2 m to 2 m 50. It had no wings, no propellers, no portholes, or other openings. It moved in a gentle and constant manner, and silently.

They were of a dazzling white, like burning magnesium, and were approaching the C 46 in a parallel course. Suddenly the left engine faltered. I was to learn later that the magnetic needles of the navigation instruments had gone wild. The C 46 was sinking. Oil was spurting from the failing engine. The pilot gave the alarm. The crew and passengers were warned to be ready for the dive. (...) The last fleeting vision I had of the three craft placed them at about 20 degrees in elevation relative to us.

Just before 5 o'clock, Ilona Johansson Paasonen was awoken by a strong light. She pulled the curtain to see what it was. From the shore of Shalahti, a dazzling sphere of about 10m in diameter was approaching quickly. She threw herself to the ground, on her back, waiting for the end, as she believed that this ball of fire would destroy everything. Surprised that the collision did not occur, she got up after a few minutes and took a look: the ball of fire had disappeared. But about 300m away, an object shaped like a tree trunk was slowly gliding on the water and approaching the shore. About 2 meters from the jetty stood a strange gray animal that seemed to be in terror. It was standing on its claws, it suddenly turned its head and she saw sharp teeth in the open mouth. Then the tree trunk arrived near the jetty and she saw that it was a narrow boat like a canoe: at the bow stood a tall man of handsome bearing, he was wearing a greenish suit. The boat pivoted a bit and she saw another man operating a motor inside a large transparent bulb. The "Lapp dog" no longer seemed afraid and was leaving.

#1946, March 5
BRAZIL, Araçariguama, (Sao Roque de Sao Paolo)
Excerpt from the report of Professor Felipe Machado Carrion, president of the Brazilian GGIOANI group: On this March 5, Mardi Gras day, Joao Prestes Filho had invited his 39-year-old friend Salvador dos Santos (still alive in 1971 at the time of the report) to go fishing on the banks of the Tiete. He asked his wife to take his sons to the carnival festivities, telling her to leave one of the windows of the house ajar, through which he could enter upon his return from fishing. Prestes Filho and dos Santos spent the day fishing, joyfully and carefree.
Around 7:00 pm, under a light and uniform mist, in a serene atmosphere, not stormy, they returned from the Rio Tiete. They separated at a fork in the road, each heading towards his own house. An hour later, Prestes Filho burst into his sister Maria's house, shouting and in a disjointed way that when he tried to open the window, he received from outside a silent beam of light, against which he protected his eyes and head with both hands. Dazed, he fell to the ground for a few brief moments, without losing consciousness. He got up and started running towards the center of the village, in search of help. Maria's neighbors were immediately called, and Prestes Filho kept telling his story. One of the neighbors, Aracy Gomide, never left Prestes Filho's side from that moment on. His hair, head, eyes, clothes, nothing showed signs of deep or light burns. His eyes were dilated, in terror, his voice excited. Soon the scene turned to horror: Prestes Filho's flesh began to become visible, taking on the same aspect as if it had been cooked for long hours in boiling water. It began to peel off the bones, falling in pieces from the jaw, chest, arms, hands, fingers, lower legs, feet, toes. Some pieces of flesh remained hanging by the tendons, the witnesses not daring to remove them. Then everything deteriorated in an unpredictable way: the teeth and bones were exposed. Prestes Filho energetically refused the water and food that were offered to him, but at no time did he seem to feel any pain. His nose and ears detached, rolling down his body to the ground. A terrifying specter, dislocating from mutilation to mutilation. Eyes wide open in terror. Words already distorted in a mouth that was disarticulating: only sounds remained, whose meanings were lost. In the general confusion, what remained of Prestes Filho's almost decomposed body was loaded onto a cart that was to take him to Santa Casa de Santana de Parnaiba, the nearest hospital. In the sixth hour after the light attack, a corpse returned to Araçariguama, as Prestes Filho died during the journey without reaching the hospital. Until his last moments, guttural sounds came out of his mouth. Was he still telling his story of horrors? As there was no medical examination, the death certificate said "Death by generalized burns". The police made some inquiries that led to nothing that could be added validly to the content of the death certificate. (...)" (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 276 to 278)

The US Army invited hundreds of journalists, photographers, filmmakers, even scientists, generals, including some British, to a spectacular show. Safely sheltered in bunkers, the guests could admire from a respectful distance a V2 rocket (...) At exactly 2:13 pm, a jet of flames appeared beneath it. The rocket rose with an impressive slowness before accelerating more and more in an awful roar, dragging behind it a 20 m long flaming tail, until it became a small orange star that finally disappeared, leaving only a thin trail of smoke. (...) Three minutes later, the V2, which had been followed by radars and special optical instruments taken from the Germans, after reaching nearly 100 km in altitude, fell back, signaled by an observation plane, at 4000 km/h, about sixty km from its starting point, burying itself in the desert sand amidst a burst of flames. (...) While tests of the V2, more or less modified, continued at a rate of one per week, in 1947 one of them reached the record altitude of 183 km. ("To the Assault of Space" - Georges H.

#1946, May
SWEDEN, Angelholm
A Swedish industrialist, Gösta Carlsson, told journalist Eugen Semitjov (issue no. 44, Allers, 1971): "It was one evening in May 1946. I had gone out to try to find pollen for my bees and I had taken a flashlight because the darkness was already well established. Suddenly I saw a light between the trees: I then thought that someone had just lit a fire. But when I saw that this light was advancing towards a small clearing, I changed my mind. So I headed in its direction and when I arrived at the edge of this open space, I saw something like a disc topped with a dome and resting on the ground. On the dome there were some kind of oval windows and above it was planted a kind of periscope, like for a submarine. Under the disc one could distinguish a large oblong fin extending from the center to the outside of this lateral part. Two landing feet were also visible and from a door located next to the fin-shaped wing, a ladder descended to the ground. The object had approximately 16 m in diameter for a maximum height of 4 m. On the periphery of the disc there were a series of openings like nozzles and besides, when the object left, jets of gas or vapors came out of it which burned the grass. The light that had attracted my attention was on the kind of mast that I assimilated to a periscope. This rod had a length of 5 m and from its top three antennas were leaving. Lower, it was a kind of lampshade that was suspended there. It was from there that this light seemed to pulsate, of a rather curious purple shade and which illuminated not only the object but also one to two meters all around. On the ground, outside this illuminated zone, a man dressed in a tight white suit was standing. It seemed that he was guarding the machine, because having spotted me he pointed his hand in my direction: I was less than 10 m from him and I stopped dead. The man had my size but he was much thinner than me. I saw that there were other people around the object, but what was strange was that they did not say a word. There were three of them working on one of the portholes and two others standing on the side of the machine. I also saw three women. In total I thus spotted the presence of eleven people. They all had black boots and gloves, a belt of the same color around the waist and a transparent helmet on their head. The women had ash-colored hair, but I could not see the shade of those of the men because they wore a kind of dark cap. Their skin was brownish, as if tanned by the sun. I advanced a few more steps, but the guard stopped me again with a gesture of the hand. This character was wearing a black box suspended from a chain around his neck: it looked like an old camera. He turned this device in my direction and I then thought he wanted to take a picture of me. But nothing happened except that I heard a click in my flashlight. This one did not work anymore afterwards, but this may be only a coincidence: when I returned home I noticed that the new batteries were completely discharged. One of the women came out of the cabin of the object holding something in her hand. She approached the edge of the illuminated zone and, through this kind of luminous curtain, she threw the object she was holding: at the same time she laughed ..." Carlsson found this object which had the shape of a stick. An analysis carried out in 1971 revealed that it was silicone with various impurities. After this episode the witness left the place and did not return until about thirty minutes later. He approached by another path and then felt a strong ozone smell in the atmosphere. Before he reached the clearing, a very bright red light came on. With a kind of plaintive noise the object rose slowly above the treetops. At 500 m it seemed to waver a bit, then suddenly the light became brighter and turned purple. The object accelerated and disappeared at full speed. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 279 to 281) 1946, summer, Angelholm A man saw in a wood outside the town, a swollen disc resting on two crutches and a tailplane. All around there were eleven beings of human appearance, of both sexes, dressed in white overalls and wearing spherical helmets. He approached but one being made him a sign to stop. Believing it to be a military secret, the man moved away and observed from a distance the takeoff and the rapid disappearance of the craft. traces were found. (Inforespace no. 48 of 1979, p. 29)

My father told us an astonishing story: Around one o'clock in the night, he got up to satisfy a natural need outside. The night was calm and the sky starry. When he returned to his room, he suddenly saw the sky in the northeast lit up like in broad daylight. (...) He discovered an object neither round nor square flying in his direction. The shining object was as wide as two houses and as high as one floor. When the object passed over his head, it was 3 m away from him, but my father heard no sound. The huge flying machine was heading southwest. After about ten seconds, it had completely disappeared. (...) The next day (...) I learned that two teachers had seen in the night, around one o'clock, a huge luminous object advancing in jerks, going up and down. After three or four seconds, the object was only 50 m away from them. As it approached, the object became bigger and brighter. Frightened, they ran away. (..) But then they heard a loud "Peng" and the object rose to 30 m from the ground. It brightly illuminated the whole school with its bluish light. Even more scared, the two teachers shouted and woke up the teachers and all the boarders (...) But at that moment the luminous object had already disappeared.

A family of farmers reported that an airplane was making a strange whistling sound at low altitude. Soon the witnesses saw two rocket-shaped objects pass quickly overhead and crash to the ground together. Two other witnesses described the craft as a kind of V1; then two small rockets two meters long fell together into the lake following a parabolic trajectory.

Between 12:00 and 12:30, several witnesses observed two objects, resembling V 1s, coming slowly, at low altitude (50 meters) from the west. Their attention had been drawn by a whistling, not resembling the sound of an airplane engine. The two objects flew so low that they almost brushed the tops of the trees. Both of them fell into Lake Mjosa, 2 km from the west beach and 7 km from Minnesund. They had the shape of a rocket, measuring about 2.50 m long and had wings with a total span of 2 meters. The wings were placed a little forward, about 1 m from the nose. The nose and tail shone like metal but the central part, as well as the wings, was very dark. The wings seemed to move slightly. The objects had no lights or fires and they flew one behind the other. Their trajectory was like that of a stone thrown with force. When they fell into Lake Mjosa, they raised a water jet several meters high. There was no sound of explosion. The sky was clear and the water calm.

NETHERLANDS, province of Twente
The newspaper "Hengelosch Dagblad" reported on September 12 the events of the 10th as follows: "The rocket passing through our firmament was observed by the population of Hengelo, Almelo and Enschede, probably concerns a test of V6, improved model (by the Americans) of V2. They called it V", since the supposed rockets of Russian manufacture were already designated as V3, V4 or V5. The speed of the object would have been about 12,800 km/h. It flew silently at an altitude of 21 km. This rocket was also observed in Oldenzaal, while a Frisian witness saw it in the sky in the southeast.

George Adamski observed a cigar-shaped object hovering motionless in the sky, and then heading south towards San Diego, where thousands of people (note from vog: see San Diego, same day, where Bougard mentions a dozen witnesses...) saw it. It was then that Adamski decided to build a telescope with the intention of photographing the objects. From 1946 to 1952 he took 500 shots of aerial phenomena of which only about twenty were clear enough to be identified as flying saucers. (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

Ella Young was with a friend: "The sun had just set, it must have been 5:35 pm. Suddenly a dark object appeared in the sky and as it approached us, its shape became more distinct. It looked like a black stick with wings. It remained motionless for a few moments. It then flew off towards the horizon and disappeared behind a cloud. Right after, a bright flash of light illuminated the sky above the ocean." (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977- p. 285-286)

The secret Haviland D.H. 108 Swallow aircraft, which was meant to prefigure the DH 110 model, lacked stability for the expected Mach 1 speeds. During its test flight it suffered a terrible crash. This made the Americans working on the X-4 project think: it had the same profile as the English aircraft and, rightly so, the USA feared a destabilization at high speed.
