AUSTRALIA, Gum Creek, South Australia
At 2 o'clock in the morning, Mrs. Player woke up in her bed, sat up and saw the whole room illuminated. Suddenly, an entity of about 160 cm appeared, wearing a blue-green overall, a brown balaclava on his head, and an open brown jacket. His black gloves reached up to his elbows and were held in place by a cord going from the balaclava over his left shoulder. He had a red face and a big nose. He was holding a black box which made a clicking sound when he pointed it at her. She fell back into a lying position and fell asleep.

(cf: 4 Sept. 62) Siragusa is able to take a ride in a saucer for the first time. He meets other humans, including the Italian mechanic Luciano Galli from Bologna, who had been contacted by Venusians since 1957. Siragusa had at least 19 close encounters with extraterrestrials between 1962 and 1978, and almost every time he was forced to write messages to heads of state.

USA - MADAGASCAR
The first case dates back to April 1964, when the satellite "TRANSIT 5" fell back into the Indian Ocean, very close to Madagascar; it simply could not be placed in orbit, its carrier rocket having communicated an insufficient speed to it. The radioactive fuel which was on board to power a radio-isotopic generator, burned in the atmosphere. It was plutonium 238. ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, p. 116) This military navigation satellite was loaded with one kilo of plutonium. The radio-isotopic thermo-electric generator (RTG) burned in the atmosphere, according to what is said, releasing its radioactive material. (The Associated Press)

IN SPACE
The GEMINI capsule (unmanned) was joined by four UFOs which deployed in formation around it (2 above, 1 beside, 1 below) and did not leave it during the entire orbit. (Jacques POTTIER: "Les Soucoupes volantes" - DE VECCHI - 1974 - p. 42 (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "L'énigme des E.T." - éd. Guy TREDANIEL 1995, p. 34, 35). This position was maintained during the entire orbit, after which the objects moved away and disappeared into space at great speed. (1989 - listing and research by Harvey S. Stewart)

USA, Newark Valley (New York)
Gary Thelbert Wilcox was farming with his wife. At 10 o'clock this Friday he was spreading manure with his spreader on the fields to the east of the farm. The weather was clear with sunshine. While he was working he looked up to the top of the hill and noticed a shiny object up there: at first glance he thought it was a refrigerator. He realized it was not one. He directed the tractor with the spreader up the hill, and at 100 m from the object he thought it might be a tank that had fallen from an airplane. He stopped and walked the remaining 100 m. This thing was above the ground, the size of a bit more than a large car, of an oblong shape somewhat like an egg. It was absolutely smooth and aluminum-colored. He touched it: the metal seemed harder to him than aluminum. He does not know if the craft was hovering or resting on feet. It measured about 6 m long by 1.20 m high, and from 4.50 m to 5 m wide. Two small men came out from under this object - tank. He does not know where they came from. Each of them was carrying a tray made of the same material as the craft. There were tufts of grass on the trays. The small men stopped less than a meter from the witness. Then it seemed to him - because their voices did not sound like those of human beings - that one of them said to him: "Do not be afraid, we have already spoken to people". The witness understood perfectly but does not know if they were speaking in English. They were quite wide for such small people. They had arms and legs but the witness does not know anything about their hands or feet. They seemed to have some kind of clothing that covered the place where normally there should have been a head. When they raised their arms he saw a bulge where we have an elbow. The color of the complete and totally flexible suit was aluminum white, without seams or pockets. They said: "We come from what you call the planet Mars". They then asked him what he was doing. He explained that he was spreading manure and he had to explain it in more detail. The beings asked if they could have fertilizer. They also said that they could only come to Earth every two years. The conversation quickly moved from one subject to another. They added that they were monitoring people on Earth. (...) They went back under the ship, bent down a bit. Then there was a sound like the slowing down of a car and the object took off slowly and disappeared after traveling about 45 meters. (...) Around 4:30 pm he returned to the hill with a load of manure and he left a bag of fertilizer where he had seen them. The next morning the bag was gone.

USA, Socorro (New Mexico)
RR3. In the afternoon of this day Lonnie Zamora, a former police sergeant already in the service, was patrolling the streets of Socorro in a car as part of a routine operation. Suddenly he saw a shining object descending towards the lower part of the city, a little outside. He later added that he then heard an enormous rumble. When he approached the edge of the ravine, he saw a strange egg-shaped object, 3 to 5 m long, resting on short metal feet. Apparently ignoring the witness's presence, two small human-looking creatures wearing what seemed to be white or silver overalls were apparently examining or repairing a piece under the craft. As Zamora returned to his car, he looked back... At that precise moment the object projected a dazzling blue flame onto the sand where it was resting, then it rose with a deafening noise. Four deep imprints were found in the ravine where the object had landed, which Zamora identified as those of the craft's feet. The surrounding bushes were charred and still smoking where the flames projected from the base of the object had reached them. (Henry DURRANT: "The UFO File" - Laffont 1973 - pp. 29-30) (Science et Vie, special edition 1997: 50 years of UFO, Atlas of Unsolved Cases, pp. 60 to 63) In April 1964, the same day Hynek was at Wright Field, Lonnie Zamora saw an egg-shaped object, now famous, which landed on four feet in the desert of New Mexico. It bore an insignia that strangely resembled the logo of Astropower, a Douglas subsidiary, founded in 1960, under the presidency of propulsion expert Y.C. Lee. I found a full page of four-color advertising for Astropower in the "Proceedings of the Radio Engineers", special issue on computers, dated January 1961. In this advertisement Astropower "offers its services for the research and development of advanced space propulsion systems to subcontractors and government agencies". ITS PROGRAM INCLUDES HIGH-ENERGY PROPULSION SYSTEMS OF NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL AND ELECTRIC TYPE; SOLID STATE ELEMENTS AND ENERGY CONVERSION EQUIPMENT. Mr. Lee would be happy to receive requests from "scientists with advanced degrees in plasma physics, nuclear physics and thermodynamics".

USA, Holloman (N.M.)
Three occupants of small size but of almost human appearance,
were reportedly taken inside the base and received in a
specially arranged hangar, building 930. In 1973, Robert Emmeneger
and Allan Sandler were said to have received an invitation from the director of the AF OSI
(Air Force Office of Special Investigations) to study the
possibility of making a documentary about this first contact. It
seems that at that time President Nixon, or at least his
administration, had seriously considered revealing part of the
truth to the public. (Jean-Gabriel GRESLE: OVNI, a pilot speaks, ed. Guy Trédaniel, 1993, p 135, 136)

TURKEY, near Koyulhisar
Mr. and Mrs. Ahmed Bey were driving along a secluded stretch of road.
Suddenly Mrs. Bey pointed out to her husband through the windshield, a disk that had just appeared in the sky, spinning. The two spouses were surprised by the size of the object (...) as big as a house. (...) It hovered over the road in front of the car, hesitating and jerking. They suddenly saw it descend and it hit the ground in a burst of flames. At the moment the object fell, a huge hairy creature emerged from it and bounced on the ground a little further away. It got up staggering and leapt onto the road. Then, with fantastic strides, it headed towards the Bey's car, who, horrified, desperately tried to hide under the dashboard. Mr. Bey stopped his vehicle. Taking a knife out of his pocket, he opened the door and stood in front of the monstrous saucer. The giant was soon upon him. Mr. Bey struck him, but it had no effect. Then the creature grabbed the man, clawed him, lifted him off the ground and let him fall, and finally trampled him. Mrs. Bey, in the utmost horror, managed to escape and ran like a madwoman. For some unknown reason, the being did not follow her. Exhausted, she reached the police. (...) They found the battered body of Mr. Ahmed Bey lying across the railway track. He had been beaten to death (...)(Jean FERGUSON: "Les Humanoïdes..." - ed. Leméac, Ottawa 1977, p.171, 172)

GREAT BRITAIN, Carlisle, Cumberland
Jim Templeton took a photograph of his daughter who had just put on a new dress. Strangely, he noticed that no birds were flying in the sky on this beautiful day and it was strangely quiet. When the photo of the child was developed, a "spaceman" appeared on the picture. Nobody had observed it visually. The air force asked for the negatives, because this "spaceman" was exactly the same as the two seen on the Woomera video cameras on the same day.

Alberto Kalbermatter was driving home with a truckload of tree trunks, through a forested area, when the road was suddenly blocked by a huge human-like figure about 3 meters tall with abundant black hair. He almost ran over the creature which emitted a very powerful guttural cry. Terrified, Kalbermatter pressed the accelerator and fled. (...) A few nights before he had seen a large luminous object that seemed to be stuck in the branches of the trees. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 131)

ARGENTINA, Pajas Blanca (Cordoba)
At 4 in the morning, a doctor from Buenos Aires and his wife were driving about 30 km from the international airport when the engine stalled. They were confronted with a huge and extraordinary machine blocking the road. Its very powerful lights went out, leaving only a violet light coming from the object, and they stayed there, sitting, perplexed, for about 20 minutes. Suddenly a figure approached their car and asked in Spanish: "What's going on, my friend?" The doctor replied that the engine had stalled. The man suggested trying to start it again. He did, and the engine started, as did the headlights, so that they could now see the machine in front of them. The stranger then said: "Don't be afraid. I am a terrestrial (!). I have a mission to accomplish on Earth. My name is R... D... Warn humanity, in your own way!". He moved away to join two beings dressed in gray who had just appeared. All three entered the machine, which rose quickly and disappeared, leaving a violet trail behind it. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, pp. 131, 132)

A miner, Rafael Aguirre Donoso, observed the landing of a strange craft from which two men with fair skin emerged, speaking a language that seemed to be a mix of English and Spanish.

#1964, June 25
USA, Ely (Nevada)
George W. Rogers of Spring Valley was driving with his brother Bert towards Ely when they saw a strange craft in front of them on the road. At first it was on the side at 1.20 m from the ground. They had only seen the top and their first thought was that it was a jeep that had swerved. Then it had risen and come above the road where it had landed for a short moment on a kind of 60 cm pedestal. The two men were then a few meters away from the object. It looked like a pyramid roof, but the tip was on the side of the thin pedestal. It was slightly curved and was spinning quickly. George Rogers had jumped out of the car and run to touch the object. At the moment he had approached, the thing had emitted a loud rumble and had jumped about 3 m high to come back down on the road 15 m further. George had approached 3 or 4 times, it had been the same thing. "It suddenly came to me that I was stirring around something I knew nothing about. Bert was shouting at me to stay away from this object. I eventually thought he was right and I went back to the driver's seat." A moment later the object had risen slowly and had flown away at full speed towards the east. The two men said that the thing looked like an upside-down roof, the sides were shiny as if they had been made of plastic and had a red mark or emblem that he had not seen well because the craft kept spinning.

#July 1964
USA
Two prototypes of such an ionic engine were tested in July 1964, in the United States. The characteristic of these devices is to provide only an extremely weak thrust, of the order of half a gram, but to be able to sustain it, without refueling, for years. Since the acceleration is constant, the speed could reach 200,000, 300,000 km/h... which does not exclude the invention of propulsion based on phenomena still under study in laboratories.

But the most beautiful achievement of the kind was that which the Americans accomplished on July 31, 1964. Their "Ranger VII" (note from vog (so there were Ranger I to VI tried before him, isn't it?) fell on the Moon at the planned location and, before crashing, took and transmitted by television more than 4000 photographs, showing the lunar surface at altitudes down to 400 meters.

From the beginning, the USSR opted for the multiple launch formula, each rocket placing a cluster of (tactical) satellites in orbit around the Earth. There were initially three (with Cosmos 38 to 40) in August 1964 and twice afterwards (see July 1965) ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, p. 93).

#1964, August 11
USA, Hamilton (Montana)
Reports of a hairy creature in the Girds area were reported. This was after the wave of mysterious object sightings during the previous three weeks in Bitter Roots. The description of the UFO was made by the couple Ron Ballew and Helen Ballew of Darby, matching the previous descriptions of an object emitting intense light. It was from lumberjack Lou Smalley that we have the report of his encounter with the hairy creature. Smalley was in a truck, on his way to load logs. When he came out of a hollow on the road, he saw the creature on a rock above the path. "I saw it clearly for several seconds," he comments, "it was not human." The creature was about 1.5 meters tall, had a hairy or furry appearance, and was not wearing any clothes. It was standing like a man, but it was not human. Smalley has often hunted bears or cougars, and claims that the creature does not look like anything normal. (APRG on the Internet in May 1997)

CHINA, Menjing (Miquanxing)
One night a bright fireball of red-orange color was observed, shaped like a circular saw. It flew slowly in the low sky and finally landed on a wooded hill. Militiamen immediately rushed into the forest to see what it was. They stealthily approached, the circular saw-shaped ball was sparkling, resting on the ground of a clearing. As its luminosity was very intense, the witnesses did not dare to look at it directly. In the center of the bright ball, there seemed to be a dark area, less bright. When the militiamen arrived close to the clearing, the object suddenly flew vertically and disappeared in a blink of an eye. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials". ed.

USA, near Cisco Grave (Northern California)
The witness was hunting when he became separated from his companions and lost his way. Night was falling; he lit some fires to attract attention to the place where he was. He saw a light in the sky and thought it was a helicopter sent to look for him. But the thing stopped and began to hover silently around. The witness climbed a tree to get a better view. The light circled the tree and he saw a flash and a dark thing fall to the ground. Then he saw a silhouette walking heavily in the woods below him, and another coming from a different direction. The two silhouettes approached the tree. They were a little over 5 feet tall, wearing a silver outfit that covered their heads. A third creature appeared, which acted more like a machine than a man or an animal. It was darker than the others and its eyes were red-orange. It had no mouth but a kind of slit that opened like the door of an oven. These entities seemed to be looking for all kinds of ways to make the witness fall from the tree, who in turn threw pieces of paper and clothes at them, to which they reacted with fear. The robotic entity dropped its lower jaw, and from the rectangular cavity where it put its hand, it emitted a puff of smoke towards the witness! This smoke spread like fog and would have made the witness unconscious for some time. (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - coll. J'AI LU, p. 124, 125)

The North American XB-70A Valkyrie, with 6 engines, was an experimental bomber designed for speeds of Mach 3 and higher. It was the largest of the experimental aircraft, with a length of 58 meters, a wingspan of 32 meters, and a height of 10 meters. It had two large vertical tail fins and a horizontal canard mounted on the fuselage, triangular wings whose tips could be lowered to increase lateral stability at supersonic speeds. It was constructed of titanium and stainless steel honeycomb and could withstand temperatures of 332°C for its Mach 3 high altitude flights. There were only two prototypes which the Department of Defense used for its Mach 3 research programs as part of the SST program. They were packed with measuring instruments that could measure 36 different data points transmitted directly to the ground. 900 other types of measurements were recorded in digital pulse code modulation at a rate of 20,000 data points per second.

#December 10, 1964
USA, Fort Riley Air Force Base (Kansas)
At around 2 in the morning, a flying saucer landed on the military base of Fort Riley, likely due to a motor failure. It was metallic grey, perfectly circular, with a diameter of around 20 meters and a height of 4 meters. It was surrounded at mid-height by a black band from which square nozzles protruded about 30 centimeters and were likely part of its propulsion system. It was not lit and did not emit any smell. As one of the witnesses would later say, it seemed absolutely dead, and nobody knew if there was a crew inside. After a few hours, specialized teams from the Air Force arrived at the scene with large tractors pulling a huge platform on which they loaded the saucer. They immediately took it away, without even trying to find out what was inside, and nobody ever saw it again. (Maurice CHATELAIN: "Les messagers du Cosmos" - Laffont 1980, p. 27, 28)

Horace Burns, an armorer from Grottoes (Virginia) on Highway 250, jumped when he saw a huge cone-shaped object fly past his eyes and descend on the other side of the road in front of him. At one point, the object filled more than his windshield. Without engine failure or anything else, Burns felt forced to stop. The craft landed calmly in a meadow 100 m from the road. Burns counted six concentric circles that decreased in diameter as they approached the top, crowned with a dome. The whole thing emitted a bluish glow. He estimated the width to be 40 m and the height to be 25 m. There were no openings or connections visible during the minute and a half that the craft stayed on the ground. It took off at a right angle, immediately gaining great speed. Professor Ernest Gehman of Eastern Memmonite College was curious enough to examine the landing site: he discovered a concentration of radiation of 60,000 radiations per minute.

The object came out of the water and stayed hovering at an altitude of 17 to 20 meters" The witness took out the binoculars to get a better look at the object and saw inside, like an entity looking at him fixedly... "so I remembered my camera... When I held it up to my eyes the object started to move, and I just managed to capture it in the corner of the frame. In a few seconds the craft was far away, beyond the mountains. It rose up, changing color: black when it came out of the water it became a bright yellow-orange. That's all I could see.

The incident had taken place on a road, about a mile and a half from a farm belonging to her mother. She had an appointment with Lew Lister. They were sitting in the car and talking, all lights off; it was about 11 pm. Suddenly they saw a silhouette crossing the field. "It didn't seem to see us until we turned on the headlights. Then it headed towards us. It wasn't walking, it seemed to be advancing in big leaps towards our car. (..) the thing passes through three rows of barbed wire. As it approached, I started to scream. Then it backed up and dove forward as if it was going to go through our windshield. It tried to grab Lew, I'm not sure if it touched him or not. (...) she and Lew desperately tried to raise the windows. (...) I remember that feeling of being hypnotized by the bright eyes of the "thing". (...) The "thing" crouched down, its hands became paws, and it started to walk on all fours. Everything happened in slow motion. Then it disappeared, it evaporated. " It was about two meters tall, with wide shoulders, a rather slim waist. Standing, its body appeared in the light of the headlights, covered with a kind of yellowish down. The head was horrible, pointed at the top, narrow at the chin, wrinkled forehead, large pig ears and a kind of groin. Its eyes shone orange and its teeth were like fangs.

A witness reported having seen the landing of two silent and unlit UFOs, descending into a wooded area near Lynchburg. One had a diameter of 24 m, the other 6 m. Three creatures of 75 cm in height disembarked, approaching up to 10 m from the petrified witness. They were of humanoid type and had strange eyes, "which looked straight through me" said the witness. They emitted unintelligible sounds then pivoted and returned to the object from which they had come out. A door opened, they entered and the opening seemed to seal itself in such a way that there was no trace left. The encounter is presumed to have lasted about 30 minutes and to have started at 5:40 pm.

A young man went to the police to say that he and his friends had encountered three little space men and that one of his friends had taken a photo to prove it. The boy, Steven, said that they were seven in a car driving to Brand Flats when they saw someone coming out of a field towards the road, seeming to examine the cars that passed by. Remembering stories of flying saucers in the area, he stopped the car. They got out and tried to catch the entity that ran away up the hill. It was on the hill that two other entities appeared. They ran much faster than the boys. They were about 1.2 meters tall and were covered in a one-piece silver-colored tight suit. In the field there were no footprints of the strangers. The police sent 10 men, including a photographer, to investigate. After an hour, having found no evidence, the police left, but the young man stayed on the spot with the photographer. That's how they found a small shiny aluminum shed where they entered. At that moment they had the impression that the shed was lifted and they quickly left, but Wilson managed to photograph it as it rose. In the light of the flash, Wilson saw one of the little men standing next to the shed. (Note from Vog: All these stories from the cited source seem abracadabrant to me... because here, the young man initially claims that one of his friends has already taken a photo, while in the story, it is the photographer sent by the police who takes one...)

Sid Roderick, 45, had an encounter with a nine-person space crew and took a ride in a flying saucer. It was perched on the side of the hill less than 10 minutes from Roderick's home. It was about 2 o'clock in the morning when the event occurred, during one of his usual night walks. He heard a faint buzzing and saw the ship. After landing, a voice coming from the object assured Roderick of the friendly intentions of the visitors. Then, a character called Ziena emerged through a door at ground level. Roderick was invited inside, which was at least two stories high. There were 14 rooms, and the crew, of perfectly human appearance, wore an elegant blue-white outfit. Inside the ship the light was also bluish-white. The character Ziena spoke English. Among themselves, the other members communicated through facial expressions and gestures. Roderick received a message of peace with a religious aspect... (APRG, on the Internet in May 1997)

In the evening, passersby suddenly found themselves in the presence of small beings and were filled with fear. They ran towards their homes and locked themselves in. But then, according to what the witnesses said, a light entered through the wooden walls, illuminating the entire interior. Carlos Souriou, who had barricaded himself with several people including his younger brother, said that the latter had almost gone mad with fear, had nervous breakdowns and that the other witnesses surrounded him with boxes and whatever they could find to prevent him from seeing the light.

ARGENTINA, Torrent (Corrientes)
First week. One night a resident asked his neighbors to come out and observe five
luminous objects flying over the area. Then, a transparent craft
landed and from it emerged five "Martians" about 2 meters tall, each
with a single eye in the center of their forehead. On their heads were
instruments emitting flashes of different colors. They entered a farm
and tried to seize a man, but retreated in the face of the determined
attitude of the villagers and fled. On February 6th they returned and
were seen by many people. Once again they tried to seize a man and
failed. He escaped and raised the alarm. The villagers came out in
force and fired shots at the "Martians" but apparently to no effect.

The place is located near the Argentinian-Paraguayan border.
Several saucers were seen in flight and one of them landed.
About 50 Indians from the Toba tribe remained astonished while
three tall beings, enveloped in luminous halos, descended from
the craft and approached slowly. The Indians knelt and paid
homage to them, raising their arms according to the tradition
of the Sun worship ceremony of their ancestors. They then
heard a voice coming from the creatures of the craft saying
that they should not be afraid, for the People of Space would
soon return to convince the Earthlings of their existence and
to bring peace to the world. An Indian who tried to approach
the machine was dissuaded by gestures. The visitors then
returned slowly to the craft, bathed during this time in the
luminous rays coming from the small wings of the craft. The
craft flew away, its luminosity becoming blinding. Argentine
police officers were present and took a number of photographs
of the craft. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai

USA, Brooksville (California)
In the afternoon, around 2 pm, 60-year-old John R. Reeves was walking when suddenly 400m in front of him he saw a flying saucer 10m in diameter and about 2m high. It was resting on the ground, supported by a landing gear of 4 feet. The craft, blue-green tending to red, had two portholes in its upper part. As Reeves was 30m away from the craft, a creature came out and walked towards him. It stopped at 5m. This entity was 1.5m tall, stocky, wearing a green garment and a green helmet made of "glass". Its skin was dark. All parts of the body were covered, except the face. Its eyes were wider than humans, and the chin more pointed. The unusual visitor gave Reeves some sheets of paper covered with strange writing. These sheets were given to an investigation commission of the Mac Dill base. (Guy TARADE: "S.V. and extraterrestrial civilizations" - J'AI LU, p. 184, 185 - dated March 1) Reeves noticed the object at some distance from him and approached it by a detour, then saw the space man. Around the object was an arrangement of pallets that looked like a Venetian blind and which opened and closed just before the object took off. The device rested on 4 feet and a cylindrical element with disc-shaped steps allowed to enter the device from below. The creature was wearing a tight, gray-silver suit, which seemed stiff. He wore a helmet very similar to an overturned glass cup resting on the shoulders. The head inside was covered with a dark material that hid the hair region. The ears, mouth and nose appeared normal, but the eyes were large and widely separated, with "a flat area" between them. The hands were covered with mittens that seemed very flexible and of the same color as the suit. Reeves did not notice any shoes. Reeves said that the creature coming out of the bushes and approaching the craft noticed him and came towards him. At first it just looked at him. Then he pulled out a small black box from his left side which emitted a flash, after which Reeves turned around. He lost his hat, bent down to pick it up, pivoted and the box emitted another flash. He did not see any flash. Reeves would have found two pieces of very thin paper bearing marks. (Charles BOWEN: "In search of humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 201 to 203)

At around 5:30 PM E.A. Bryant was out for a walk when he suddenly found himself face to face with an aerial object that was moving in a pendulum motion before stopping and hovering about a meter off the ground, a few meters in front of him. The object had literally come out of nowhere. (...)
While he was looking, an opening appeared in the side of the saucer and three shapes emerged. They were dressed in "diving gear". One of the shapes - they had the appearance of a human - gestured to the witness, who approached. The beings removed their helmets and he saw that two had very high foreheads, blue eyes and blonde hair. The third, smaller one looked to be about 15 years old, had normal features, dark hair and brown eyes. A conversation took place in acceptable English.
The dark-haired man said his name was "Yamski" and added that it was a shame that "Des" or "Les" wasn't there to see the visitors, as he would have understood! They also said they were from Venus and that they would return in a month bringing with them "proof of Mantell" or something like that.

A humanoid of a little more than one meter was understood with difficulty by Felipe Martinez. The word "sil" seemed to designate his UFO (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 187) In April 1965, while hunting, he saw at a distance of 300 m a large egg-shaped craft hovering a few meters from the ground. The UFO was surrounded by something like a "ring spinning quickly" and seemed completely silent. He had rushed enthusiastically shouting "Amigo!" and had been suddenly struck by paralysis. A door of the craft opened and a small man descended a ladder about 30 cm wide. The little man was about one meter tall, wore a helmet and two cables connected the helmet to the saucer. The rest of his costume resembled a diving suit. They conversed, the small entity speaking slowly and with difficulty. He promised to return on May 3.

Three customers of the Retreat Hotel saw a strange, brightly lit machine approach the hotel. These customers were J.W. Tilse, an old pilot, John Burgess, an Australian veteran of World War II, and Eric Jurdin, an engineer. Tilse recounts: This craft was about 300 m from the hotel veranda and was moving just above the trees. Under a circular platform there was a row of lights, about twenty or thirty. It was solid, seemed to be made of metal, and must have been 9 to 10 m in diameter. (...) For about thirty minutes it remained motionless. Then it began to rise and in the light of the lamps we could see that it had three legs at its base. Each one had a lamp. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 88, 89) Three men saw a circular UFO about 10 m in diameter, which emitted a buzzing sound. This UFO was carrying another round disc. The main object had a tripod landing gear and lights. The police found landing traces and damaged trees. It was May 23, 1965.

McDivitt is sure he saw a satellite launched from the earth, but the public must ignore it for security reasons. McDivitt, unlike other astronauts, has always willingly answered journalists' questions about this incident. (1989 - listing and research by Harvey S. Stewart)

FRANCE, Valensole (Basses-Alpes)
Maurice Masse was smoking a cigarette early in the morning before going to work in his fields when he heard a whistling. He then saw an egg-shaped craft in his lavender field and approached it to within 6 m. In front of the craft, two figures seemed to be examining the lavender. They measured about 1.20 m and were dressed in a one-piece gray-green suit. Their head was three times bigger than a human head, had normal eyes, but only an opening where the mouth should be. They were not wearing helmets. Their hands were small and well proportioned. One of them took out a tube from a sheath on his belt and pointed it at Masse. He was thus completely immobilized. For 60 seconds the creatures circled around him and a kind of gurgling came from their throat, although their mouth did not move. Then the beings returned to the craft, the door slid shut, and Masse saw them in the dome. The craft lifted off the ground from its central pivot, rose slowly, its six thin legs began to spin faster and faster, and it flew off obliquely. After 50 m it suddenly disappeared in one go. After 20 minutes Masse gradually regained his mobility to return home. (This case was widely commented on by all authors, as there were traces on the ground etc. - this excerpt is taken from: Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - pp. 38 to 41)

At 8 o'clock in the morning Ramon Eduardo Pereyra was driving his truck beyond Monte de los Curas when he saw an object like a parachute falling silently into the trees on a hill. He went to see what it was and he found, in a clearing, a chrome-colored egg-shaped device supported by metal feet. Its upper part was transparent and its lower part extremely smooth, without joints or connections. Near the machine stood a young blond man who seemed to be studying a piece of paper. He was wearing "a plastic diving suit" and small boots and had a kind of towel attached to his right leg. The witness managed to get to the device without being observed and took a look through a panel. Inside he saw a second man sitting at a control panel. It was then that the man from outside noticed him and headed towards him with an expression of anger. "What's going on?" asked Pereyra, but without answering the other one climbed straight into the device which immediately rose to a height of about 30 meters, then moved away at a regular speed.

As he crossed an open field on the outskirts of the city, he heard a strange buzzing and saw two cones of white light in the sky, then two almost round devices, one larger than the other, land not far from him. He hid behind the wall of a well and saw three entities emerge from one machine and two from the other. The two teams joined and he could hear their words that did not resemble anything he had ever heard. The beings measured 1 m 50, wore helmets and one-piece scuba suits, dark in color and small boots. One of them carried in his right hand a very bright object resembling a wand. They conversed in their whistling language for about five minutes, then each team circled its machine three times, leaning down to examine the hull. The inspection finished, they got back into their machines which flew away at such a fantastic speed that in one or two seconds they were only a tiny point among the stars. Adilon ran to join his friends at the cinema but soon felt such a violent headache that he had to go to a pharmacist to buy tablets. Without any result, his headache lasted for five days. (...)

She saw an object approaching that looked like a small plane without a rudder, with a small boy with a big head as the pilot, and extraordinary large dark eyes. He was sitting under a dome and wearing a helmet. He stopped 3 m away from the window, staying there for only 3 seconds: he was intensely observing her. During this short time the witness felt paralyzed, but as soon as the object left the feeling went away.

USA, Tulsa (Oklahoma)
Tens of thousands of Americans, from South Dakota to the Mexican border and beyond, saw bright colored lights moving in formations in the sky. Some formations were diamond-shaped and turned at right angles. Others were isolated and hovered from time to time. Some very high in the sky would dive down to a lower altitude. Others were low and would climb up in a spiral. From time to time one of these objects would stop. It was thus that around 1:30 am Alan Smith, 14 years old, from Tulsa, was able to take a remarkable color photograph of a stationary UFO in the sky, with an ordinary camera and a commercial color film. On the enlargements obtained, it was clearly visible that the UFO had the shape of a flattened disc at the back and was divided into three parts by two opaque bands. These three sections were, from left to right, with respect to the photographer, bluish green, yellow orange, white cream. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 250, 251). IN REALITY: when the image is turned over, a wide-brimmed hat with a red fruit placed on it is discovered.

2 a.m. Witnesses: Exeter police officers Eugene Bertrand, Jr. and David Hunt, and civilian Norman Muscarello. A dark, elliptical object, surrounded by a series of red lights, maneuvered silently and erratically around houses and trees, while the lights blinked in sequence. Farm animals were screaming. Observation lasted about an hour. (Project Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner). 1:45 p.m. (note de vog: ???) a young man, Norman Muscarello, 18 years old, stumbled into the Exeter police station. He was out of breath from his run, green with fear and trembling so much that he couldn't speak. When he calmed down he was able to tell Officer Tolan and Agent Bertrand that as he was returning home on Route 150, the area in front of him was suddenly illuminated by a blinding red light, then a strange aerial vessel rose above a clump of trees. As the craft approached Muscarello saw 4 or 5 bright red beams, coming out alternately from its base, in a continuous line back and forth. The lights blinked in an increasing and decreasing sequence: 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1. Panicked, Muscarello rushed behind a stone wall, which the craft slowly and silently flew over at less than 30 meters high, before hovering just above the house of a neighbor, Clyde Russel. This allowed the witness to observe that the craft was longer than the house and must have measured about thirty meters. Agents Bertrand and David Hunt also saw the craft.

They stopped and then rose to about 5 meters, leaving behind two small beings about 70 to 80 cm tall, who apparently had come out of the discs. The small creatures looked like men, were well proportioned, with smooth, reddish-brown faces "exactly like wax" and normal eyes. They wore one-piece clothing that fit very tightly. Terrified, the farmer leaned against a tree, holding a pickaxe in one hand, and the creatures that had approached returned, speaking an unintelligible language. When the farmer thought "Could these be the people from the flying saucers they talk about?" they turned, smiled, approached him, examining a tomato plant and plucking a fruit as they passed. Then they moved away again, the discs hovering descended, and apparently the little people got on board because when the discs shot up vertically with a sharp whistle, the little men had disappeared.

Then, unable to move, the witness feels paralysis taking over. The dark base of the craft stops a few decimeters from his head. He feels cardiac and cervical fluctuations, dizziness and receives an electric shock leaving him unconscious but standing. A little further the scooterist is also petrified. Later Paul Green notices his clothes cracking, his hair wrinkling and breaking. A dog from the nearby village has its fur affected in the same way, after the passage of a bluish phenomenon in the sky. (J.G. DOHMEN: "To Identify and the Adamski Case" - ed. Guy Dohmen, Biarritz 1972, p. 127)

PERU, Pichaca (Puno)
At 4:30 pm a shepherdess saw six entities from 80 to 90 cm tall emerge from a UFO on the ground. They spoke an incomprehensible language that resembled "the cackling of geese". The shepherdess fled and hid. The creatures left some traces on the ground - those of a liquid resembling oil. The clothing of the entities was white and emitted intermittent flashes of light.

PERU, Arequipa
Julio Lopez de Ramana and Antonio Chaves Bedoya in a car almost ran over a strange being that was on the road. It was about 80 cm tall and had only one eye. Its body was surrounded by gold and silver bands. Shortly after, a UFO appeared and flew over the car for some time. Then, 20 km away, a similar UFO flying very low was seen by various people.

BELGIUM, Rosières (Brabant)
Between 7:30 and 8:00 PM, Mrs. A.V. was driving at 90 km/h. Her husband was following in another car at a maximum of 500 m. When she arrived at the sharp turn, she felt that the direction of the car was no longer responding, the steering wheel was going left and right without any apparent reason. She felt strangely lifted with the car a few centimeters above the ground. At the same time, "a small neon" appeared a few centimeters from the windshield, opaque, light yellow in color, and it stayed there for a few seconds. It was like a tube 70 cm long and 4 cm thick, slightly curved upwards, with sharp and well-defined contours. Then, it suddenly disappeared. The car regained contact with the ground and the witness had passed the turn by a good 50 m. During the "transportation", she had seen the dust from the road flying at a height of about one meter..

#1965, Late Autumn
ENGLAND, Warminster
UFO sightings, and all sorts of other phenomena had become by the year 1965 so commonplace in Warminster, that no one was surprised by anything anymore. A flock of dead pigeons fell in the locality and the naturalist David Holton, after examining the dead birds, concluded that they had succumbed to unknown sonic vibrations on Earth (note from vog: how could he conclude such a nonsense?)

#1965, October 7
USA, Edward's Air Force Base
The audio documentation of Sam Sherman, "The Edwards Air Force Base Encounter" from the night of October 7, 1965, contains copies of the current voice recordings made available by the Air Force.
During this night of October 7, 1965, twelve extremely bright UFOs invaded the airspace and descended to low altitude above the runways of Edwards Base, where operator Chuck Sorrels, in the control tower, saw them and reported the event to his superiors. I met Sorrels who can be heard on the tape and he confirms that this is indeed what he said. The UFOs are described and an interception decision is taken involving F-106s. This is without a doubt the best audio tape ever heard about UFOs and the recording itself is an unparalleled event. A copy can be obtained for (May 1999) $14.95 each, plus shipping $2.00, for a total of $16.95 -- The buyer can also send a check to Independent International, Box 565, Dept. GF, Old Bridge, New Jersey 08857. (note from vog: I'm not advertising the cassette, I'm just translating the accounts of the "events". Here it is obviously ufobusiness…)

#1965, November 5
ARGENTINA, Duringo
A shepherd, José Luis Fernandez and his 15-year-old son Ignacio, were on a high plateau and saw a disk that stopped in the sky. After a minute of waiting, a round hole opened in the base of the spacecraft, from which reddish vapors emerged. Then a Martian appeared, which the two witnesses agreed to describe in the same way: "It looked like a big lizard, 80 cm long; it had mouse ears, six tubular arms and a long tail ending in an olive leaf. He held an object, a kind of metal umbrella, with three very thin supports that he waved as if he were making signals. After observing everything carefully, he jumped to the ground and, of course, José and Ignacio ran away. (Peter KOLOSIMO: "Shadows on the Stars" - Albin Michel 1970, p. 353)

Not far from Khartoum and the Blue Nile, a celestial phenomenon, a rain of fire, has been burning daily for eleven days, from five to six peasant houses. The authorities are unable to justify this phenomenon responsible for 70 fires. (J.G. DOHMEN: "To Identify and the Adamski Case" - ed. Guy Dohmen, Biarritz 1972, p. 61)
