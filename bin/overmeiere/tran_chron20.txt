USA, BAF Kirtland
The first successful experience dates back to 1973, the year when the Americans managed to shoot down a guided target missile above their Kirtland base, passing close to the "LASER" air defense. Progress was however relatively slow to go from a range of tens of meters to an action radius measured in kilometers.

Another group of Soviet electronic listening satellites, launched on a slightly lower and less inclined orbit (74°) appeared in 1973 with "Cosmos 544" to cease to exist in 1979. An average of 4 were launched per year during this period. ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, p. 87)

#1973, 10 January
FRANCE, Quarouble
At around 1 o'clock, Mr. Pouget (Pourain?) and Miss Donez were driving down Rue du Dauphin towards Blanc Misseron and the Belgian border. Near the stadium, a grey-white light was moving slowly. At first they didn't think much of it. But when the light suddenly and intermittently projected intense beams of light, moved east, zigzagged, rose and fell, moved in a saw-tooth pattern, curved, arrived at Rue du Dauphin and directed its beam towards the witnesses, and then suddenly went out, the witnesses were scared. After regaining their composure, five minutes passed and the phenomenon appeared again. It no longer projected a beam: it was a square with rounded corners, with a dark curved vertical line, and a large halo around it, giving it the size of a house. A veranda was lit up by the phenomenon and the witnesses could see all the details. (vog: I suppose here we are talking about the details of the veranda and not those of the phenomenon). (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 402, 403)

AUSTRIA, Graz
It was 5:00 in the morning, Mr. A. was on his way to work (Puch factories in Graz-Thondorf). When he arrived at the Puntigam bridge, he noticed that the road and the air were lit up by a blue glow. He then saw an object gliding through the sky, just above the high-voltage line. The object was approaching at a constant speed, like a glider ready to land, its front pointed towards the ground. The object had the size of a medium-sized car, colored blue, ending in 4 or 5 fan-shaped points on a kind of parallelepiped (box) with rounded corners, and at the front there was something like a ledge. The witness on the bike pedaled faster, feeling a strange feeling of insecurity, so much was he taken aback by this apparition. When he arrived at a corner of the road, he looked around and saw the flying object close to the ground parallel to the road. That's when he saw 8 or 10 fixed red points, like small domes emitting a very bright red glow that contrasted with the blue of the rest of the object. Suddenly, without any noise, it went out, leaving the area in complete darkness. (Inforespace n° 21, June 1975, pp. 19, 20)

USA, Enfield, Illinois
Late at night, Henry McDaniel was watching one last movie on television. A noise reaches him, someone is scratching at the door. He wonders who it could be at this late hour. He gets up and goes to open the door. There, an indescribable being is looking at him. It measures between 1.20m and 1.50m. It has three legs, a hunched body, two small arms coming out of its chest and its two pink eyes the size of a flashlight reflector are fixed on McDaniel. The dark grayish creature tries to enter the house. Horrified, McDaniel does not give it the chance. He rushes to his gun and without warning, he opens fire. With the first shot he has the sensation of having hit it, but he notices that the monster does not seem to be any worse off. With a wild cat hissing, it jumps in three bounds and covers a distance of at least 25 meters. It then disappears behind the steep slope of the railway line in the bushes. (...) The police will discover paw prints, similar to those of a dog but with six toes. (Jean FERGUSON: "Les Humanoïdes..." - ed. Leméac, Ottawa 1977, p.180, 181)

BRAZIL, Catanduva (Sao Paolo)
At 3 o'clock in the morning, Onilson Patero, a 40-year-old employee, had dropped off a passenger in Itajobi and was continuing the journey home to Catanduva. The car radio had strong interference, the engine was stuttering at the same time as an intense blue light began to sweep through the interior of the car. As the vehicle jolted, a blinding but lower light source startled him as he saw his engine in great detail: the hood and dashboard seemed to no longer exist, as if he was looking at it with X-ray eyes. He then stopped the vehicle. Inside, the heat was so intense he was suffocating and he opened the door. Then he saw the object hovering 10 meters above the ground, 15 meters away from him, emitting a turbine buzzing sound. It resembled two hats stuck together, without any structure, and from a single source it emitted this intense light. Then a kind of tube descended from the lower part and a semi-transparent veil covered the craft: the witness no longer felt the heat or lack of air. (...) He lost consciousness. Around 5 o'clock in the morning a policeman found him unconscious in a stream near the road, 30 meters away from his car parked on the side, doors open and headlights on. The man was taken to the hospital. Inside the car, the briefcase had been opened and the documents it contained were scattered. Physiological effects: brown hair had become completely black, yellow pigmented spots on the body. (Inforespace n° 11 - p. 36, 37 - 1973 - SOBEPS) Finally he was seized by such panic that he left his vehicle and ran, head down, into the nearby forest. After running about thirty meters, he felt a mysterious force pulling him back like a spring. Desperate, he tried to free himself from the lasso he thought was holding him prisoner, but his hand did not encounter any tangible link. When he looked towards his car he noticed other unusual transformations. This time the witness was so terrified that he lost consciousness. (Emmeneger 1974) (A.SCHNEIDER - H. MALTHANER: "Le dossier secret des OVNI", ed. De Vecchi, 1978, p. 34)

MEXICO, Vera Cruz
Miguel Angel Gonzalez was driving peacefully in his truck loaded with plaster and asbestos plates, when he saw a group of small men, similar to dwarves and dressed in a strange way. These characters immediately fled as soon as the witness stopped the truck to examine them closely. He searched for them for a few minutes without seeing them, and returning to the truck he saw that it was surrounded by gigantic blue flames producing no heat. In a few moments the truck and its load were destroyed. This strange fire had spared the plastic of the seats, the paint of the doors, the fuel tank... (Inforespace n° 23 - October 1975, p. 11)

A little after midnight, Randy Needdham and Judy Johnson were parked in their car on the boat dock of the Big Muddy River. Suddenly a shrill cry. Looking up they saw, coming from who knows where, a huge giant walking heavily towards them. He stopped six meters away. He seemed white, with short hair plastered with the mud of the river. He was of very strong build and measured about 2 m. The witnesses fled to go and warn the police, who found traces. (Jean FERGUSON: "The Humanoids..." - ed. Leméac, Ottawa 1977, p.182)

CHAD, in flight
The Concorde piloted by André Turcat was flying over Chad at 17000m altitude and Mach 2, on a scientific mission: observation of the solar eclipse. Jean Begot, a technician from the CNRS, was taking pictures. Upon development, one of the photos showed a bright point in the night of the eclipse. (15 km from the plane) Upon magnification, this "star" took on the size of a flying saucer. This bright point had been observed by the entire crew: planet or saucer? (Robert ROUSSEL: "OVNI, the end of the secret" - Belfond 1978, p. 20) IN REALITY: According to Pierre Guérin, a well-known astrophysicist and an experienced ufologist, the bright spot has absolutely nothing mysterious about it. That day at 11:12, the swarm of Beta Taurid meteors was indeed passing over the equatorial African zone and was therefore clearly visible. René Fouéré from GEPAN thinks it was a development fault, such as one caused by the presence of a small air bubble. (Bougard 1974/16) (A. SCHNEIDER-H. MALTHANER: "Le dossier secret des OVNI", ed.

USA, throughout Pennsylvania
As this is a report grouping 118 separate testimonies of encounters with unknown creatures, the date and location have been generalized. Each report differs somewhat but all have certain details in common. The common thread of the reports is the encounter with one or more hairy creatures, resembling monkeys, with glowing eyes, prominent ears, large noses, carnivorous teeth and long arms. Where Gordon was able to take footprints, they were very large. The encounters usually took place in wooded areas or near rural villages. During the observation of these creatures, domestic animals usually remained calm, but in the period before and after, animals and small children were very agitated: cows mooed, dogs barked, children cried all night. These creatures have often been seen in association with UFO sightings, seen entering or exiting a UFO, and occasionally telepathic messages from these creatures have been reported. On three occasions the witnesses shot at them from close range, which caused the instant disappearance of the entity, in a flash of light.

#July 1973
CHINA, Changchun (Jilin)
It was a day in July 1973, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly we observed an object flying from north to south, in our direction. Its speed was slow and no sound was heard. Looking at it more closely, we noticed that it resembled a large shuttle and that its two ends were pointed. Its entire body was transparent like glass. In its front part there were lights inside as bright as an electric arc. The middle and back were divided into four floors with portholes neatly arranged like those of a large boat. At 7000 meters altitude, it seemed enormous to us. If it had landed on the ground, it would have been at least as high as a two-story building. Throughout its journey over our heads, it made no noise. We immediately alerted the other fighters of the barracks and everyone came out and looked in amazement. (...) Our observation lasted in all five or six minutes. The object disappeared in the distance. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials". ed. Mercure de France, 1983, pp. 117, 118)

Students near the ravine "El Jordan" who were to collect samples of vegetation saw at the edge of the almost dried-up stream, 4 small beings no more than 20 cm tall: they were examining the mud. Dressed in white, with small gray caps, they looked like miniature little men. Upon the approach of the students they disappeared "into the air". A police officer was also a witness to the phenomenon. The footprints of the little steps were photographed. (GEPA n° 45 - p. 27 - 1975) Four young boys saw tiny entities in the muddy bed of the river. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 322)

#1973, August (a Tuesday)
BRAZIL, Nova Friburgo (Rio)
At around 2pm, Edmond Cardoso, working at Fazenda Velha, heard a rustling in the leaves 20m away from him: through the leaves he saw a sparkling ball near a bush whose leaves were agitated (even though there was no wind). As he got closer, he noticed that the object was floating 50cm from the ground, that it was a ball 2m in diameter of a blue-aluminum color with a nearly blinding shine. The object was horizontally encircled by a dark green band and at the top of the ball emerged a vertical cylinder 4-5m high and 50cm wide. The cylinder was finished with a funnel-shaped form also 4-5m high. This object rotated on itself in 2-3 seconds and swayed with an amplitude of about 50cm. Cautiously, he stepped back a few paces when he heard a clap, like a metal door. He turned around and indeed saw in the lower part of the ball an opening about 1m high and 60cm wide and saw at the same time that the thickness of the wall was indeed 5cm. In the frame appeared 30 seconds later a being of human appearance that was floating outside 50cm from the ground, completely dressed in black from feet to head, except for the details that were ash-colored: the wrists and hands were smooth, the shoes 20cm long, 5cm wide and 3cm thick, a band around the neck 6cm wide, openings for the eyes and mouth. The fabric was of the bubbled kind, like several juxtaposed half-spheres. The being was connected to the craft by two transparent cables 5cm wide coming from the shoes towards the inside of the UFO. In 5 strides it advanced 3m towards the witness who, terrified, ran away. (Inforespace n° 34, p. 12)

It was 7:45 PM, night had just fallen, Mr. Plume was driving his daughter Sonia to Mons. "Suddenly, at the exit of a bend, we saw in front of us on the left of the road an immobile object at about 200 m of height, almost vertically above an electric cabin, at less than 200 m from us. It was like a flower pot of the size of a small car, with at its upper part a kind of saw of which one could only see the teeth. At the extremities of this part two short oblique antennas. The whole was of a vivid orange color. Four dazzling yellow lights on the antennas and at the base of the object were twinkling. The upper part under the teeth was more clear and blurry, yellow-orange. The teeth were brownish. An orange clear and blurry halo was crowning the object between the antennas. It was animated by light vibrations. A few seconds later, arrived at the height of the electric cabin, the object inclined towards the right and moved away towards Ciply. Its light was decreasing in intensity and its contours were fading." (Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - p. 73 à 76)

PORTUGAL, Alija-Vila Réal (Oporto)
Between 10:30 PM and midnight, Serge Ribeiro Lisboa, Maria Filomena Costa Lisboa, and Maria Carmela Santos Costa were travelling together in a car. Near Sao Laurenço and Tua, they heard an unusual buzzing coming from outside the car, and a faint light moving to their right. The driver stopped and all the passengers got out. They then saw a white, luminous object, like a disk, emitting a powerful red light from its upper part. These flashes allowed them to see part of the structure, which appeared to be metallic, light aluminum. The object was small: 2 m in diameter, 1 m high, and seemed to be at 300 m altitude. Feeling uneasy, the witnesses got back in the car and continued their journey to the town of Alija. There, the engine had some difficulty with its speed, for no apparent reason, and they heard the buzzing again, with a sound of modulated, brief cadence, without any light being seen. After a journey of 4 or 5 km, they saw an unusual object in the headlights on the road. A strange cylindrical object emitting a bright green color. The driver slowed down, fearing it was some kind of explosive, and narrowly avoided the object. At the same time, the passengers saw two human forms lying on their backs on the embankment. They were wearing lead-silver colored suits, were 1.5 m tall, and had spherical helmets with a horizontal rectangular window at eye level and an antenna 50 cm long emitting red glows at its end. The observation was brief. Frightened, the driver accelerated and as the car passed the cylindrical object, the two humanoid forms rose from the ground, in a rigid manner, without any movement of their arms or legs. The witnesses then saw a kind of backpack on the backs of the humanoids as they rose and disappeared above the car.

Antoine walked to a small clearing to pick mushrooms. It was 5:30 PM, the sun was already low, the sky covered with a few clouds, not a breath of wind. He noticed a large "mushroom nest" and bent down to pick it, but when he looked up he saw two "children" coming out of the bushes 30 m away from him. He called them to come pick mushrooms with him. But they were not children: they were small people 1.2 m tall, with regular and fine features, wearing a beret, dressed in a tight beige jumpsuit, their hands were bare, but Antoine did not see their feet, hidden in the grass. Yet one detail struck him: they had no ears. At Antoine's call they looked surprised, emitted a kind of laugh, then disappeared into the bushes. A few seconds later, an oval shape, gray-blue matte, without visible opening, rose from behind the bushes. It measured 5 m long and about 2 m wide, it rose to 20 m, dragging the dead leaves up to 6 m from the ground. It remained motionless for a brief moment, then flew horizontally at a dizzying speed towards Mont Ventoux. All this was done without the slightest noise, except for a slight whistle during the vertical ascent. There were traces on the ground at the supposed landing site.

The same scenario was repeated in October 1973, during the Yom Kippur War between Arabs and Israelis. This time the means employed were much more important, in proportion to the stakes. Eight satellites were launched in two weeks, the first three (Cosmos 596, 597, 598) were recovered after 6 days of observation. For the others, the delay ranged from 7 to 13 days.

A truck driver was temporarily blinded when he stuck his head out of the open window to get a better view of a UFO. His wife, who was accompanying him, said a big ball of fire jumped in his face, tearing off his glasses. She took the wheel to drive her husband to the hospital. The doctor examining the glasses said a terrible heat had expanded the frame and one of the lenses had fallen out. The truck driver was treated for his burns and did not start to see again until several hours later. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDELLL: "The World's Greatest UFO Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p 148)

CANADA, St Mathias de Chambly
At around 12:45am, the R.N. couple saw the light of a large projector about 500m away, sweeping the ground of their land. The husband assumed it was the police looking for cattle thieves reported in the area. At around 11:35am, while hanging laundry behind the house, Mrs. R.N. saw a thick smoke on a wet, plowed land. She called her husband, as this smoke in that place was rather unusual. In the same direction, the witnesses saw a yellow-orange dome about 25m in diameter with blurry edges, as if submerged in the fog. The object was 500m from the ground and a yellow-orange "bulldozer" emerged from it and moved away 65m from the large machine, to the edge of the stream near its source. Then there was a back and forth of 5 small figures, 1m tall, wearing bright orange suits, moving quickly, very busy and as if in a hurry to finish a job. The small craft moved again following the stream and stopped 100m further. The observation lasted between 20 and 25 minutes, but the witnesses went about their business, coming to see from time to time "if the children" were still there! At around 11:55am everything had disappeared. The witnesses' daughter went to see on the spot and found a large circle 18m in diameter and a smaller one 4m in diameter, where the grass was flattened and burned in some places. As soon as she was back home, she was taken with headaches and vomiting. (Inforespace n° 22 - August 1975 - p. 13)

USA, Pascagoula
Charles Hickson, a 45-year-old shipyard foreman, and Calvin Parker, 19, were fishing on the banks of the Pascagoula River (in the town of the same name - Gulf Coast of Mexico) at around 7:00 PM when they both noticed an oblong shape emitting a bright blue light. The object was already very close and was descending towards them, making a humming sound. Suddenly, an opening appeared and three pale, reddish beings floated out of it. Without having to use force, they grabbed the witnesses by the arms: two of them took hold of Hickson, the third of Parker. They felt themselves being lifted off the ground and guided towards the opening of the object. From then on, the young Parker could not remember exactly what happened to them. Hickson recounts that inside there was a white luminescence without a visible source. He floated like the beings and stayed there for between 20 and 30 minutes, under the gaze of what looked like a large eye. Various instruments that he could not identify were visible, but there were neither seats nor windows, only this opening. He was unable to move, scared to death. The humanoids moved around him and he was apparently observed by an electronic device. In the end, the creatures brought the two men back, still floating, to where they had found them. These beings, about 5 feet tall, did not seem to be dressed. They emitted a faint humming sound. According to Parker: they looked like ghosts, were naked and their skin was wrinkled. Hickson estimated the dimensions of the craft to be 14 feet long by 8 feet wide. It suddenly disappeared. The witnesses were convinced that no one would believe them, but after reflection they decided to alert the authorities. The police officer declared: "they were so scared they were on the verge of a heart attack". The men were interrogated again and again in the following days and gave another part of the observation under hypnosis.

USA, Cincinnati (Ohio)
Mrs. Heitfeld had set up her mobile home next to a department store warehouse. Around 2:30am she woke up, tormented by a terrible thirst. Her gaze was drawn to a bright light outside. She pulled back the curtains and saw a row of lights forming an arc. Each light as big as an open hand. There were 6 of them, spaced 120 cm apart. There was also another light that appeared in the parking lot, just behind her caravan trailer: a car parked there was masking the lower part of this light source. It was at this moment that a creature resembling a monkey appeared in the glow. Terrified, Mrs. Heitfeld watched all this for 2 to 3 minutes, thinking that the creature was very close to the car. Her 13-year-old son, who was sleeping in the mobile home, was awakened by her. When she returned to the window, she noticed that the creature was about 10 m away from the car. It was inside a shield of light: it was like a standing monkey, tall and without a neck. It had a kind of muzzle ending in a point directed downwards. Its body was uniformly gray. Only the arms moved jerkily, like a robot. The witness never saw legs or other details in the rest of the body, which moved as if sliding on the ground. She called the police and was told "Madam, we have already been to the place". "But it is still here; this can in no way be a human being!" she cried. While her mother was on the phone, young Carl saw a car approaching the one near the caravan and connecting the battery of one to the hood of the other, and he went back to bed. Shortly afterwards a dull noise was heard: Carl assumed that the car had left. There was indeed a car breakdown by Cliff Fulmer of Tina Marie Arrico's car: these two people noticed nothing special. Mrs. Heitfeld's observation had ended, without her seeing how the being had left. (Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - P.148 to 151)

Shortly after midnight, George Willis was awakened by a piercing noise. His room was bathed in orange light. He could make out three nightmare creatures in front of him: one to one and a half meters tall, round heads, large ears, and wrinkled skin of a grayish white. They had jerky, mechanical movements, like robots. Willis fainted. He remembers that when he woke up, he was on the floor; the entities grabbed him and propped him up against the wall. In this vertical position, his body and limbs suddenly stiffened. Helpless, he saw that the three intruders were examining his body with a strange little oval object. When the device was pointed downward towards his leg, his leg bone was visible! Immediately he was seized with a violent headache and he fainted again. He only came to at dawn. Fearfully he looked around. The lights were still on. The sheets were neatly folded. (Leonard STRINGFIELD, "General UFO Alert", ed. France Empire 1978, p.85)

Mr. Clarence Ray Patterson (...) was only 50 km from his home in Pensacola, it was 10 pm. Suddenly, in his windshield, a few hundred meters away, he saw an enormous shining object appear, so big that he did not hesitate to compare it to a football field. The object stopped above his truck which was literally sucked into the UFO. In the heart of the craft, six beings of strange and incredible appearance approached and forced Patterson to get out of his vehicle. Round, with one eye, hands like crab claws, they were of small size, their heads barely reaching Patterson's chest. They busied themselves around the man for more than 30 minutes (...) They moved around him with a slow, affected air. (...) Finally, they relaxed him on a road about 80 km from his home. The journey had covered 112 km. Completely broken, dazed, he drove to Pensacola where he stopped at the police station. There, he collapsed on a bench, crying hysterically. He told his adventure to Sergeant Lucien Mitchell.

Paul Brown reported to the police that a bright light had passed over his car with a whistling sound, just before he saw an object shaped like a cone land about 100 m in front of him. He stopped, surprised. When small creatures emerged from the object, he put his hand on the revolver in the glove compartment and crouched behind the open door, ready to shoot them. The creatures did not advance, they returned to their craft which quickly departed while Brown claimed to have fired some shots without hitting the flying object.

A red light seemed to be escorting an Army Reserve helicopter, piloted by Captain Coyne, then quickly approached it. The pilot descended to the ground to avoid collision, while the cigar-shaped object flew over it and illuminated it with a green light. During this time, the onboard radio was silent. Then the UFO moved away and Coyne realized that his aircraft had inexplicably risen 700 meters.

Driving alone on the road from Huntsville to Tifton around 3:30 PM, a businesswoman encountered the unusual. Suddenly the engine and all the car's systems failed and she felt a strange sensation rising in her. Looking to the left, "the being" was there, against the door. She dared not look straight at him and did not want to believe that this apparition was real. Standing 120 cm tall, it seemed entirely clad in a metal resembling tin. In place of the head, a dome of the same material the size of a motorcycle helmet, pierced with two rectangular slits at eye level. After 5 or 6 minutes, the being moved from left to right, then back around the car. The walk was normal but the head turned mechanically. The witness did not see the bottom of the being's body: she only saw him up to the waist. When the creature had disappeared, as she saw no one around, she decided to open the hood to attract the attention of passing motorists: when she lifted the hood, smoke came out even though there was no fire. An hour and a half later, a police car finally stopped near her. When the tow truck came, the hood was almost at the point of fusion, the metal was soft but the paint was not affected. It took 3 hours before they could touch the heated engine. (Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - P. 154, 156)

When Flatter and Townsend arrived, they saw nothing out of the ordinary. Ed Townsend then left for other duties while Gary Flatter decided to stay a bit longer. Suddenly, a whole menagerie rushed past his stopped vehicle: he counted 7 hares, a raccoon, an opossum, and several cats. At the same time, he heard a kind of sharp whistle. Looking more closely, Flatter saw two creatures staring at him, dressed in silver suits, on the opposite side of the road. They measured about 1 m 20, had an egg-shaped head covered by something like a gas mask. Flatter turned on the headlights. Far from being bothered by the light, the creatures began to put on a kind of show: they jumped to a remarkable height, and to come down they floated, and so on. Finally, they flew away leaving a kind of faint red trail. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDELL: "The World's Greatest UFO Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 10)

… American witnesses saw two giant (2.50m) humanoid creatures come out of a flying saucer and immediately start walking on all fours. They had gray fur and green eyes, shining in the darkness. (Jean FERGUSON: "Les Humanoïdes…" ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1977, p 127 and p.187, 188, the only author who dates it to October 27) … The trio walked up the hill; the object was landed. It was bright white, could have been 30 meters in diameter and made a lawnmower noise. In the light of the craft, they saw two tall beings, like monkeys, with shining eyes. They emitted shrill sounds and an odor of "burnt rubber" filled the air. One of the young men was scared and ran away. The man with the rifle fired several shots above the heads of the creatures, without stopping them. Then he fired three shots, this time at one of them. A moan rose up, then the one who had been hit raised his arm and both of them disappeared into the woods. The UFO disappeared. (Leonard STRINGFIELD: "Alerte générale OVNI", ed. France – Empire, 1978, p. 91 to 93 which dates it to October 25) Around 9 pm, the young farmer Stephen Pulaski, according to the report published in the Flying Saucer Review, and at least 15 other witnesses saw a red glowing ball hovering over a nearby field. Stephen took his 30.06 rifle, and with two boys about ten years old each, sons of neighbors, drove to the thing to see what it was. The headlights of Stephen's car dimmed when they arrived near the object, and when the object descended to the ground, Stephen's German shepherd, left at the farm, became like crazy.

Very early in the morning, the truck driven by Dionisio Llanca had a flat tire. He therefore stopped outside the road, in a secluded place and began to busy himself to change the wheel. He had seen small lights in the distance, but had not paid attention to them until they approached and were of a bright blue. Trying to see what the object carrying this strange light was, he found himself paralyzed and could not move. He could however see how a dome-shaped disc descended, hovering just above the ground, next to the truck.<br/><br/>
On the ground, near the vehicle, there were three humanoid entities: two men and one woman. They had long blond hair and almond-shaped eyes, wore silver one-piece suits, boots, but their head was free of helmets, they were not armed. The entities spoke among themselves, then one of them lifted Llanca by the collar of his sweater. Llanca was in the utmost terror, but the man adjusted a small black box around the index finger of his left hand and instantly Llanca became relaxed. In a few moments he lost consciousness. He woke up the next day, lying on the road. He told his story. Despite the use of hypnotherapy and truth serum, Llanco could not even remember a shred of what had happened to him after he lost consciousness. He could only say that the extraterrestrials had made contact with the earth in 1950 and were studying how the earthly man could live on this planet. He could describe the interior of the spacecraft, saying that one did not enter it either by a ramp or by stairs, but by a beam of light. He also said that the entities did not want him to remember anything else. (DON ELKINS with CARLA RUECKERT, CASE NUMBER 7, Investigator: Liria D. Jauregui, APRO Investigator) They spoke among themselves in a kind of language without vowels. The sound emitted made me think of a badly tuned radio. One of these beings took me by the collar of the jacket and forced me to stand up. I wanted to speak but I had no voice. The other placed a device on the index finger of my left hand, they applied it to me for a few seconds, I felt nothing. When removing it I saw two drops of blood on my finger. It was at this moment that I must have fainted, I do not remember the rest .." (Inforespace n° 41 of 1978, p. 9 which dates this from November)

George Chubert was on his way to work on his moped. It was 5:30, still dark. His engine had some hiccups in a slight curve and stopped. He resumed his journey pushing the moped. As he came out of the curve, he was blinded by a strong bright white light and a few meters further he could make out a bright shape blocking the whole road. He was scared. He was completely terrified when he saw a being approach him and put his left hand on his right shoulder. "Where are you going?" the being asked. "To work" Chubert replied. "I'll be back" said the other. "But now don't look at what I'm going to do". Real exchange or telepathy? In any case, Chubert obeyed and turned around. A few seconds later the craft flew away with a "buzzing of a bee swarm". 3m.

Rex Snow ordered his dog to attack the two silver-clad figures frolicking in his well-lit garden. The dog, a trained attack German shepherd, leapt forward towards the intruders. But when it got to within 10 meters of them, the creatures stopped their gamboling and stared fixedly at the dog. The animal stopped, growled, and with its tail between its legs, returned to the safety of the house. Snow had a .38 caliber pistol in his hands, but he was trembling so much he couldn't use it against the strangers. Overcome with a visceral fear, he followed the dog back inside. He watched the creatures through the window: they seemed to be faintly luminous, had oversized ears, sunken dark orbits for eyes, and a very pointed nose. On their heads they wore a Ku Klux Klan-style hat, silver like their costume. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDELL: "The World's Greatest UFO Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 10)

Four fishermen, joined by coast guards, discovered a strange object underwater. (...) In the dark waters, the men were preparing to cast their nets. Suddenly Raymond heard his brother Rayme calling him: he was signaling him to come and see. Near Rayme's boat, in less than four meters of water, all four saw a bright light in the water. (...) for a moment the Ryan (Raymond and Rayme) played cat and mouse with the device (...) "It was big, maybe more than 30 meters in diameter, it was round and metallic". "It was like the top of a parachute, with ribs coming from a dark bump in the center". (...) etc.. (Leonard STRINGFIELD: "General Alert UFO", ed. France-Empire, 1978, pp. 150-154) In the night three witnesses saw an object submerged southwest of Pascagoula. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "UFO, First Complete Dossier..." - ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 426) It was a small object 1 m long and 15 to 20 cm wide, shining like steel, playing cat and mouse with the coast guard at the mouth of the Pascagoula River (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 172)

The witnesses were two eleven-year-old boys (Richard Thiel and Danny Fleming). They were going to play in a vacant lot (around 7 pm) (...) when they discovered an object that was motionless. (...) They slowly approached it. Five minutes passed, then one of the boys started to tap the object three or four times with an electric torch. The object, described by the boys as a clear grey, immediately came to life. The taps made a metallic sound. At the top of the object, the dome began to shine with a red light (alternating). At the same time, the object rose to 1 meter - 1 meter 20. Around the perimeter of the object, green lights flashed successively. The object began to spin on itself, making a rather dull sound. (...) and the object rose into the air, still making the same sound. The boys started to run; they felt assaulted by shivers, tinglings, and were overcome by a great weakness.

In the night this woman was unable to sleep and went to the kitchen. Around 2 o'clock her attention was suddenly drawn to a white object that seemed to be floating on the other side of the window. She approached it and discovered something 4 feet tall: a humanoid being, with a round head and normal eyes. She saw neither nose nor mouth on the face. Around the head, or helmet that surrounded the head, there was a kind of halo or aureole of flames. She also saw some kind of laces around its neck. The shoulders were not built square like a human's but started from the base of the head or helmet, at an angle of 45°. She was not scared, the being even seemed beautiful to her. She felt drawn to the humanoid, but felt unable to move. When the creature disappeared after about 15 seconds, she suddenly realized that a strange event had just occurred and ran to the bedroom to wake up her husband. But there was nothing to be seen anymore. (Pierre DELVAL: "Contacts of the 4th Type" - De Vecchi 1979, p. 81)

Two fishermen, father Georges Jean and son Noël, arrived on the field around 05:30 in the morning. A big light was revealed at sea level, on the sand. Stunned, the fishermen did not dare to advance at first, but still went down towards the beach, each one going towards his lines. The son saw the light right on his lines and went to get the father, explaining that the light was at the heart of his nets. They headed towards it, pointing their lamps in front of them. The light did not move. They were scared and went back up towards their mopeds. Before leaving, they saw the yellow light go out, then a blue-green beam swept the ground and the dunes. Apart from fear, the witnesses felt nothing. (J. C. BOURRET: "la nouvelle vague des S.V." - France Empire 1975 - P. 62,63) The same night, a curious accident happened on the coast. The trawler Archipel which was near the breakers of Urville just west of Cherbourg and on the trajectory of the object, lost its way, apparently due to a disturbance of its Decca-navigator (L.D.L.N), a deviation of the compass (J.Vallée Collège invisible p. 72). The boat hit the rocks and sank. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 426) They advanced to about 150 m from the object which had the appearance of an intense yellow window of 3.50m long by 1.50m high emitting a conical beam towards the ground. (...) but it suddenly changed: the yellow light went out. At the place where it had hovered was now a blue-green balloon which flew away at 6:05.

At 6:30, the witness, Rita Franco, was returning from a short walk with her young shepherd dog. As she was climbing the steps of her building, she heard a crackling noise. She turned around and saw, towards the Chaussée de Boitsfort, a gray-blue luminous beam. It was directed vertically towards the sky and was hollow. The top of the beam was cut horizontally. While she was looking at this phenomenon, it started to move: the crackling was replaced by a whistling. During its movement, the beam described quite tight circles. The dog's fur was literally standing on end. She expected to see the phenomenon reappear momentarily, hidden by a building, but then she saw a gray-matte craft emerge, which stopped in the air after a silent trajectory of about ten meters. This thing was not lit. It was egg-shaped, with the large end downwards. It seemed to have important edges or welds, but too small to be wings. At that moment, the panicked dog ran towards the hall and she followed it. She hoped to be able to examine the phenomenon from the terrace, but when she got there, there was nothing to see anymore.

At around 6:45 pm two 14-year-old boys, Fernand Perez and Jean Paul Dazévédo, were out for a ride on their mopeds to the chapel of Saint Baudile. Almost at the top of the steep hill they saw a strange light illuminating the chapel. They abandoned their mopeds and continued on foot: they discovered a circular object about 10 meters in diameter and about 3.5 meters high, resting on legs, a bit lower down. The object was the color of aluminum and they heard a faint humming like that of a small electric motor. All around the dome there were red and white flashing lights. A door opened in the middle, sliding on the upper part of the dome. They were scared! They went back down to their mopeds, avoiding making any noise, and returned to Fabrègues to alert people. Three of their friends went back up with them. When they arrived at the site they were blinded by an intense light that prevented them from seeing anything. The story spread around the village, and when everyone arrived at the top, they saw an object that seemed to be trying to land, but it disappeared over the crest of the hill in the direction of Sète. - Traces (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, pp. 207-209) Note: the Fabrègues case is thought to be a hoax set up by the two main young witnesses, but no counter-investigation has come to our knowledge.

Beginning of the CLAUDE VORILHON = RAEL affair.
"That is how I found myself at the bottom of the crater (note from vog: extinguished! Phew!); And suddenly I saw a flashing light above the volcano (...) It was only when it stopped two meters above the ground, about twenty meters from me, that I noticed it had the shape of a huge bell, four meters high and seven meters in diameter. It had the color of silver metal". The lower hatch of the craft opened and inclined towards the ground, unfolding like a removable footstep. "Seeing two feet appear, then two legs clad in green, I was panic-stricken. I only regained my composure when, above a thin silhouette, about 1.20m high, I saw the face of this mysterious being. With his slanted eyes, wide forehead, black beard and olive complexion, he had an Asian type. A kind of halo enveloped his face. (...) (Vorilhon follows the stranger inside the saucer) At the request of the extraterrestrial, he will return five days in a row at the same time to the bottom of the crater. He will receive a long message and stunning details about the origin of the worlds. (etc.. etc.. )

The witness lives in a modest row house and makes the observation from the ground floor. The 75 m² garden is delimited by three high whitewashed walls, behind the back wall there is the property of a convent of religious women housing a school. V.M. was already in bed that night, when around 2 o'clock in the morning he woke up for a natural need and had to go out to a small building attached to the kitchen. He did this without turning on the light, in the darkness. When he arrived in the kitchen he heard the sound of a shovel falling outside. Through the window curtain he saw a greenish light outside. His garden should normally have been plunged into darkness at this hour, the witness was very intrigued. He went to the window, moved the curtain aside. In the back of the garden was a small being of about 1m10 dressed in a shiny suit that emitted a greenish light. The character was visible from the back and three-quarters. He was of medium build, the head, legs and arms proportionate to his height. On his head he wore a transparent helmet in the shape of a ball and a tube came out of the back to connect to a kind of backpack that the character wore on his back. This bag, rectangular in shape, covered his back from the waist to the shoulder blades. This equipment had the same appearance as the clothes. On his stomach, at waist height, he wore a small bright red, luminous and sparkling square box, attached to a belt. The bottom of the billowing trousers was taken up in small tight boots of the same greenish aspect. The hands were gloved and the sleeves of the garment tightened at the wrists. Seen from the back, the head appeared round and black. A halo surrounded the visitor partially illuminating the ground and the left wall. He held in his hand a device comparable to a vacuum cleaner or a mine detector which he slowly passed over a pile of bricks at the bottom of the garden. The character seemed to move with difficulty. He was waddling as he walked. V.M. then used the flashlight and made two light calls in the direction of the creature. At this signal the humanoid turned around by pivoting in one piece. V.M. then saw for the first time the black face of the visitor. He saw neither nose nor mouth: only small pointed ears. The eyes, oval and yellow, were particularly bright and surrounded by a green edge. On the iris the witness noticed small black and red veins, the pupil was black and oval (note from vog: he saw all this at 25 m distance? This creature must have had ENORMOUS eyes!) When the eyelids lowered, the face became completely dark. Then the being answered the witness by raising his hand and forming a "V" with his index and middle finger (note from vog: unless it was donkey ears he was representing!) after which he turned towards the back wall. He put one foot flat against the masonry, then the other and climbed the wall holding his legs straight, arrived at the top of this 3 m high obstacle, he tilted forward to descend (probably) on the other side. A minute having elapsed, V.M. saw an aura of white light appear behind the wall and a round object gradually appear, of about 5 m in diameter, which eventually rose vertically to 20m, then tilted and left behind a luminous trail. During the flight of the craft there was a sound like the rubbing of the elytra of a cricket, which amplified into a whistling when the craft left.

At around 9 pm, Mme Jendreaux left the farm to check if the dogs were properly tied up for the night. The sky was particularly cloudy and low. Suddenly, towards the east she saw the phenomenon, as if it had just lit up: first a kind of milky dome above a meadow 100 m away from her, which was stationary close to the ground. Mme Jendreaux had the impression that it was made of a transparent or translucent material because she seemed to make out a kind of vertical "stovepipe" inside. On either side of this pipe, the dome was stained with two vaguely circular dark areas. The dome was the size of a small tractor. Above it, offset to the right, were two yellow neon tubes placed one above the other, horizontal and motionless. These tubes were clearly visible just above the line of trees. The whole thing was perfectly silent and Mme Jendreaux, fascinated, watched the phenomenon for several minutes without moving from the doorstep and without thinking to call her husband inside the house a few metres away from her. Suddenly she felt drawn, sucked towards the phenomenon. She had the distinct impression that she was rising, that her feet were leaving the ground... So, she clung to the door handle. At the same moment, the dog, which had not yet reacted, panicked and ran between her mistress's legs to take refuge in the house. At the animal's touch, Mme Jendreaux lowered her eyes and when she looked up again... there was nothing. The sky was empty. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - éd.

The merchant Liefooghe at 6 o'clock in the morning, on a route he takes every weekday, saw in a field, 100 m away: a rocket 30 to 50 m high. Upon his arrival it had tilted, emitted red-orange to white and disappeared into the sky at an incredible speed. Gendarmerie alerted and traces on the ground observed. (J.C. BOURRET: "La nouvelle vague des S.V." - France Empire 1975, p.78 to 82) ... the witness alerted the gendarmerie who, less than 3 hours later, was on the scene. They discovered, not only, clear traces left by the cigar, but also footprints of small feet measuring 17 cm long. (Erich ZUCHER: "Les apparitions d'humanoïdes" - ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 105) Around 7 o'clock, on a cloudy and foggy day, Mr. Liefooghe sees the shape of a DS Citroën car, with two yellow-orange headlights directed towards him. He finds it strange that a car is parked against the flow of traffic, but continues to move at a moderate speed. At 50 m from the parking spot of "the thing" he suddenly sees a craft leaving the side of the road and, having reached the middle of the road, performs a kind of turn. This "car" has no rear lights or reflectors. 400 m further on he sees an orange glow in front of him on the left. He then sees a large cigar-shaped object in a field 100 m away. No superstructure is visible. Quickly the luminosity of the cigar increases in intensity, it quickly tilts at about 20 degrees on its own axis. The luminosity is at this moment so strong that it partially blurs the previously sharp outlines. The surrounding fields are lit by a yellow-orange light and the witness sees it as if it were broad daylight. The illumination does not vary during the ascent of the object, but it suddenly stops after a few moments. Traces on the ground: traces of the craft and traces of small feet. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

Mrs. Vermeulen living in Uden, woke up one night, around 2:30, and got up to go to the bathroom. Through the small window of this place, she saw something white outside, but didn't pay it much attention. When leaving the small place, she saw through another window, three creatures about 1.2 meters tall, moving towards her house. They all wore a kind of monk's robe and had a kind of pointed headgear. They moved in single file. The one who closed the small row, a bit taller than the other two, suddenly looked in Mrs. Vermeulen's direction. Simultaneously the three little creatures turned around and disappeared from view. Mrs. Vermeulen was about to wake her husband, and in the bedroom, she saw through the other window, a large red ball suspended in the air about ten meters from the house. The diameter of this ball was around 5 meters. At the moment her husband woke up, everything disappeared, as if by magic. ((c) 1997 Jeroen Slurf and Jeroen Kümeling.)

It was exactly 8:20. They had left Chateaulun a little earlier and were in Saint-Nic, at the top of a slight height, when one of them saw an object in the sky, which caught his attention and aroused his curiosity. Gendarme Kaminski stopped the staff car at the request of his companion and both observed the strange "thing". "It was approximately in the axis of Cap de la Chèvre," explains Mr. Le Stunff. The color was orange, the shape elongated. As we said, it was 8:20. It was not very clear but the night had stopped. Due to its direction, it is obvious that this light could not be confused with that of the sun. The object was motionless and the light contrasted with the "cloud" behind it. We observed it for about five minutes. But during this period, it changed shape, in fact it looked like a kind of "condensation" of "smoke", I can not think of another word. At the start it had an elongated shape, then it took the shape of a dome (a mushroom cap) before coming to a standstill above the aircraft carrier "Foch" in the bay of Douarnenez. Then the whole seemed to burst before taking the shape of a circle. After that, the UFO changed shape again into a dome, but this time the condensation surrounded it at its base, before taking altitude and disappearing into the clouds. (..) "(Jean François BOEDEC: "Les OVNI en Bretagne, Anatomie d'un Phénomène", ed. Fernand Lanore 1978, pp. 90 to 92) At the place called "Coat Madiou" two gendarmes from the Telgrunc brigade, Le Strunff (the Stroumph, blue ???) and Kaminski, saw in the sky a strange object at 8:20 in the morning. It was in the shape of an orange half-sphere and was followed by a pale orange cloud. The phenomenon came to stabilize above a building of the navy in the bay of Douarnenez: the aircraft carrier Foch. Later the witnesses learned that the nuclear submarine "Redoutable" was on an immersion mission under the "Foch". The cloud came to stabilize under the object and the contours became clearer. Later, this kind of "mushroom" luminous burst or seemed to explode to take the shape of a pale orange sphere. Then it took its initial shape and its first colors, the contours became crazy, it rose slowly to disappear into the clouds.

BELGIUM, Warneton (Franco-Belgian border in the north)
The witness was driving his AMI 6 at 60/70 km/h from Comines to Warneton at around 8:40 PM. The car radio was working normally. There was a bright moonlight and the sky was clear. Suddenly the car headlights went out and almost simultaneously the engine stopped after a few stutters and the radio became silent. The car continued to roll for about a hundred meters, then its owner stopped it with the handbrake. He was about to get out of the car to see what was happening, his hand already on the door handle: he didn't have time to complete his gesture when he saw, on the right side, in the elevated field, what he took for a hay wagon 150 m away from him. But there were white and orange reflections on the object and he also noticed that it was standing on three legs. The whole object reminded him of a "Tommy" helmet. Through the windshield he then saw two silhouettes in the field, 30 m away from the car. They were walking towards him in a rigid and slow manner, stopped at 15 m and then resumed their progression. The first one, the smallest, looked like a Michelin man but with barely marked rings. He had a helmet on, the round helmet had a large window behind which one could see a face. He was holding a kind of short thick ruler in his right hand and pointing it towards the car. The second one was a bit taller (1.20 m to 1.30 m) and he was wearing an opaque cubic helmet, except for the front wall which was transparent and showed a strange face. The two faces were alike like those of twins: pear-shaped head, grayish complexion, two perfectly round eyes like agate beads, barely pronounced eyebrow arch. Small nose with little relief, the mouth a horizontal slit without lips. When one of them opened his mouth at one point, the witness saw neither teeth nor tongue. The costume was gray metallic matte. The shoes were big and pointed. Inside the helmets there was a soft light. Shortly after the beings had stopped very close to the ditch, the witness felt a slight shock at the back of the skull, at the height of the cerebellum: after this shock he heard (before he heard nothing, the windows being closed): a deep modulated sound, increasing in intensity. During all this time a third Michelin man stayed close to the craft in the field. The face-to-face was suddenly disturbed: suddenly the two beings turned their heads in a perfectly synchronized movement, the sound stopped, the beings turned around and quickly went back to the UFO. The tripod disappeared, the beings were inside the thing which rose 50 cm and after 3 or 4 seconds of immobility it rose horizontally and disappeared. In the rearview mirror the witness saw the white lights of a car approaching. Slumped in the seat the witness will see a Belgian motorist open the door for him and ask him: "Did they hurt you?" He had seen them too, he had engine stutters but not the headlights going out. After a few starter solicitations the witness's car was also able to leave.

John E. Justice, a night guard, having taken his car at the end of his shift, at three in the morning, was driving normally on the long park avenue, when suddenly his headlights dimmed and his engine stopped. In a few seconds Justice saw large lights descending and spreading out in the sky a short distance in front of his car. Then the rainbow of lights went out, and an oval-shaped light about two meters in diameter appeared. It was too bright for him to make out any shape of the fuselage. "The trees, the road, everything was lit up," said Justice. "And in my car I could have cut my nails, it was so bright." The object was getting closer. Soon it was only two meters in front of the car and slightly above. He could now see inside the oval object. It was a golden-colored room with 5 occupants seated on high chairs on the left side. They were motionless, in a row, wearing capes of the same color as the chairs. (...) their hair was so long that it covered part of their faces. They all looked alike.

FRANCE, Landivisiau (Saint Derrien? ) (Finistère nord)
On January 18th 1974, it was Mr. Jaffres, from the village "Bellevue" in Ladivisiau who observed a "glowing ball" at the height of the clouds. This object descended vertically and came to a stop above a meadow. Mr. Jaffres then decided to take his car and go to the scene "to be sure". To his surprise, upon arrival, the UFO had changed shape and presented itself as an immense vertical cylinder of metallic appearance, 6 meters high and 3 meters wide. Two rotors were visible above and below it: they emitted intermittent flashes of light. The witness, not very reassured by this presence, sent out several beacon calls: the craft then began to rise and fall! And it would do so with each call. Mr. Jaffres parked his vehicle near a slope, grabbed his... pistol and advanced towards the meadow... The UFO approached slowly... Mr. Jaffre then felt a tingling in his eyes... That was too much. Our man quickly returned to his home. The observation continued for 2 hours from the window of the first floor, in the company of two other witnesses, before the cylinder transformed again into a sphere before returning to the clouds... (Jean François BOEDEC: "Les OVNI en BRETAGNE, Anatomie d'un Phénomène", éd. Fernand Lanore 1978, p. 74 )
It was 10:30 pm, it was raining, Mr. and Mrs. Jaffrès and Mrs. brother were about to go to bed, when, through the window, a bright light caught their attention. It came from a ball two to three times as big as the full moon, under the cloud ceiling. The wind was blowing hard from west to east. This ball was descending at great speed vertically, slowing down greatly when it was no more than 200 or 300 m from the ground, moving above a field. The shape, then more distinct, was cylindrical, with the lower and upper ends formed of rings. It was about 300 m from the house. Mr. Jaffrès finally, after already 3/4 of an hour of observation, took the decision to go out in the car and go to the edge of the field. Despite the rainy weather, the whole area of the place called "Belle-Vue" was lit up. After 10 minutes, he had the idea of making beacon calls. At each "code-phare" passage, the object went up and down, giving the impression of a helicopter in difficulty. The witness then had the certainty that the extreme rings were turning on the cylinder, projecting sparks and sparks of the color of a continuous flash. The witness got out of the car. The object sometimes moved slowly, sometimes much more quickly. When it came back to the witness, he felt for the first time a discharge of heat very clearly and he heard a buzzing like that of a fan. The witness was not really afraid, but became nervous and when the object was 20 m from him, he felt tingles and his eyes were tingling. Caution: he had armed himself with a defense pistol before going to meet the UFO... Then, seeing the object rise and believing that it was leaving, the witness returned to the house. It was already twelve thirty. They continued to watch the evolutions of what they took for takeoff attempts. At 03:00 in the morning, the light dimmed and they saw the ball return to the clouds. The next day the witness went to the field to find any traces: he found grass lying in places and in some places there was a liquid substance that looked like fuel but was not. Unfortunately, he did not have the idea of collecting a little of this liquid for analysis. (Philippe SCHNEYDER: "Ovni, premier bilan" - éd. du Rocher 1983, p. 73, 74)

ENGLAND, Berwyn Mountains, Clwyd (Wales)
(Source: New 1999 book by veterinarian and ufologist Nick Redfern, U.K.) A UFO crashed in the isolated Clwyd valley and the bodies of two aliens were removed from the wreckage, writes this author. "Farmer Huw Lloyd, 39 in 1999, was then a 14-year-old boy watching television at his home in Llandrillo, very close to the crash site, that night in 1974. He says he saw a large object followed by a luminous trail and a flashing blue light. Huw remembers: 'It was amazing how quickly the police arrived and how many people came to see.' Among the arrivals, Redfern says, were units of the British army, and it was they who removed the body of the aliens. One of the soldiers, named 'James Prescott' (pseudonym) was sent from Llanderfel with four other soldiers, and loaded two long oblong boxes into their armored truck". The truck was taking the boxes to the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down, near Salisbury, in Wiltshire, with the strict order not to stop under any pretext or for anyone. "Mr Prescott is retired today and is too scared to allow the use of his real name. He says that once they arrived "the boxes were opened by senior officers in our presence. We were amazed to see two creatures in decontamination suits. It was obvious that they were not creatures of this world; upon examination they were found to be deceased. They measured 5 to 6 feet, had a humanoid shape, but in a way resembling skeletons covered with skin. Although I did not see the craft at the crash site, I was informed that a large craft had crashed and been found by other army units."

At 8:39 PM a violent explosion shook the villages (recorded in Edinburgh: 3.5 on the Richter scale). Above Mount Berwyn a large pulsating orange light and shortly afterwards blue and orange lights flew around the summit. Police stations were flooded with calls from people claiming to have seen a ball of light crash to the ground, followed by a huge explosion. One of the witnesses who called the police saw a military patrol on the way back ordering him to immediately leave the area. Local farmers were ordered not to leave their homes for a week. On the side of the hill, there was still this orange ball... (Sentinel News No. 6; July-August '97)

PORTUGAL, Sagres - Algarve
Witnesses were flying in a TAP Boeing 707 from Lisbon to Cape Verde and Las Palmas. Alerted by technician Francisco Duarte, captain Rodrigo Freitas saw at Freitas' coast, and facing their plane, at 80 miles, a formation of 5 lights. Two of these lights were spinning. The phenomenon was followed by a trail. The plane was flying at 900 km/h at 19000 feet. The lights were at 16000 feet above the plane. The pilot tried to find out if other planes were confirming this observation and learned that a South African plane had encountered the strange formation 40 minutes earlier. Knowing the position of the other plane, Mr. Freitas later calculated that the formation was flying at a speed of 36000 km/h and made a report to NASA.

Mrs. A., who lived alone in an isolated house in the middle of the woods, was watching television. Having heard a clanking noise at the entrance, and thinking it was stray dogs, she took her gun, only to scare them. She thus headed towards the door and turned on the outside light. Instead of a dog, she found herself face to face, two meters away, with a simian-looking, hairy creature two meters and twenty centimeters tall. The giant raised his hands above his head. Frightened, the woman shot, thinking he was going to throw himself at her. To her great surprise, he simply disappeared in a burst of light. (...) Her son-in-law, who lived with his wife and children in a trailer 300 meters away, had heard the gunshot. Immediately armed with a 6-shot revolver, he went to his mother-in-law's residence. Approaching, he saw at the edge of the woods "four or five furry shadows". It was a terrifying sight: simian-looking beings two meters tall, with long arms "with glowing eyes like embers". He fired two shots, then ran to his mother-in-law's house. Looking out the window, they both saw at a hundred and fifty meters from them a bright red light motionless above the woods. It looked like a Christmas tree ornament or the rotating beacon of a police car. Panicked, they called the police (note from vog: who came and found no trace..)

M. Laporte, a postman in Montcuq, left his farm at "Borde Haute" at 9:10 PM and saw an object flying from left to right, like a bus with 5 or 6 portholes on the side and two headlights in the front projecting two long beams of light to the right. The light from the portholes was bright and multicolored: yellow-blue-green. Rays of light were emanating from the portholes, directed obliquely towards the ground and illuminating the gorse and juniper that dotted the moor. The beams of light from the front were still visible. Suddenly the witness saw nothing. No sound. Altitude 200 to 300 m. Length of the object: 14 to 20 m. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

At around 11pm a fairly thick fog forced Jean-Michel Lartigaud and his wife Marie-Thérèse to drive at about 60 km/h. At Sauvagny the fog dissipated and visibility became perfect. "At the same moment, I felt a great cold that froze me from head to foot, followed by a shiver like I had never felt before. In front of me, to the right of the road and 3 to 4 m below, I saw an enormous luminous object, which seemed to be resting on the ground. Instinctively I slowed down, shaking my wife who was dozing. It looked like a cylinder 8m high and 3m in diameter at the top and slightly narrower at the base. I could not detect any solid structure. It was perfectly still. The top was made up of a kind of camembert box lid 3m in diameter and 1m thick. It emitted a dry light of extraordinary power, almost bluish white, but this light did not radiate. Under the lid a luminous cone evoked frosted glass. On the ground, the base was not clearly defined. Everything remained dark around this object whose sharp outlines contrasted sharply with the black of the night. "Go away, get away quickly," Marie-Thérèse ordered, feeling a sense of danger. Almost immediately the fog raised a cottony wall in front of the car headlights (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, pp. 201 to 203).

The creatures were about 150 cm tall and had normal human proportions, dressed in tight clothing. They remained standing, motionless as the object passed in front of his eyes at a distance of about thirty meters and at a speed of about 50 km/h.

Canada, camp 731 (80 km NE of Baie Comeau)
(source: "Le Bois Vert" No. 2 vol. 10, March-April 1974) "An extraordinary event is said to have occurred at 731 in the night of February 26th. It should be mentioned that on several occasions before this date, Koehring operators would have seen in the sky of 731, a strange object, like a very large star, of an even greater luminosity. After remaining motionless, this "thing" quickly disappeared from their view. But according to several employees of this camp, what happened during the night of February 26th, around 4 o'clock in the morning, is much more surprising! J.S.L., who told us this strange fact himself, was traveling in a truck with his work companion F.B. and the "thing" suddenly appeared to them at a distance so close that they were frightened and called for help to the camp by radio. According to these two eyewitnesses, the craft stopped nearby, and they stopped their truck. They could no longer use the radio because the interference made it unusable. For at least 20 minutes, this mysterious apparition remained there, motionless, at the height of the treetops. "It must have been at least 30 feet long," J.S.L. told us. A blinding light prevented them from distinguishing the shape of this unknown craft, but they saw a green light on top. As for the rest, it was rather oval in shape, very bright yellow and incandescent red in the center. To finish the story, a car with J.P.L. and P.G. on board left the camp in response to the call they had received. Unable to communicate with the occupants of the truck, they suspected that something not very nice was happening and accelerated. When they arrived at the scene of the "appearance", these last ones saw the object sparkling with all its lights, which immediately described a large circle and disappeared like a flash in the firmament. This account of Mr. S.L. is supported by at least five other employees who were witnesses of this apparition. (...) "(Jean THOMAS: "Synthèse Ovni", ed. Louise Couteau, 1999, p. 127, 128)

At 5:30 the witness left his home on a moped to go to work. He had just crossed the bridge over the Thon and was face to face with "two cosmonauts" and noticed at the same time that he was stopped.
The men were about 1.70m tall and wore dark suits. They had a cubic helmet on their head, with an opening in the face area, but in the darkness the witness could not make out anything. They wore gloves covering their arms up to the shoulders. He was astonished as he did not remember braking or stopping. On the left side of the road, in a meadow below at 35m, he could make out a large dark circular mass: there was no light or noise. The two figures, facing the witness, firmly held the handlebars of the moped. The witness was scared, especially as their gestures seemed to urge him to eat something. The witness was panicked. One of the beings made a sign to his companion who started rummaging in a kind of bag he was carrying on his back: he took out a small piece of substance (1 cm²) which he presented to the witness, urging him to eat it. He ate it. It was brown, like chocolate, soft in consistency, without taste. As soon as he had swallowed the material, the figures stepped aside and the witness was able to leave.

At 10:17 PM, the witness was watching television when he saw through the window a large row of circular portholes topped at the front by another row of teardrop-shaped portholes, suggesting the curve of a more or less curved surface. The portholes seemed to go all the way around the craft, but this change in shape happened suddenly, all at once. They emitted a fixed light exactly like that of a sodium vapor trail. The witness went outside and heard an unusual sound like the amplitude and frequency modulation of an electric motor whose speed was suddenly changed.

The main body was oval-shaped and not shiny. The seven small flying objects in the shape of a sphere, emitted a yellow-white, transparent and dazzling light. They were on the same plane, around the main object and at an equal distance from it. Their light illuminated the main body well. They flew together, at the same speed, without any noise. (...)

At 9 pm, Mr. Pasquier and his wife were occupied watching television at a neighbor's house, Mrs. Lalande. Suddenly their gaze was drawn to the kitchen window by an extraordinary blue light, turning green, yellow, then red. Intrigued, they rushed outside and thus saw a strange "composite" object. It was formed of two balls connected by a kind of blue neon tube. The first ball, orange in color, was bigger than the following green one. The object ended with a kind of shadow sprinkled with small colored dots. The craft moved silently at a constant speed (approx. 80 km/h) at a relative altitude of 25 to 100 meters and at a distance of about 150 meters from the witnesses. The length of the object was estimated at 2 or 3 meters. The observation ended with the disappearance of the object behind buildings.

Early in the morning, this woman, not disposed to believe in UFOs, saw a pulsing red light at the height of the treetops, from which two beams emerged that crossed her car from side to side, immobilizing the engine and producing interference on the on-board radio. Shortly after, she received a telepathic message, telling her to go on a certain road, which she did. Again her engine stalled and the radio emitted strange noises. But this time she saw four small humanoids, quickly coming towards her, each in a small vehicle resembling a garden tiller, but moving quickly just above the ground. One of the entities approached the car and telepathically asked her to open the door. But when she opened one of the doors, all four opened wide at the same time. The entity examined the woman's neck, applying a small device that left five puncture marks. She was told that thousands of their vessels had already visited the Earth for years. Nearby was their mothership, while their planet of origin was called "Omnius" or "Omnigus." They added that they had examined thousands of people, but not all had done so voluntarily. She was not to touch the entities to prevent any contamination. She was also told that she might have terrible headaches for several weeks after the contact. The entities measured between 1m20 and 1m40, and wore helmets that masked their features. However, small eyes could be seen shining. They wore uniforms and a belt with a symbol made of wavy vertical lines. (Don ELKINS with Carla RUECKERT, CASE NUMBER 12, Investigator: John Giambrone, MUFON field investigator)

He then saw a second saucer that remained stationary in flight like a helicopter, above and to the right of the first. Two creatures of human appearance wearing shiny suits were making gestures (...) and seeing Sanchez's truck, they got back into the saucer which rose about ten meters, placing itself next to the other craft at the same height. Seeing that the road was clear and his headlights were on, Sanchez tried to start the engine which turned on the first try.

To the right of this ball, a series of 4 to 6 rectangles of a violent white light illuminated. With the binoculars, Mr. Cosme observed a luminous ball which projected from its base a triangular luminous beam, base coming from under the ball, point oriented towards the witnesses. Mr. Cosme observed with the binoculars two luminous silhouettes, stiff, seeming formed of two blocks and disproportionate: elongated head, too small for enormously wide shoulders. One of the silhouettes was behind the triangular beam projected by the white ball, the other slid on the beam towards the point and disappeared into the night. The one that remained near the sphere had on the left a kind of satchel, it gradually diminished as if it was collapsing and completely disappeared. The beam then went out and then the ball. They left and after 10 minutes observed through the back window, a white-yellowish luminous ball at the height of the trees which followed the car and according to the sinuosities was seen sometimes on the right, sometimes on the left. It approached very quickly taking 6 to 10 times its volume and a yellow-green color. The UFO hunters chased found the road to Beauvais and quickly returned to their home. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

For a few seconds I was able to see three shadows moving inside. Then this part went out too. At this moment a powerful spotlight came on and began to sweep the horizon in complete rotations, sometimes stopping in one direction. We heard a faint humming like that of an engine at idle. At one point the spotlight stopped in our direction. We were scared and left without waiting any longer." When she arrived home Anne woke up her parents so they could watch the show, perfectly visible from the house. The spotlight illuminates a house located about 2 km away. After observing it for an hour, the witnesses go to bed. Anne has pain in her eyes and can't fall asleep.

At 6:15 Claude Tardy was riding his motorcycle towards Bourg les Valence. It was drizzling. Between the first and second tunnel of the "Petits Goulets" he saw to his right, on the other side of a cliff where the Vernaison river flowed, a white ball with two feet that slanted outwards. This ball seemed to be against the rocky wall or in a station nearby.
Note: there is a geological fault at the location and a cave called "La grotte du Diable" which the witness was totally unaware of. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 485)

Around midnight the witness was swimming alone near the beach. Suddenly he saw a disc-shaped object approaching parallel to the ocean and descending vertically to the ground. The craft had a diameter of 15 to 18 m, was biconvex in shape, and on each face a circular edge occupied the center. It was equipped with several lights, and was resting on four feet ending in a kind of tuft. It emitted a buzzing sound and gave off heat. After a few minutes a hatch lowered on the underside as if it were pivoting around a hinge. An electric motor noise then dominated the buzzing. Through the slope created by the opening, an occupant emerged: "humidity emanated from the occupant" at the time of his exit and extended up to 70 or 80 m. He was at least 1.8 m tall, and a garment covered his entire body, including his head. The garment was voluminous, tubes coming from the back of the maxillae joined behind the neck and descended along the back. He only took a few steps on the beach before re-entering the craft, whose door closed and then took off in the direction from which it had come. The witness could not specify whether his observation lasted 20 or 60 minutes. After the departure, the witness examined the landing site with a flashlight: in the hollow of the feet there was a pink paste, in which there was a thick liquid. At dawn the tide had leveled it all out. (Inforespace n° 22 - p. 16 and 17)

This witness had already observed several UFOs in the past. One night, he was woken up in his caravan by a buzzing and pulsating lights. He tried to call his family, but had no voice and felt paralyzed. He saw four toothed lights, red, orange, yellow and blue-green. The next morning he woke up two hours later than usual, with bloodshot eyes and feeling pain all over his body. He had the feeling of having been inside a UFO, but his memory refused to restore the details. Later, under hypnosis, he remembered better, and spoke of a row of gyroscopes along a partition. The toothed lights dynamized them to form an artificial gravity field. He had seen eight men of normal appearance. Seven of them were dressed in brown metallic fabric uniforms, the eighth wore a light blue work outfit. He saw on a screen a close-up view of the planet Saturn, there was a control panel and three reclining chairs. The entities examined his eyes with a magnifying glass, telling him to expect other contacts.

(see January 7, 1974 in Warneton) Five months later, second contact, but quite particular, in the same place, same witness, same time, same circumstances. The witness had just resumed his evening classes for improvement the day before for the first time since a work accident in February. The witness sees the two beings posted at the side of the road (apparently the same ones) like two hitchhikers. There are engine misfires but since it is still daylight, there is nothing to say about the headlights. The radio is silent. The witness stops at the height of these two creatures who are then so close that they could touch the bodywork. He does not move from his vehicle: emotion and prudence. Again a small shock behind the head and a modulated sound for 2 or 3 minutes, which stops: the two beings disappearing abruptly as if disintegrated, without any noise or other reaction. After this instantaneous disappearance the radio works again, the engine starts without difficulty. Shortly before this second encounter, the witness had been overtaken by a Ford car registered in Belgium which, however, was not affected and the driver would not have seen the ufonauts.

Mountaineer Keo Wha Unan was inspecting a rock formation in the upper part of Mount Dahjar. At one point, emerging from a kind of rocky cave, he saw above a ridge a silver disc, unlit and quite smooth in appearance, hovering 1.30 meters from the rock. Three humanoid creatures jumped out and began to collect samples of snow and rock. After five minutes, they had finished and climbed back up a kind of sliding ladder that had come out of the base of the UFO. Once everything was inside, the humanoids and the ladder, he heard a buzzing sound, the machine rose a few meters vertically, and then, like lightning, the object disappeared into the clouds.

At midnight the sentry woke up the soldiers of base 103 to show them an unknown object. In the sky they saw a strange cylinder (like a cigarette at arm's length) and silent. Through binoculars the military observed three triangular shapes under the object. They slowly rotated changing color, along the cylinder ran waves like hot air. The object was stationary for 10 minutes towards the north at 20° angular height. It then came above the witnesses but its dimensions were decreasing. It suddenly stopped while another luminous object coming from the west approached and circled it 5 or 6 times. The two objects left together towards the northeast.

… It was made by a clergyman from Fouesnant, while he was driving alone in the direction of Beg-Meil (Finistère). For two minutes, he was able to notice the presence in the sky of a black matte spherical object. It was about 6 pm. This flying object, whose size was compared to that of a football, was moving at 300 meters of altitude on a trajectory oriented southwest/west. It appeared as a solid volume and, curiously, dragged in its wake a triangular "luminous cloud" of orange color of about 200 meters in length. The UFO, which did not emit the slightest noise, veered towards the sea. The witness then rushed into a cafe to alert the customers: when they arrived, the craft had unfortunately disappeared.

Three young girls returning home saw a bright object land in the countryside. Almost immediately a yellow beam was directed towards the sky. Other witnesses observed the phenomenon. One of them, accompanied by his mother and sister, drove to the landing site. They discovered in a harvested field a half-sphere of intense red color, 8 meters wide, 4 meters high and whose base seemed to be enveloped in luminous mist. Frightened, they turned around and alerted the firefighters. When they arrived 20 minutes later, the craft had disappeared, the straw and thatch at the craft's location was charred.

As I was walking along a vegetable garden I suddenly noticed a completely black man standing in front of me; at 8 or 9 m. He seemed robust and tall (1 m 80). As it was very dark I couldn't make out the details of his face. This black man stood out well in the night as his whole body was slightly glowing. I thought he was a peasant come to check the irrigation system. I shouted to him: "Who goes there? Come quickly to plug the ditch!" The glowing black man didn't move or answer my call. So I joked: "If you don't come, I'm going to hit you on the head!" Immediately the man started glowing brighter, and suddenly he hid himself in the tall grass of about one meter. I rushed into the grass to find him, but in vain. And after a few minutes I gave up. Then I got scared and ran away. (...) yet, two days later, in the same place, the head of our production brigade and the head of our team encountered a slightly glowing black man. The same man may have been. (...)

CANADA, Port Coquitlam
(source: Graham Conway, Aufora) At around 8pm, three boys, David Bates (8 years old), Steven and Henry Stillie (10 and 7 years old) were taking their usual shortcut through a wooded area, on a path that would lead them back to the street where they lived. Halfway through the path, they heard a sharp whistling sound, so much so that the kitten that David was carrying in his arms was desperately trying to escape, scratching and clawing, and David had to let it go. The kitten ran off like a mad thing, then fell on its side "asleep", said David. The other two boys said the kitten was "playing dead". Looking in the direction of the shrill noise, the children saw an object above the trees, going from south to north, above the railway bridge over the river. It had a red light on top and flashing green and white lights at each end. The shrillness was so unbearable, especially for David, that he covered his ears with his hands, though David doesn't remember this. The UFO then began to descend, and the noise became very faint in no time. The kitten regained its senses and came back to David, who took it back in his arms. To their great surprise, less than 50m away from them, the object touched the ground sending a very hot and violent gust of air, which made the boys enveloped in a cloud of dust. Before touching the ground, the object extended its feet and then something inside the craft made the earth and stones fly around. Here the testimonies differ. The Stillie brothers had seen enough and sprinted 100m to get back home, at Olympic speed, they say. David Bates, either braver or more stoic, stayed long enough to observe a door on the craft, without portholes and square on top. This is confirmed by the other two boys. There was like a chain around the object and at that moment, David started running towards his home too. His parents confirm he came back in a state of hysteria, eyes wide. Meanwhile, the sister of the Stillie brothers explains that when they came in, the boys closed all the doors and shutters before hiding under the sheets in their bed. There were still visible traces of the landing the next day.

Miss Moret went to the fairground attractions and was supposed to be back at 8:30 pm. The parents were worried. Mr. Moret went out in front of his house at 8:55 pm to see if his daughter was on her way back. At 9 pm, suddenly, he distinguished in the sky an object that was descending very slowly, it was round, black in color, with a slight white halo, standing out against the grey background of the sky, at about 200 m of distance. He ran to get his wife so that they wouldn't be the only witnesses as the street was deserted. Mrs. Moret also saw the thing which, after 15 minutes, stabilized at about 20 m from the ground. Then this ball opened up in the vertical direction, by a slow spreading, forming two black half-moons with a peripheral luminosity. The one on the left stayed in place without changing, the one on the right moved away, shrinking until it disappeared in the nightfall. Then, towards the flat side of the remaining crescent, a kind of veil was pulled slowly, as if one was sliding a single black curtain. On the new background, still black, two "cosmonauts" dressed from head to toe in metallic grey were gradually discernible. Their arms and legs were seen moving, but their heads seemed to be encased in a kind of bulky helmet. They moved by waddling like puppets, crossing from one side to the other. The scene lasted about 40 minutes. Then, all of a sudden, the parents remembered that their daughter still hadn't come back, it was 10 pm. The UFO occupants' show continued, but Mrs. M. went back inside to set the table and Mr. Moret left on his bicycle towards the fairground. When he came back with the young girl, he didn't even look at the thing in the sky, if it was still there. (Pierre VIEROUDY: "Ces OVNI qui annoncent le surhomme" - Laffont 1979, p. 66 à 68)

Patricia Riega was taking the air, sitting in the courtyard, her parents being in the house. At exactly 8:55 pm she heard for 1 minute 30 a jet engine noise. Very quickly distinct sharp whistles were heard, suggesting a rapid rotation. She looked up at the sky, and she only saw stars (note from vog: at 8:55 pm in August, with a clear sky, you can already see stars at summer time valid in Belgium? Really amazing!). The noise increased to the point of piercing her ears and suddenly, as if coming out of a small cloud, an object appeared, comparable in size to a Boeing, a saucer surrounded by a round red-orange halo radiating strongly. The craft seemed to be rotating rapidly, it moved away obliquely on a SSE-NNO trajectory as if on an air cushion. The mother heard at the end of the observation for a few seconds the noise that was fading away. The witness remained shocked by what she saw, trembling all over and was unable to sleep all night (Inforespace n° 24, December 1975, pp.29-31).

Around ten o'clock... Edwin Fuhr began to harvest his rape in a field located about 500 m from the house. (...) He had been harvesting for nearly an hour and was near a bog (...) When he looked up (...) he saw a metal dome about fifteen meters away from him, apparently resting on a grassy area between the rape and a ravine. He stopped his harvester, got down and approached the object to within about five meters. When he got closer to the metal dome he noticed that the grass was moving at the base and that the object itself was rotating very quickly. Fuhr was naturally very scared and he backed away, without taking his eyes off the object, until he reached the harvester whose engine was still running. He circled it, climbed onto the seat and looked at the rotating dome from this higher observation point. He then saw four other metal domes, all the same size, all rotating (...) He heard no noise, perhaps because of the harvester's engine. After several minutes, it seemed to him, the objects suddenly rose into the air in a staggered formation, at a height of about 60 meters. They stopped and a puff of dark gray vapor escaped from pipes similar to exhaust pipes at the base of each object, accompanied by a downward gust of wind that almost blew Fuhr's hat off and flattened the rape. The objects were now in perfect straight formation. After remaining stationary for one or two minutes, they suddenly rose into the low clouds and disappeared. (J.

The first witness, Younic Le Bihan, was a sergeant in the army and 21 years old. Around 00:50 he had just returned to his home, near the Carrefour de la Villeneuve, while a violent storm was breaking out. Arriving in the living room he saw a fleeting orange light. Reaching his bedroom on the upper floor he noticed a red halo, like that of a fire. He then saw 500 or 600 m to the southeast a blaze the size of a house. He took out his binoculars and saw three rectangles of bright red color topped with folding shutters. Simultaneously he saw three luminous masses of phosphorescent white pass beneath these hatches. He clearly distinguished the contours of the object: a horizontal base topped with a truncated cone-shaped cabin, in which the red rectangles were still visible. In front of the object he saw three silhouettes the size and aspect of human beings, of phosphorescent white. They moved in his direction. The witness then alerted his parents, Francis Le Bihan and Yvonne Sallin, who observed with the naked eye and binoculars. The object suddenly had a slight lateral jolt and disappeared, while the three figures remained on the ground. Simultaneously there was a yellow light to the south, like a flash. Frightened, the parents left the house to take refuge with friends 300 m away. (J.C. BOURRET: "Le nouveau défi des OVNI" - France Empire 1976, pp. 84-98) »

At around 8pm Collette P., 49 years old, was tending to her rabbits and crossing the courtyard to get some water. In front of her, to the right of a walnut tree at the back of the courtyard, she saw a stationary, silent, luminous phenomenon that did not light up the surroundings: three concentric circles, the largest of which had a diameter of approximately 4m. The whole was surrounded by a white, oval-shaped halo 15m long. These circles at a low altitude gave the impression of being horizontal, but seen from below they were comparable to neon tubes. The whole thing slid behind the walnut tree and disappeared behind the ridge of the barn. Collette wanted to follow the phenomenon, but feeling an uncomfortable sensation, she did not dare to go alone. She called her sister Lucette, 54 years old, who was in the hangar. In the meantime, the phenomenon had become entirely oval and luminous, moved towards the road and then returned to the farm. Lucette made calls with the electric torch but nothing happened. To avoid being disturbed by the lights of the courtyard, Lucette went behind the hangar and continued her calls. Then the thing moved behind her towards the hangar. Collette ran to get her brother Dominique (53 years old) from the stables, while Lucette advanced along a path towards the cemetery. Her sister and brother joined her but no longer saw the phenomenon, which had just disappeared behind a roof. All three of them saw it reappear, it stopped again above the path in the form of concentric circles but this time with the colors of the rainbow. Then it changed shape, taking the form of three luminous points arranged in a triangle with the point upwards. This was followed by a mysterious ballet from left to right over a width of a hundred meters. Then the phenomenon changed back into concentric circles of different colors and quickly disappeared in the alignment of the path to the NE. The witnesses' mother had glimpsed the phenomenon from her armchair through the dining room window. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 524, 525)

They were observed by three members of the crew who were on duty between three and four in the morning, as the boat was coming from the Isle of St Kildo and heading towards the Isle of Barra. Manon, a sailor, recounts the event as follows: "I was on the bridge with Michel Kerivel, the chief mechanic, and José Morel, a sailor like me. In the south-east we observed on the horizon for about ten minutes, a round, oval shape, glowing with an orange color. This light moved from right to left. What's more, we were able to pick up on the ship's radar screen the echo of this strange thing. Its point was as big as the Isle of Barra itself. And it varied at an angle of 25 to 30 degrees in less than a second, at an extraordinary speed". (...) The next day this unusual presence was confirmed by the captain of a trawler from Concarneau, the "Kerscadec". (Jean François BOEDEC, "Les OVNI en Bretagne, anatomie d'un phénomène", ed.

This curious noise makes her think of the sound that would be produced by water thrown on a red stove round, except that it is deeper and very loud. (note of vog: like the one made by close lightning?) She puts on a garment and hurries outside, believing that an airplane has crashed and fearing for the safety of the children playing outside. (...) She watches with astonishment a strange machine (which she compares to a Mexican hat) floating above the old barn, located 15 to 20 m from where she is. She estimates the diameter of the object to be about 20 m. Not yet recovered from her surprise, she sees through the translucent upper part of the object, beings of human appearance, of an indescribable beauty. They seem to be dressed in a blue suit, fitted like a ski suit! They have long golden hair (...) and their faces express tenderness and compassion in a striking way. (...) Recovered from her amazement, the witness's attention is diverted by the presence of her children, to whom she hastens to ask if they too see this strange vehicle. "Yes mom" they all agree in chorus. Then, looking up, the witnesses realize that the object is no longer there. (...) The object moved a little further away to come back and make three circles above the witnesses.

Carl Higdon, a mechanic in an oil field, 40 years old, athletic, passionate about hunting, parks his truck under cover and walks into the forest to hunt elk. He finds the forest strangely silent. Suddenly he sees an elk, aims and shoots: the detonation is muffled, the bullet flies in front of him in slow motion and falls to the ground a few meters away, as if crushed. The hunter picks it up and puts it in his pocket, when he hears a crack of a branch. He sees a creature of human appearance, very tall, yellow skin, straw-colored bristly hair, dressed in a black suit, under a birch tree 15 m away from him. "How are you?" asks the stranger. "Very well" answers the witness. "Are you hungry?" asks the creature. "Yes, a little" says Higdon who immediately finds a box with 5 pills in his hand. He must swallow one "which will feed him for 4 days" and he obeys. The stranger invites him to follow him and the witness agrees. In the clearing he sees a transparent cubic structure surrounded by a luminous halo. Then he sees himself walking with the gun in his hand on an unknown path and he falls by chance on a stuck vehicle, but with the CB on board. He makes a distress call and waits. He did not even recognize his own truck, stuck 8 km from where he had parked it. He was found at 11:15 pm, did not recognize his wife, his body was covered with bruises and he only repeated a story of a man in black and pills. He finds the crushed bullet in his pocket. He is taken to the hospital where nothing serious is detected. It is only the next day that the memories come back to him: Higdon floats towards the cubic structure, finds himself inside in the company of 5 other characters dressed in black. From the outside the structure seemed transparent: here it is opaque and much more voluminous than it seemed. He is seated in a chair and there is a vertical acceleration, up to the planet of the entities. He can not get out of the vehicle but sees a giant tower at the top of which turn unbearable lights. He also sees some "humans" (Earthlings). Then he is told "We are bringing you back because you are not suitable for what we are looking for". This is the return journey and the brutal expulsion through a hatch. Higdon falls from 2 or 3 meters and slides down a scree. (Bertrand MEHEUST: "In Flying Saucers" - Imago 1992 - pp. 34 to 36)

He stopped a few meters away from the craft. It was a kind of transparent bell-shaped vehicle. There was a curious figure inside, illuminated by a diffuse light source. The upper body was visible. The occupant had their hands raised (...) Their straight hair (3 cm) stuck out from either side of their head like a rag doll's. Their body was covered in natural fur of a ginger brown color. (...) Their ears, straight like a calf's, were no less than 8 cm. The being was thin and their height seemed to not exceed 180 cm. Due to the fog, Bosak could not see if the craft was on the ground or floating. (vog: but he saw all the details reported above?) He could not make out the lower body of the occupant either. (...) Their face was hairless, Bosak was 2 m away from the craft and the creature was looking at Bosak.

Looking outside, she clearly saw an oval-shaped object "somewhat boat-like" hovering just above her neighbor's house, about 125 meters away. The object was large. Green and white lights lined its perimeter. On one side were three small square windows through which shone white lights. The object remained in view for a quarter of an hour, rising and falling slowly in the sky. The sky was clear when Mrs. Page saw the object move slowly in a straight line towards the church which was on the side, a block away. Then it positioned itself above the center of the church and resumed its vertical up and down movement. "It stayed above the church for maybe half an hour," Mrs. Page would say. That's when she saw two dark silhouettes above the windows of the craft in what seemed to her to be a transparent dome. She opened the kitchen door to get a better view. It was cold and she didn't stay, but while the door was open, she hadn't heard any noise. Finally, the UFO moved in a straight line, leaving the church towards the north, and suddenly gained tremendous speed. "The silhouettes I saw in the craft were those of two small men. I could see them up to their waists. Their arms were constantly in motion. They went back and forth from one end of the craft to the other and seemed to meet in the middle," she said.

SALIOUT 4 space station was put into orbit, while SALIOUT 3 was still orbiting. After being gradually raised to its final altitude of 350 km, SALIOUT 4 was visited by the cosmonauts of SOYOUZ 17, who spent 4 weeks on board the following month. Two other cosmonauts followed them in May 1975 for a two-month stay. After their return, the station remained unoccupied, before being precipitated into the atmosphere in February 1977 after having completed 12,000 orbits around the Earth.

At 8:15 PM, the 14-year-old witness was in the backyard with two family members when they heard a loud noise and all the lights went out at once. He ran outside and saw an object in the shape of Saturn, 6.50 m in diameter and 4 to 4.50 m high, radiating beams of light of all colors. The upper part was transparent and the witness saw 4 or 5 entities, dressed in dark frogman suits, about 1.80 m tall and humanoid in appearance. During this observation, the witness was unable to move and lost track of time. He regained his senses as the electricity returned and the object left.

A young shepherd went to pick mushrooms. He traveled in all directions in a mountainous region. Around 5 pm he saw, at 500 m, a strange cylindrical object. The witness estimated that it had a length of 100 m and that it was moving at 150 m above the ground. Its color was a bluish green. The object seemed to slow down, then stopped in a vertical position above a road. At the top of its middle part, the object emitted a powerful orange-colored light beam that rotated and blinked like a police beacon. It clearly emitted a whistle composed of a long sound and three or four short sounds. Shortly afterwards, a hatch opened under its middle part and three luminous balls of blue, red and grayish white color fell first in a free fall, but soon changed into an ascending and slow flight. When the three balls disappeared from his view in the distance, the witness was astonished to find that in the meantime the carrier vessel had also disappeared. (A. SCHNEIDER-H.
