SWITZERLAND, Emmishofen
Pyrotechnician Karl Muller developed paragrêle rockets. They rose to altitudes of 1000 to 1500 meters and exploded there. In the 1950s, in Switzerland, such rockets were still fired into the clouds when hail threatened. The resulting atmospheric currents caused the hail to transform into snow. Under the effect of a second or third rocket, the snowflakes changed into raindrops. Muller's rockets had a length of 25 to 50 cm, a diameter of 3 to 4 cm and were propelled by ordinary black powder. (...) Each rocket had an effective area of about 1 km². ("The Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K. Kaiser, ed. Amiot-Dumont 1954, pp. 19 and 20)

#July 2, 1900
Switzerland, Lake Constance
Launch of the Airship "L.Z. 1", the first airship of a long series.
Built by Count Zeppelin or under his name by the "Zeppelin Company". This "L.Z. 1" flew over the Lake of Constance. Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, a former general, will build other airships which, between 1910 and 1914, will provide regular flights in Central Europe. During the 1914-18 war, more than 100 Zeppelins will be built by the Navy, numbered L.Z = Luftschiff Zeppelin.
The balloons are contained in an aluminum structure covered with canvas, they have a Maybach water-cooled inline engine, between January 1915 and August 1919 the Zeppelins will carry out 51 bombing raids on England killing 557 people and injuring 1358 others.

The two sons of Mauro Pansini, an architect, experienced several astounding experiences.
One day when they were in Ruvo around 9 o'clock in the morning, they were found at 9:30 in the morning at the Capuchin convent of Malfatti, 50 km away. Another time they were transported from Ruvo to Trani in the house of a relative, where they were found in a deep hypnotic state. Another day they realized they were falling into a boat moored in the port, where the owner was already present. (Jean SIDER: "Ovni, the unmasked invaders" - ed. Ramuel 1999, p 161)

AFRICA, at sea, Gulf of Guinea.
In the middle of the night, at 03:05, while the ship "Fort Salisbury" was in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean (05°31' south latitude, 04°42' west longitude), the second officer Raymer observed, together with another officer and two other people, an immense object sinking into the ocean. This clearly solid body was estimated to be nearly 180 m long and 30 m wide. Shortly after, the witnesses saw this object moving underwater, with a machinery noise. Two orange lights were lit at the front and two other blue-green lights shone at the other end. After the ship passed over this underwater phenomenon, nothing else was observed.

#1904
ROMANIA, Transylvania
For a long time after midnight a farmer was still in his fields with his wagon and it is confirmed that he was not asleep. Suddenly he saw a wheel of fire in front of the Apusendi Mountains descending towards the ground. The wheel approached quickly, spinning around the farmer who remained standing in place without any help. When it was very close to him, it transformed, taking a human form: a creature that examined the peasant for a long time without saying a word.

ATLANTIC OCEAN
The report was published by the American "Weather Review". In the March 1904 issue, page 115, there is an account of a curious observation made at sea. On February 24, 1904, a mysterious light was seen above the Atlantic by sailors on the American ship "Supply". It moved quickly and evidently at a high altitude. The report was signed by Lieutenant Frank H. Schofiels of the United States Navy. (Donald KEYHOE: "Les Soucoupes volantes existent" ed. Corrêa Paris 1951, p. 82) Report drawn from the observations of three members of its crew by Lieutenant Frank M. Schofield, of the American ship "Supply" (Weather Review, March 1904- 115): Three luminous objects, of different sizes, the largest having a diameter of 6 suns, appeared at low altitude below the clouds of an estimated height of 2 km. They fled or turned around, rising in one movement from the clouds from which they had come. But this unity of movement does not change their difference in size and their different susceptibilities to the forces of the earth and air. (Charles Fort: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 236) At 6:10 local time, on board the USS "Supply", Frank Schofield, future admiral commanding the American Pacific Fleet (in 1930) observes meteors flying in formation. The largest, egg-shaped, passes under the clouds. At this moment its apparent diameter is equal to that of 6 suns. (Jean-Gabriel GRESLE: OVNI, a pilot speaks "ed. Guy Trédaniel, 1993, p.27)

After sunset, two men, Wirt Covert and Arthur Eldert, observed a large dark flying object moving from east to west at low altitude. Each described it as a boat with a flat top and with a mast or something else standing on top. A bright light emanated from windows on the sides of the craft. The object passed between the tower of a church and a row of small hills, rising just enough to avoid collision, before flying away.

Engineer A. Maul developed at great expense a photographic rocket.
It rose vertically up to 500 meters and carried a photographic apparatus which then descended to the ground using a parachute.
The version that had the most success was built in Austria:
The entire apparatus weighed 40 kilograms, the camera weighed 1 kilogram.
The altitude reached was 1000 meters. A 6 m long rod was used for flight stabilization. ("Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K. Kaiser, ed. Amiot-Dumont 1954, p. 21)

#August 2, 1905
USA, Silsbee (California)
Very early (1:30 am) J. A. Jackson, a well-known citizen of Silsbee, saw a bright light in the sky just above him. As the light drew closer, it revealed itself to be an aerial vessel about 20 m long, with a searchlight at the front and several other lights on board. The mysterious machine seemed to be driven by wings that beat like those of a giant bird. Apparently there was no balloon as is usually the case with dirigibles. Jackson, who was near Wilsie's house, went to wake him up and he was still able to see the lights just before they disappeared. The same night, H. E. Abott, postmaster of Imperial, was abruptly awakened from his sleep by the appearance of a bright light. It looked like a fire in the sky. It was then 1:30 am and one can think that this blinding light was probably the beam of the aerial vessel's searchlight. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p.200)

An unknown craft passed through the sky of Dresden at the speed of a modern jet from the 1990s. The object made no noise and flew in a straight line at an altitude of barely 40 feet.

USA, Cambridge (Massachusetts)
Walter Landry was three years old and had just lost his mother. He was told she had gone away and would come back one day. On the day of the funeral, a nurse was looking after the child when she heard him screaming from downstairs. She rushed down and pointing, he said: "There's Mommy!" Later he explained that she had tried to take him in her arms. Question: why was this child so scared when he saw his mother, when no one had ever talked to him about ghosts or spirits? (Jane and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World", Guild Publishing London, 1989, p. 79)

#1906
FRANCE, La Celle-sous-Gouzon
The witness, Jules B., was 18 years old at the time. He was interviewed by Ian d'Aigure, an investigator for the Lumières dans la Nuit (LDLN #129, Nov. 1973, p.24 ref.182) and passed away in January 1977. "I was 18 years old at the time, it was late in the season and I was an apprentice carpenter in Gouzon. I had just put a window in a property in La Celle and I was returning. I was hurrying because I had stayed a long time talking with the farm girl.. You know what that's like. It was pitch black but the weather was clear. (...)" So it could have been 10 pm and he was hurrying with a light heart. Suddenly, as he reached the junction of the path leading to the Manaly estate, what was his surprise, his stupor even, to discover a curious assembly of characters. There were 10 or 12 of them, sitting in a circle on the path. The witness passed 10 m away from them. They all looked at him pass in silence, and those who had their backs to him turned around when he passed. They were there, sitting, without saying a word, without talking to each other, otherwise the witness would have heard them in the silence of the night. It was this silence that "frightened" Jules B., who hastened to continue on his way without looking back. "You understand, he said, if they had been normal people, they would have said good evening, nodded or waved to me... But there, nothing. Ah! I can assure you I didn't feel proud." The observation was therefore brief, about ten seconds. The witness could not detail the individuals, but he is certain of the following points: they were all men. They were neither too young nor too old. They all seemed to be dressed the same way, in a kind of gray uniform, neither too light nor too dark. Near them there was no source of light, no fire, no object (bag, package) and no vehicle. However, the witness had the impression that the characters were sitting in a circle, on or around some kind of large cloth (or tablecloth) laid on the ground. Apart from this curious impression felt by the witness in front of these curious noctambules, nothing seemed to prove their "extraterrestrial" origin. This was pointed out to him. Jules B. interrupted us by saying:<br/><br/>
- "Yes, but then I saw the other one flying!"
Not at all calm, the witness was therefore walking away at a pace close to running. He had barely gone a hundred meters when suddenly he saw a "Martian flying" emerge at the level of the trees. The being was flying fast and it almost passed right over his head. He had his body stretched horizontally and his head raised forward ("Straight ahead as if to see where he was going"). His legs were stretched and joined. His arms were not visible but the being had like two immobile wings like spread arms (in terms of their size). The being passed quickly and silently, it was just that the witness heard a slight rustling of air.
- "And the funniest thing," concluded Jules B., "is that this 'Martian flying' flew straight to the place where I had seen the others. That's what makes me say they must have all had some kind of rendezvous. But hey! I didn't try to find out more.. I didn't hang around..."
(...) He often took the same path (later) but he never saw anything there again... (next: 1930, Toulx Ste Croix) (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 200 to 202)

(around 2 pm) ... a strange explosion occurred in the sky near Burlington. Some witnesses spoke of a torpedo-shaped craft, which was spinning at altitude. Shortly after this observation, a round and luminous object fell from the sky and exploded (Weather Review 1907, page 310). (Donald KEYHOE: "Les Soucoupes volantes existent" ed. Corrêa Paris 1951, p. 82) Bishop John S. Michaud saw a strange luminous torpedo-shaped craft. "I was standing at the corner of Church and College streets, facing the Howard Bank and looking eastward, engaged in conversation with ex-Governor Woodbury and Mr. A.A. Bluell, when, without the slightest warning, we were startled by what seemed to be a terrific and unusual explosion, evidently very near. Looking up along College Street, I noticed a torpedo-shaped body, a hundred yards away, which seemed to be hovering in the air, fifteen feet above the highest buildings. It was about two meters long and thirty centimeters in diameter, its outer part seemed to be of a dark color, and from it tongues of fire, like red-hot irons, were shooting out. Soon after, the object began to move, rather slowly, and disappeared southward, over the Dolan stores. As it moved, the wall seemed to open in places, letting out intense flames.

Two young girls of about twelve years old were able to observe one evening a very bright light in the sky. Soon a dark mass appeared in front of the stars: one could distinguish a row of red, blue and green lights. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 203)
I am unable to resist writing about a little incident that happened to me in Duncan, BC away back in 1908 when I was 12 years old. (note de vog: so, this person is writing her story in 1997, when she would be 101 years old? Or did she write it before? All this is not very clear) It is one thing in my life I shall never forget. As we had never heard of UFOs or flying saucers in those days, I have never claimed to have seen one until I heard just recently that an old neighbor of ours, Mrs. Campbell, claimed to have seen a UFO away back in the early days and I think it would have been about the same year that I saw mine. She described it almost exactly the same as mine but like me she didn't tell anyone (..) As I was about to shut the door the whole opening was filled with a flash of very bright light. I jumped back stunned, my eyes on the light. It rose on an angle to about 30 feet, judging by trees in the background, and then it changed to a dark mass with a cluster of red, blue and green lights on it, not bright enough to cast a glow. And then in a changed direction it moved quite slowly for maybe 200 or 300 feet and just disappeared. There was no sound or heat that I remember. I was absolutely in a panic. I ran into the dark house and lay down on the floor under a window so the thing couldn't see me, I suppose - but that's panic! (...) (collected on the Internet in May 1997)

He made the return journey over a hundred miles and again the engine failed, forcing the airship to land near Echterdingen; however, caught in a storm, the airship was finally damaged.

David Packer managed to photograph this light: the object was large and resembled a Moon. The document was published in "English Mechanic" vol. 88 p. 21 but we have not been able to find it (according to Contry Queries and Notes, 1-138, 417). David Packer testified: "At 8:40 pm in the sky lit by the Moon I observed a bright horizontal cloud in the anterior part of the Great Bear and which was just above a dark cloud masking certain stars. The bright cloud constantly varied in brightness, quickly lit up and then became duller, a bit like the stars that twinkle. Its color was pale white and it remained stationary during the entire observation. At 8:45 pm, a meteor from the Perseids penetrated the cloud, at the eastern end of it and there it burned very brightly releasing a string of small luminous nuclei".

The captain of the fishing vessel "Superb" saw, on a clear night, a large star approach the boat. Immediately the ship shone a red light in the direction of the phenomenon and to his great astonishment, it immediately lit a fire of the same color. When a white lamp was lit, the object which had the shape of a "sausage", this time responded with a blue colored fire. The observation lasted between twenty and thirty minutes.

Another cigar-shaped craft was reported at low altitude above Bridgewater. (...) It had searchlights that explored the ground. After a few moments it rose almost vertically and the searchlights went out. (Donald KEYHOE: "Les Soucoupes volantes existent" ed. Corrêa Paris 1951, p 82) Before dawn, at three in the morning, John E. Flynn and Philip S. Prophett, workers, were driving a cart pulled by a horse on Main Street (west of Bridgewater) towards the center. Flynn recounts: "We saw the light, not a searchlight, but a kind of large lantern about 60 to 80 cm in diameter, quite unusual, above the Stanley factory. We stopped to look at it for about ten minutes and saw the light descending more and more towards the ground. Finally, we were able to make out the shape of a balloon. We shouted, but no response came, nor any noise. The balloon descended and the light moved, as if someone was carrying a lantern. Then, slowly, the light rose and went off to the east, a bit towards the southeast. We followed it with our eyes for a long time. Even when I was already back home, I could still see it through the window, for another three quarters of an hour to an hour. I was waiting to see it descend, because at 25 miles it would reach the sea. But it did not descend and continued on a straight trajectory. I noticed this because I was looking at the light between two branches of a large tree: the trajectory was straight. I'm sure it wasn't an ordinary balloon! (note from vog: and why not???) It was turning in a perfect circle above the Stanley factory at about 30 meters altitude and then, this straight horizontal trajectory..." (The Brockton, Mass.

At around 10:30 pm, Egerton S. Free saw a long, sausage-shaped dirigible without lights heading northeast. The next day, the witness's wife discovered a metal piece at the spot where it had been flown the night before. It was a wheel rimmed with rubber, weighing 16 kg and with a diameter of around one meter. On the side of the object was written "Muller Fabrik Bremen". It was the perfect calling card and E. S. Free immediately thought of a German spy dirigible. Yet, several weeks later, the wheel was identified as a piece of a target used in British naval artillery fire. The full account of this case was published on May 15 by the "Evening News" and the day after the newspapers came out, two men "speaking a foreign language" came to inspect the area around the spot where the famous wheel had fallen for at least five hours.

#1909, May 18
GREAT BRITAIN, Caerphilly (Wales)
This new event seemed to confirm the hypothesis that it was a foreign dirigible come to spy on British territory. Around 11:00 C. Lethbridge was returning home when, on the outskirts of a deserted hill called Cerphilly Mountain, he was confronted with an unusual sight. At the top of the slope, to the right of the road, a large cylindrical object was resting on the ground and near it were two young men dressed as officers and wearing fur. When these characters saw the witness, they argued violently in a foreign language, picked something up off the ground and got into some kind of gondola that was under the machine. It then rose in a zigzag, two spotlights came on and with a terrible noise of machinery the object headed towards Cardiff, more towards the south. As soon as C. Lethbridge had told his story, investigators came to the scene and found a whole series of footprints attesting to the presence of characters in the place indicated by the witness. In addition to these traces, a red label was found attached to a small metal rod. It was a piece of French tire valve that was not yet on the British market at that time. On the label there were instructions written in French. A piece of letterhead from a London stockbroker was also found, where the following text could be read with difficulty: "... provincial centers ... be assured that we will not ... the fullest confidence ... this letter is fully justified .." Of course, the agency in question claimed to know nothing of this document. Around the area, a whole series of scraps of paper and newspaper clippings on the mysterious aerial ships that had been seen in the region for some time were also found. A large quantity of stamps of a pasty material resembling papier mâché and two dozen small pieces of blue paper covered with drawings and inscriptions were also discovered. To close this inventory that a surrealist would not deny, one must also add a kind of polished tin lid. During the investigation, a resident of Cardiff revealed that on May 16 he had seen five strangers inspecting the Caerphilly Mountain area. They went from one corner to another in two carts and took pictures with cameras mounted on the seats of their vehicles.

It disappeared shortly after. The following evening the mysterious object was again seen around 8:30 pm by George Smith and his neighbor Poulter. They observed it through binoculars. It glided through the air and flew towards Kaitangata, and began to sway from right to left before disappearing. But around 10:30 pm, the object was again visible, above the sea.

When the conductor of the "Evening Limited" train took out his pocket watch and shouted "All Aboard!" at Boston's North Station that evening, he had no idea that the train was about to go on an adventure with a UFO. The heavy steam locomotive Belching was spewing black smoke. Near the town of Ayer, 48 km northwest, a cigar-shaped UFO descended from the sky to the west to meet the train. The powerful beam of the craft illuminated all the train cars and this lasted until they arrived in Fitchburg. During the stop in the station, the object was lost from sight, but as soon as they left, the journey resumed together. (The Fitchburg, Mass. Sentinel for December 24, 1909.)
Police Inspector Frank Metcalf (Springfield, Mass.) was among the passengers. All he could see of the airship was the powerful beam. All the passengers were very interested in the thing and regretted not having a closer view of the airship. (The Springfield, Mass. Union-News for December 25, 1909.; Ufo Roundup vol. 2 n° 48, 14.12.1997, Joseph Trainor.)

USA, Chattanooga (Tennessee), Huntsville (Alabama)
The inhabitants saw at 9:00 a huge whitish object in the shape of a cigar moving slowly at 50 km/h above their city. The witnesses distinctly heard the sound of the engines and spotted a series of small blue flames at the lower part of the object and along its entire length. Before leaving in the direction of the nearby mountains, it circled around the city for some time. At 9:15, 120 km from Chattanooga, the people of Huntsville saw a similar object, very fast in the sky. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse - trad. Laffont 1964 - p. 24, 25)

Doctor Harris saw an intensely black object 400 km long and 50 km wide, standing out against the lunar disc "it looked like a crow perched on the moon, as close as possible". Clouds interrupted the observation. "I can't help but think," wrote Doctor Harris, "that a strange phenomenon had just occurred". (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 162) (note from vog: in their books, authors Michel BOUGARD and Antonio RIBERA repeat this data in 1912, June 27. Ribera reduces the measurements to 400 m x 50 m and Bougard cites 400 km and 80 km... : in science fiction, Nelson Bond exploited this information in 1960, by publishing "And Lo! The bird!")

Day laborers were sawing trees when they saw in the sky a device they took for a balloon. Suddenly the balloon ignited and what seemed to be a gondola detached and fell into the forest. It was to be searched for in vain in the days following the incident. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 219)

#August 30th and 31st, 1910
USA, New York, Manhattan Island
At 8:45 PM a long dark object flew over Manhattan Island. Hundreds of people saw it approach Madison Square, make a turn, and then disappear. It should be remembered that at this time aviation was still in its infancy. In 1910 there were 36 licensed pilots and the few aircrafts were well known. The following night it was seen again around 9:00 PM, still above Madison Square. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 219) 
There were already more than 200 licensed pilots and many others had to prove themselves by making numerous flights before obtaining a license. Also, on August 20th, 1910, at Sheepshead Bay (New York) Lieutenant J.E. Fickel fired at a ground target from an airplane in flight, using a '30 caliber rifle (Conquête de l'air. Chronologie..." A.

#1910, October
Atlantic Ocean
In 1907, the wealthy American adventurer Walter Wellman ordered a dirigible balloon from Paris. He named it "AMERICA". He set off from Atlantic City towards Europe in October 1910. The propulsion of the balloon was underestimated. Wellman traveled around a thousand miles without being able to control the balloon to direct it against the winds above the Atlantic. After a three-day flight, it finally fell into the ocean near a British warship. ("Ufo's – A century of Sightings by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 8)

#April 8, 1913
USA, Fort Worth (Texas)
A strange shadow was observed on clouds in Fort Worth. (...) It seemed to be caused by some vast object hovering without moving above the clouds. Although the clouds moved, the shadow stayed in the same place. Then it narrowed and faded, as if the object had risen vertically. The Weather Review of this year No. 4-599 gave an account of it. (Donald KEYHOE: "Les Soucoupes volantes existent" ed. Corrêa Paris 1951, p 83) The shadow in the sky of an invisible object, supposed to be a cloud, moves with the setting sun. Two observers saw a triangular object crossing the sky with a considerable parallax for 6 nights in a row. It was very close to the ground. (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed.

#1913, Summer
CHINA
In the summer of 1913, I was a schoolboy. One afternoon, the sky was dotted with a few clouds after a light rain. Suddenly, in the southeast sky, three rings were noticed, each three or four times the size of a full moon. They constantly emitted red and blue lights. Arranged in a perfect triangle, they remained motionless for a few minutes. Later, the three rings lined up and flew slowly in single file. The schoolboys shouted and our teacher came out to see what was happening. Then we went to class and we did not know how the three rings disappeared.
Two days later, at night, villagers were returning from the fair passing through the mountain pass 2 km from the village: they all saw a shiny thing on the ground. It looked like a grain mill, had a diameter of 3 or 4 m. They were all scared, stepped back and took another path to go home.

In the middle of the afternoon, three strange "electric" lights were observed above the Wabash River valley. These lights sometimes flew very slowly (6mph) and sometimes at very high speed. They seemed to be controlled in a "rotary" movement and among the maneuvers observed, there were right-angle turns, and following the terrain, "jumping" merrily over trees and other obstructions on their route.

One fine morning in June, around 4:00 a.m., Gustav Herwagen opened the door of his home in Hamburg. He then saw in a nearby field a shiny object in the shape of a cigar with illuminated windows. Next to this craft there were four or five dwarves, no taller than 1.20 m and wearing light-colored clothing.

CANADA, Georgia Bay
After a boat ride several people rested on the shore of Georgia Bay on Lake Ontario. A little girl saw a deer on the shore and the animal was facing the lake. The child looked in the same direction and remained silent in surprise. After a moment she called her parents. A spherical object with a platform at the base rested on the lake about 16 feet from the shore. Two small men were busy around a colored pipe, green. Their clothes seemed luminous, their size did not exceed 3'3 '' feet. They wore a kind of box-shaped helmet. Then three other small beings with tubular objects were engaged in an enigmatic task before disappearing?
Shortly after, the first two put their pipe into an opening on the side of the device. At a height of 20 feet above the lake, the device tilted and took off at a lightning speed. (Jean FERGUSON: "All about Flying Saucers" ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1972, p.187) William J. Kiehl and seven other people observed an extremely unusual phenomenon at Georgia Bay on Lake Huron. At 150 m from the shore, an object shaped like a flattened globe at the top and carrying a kind of square structure at the base was resting on the water. Two human creatures, 1.20 m tall and dressed in tight-fitting purple-green clothes, were standing on a kind of bridge encircling the device. These beings manipulated a green pipe that plunged into the water. After a while three other small characters appeared at the upper part of the globe. They were dressed this time in khaki and wore, like the first two, a kind of square mask to the shoulders. Meanwhile, the other two had recovered their pipe, pushing it through a kind of hatch. As one of these beings had not yet had time to enter the interior of the object, it suddenly rose from the surface of the lake, forcing the unfortunate to cling energetically to a chromed ramp and it quickly disappeared from the sight of the witnesses.

NORWAY, Alta;
It is reported from the town of Alta that in the evening of Thursday, between 9 and 10 o'clock, a very strange luminous phenomenon was observed by several people and in various districts of the town. The sky was completely covered by low clouds. It was pitch dark when a light point, shining like a big star, appeared in the east of Elvebakken. The phenomenon passed over Bosekop, disappeared behind Skoddevarre, reappeared at Kvaenvik where, after various maneuvers, it disappeared in the direction of Talvik. The white light partially changed from red to blue. On board the SS "Sina" the phenomenon was observed with binoculars. Most of the observers obviously thought of an airplane. But only one person seems to have heard the sound of an airplane, without however observing the light.

BRESIL, Cordilheira dos Parecis
Explorer Lt. Colonel P.H. Fawcet, in the region near Bolivia, reported: "I whistled and a huge creature, covered in fur like a dog, ran to its 'barn', took a big stick and came towards us, dancing on one foot then the other, until it was less than 3 meters away. It made growling noises like "Eugh! Eugh!" and stayed there, dancing. Suddenly the whole forest around us was filled with these hideous human-simian creatures, all growling "Eugh! Eugh!", dancing like the first one and holding sticks in their fists. (note from vog: 70 years before Disney's long animated feature...). The situation seemed delicate for us. I tried to talk to them kindly in Maxubi, but they paid no attention to what I said. Human language seemed not accessible to them." Fawcet ended the situation by shooting first on the ground, then in the air. The creatures then threw their sticks at them and the intruders (the explorers) had to retreat. The local population was aware of the existence of these creatures and called them "Maricoxis". (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 197)

D. S. Ionescu was then 14 years old. One evening, while the family was seated in the garden, they all saw an object of the apparent size of a football, glowing red, moving from east to west at about thirty meters. At the back there was something like an exhaust pipe, whose breath violently shook the tops of the nearby trees. From this kind of tube also came a trail of sparks about ten meters long. A week later the same phenomenon was seen again, this time emitting a characteristic whistle. It flew over various houses, disappearing suddenly. After lingering above one of these dwellings, a lady was found there covered in burns. (Ion HOBANA/Julien WEVERBERGH: "Les OVNI en URSS et dans les pays de l'Est" - trad. Laffont 1976, p. 291)

A dark object, bell-shaped, descended from the sky to the west and landed. Two humanoids appeared from the back of the object, during the landing phase. They walked towards a road, then turned around and headed towards the witness. One of the humanoids stopped and smiled at the witness, Bjarne Westvand. The boy, aged 6 at the time, said that the humanoid was the same size as him, about 1 m tall. He had long dark hair, flowing in the wind. His skin was gray and he had a big head compared to his stature. The two creatures wore tight dark brown clothing. They then went behind the hill and shortly after the bell-shaped object rose and quickly disappeared into the sky (RAPPORTNYTT, 4/1981, 3, cfr, listing of Ole Jonny Braenne).

NORWAY, Ostre Slidre
Tuesday, at 12:30, four ladies left the Fredheim hotel for a walk on the road going north. At the Valsted farm, they suddenly heard a loud engine noise, so they thought a car was coming. They moved to the side of the road to let the vehicle pass, but to their surprise, no car ever arrived. However, the two ladies who were a bit ahead of the others then saw, for a short moment, an airplane above their heads towards the northwest. One of the ladies, the wife of an officer, who saw the machine, is sure that it was an airplane. But here begins the most singular part of the observation. The two women only had the opportunity to see the plane for a short moment, where the engine seemed to have stopped while the craft descended in a dead leaf, slowly, towards Volbufjorden. That is what they both saw, and in their opinion the plane was crashing. The commander of Ostre Slide was immediately alerted, and with four men he went to investigate, organizing a search from Skogene just outside Rognagardene, to the fjord, without finding any debris. The next day the men were posted on either side of the fjord while the entire Volbufjorden region was combed. At the end of the day the commander gave an interview to the reporters, noting that they still had not found anything of the mysterious plane.

NORWAY, Christianiafjord;
Friday night, around 10:10 PM, a terrible storm was raging above the Ostlandet fjord. The witness was in his house, looking out the window towards the fjord. Suddenly he saw a dark object appear on the horizon, somewhere near Rauer. And this "cloudy" mass (what he thought it was) was crossing the sky at an incredible speed, which made him think it was not a cloud at all. He took his binoculars and went out into the garden. He observed through the binoculars, the most beautiful Zeppelin he had ever seen. It was hovering above Christianiafjord. He saw that a bright light was in the center of the huge body. After a minute of observation, this lamp went out, and immediately the craft turned and "floated" southward, where it disappeared into the dark night.

#August 21, 1915
TURKEY, Gallipoli
During the Dardanelles campaign, the Allied forces were facing the Turkish army in the Gallipoli peninsula. On August 21, a British battalion, the 5th Norfolk Regiment, came to reinforce the Anzac troops (Australian and New Zealand army corps). The attack took place at Coast 60, an elevation of terrain in the south of Suvla Bay. According to the campaign book, the fifth regiment was suddenly enveloped in an unexpected fog, on which the rays of the sun were reflected. The glare was so bright that the artillery observers were dazzled. From that moment, the 250 men were never seen again. "This cloud gave the impression of being solid. A group of 22 men could observe it from their trenches dug about 2,500 m away. After changing position, this singular cloud completely covered a dry torrent bed and we could perfectly distinguish its sides and ends. Its color was light gray, like that of the other clouds. The troop, 400 men, then marched towards Coast 60 and, when they reached the level of the cloud, they plunged into it, never to come out again. After an hour, when it had absorbed the regiment in its entirety, the cloud rose and joined the others perfectly motionless, despite a south wind blowing at a speed of 6 to 7 km/h. The entire formation flew towards the north, towards Bulgaria. The indicated regiment was declared missing or destroyed and when Turkey surrendered in 1918, the first thing England demanded from Turkey was the return of this regiment. Turkey replied that it had never taken this regiment prisoner or even been in contact with it and that it did not know of its existence" (extract from Fred Reichart's journal) (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 226-227)

Belgium, in flight
(UFOWEB: The Red Baron is said to have shot down a UFO in 1917.) Bonn, Germany:
The flamboyant fighter pilot known as the Red Baron not only shot down 80 enemy aircraft during World War I but he was also the first human to shoot down an extraterrestrial craft. This is what former German Air Force pilot Peter Waitzrik claims, who says he saw, to his surprise, the fighter pilot shoot at a UFO, which had orange undulating lights, above Belgium in 1917. Then, two of the occupants of the downed UFO, came out of their spacecraft and ran into the woods, apparently never to be seen again. "The Baron and I made a full report on the incident back to Headquarters and they told us never to mention this".<br/><br/>
The 105 year old former pilot recently spoke to a reporter. "And except to my wife and my grown children, I never said a word. But that was 80 years ago, so what difference would it make now?". He recounts that he and Baron Manfred von Richtofen, nicknamed the Red Baron, were flying on a morning mission above western Belgium during the summer of 1917 when a UFO suddenly appeared in the blue sky, directly above their Fokker triplane. "We were terrified because we had never seen anything like this before, the United States had just entered the war, so we assumed it was something they had sent. The Baron immediately opened fire and the thing fell like a rock, shearing the treetops as it crashed into the woods. Then two little bald-headed guys came out and ran away"
Waitzrik says he assumed the silver, glinting craft was some kind of enemy invention until the "flying saucer" panic began in the 1940s and convinced him his colleague had shot down a UFO. "This thing must have been about 40 meters in diameter and looked exactly like those flying saucer shaped spacecrafts everyone has seen during the last 50 years." he says, "so there is no doubt in my mind that it was some kind of spacecraft from another planet, and those little guys running into the woods were not Americans but some kind of extraterrestrials" "You know, sometimes I wonder what happened to those guys" (Source: Sighting/ Jim Hickman

#January 22, 1919
GREAT BRITAIN, Shuttlewood (Derbyshire)
At around 10:10 pm that night, Thomas Hills Harrison had just gone to rekindle the fire in his greenhouse when, heading towards the house, he saw through the living room window his father pointing out a light near the chicken coop, about fifty meters away from the witnesses. Harrison adds: "All the apple trees in the orchard were lit up and cast long shadows in all directions. The night was very dark, particularly quiet and even the chickens were silent when I opened the gate. As soon as I crossed it I could clearly see the luminous globe that remained stationary about 1.40 meters above the ground. At first I thought it was my neighbor Robinson, but not receiving any response to my call, I headed towards this fluorescent light, the size of a tennis ball, perfectly spherical and beautiful to look at, like a pearl out of proportion. I circled it several times, getting closer to less than 2 meters. For about ten minutes I kept staring at it. Finally I decided to pick up a stick that was lying on the ground to touch it and see what would happen. At that moment, as if he had understood what I was going to do, the globe started moving very slowly. I got even closer. The limits of the sphere were not clear, it was like a cottony aura. When it met the fence, the globe fell to the ground as if it were exploding. It quickly regained its normal size and began to climb the trellis in a truly impressive silence. The glow sank about ten meters into Robinson's garden and then returned in my direction at a fast speed this time, suddenly turning to the right. I ran in its direction, I saw it climb the fence again, but I quickly realized that my pursuit was hopeless. When it reached a hawthorn bush, the globe leapt about ten meters high into a gap in the branches. The light stayed there for about three minutes, then disappeared from my view. Thinking that everything was over I went back to the house when I realized that the farmer Shepperd's land was violently lit up. That's when I saw the same glow making the return trip in my direction and at a fairly fast speed. When it was a few meters away from me I felt my hair stand on end for a short moment. The sphere went to the left and stopped in Robinson's garden. I went to knock on Robinson's door and the two of us saw the light globe go north-east, completely crossing the field over a distance of two hundred meters towards Bolsover Road. Then it made several circles around the tops of the roofs of a row of houses in Club Row, finally rising into the sky and disappearing eastward. It was then 10:50 pm.

#1919, late Summer
USA, Rice Lake, Wisconsin
One evening, young Harry Anderson (13 years old), his family and friends,
went for a ride in his father's new Ford Model T. Around 10 pm, returning towards Eau Claire, the engine made some dissonances. Father Anderson stopped on the south emergency lane of Highway 25. "There's no more oil," he said to his son, handing him a can in his hands, "go see if we can borrow some from a farm". Swinging the can in one hand, Harry went off on the dark road. A road sign told him he was just outside of Barron, 5 miles west of Rice Lake. He saw the roof of a farm in the horizon and took a shortcut to get there. The farmer filled the can and Harry returned to the car. Suddenly he saw about twenty little men, coming towards him, walking in single file. They had bald heads and white skin, wearing short leather pants, held up by suspenders on their shoulders. Stunned, Harry hid behind a tree and from there observed the scene. He heard snippets of their conversations, sounding like childish rhymes:<br/><br/>
"We won't stop fighting
Till the end of the war
In Nineteen-Hundred
and Ninety-Four.
Sound off--one, two
Sound off--three, four
Detail, one, two, three, four
One--two...three--four!
The little column kept walking and disappeared into the woods. Harry remained petrified and his heart still pounding for several minutes.

#1919, November 12
FROM ENGLAND TO AUSTRALIA
The departure of the two-engine biplane CEAOU from Farnborough, which several weeks and 16 landings later, will link Australia. They pass through France, Italy, Greece, Crete, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Pakistan, India, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Timor Island and finally Australia. 75 years later, on board an identical biplane entirely rebuilt, 3 people repeat the same feat with the CEAOW (Source and reportage: National Geographic 1994).
