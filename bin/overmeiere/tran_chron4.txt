#March 22, 1802
ITALY, Poniente
In the afternoon of the 2nd Germinal of the year X, we saw a wonderful luminous phenomenon. The sky was very clear, especially in the direction of Poniente. At the moment when the Sun was approaching the horizon, on the diametrically opposite side, I then saw five or six beams of light. They were diverging from a hemisphere similar to a large globe, of which half was hidden by the horizon. This half-disk was the same color as the sky, as blue as it, but shone with more splendor (...) The sky became cloudy above Poniente and hid the view of the setting Sun. During this time the luminous phenomenon did not cease. As soon as the Sun had set, it began to diminish in intensity and finally disappeared.

In the evening of October 8, ten small vessels (boats) participated. 200 rockets were launched in salves in half an hour, with a range of 800 meters. Many fires were lit in the city but, quickly extinguished, had little military consequences. Indeed, Nelson's victory at Trafalgar over the Spanish and French naval forces had given England control of the sea. (...) The english had considered the use of rockets sufficiently conclusive.

Signal rockets, whose head contains a small parachute whose deployment is triggered at the top of their course at the same time as an illuminating charge is ignited before slowly descending, maybe white, red or green or a succession of these three colors in 27 possible combinations. In broad daylight this illuminating charge is replaced by a smoke pot leaving a black trace in the sky. These signals remained visible for a long time from very far away. (...) The first tests seem to have been made in England by a Captain Henry Trenrouse on the coasts of Cornwall where frequent shipwrecks occurred. ("A l'Assaut de l'Espace" Georges H.

SWEDEN, Skeninge
Mr. Acharius observed at 4 o'clock an extraordinary phenomenon. The sun became brick red. At the same time, a large number of dark brown, round bodies, of the apparent size of a hat brim, appeared from the western horizon and passed through the sky, disappearing towards the east. This fantastic procession lasted nearly two hours. Sometimes one of the bodies fell to the ground. Instead of a fall, a film was found which dried up immediately and disappeared. Often, when approaching the sun, these bodies seemed to come closer together in groups of no more than eight units, and then tails of 5 to 8 m in length were seen. When away from the sun, their tails became invisible again. Their substance was described as soapy and gelatinous. (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 221, 222)

GREAT BRITAIN, Hatton Garden (London)
Observation by Sir John Staveley: "I saw many meteors near the corner of a black cloud from which lights were coming out. They were like dazzling spots of light dancing and passing through the cloud. One of them increased in size until it reached the brightness and size of Venus on a clear evening. But I could not see any body in the light. It moved with great speed and bordered the corner of the cloud. Then it became stationary, lost its brilliance and disappeared. I saw these strange lights for minutes, not seconds. For nearly an hour these glimmers, as strange as it was and in countless points, came out and went back into this dark cloud. No light came from the clouds where these glimmers were playing. At the moment when these meteors increased in size, it seemed as if they were descending towards the ground.." (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 125)

#May 11th (or 15th?), 1811
SWITZERLAND, Geneva - FRANCE, Paris
At 8:35am, in the northwest, a light was seen preceded by a whistling sound. At first it was a snake of fire, then the shape changed, becoming a rectangle (horseshoe) and finally two lights at the ends of a curved line could be seen. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 125) On May 11th, 1811, at 8:35am, in Geneva, many people including members of the faculty of sciences, suddenly saw a flash of light in the northeast. This flash then took the shape of a horseshoe. It was advancing eastward and seemed to be twice as high as the mountains of the Jura. A witness who examined it through a telescope stated that this luminous line was composed of several separate parts. (Les Soucoupes chez Heidi, cfr GREPI, Switzerland, 1997)

On the day of the earthquake in Marseille, accompanied by such frightening phenomena that the 7 passengers in the Digne carriage preferred to stop at the bad inn of the Quatre-Tours rather than come to sleep in Manosque. As the carriage approached, this luminous balloon that was hovering on the road split into 4 fires, and then the sight of the passengers became so blurred that they thought they saw four men dancing around them, each enclosed in a lantern.

#1816, January 15
FRANCE, Gallardon (Beauce)
Extract from the "Dictionary of Secret Societies in the West" under the direction of Louis Pauwels. "MARTIN de GALLARDON". Gallardon, in Beauce, is a village of 1800 inhabitants, three leagues to the west of Chartres. On January 15, 1816, at dusk, Thomas Martin, a thirty-three year old farmer, was spreading manure on his fields when he heard someone calling out to him. He turned around and saw nothing. He was very afraid; he was about to take up his pitchfork again when a second call became more insistent. This time he distinctly saw an unusual figure: a small being wearing a top hat and dressed in a light frock coat. The apparition commanded him: - Martin, my friend, you will go to the Tuileries, see King Louis XVIII and you will speak to him in my name... The apparition vanished into the night that was falling. Thomas had a wife and children. At dinner he told them about his adventure. His wife gently mocked him and recommended that he forget it. To fill a pitcher of cider he went down to the cellar and there he saw his "gentleman" again who insisted:<br/><br/>
- Trust me, Martin, my friend. I am an angel of the Good Lord.
And the angel formulated a very secret message, of the highest importance for the king. The next day, at dawn, Martin, a good parishioner, told his priest, Abbot Laperruque. The rector listened to him attentively, for Martin had an excellent reputation (...) Thus, on March 6, under the guidance of a gendarmerie lieutenant, Thomas Martin took the coach and arrived in Paris two days later. (...) Martin was taken to the Tuileries on April 2, and the king immediately granted him a private audience. The monarch and the farmer remained alone, absolutely alone, for almost an hour!
A great favor, Louis XVIII escorted his humble visitor.<br/><br/>
- This is the end of the reign of the present king. He has no other choice but to leave France. Neither he nor the Duke of Angoulême will return there, and Henri V will not be king. Naundorff will one day see his rights recognized, was Martin's comment.

[note from vog: IN REALITY: the epilogue comes from the announcement on the radio and television on April 19, 2000. The DNA of the heart of the child (Louis 17) who died on June 8, 1795 is indeed the DNA of the son of Louis 16 and Marie-Antoinette (University of Louvain (Belgium) and another in Germany) and Naundorff from then on is only an impostor. The "dwarf" who would have contacted Martin de Gallardon is just as much... if he ever existed.]

FRANCE, Angoulême (Charente)
On June 13th, at 6 o'clock in the morning, according to the Journal de la Charente of June 19th, 1819, "suddenly a meteor was seen in the atmosphere. It had the shape of a "rocket", its length seemed to be about 1200 toises and it inclined towards the earth. It threw an extremely bright light into the air. A toise is 1.95 meters, so 1200 toises is about 2340 meters! If a real meteor of this size had been seen, it would have been in our atmosphere, therefore too close to the ground to escape the terrestrial attraction. It would have fallen causing a formidable earthquake that would not have gone unnoticed!

Professor Dewey, communicating Professor Graves' report, recounts that at the sound of an explosion, a bright light spread over the town of Amherst, illuminating one of the walls of the room where he himself was with his family. The next day, in Professor Dewey's front yard, on the very spot from which the strange light seemed to come, a mysterious object covered with bright yellow down, like that found in drapery factories, was discovered. The down was pushed aside and a pulpy yellowish-fawn substance appeared, which, giving off a very nauseating smell, turned bright red upon contact with the air. It liquefied after a few minutes, becoming red blood (...) (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 51, 52)

Bishop Museum of Honolulu, the following passage can be found: "This morning at about 3:30 (August 12, 1825) the watch on deck was amazed to see that all around them was suddenly illuminated. Turning their eyes eastward, they saw a large, luminous, round body rising about 7 degrees from the water to the clouds, falling out of sight, and then rising and falling again. It was the color of a red-hot cannonball and seemed the size of the sun. It spread such a bright light that a pin could have been picked up from the deck." (Yvan T.

The Reverend Alexander Espline was travelling from Auchtermuchty to Letham when he noticed a peculiar light suspended in the air above Whinny Park, the residence of one James Millie. Approaching the Park, Mr. Espline saw two lights, one smaller and brighter than the other, of a leaden hue, pale as death. Suddenly, the smaller of the spheres emitted a beam of light of extreme brightness, soon followed by a series of flashes from both objects at once. Frightened by this phenomenon, Mr. Espline fled. Two days later the body of James Millie was found, having been murdered and buried at the spot where the glows had been seen. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 127)

A strange being seemingly clad in what would now be called a space suit, frightened the Londoners. At times it was luminous and could jump very high. Named "Spring Heel Jack" this character had adventures that are not without strongly recalling much more modern facts. On February 20th Miss Jane Alsop, aged 18, met the "monster" at Bear Bine Cottage, where she lived in the small village of Old Ford, near Bow. Having heard a violent knocking at the front door, she went out and saw the most hideous apparition: a figure clad in tight-fitting and glittering clothes, a lamp radiating in the middle of its chest and eyes resembling red balls of fire. She began to scream with all her might. Spring Heel Jack then seized her arm in a metallic hand with fingers like claws and sent balls of fire into the young girl's face. She soon fell unconscious and had still time to see this sad figure fly away into the air. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 128)

Two little girls saw stones falling around them. The stones
fell with a strange slowness. The children ran to the family home and returned to the spot with their parents. The stones
were still falling, always with the same astonishing slowness. Then, a
kind of upward current - a whirlwind - sucked the two little girls
who were lifted up but their parents were able to, thanks to the speed of
their reflexes, hold them back at the last second to prevent them
from being carried away God knows where. The parents were not affected by
the suction phenomenon. (Jean SIDER: "Ovni, les envahisseurs

In the Mediterranean Sea
Three luminous bodies were seen emerging from the ocean forty meters from the "Victoria", a British brigantine 1300 km from Adalia (Asia Minor) and remained visible for ten minutes. The ship was located at 36°40'56" north latitude and 13°44'36" east longitude. Professor Baden Powell published a letter from a correspondent from Mount Lebanon who described the same miraculous phenomenon but only cited two luminous bodies, five times bigger than the Moon and with appendages in the shape of sails resembling "large flags blown by the breeze". They were visible for an hour. The appendages did not resemble meteor trails, as their glow seemed to come from the bodies themselves. At Adalia 1300 km from the Victoria and at the same time, the Rev. F. Hawlett, cited by Professor Baden-Powell, witnessed the spectacle which he estimated to last half an hour. The phenomenon was also reported from Syria and Malta, in the form of "two closely linked bodies." (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 213)

At three o'clock, Sir Robert Inglis saw thousands of bright objects,
resembling snowflakes in a cloudless sky. But although this deployment
lasted only 25 minutes, none of the flakes fell to the ground. Inglis's
servant thought he saw some of them had some kind of wings. During the
same communication, Sir John Herschel recalled that in 1845 or 1846 his
attention had been drawn to large objects crossing the air. Through
the telescope he identified them as masses of hay two meters in
diameter, but although only a whirlwind could have lifted them, he
noticed that the air was quite calm. (Charles FORT: "The Book of the
Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 173, 174) Thousands of luminous
objects are observed by the astronomer Inglis in a clear sky. Some seem
to have wings or a luminous halo. (Desmond Leslie and George Adamski:

A certain G.F.I. reported: "At 9:20pm my attention was suddenly drawn
to what appeared to be a bright flash of light and turning in the
direction from which it came (south-west) I saw a magnificent
meteoric light of a shape which I describe below (lenticular). The
colour was an intense blue and it occupied at least a quarter of the
visible sky, the phenomenon being inclined towards the ground at an
angle of 45°. This lasted from 30 to 40 seconds, gradually
diminishing in thickness until it became only a narrow beam of light,
the length remaining unchanged. Just before it went out the
phenomenon began to tremble and undulate. The sky at that moment was
very clear and without clouds and a light, fresh wind was blowing
from the north-north-west.." Mr. R.W. Stoke reported the following:
".. Around 7:20pm my attention was drawn to a very bright flash and
turning immediately in the direction from which it came, I saw a

It was a red sphere of a size equal to half of the full Moon, with a trail of six to seven times this dimension. It appeared in the center of a huge triangular cloud and it constantly emitted flashes of a very bright red light. A sound resembling a shrill whistle was heard. Having apparently crossed the Channel from southeast to northwest, the object exploded in a bright flash and a solid body was seen to fall into the waves about 800 m from the shore.

And here is the journalistic version: "A great sensation is reported in the villages of Tapshamn Lymphstone, Exmouth, Teignmouth and Dawlish, caused by the discovery on February 8 of an incredible amount of strange and mysterious footprints" (in the thin layer of freshly fallen snow). Again, there is talk of the incredible multiplicity of footprints found in the very large area limited by the different villages. They were also found in the most unexpected places: gardens enclosed by high walls, open countryside and roofs of houses. In Lymphstone there was hardly a single garden that did not receive this indescribable visit. (...) It is said that the footprints were generally 25 cm apart. "The footprint of the foot resembles very closely the hoof of an ass and measures 4 cm, sometimes 6 cm." (...) the footprints were taken on both sides of the Este (small lake 3.5 km wide). (...) No animal leaves a straight footprint, not even man. Whatever the origin of these traces, they seemed to have raised the snow rather than compressed it. (Charles Fort: "The Book of the Damned" - ed.

When it appeared, a faint, lugubrious noise was heard. It moved at a vertiginous speed towards the north and suddenly stopped. It began to waver, suspended in the air. Suddenly this metal crepe divided into three parts, spitting into the sky thousands and thousands of luminous pearls that flew in all directions, the whole sky becoming multicolored. What a splendid spectacle! When the pearls fell up to three meters above the ground, all the colors immediately extinguished, but the roofs were still lit.

The light was fully visible for only 5 seconds, when suddenly it split into particles, like a firework. A few minutes later he heard the sound of an explosion that shook the ground in vibrations, while a sound of a tornado was heard. Lumley did not pay more attention to the phenomenon, but the next day he discovered, 2 miles from his camping location, a hole in the forest, with giant trees broken off. Going around the damage he found a large stone embedded in the side of the mountain. This stone seemed divided into compartments and bore curious hieroglyphs. Lumley also found fragments of something resembling glass. The stone in question was examined in Leavenworth, Galena and Cincinnati by Colonel Bonneville. It is thought to be some kind of meteorite.

#1871, October 4th and 5th of
ENGLAND, High Wycombe (Buckinghamshire)
For more than 100 years, the secret of William Robert Loosley, a carpenter entrepreneur, was kept secret. It was his great-granddaughter who discovered the description of the event among papers in a drawer of the old desk. Wycombe at that time was only a small village. On the 4th of October at 3:15 in the morning he woke up, felt uncomfortable and went out into the garden. A star, brighter than the full moon, passed through the sky, followed by an astonishing thunderclap, as the sky was clear and without clouds. The object stopped in mid-flight, began to sway while descending. It seemed to land in the nearby forest. The next day Loosley went in search of the object. After a long time, as he poked his walking stick into a pile of dead leaves, he saw something strange, metallic, like a container, 55 to 60 cm long, covered with curious bubbles. "Suddenly something opened with the sound of a well-oiled piece, an eye came out, covered with glass and 2 to 3 cm wide. A few moments later a second eye opened, sending a purple light beam. Then a third one, which made a rod appear a little bigger than a pencil. I didn't want to stay there anymore. As I left, the machine started up, tracing three small furrows in the ground. When I reached the clearing, I noticed that similar furrows crossed and intertwined everywhere. The machine stopped for a short moment, a kind of pincer came out, digging in the ground, and a dead rat came out. It was illuminated 2 to 3 times by the purple light. Then the corpse was sprayed with a liquid before being taken to a closed opening by a panel. In my haste to leave, I lost my cane. The machine swallowed my cane. It followed me, like a sheepdog, forcing me in my flight to follow the path it wanted, close to another metal box, bigger. "In panic, he looked up and saw a light like a moon that seemed to make light signals. Before being able to determine the sequences, the light disappeared. Loosley then fled to his house running. In the night, unable to sleep, he saw through the window a light descending in the direction of the clearing he had visited during the day. After a moment the light rose and finally disappeared. He got up, put the whole story on paper, and locked the manuscript in his desk. Loosley died in 1893. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDEL: "The World's Greatest Ufo Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 82, 83)

The inhabitants saw at 1 o'clock a kind of haystack crossing the space, accompanied like a meteor, by fire, dense smoke and a sound of railway. It was sometimes very high, sometimes very close to the ground. The effect was that of a tornado: trees and walls were knocked down. The object disappeared "all at once". (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 185)

#July beginning 1873
USA, Fort Scott (Kansas)
A similar one was observed the next day, above Fort Scott. (flaming object, detached from Mars) (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970 - p.64) "Cotton farmers were frightened by a bright object that rushed towards them. This silver snake plunged and gained altitude several times. A team of horses panicked and the driver thrown under the wheels was killed on the spot.

#November 20th, 1873 (Summer?)
USA, Bonham (Texas),
It was broad daylight when a strange object, moving at a very high speed, appeared in the sky, to the southwest of the town. The inhabitants watched it for a moment, not believing their eyes. The only flying machine they knew was the hot air balloon. But this object was terrifying, and the speed at which it moved distorted its silhouette. Frightened farmers hid under their cars. The people of the town locked themselves in their homes. A few brave souls remained in the streets. The mysterious object circled Bonham twice, then moved east and disappeared. Descriptions varied, giving it a round or oval shape and a cigar shape. (Donald KEYHOE: "Flying Saucers Exist". Corrêa Paris 1951, p. 78) A luminous disc made 3 laps around Bonham and flew away. (Christiane PIENS: "UFOs of the Past" - Marabout 1977 - p.88 which gives November 20th as the date.)

#Summer (20th November?) 1873
USA, Fort Scott - or Fort Riley? (Kansas)
Twenty-four hours after this incident, a similar craft was seen at Fort Scott. Soldiers in panic scattered when it passed over them. It disappeared in a few seconds in the direction of the north. (Donald KEYHOE: "Les soucoupes volantes existent". Ed. Corrêa Paris 1951, p. 78) An hour later a disc descended over the cavalry troops during a parade at Fort Riley (Kansas) and scared the horses. (Christiane PIENS: "Les Ovni du passé" - Marabout 1977 - p.88)

#1874, Summer
USA, Newport, Oregon
In 1874, Newport was the scene of one of the strangest events. Muriel Trevenard, a 16-year-old girl, suddenly disappeared from the third floor of the old Yaquina Bay villa where she was and was never found again. (UFO Roundup, Volume 5, Number 11.) (continued in 1966)

#February 1875
GREAT BRITAIN, Pwllheli (Wales)
"A few days ago we saw something we had never seen before: lights, eight in total, stretching over an estimated distance of 13 km and moving at times horizontally, at times vertically or in zigzag. Sometimes they had a very bright blue color, sometimes they looked more like electric light (...) They disappeared at one point, but they quickly came back, as bright as at the beginning..." (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 - p. 138)

#April 1875
At sea, Gulf of Mexico
Edward L. Moss was on board the HMS Bulldog, cruising a few kilometers north of Vera Cruz in the Gulf of Mexico, when a line of light appeared on the northern horizon and, without any breath of wind, approached the boat and then passed it in a series of short pulsating lights. (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 215)

#1875, May 6
PAKISTAN, Barisal
For the first time, mysterious detonations are spoken of, which still perplex scientists and experts today. English people passing near Baarisal, a small village located to the west of the mouth of the Ganges, 70 miles south of Dacca, heard cannon shots that seemed to come from all corners of the horizon. (Yves Naud: "Les E.T. et les OVNI dans l'histoire" Famot 1977, Volume 2, p. 210)

#1875, December
INDIA, Calcutta
Report by explorer G.B. Scott: "In December 1875, when I was travelling from Calcutta to Assam, crossing the Sundarbans, the weather was calm, the sky clear, no atmospheric disturbances were foreseeable. During the day, the noise of conversations and navigation prevented me from hearing anything else. At night, when we stopped on the banks of the canals, far from the villages and surrounded by miles of marshes, there was nothing to break the silence except the lapping of the water and the fall of stones, and at regular intervals, some kind of cannon shots. Sometimes one, sometimes two or three in a row. They seemed to be fired from far away, but never from the same distance." (Yves Naud: "The E.T. and UFOs in History" Famot 1977, Volume 2, p. 210)

#March 3, 1876
USA, Bath Country (Olympian Springs?) (Kentucky)
Under a completely clear sky, flakes (gelatinous) from 5 to 10 cm²
fell in a dense shower on the ground and trees, but limited to a strip
of land 100 m long by 50 m wide. (Charles FORT: "The Book of the
Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 53) It was seen falling from a
cloudless sky a substance having the appearance of flesh. Flakes from
5 to 20 cm² fell in a shower covering the ground, trees and fences, in
a corridor 50 m wide and 100 m long. (Inforespace n° 52 - 1980 p. 4)

#1877, February 27
GERMANY, Peckloch
...a yellow rain of gold fell, the coloring matter of which consisted of four different organisms, with the total exclusion of pollen. These organisms had respectively the shape of an arrow, a coffee bean, a horn and a disc. (Monthly Weather Review, May 1877) (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 41)

#1877, March 23
FRANCE, Vence
The lights that appeared in the sky were described as almost blinding balls of fire, coming from a cloud of one degree in diameter and moving with relative slowness. They were seen for more than an hour heading North and it was said that 8 or 10 years before similar ones had been observed in Vence itself. (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 233, 234)

#1877, March 27
GREAT BRITAIN
At 22:50, a phenomenon identical to that of Vence four days earlier was observed. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 - p. 139)

#1877, March 27
BELGIUM, Ghent (East Flanders)
A bright disc flew at low altitude over the city of Ghent emitting "a great noise". (Yves Naud: "The E.T. and the UFOs in History" Famot 1977, Volume 2, p. 213)

#1877, April (May 15?)
GREAT BRITAIN, Aldershot
A silhouette resembling Spring Heel Jack appeared outside an army post in Aldershot. Two sentinels, very good shots, fired almost at point-blank range and hit him, as he refused to stop at their cries. The creature made a terrible leap and disappeared, leaving no traces of blood on the ground. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDEL: "The World's Greatest UFO Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 84) Great return of "Spring Heel Jack". "..sentries from two guard posts were frightened by the appearance of two bright spectres in the night, as if they were covered in phosphorus (...) The shapes could make leaps of ten meters in length.." (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 - p. 139) A resident sees "a strange being in tight clothes wearing a shiny helmet rising into the air". His testimony is confirmed by two sentinels who also saw him and even shot at him, to no avail. This apparition, according to their words, "paralyzed them with fear". (Yves Naud: "Les E.T. et les OVNI dans l'histoire" Famot 1977, volume 2, p. 213 which locates the phenomenon on May 15)

#1877, Autumn
GREAT BRITAIN, Newport
The inhabitants of Newport shot at Spring Heel Jack who was flying on the rooftops of the houses. He escaped, apparently without being injured. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDEL: "The World's Greatest Ufo Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 84) "as if he had springs on his shoes because he could jump up to a height of nearly five meters without any difficulty". (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 - p. 139)

#1877, Autumn
GREAT BRITAIN, Lincoln
Spring Heel Jack appears in the locality, guards try to catch him: He jumps out of reach. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDEL: "The World's Greatest Ufo Mysteries" ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 84) (continued on September 10, 1904)

#1877, September 7
USA, Bloomington (Indiana)
A light blinking regularly with an interval of 4 seconds flew over the city. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 - p. 139)

#January 22, 1878
USA, Denison (Texas)
The "Daily News of Denison of January 25th, gave this report: Mr. John Martin, a farmer who lives about six miles south of our town, told us the strange story as follows: Tuesday morning, while hunting, his attention was drawn to a dark object quite high in the sky towards the south. The particular shape of this object and the speed with which it approached struck him and he made all his efforts to better distinguish it. At the time it was seen, it was roughly the size of an orange and continued to grow larger. Mr. Martin strained his eyes looking at it and turned away for a moment to rest his eyes. When he looked for it again, the object was almost vertical, its dimensions had increased considerably and it seemed to be advancing at a prodigious speed. When it passed vertically, the object was about the size of a large saucer and was obviously at a very high altitude. Mr. Martin thought it looked like a balloon as far as he could judge. It disappeared as quickly as it had appeared and was soon out of sight. (Donald KEYHOE: "Les soucoupes volantes existent". Ed. Corrêa Paris 1951, p. 78, 79) A luminous disc is seen in the sky of Denison; a witness already uses the term "saucer" to describe it. An article from the "Daily News" dated the next day confirms it. (Henry DURRANT: "Le livre noir des S.V."- Laffont 1970 - p.64) John Martin was hunting south of Denison on January 22nd when he saw an object descending from the sun, about the size of a large dinner plate. (Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDEL: "The World's Greatest Ufo Mysteries" Ed. Hamlyn 1995, p. 76)

#1878
AUSTRALIA, near Sydney
H. C. Russell, an astronomer, and his colleague G. D. Hirst were in the Blue Mountains near Sydney. Mr Hirst was gazing at the moon. Suddenly he saw what Russell calls "one of the most remarkable facts that must be recorded at the moment, even if no explanation can yet be given for it." "Hirst saw that a large part of the moon was covered by a shadow as dark as that of the Earth during a lunar eclipse. It was almost impossible to resist the conviction that it was a shadow, even if it could not be the shadow of a known body". (...) (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, pp. 178-180)

#May 15, 1879
GULF OF PERSIA
Captain Evans, a hydrographer of the British Navy, reported that Commander Pringle of the ship "Vulture" observed at 26°26' N latitude and 53°11' E longitude, waves of light or aquatic pulsations moving at great speed. He noted that the light waves passed under the Vulture. Looking eastward, it seemed like a wheel spinning on its axis and its rays lighting up, while to the west, an identical wheel moved in the opposite direction. The light waves extended from the surface to the depths of the sea. Commander Pringle thought that the rays came from a single wheel and that the doubling was pure illusion. He estimated that the objects were forty meters wide, spaced one hundred and fifty meters apart, and moved at 80 km/h for 35 minutes at 9:40 PM. After their passage, the boat crossed large patches of a floating substance that resembled "schools of oily fry". ("Nature" 20-291) (Charles FORT: "The Book of the Damned" - ed. Eric Losfeld 1967, p. 215)

#1879, August 21
IRELAND, Knock
At 8:30 PM Mary McLoughlin went out to visit a friend. It was raining. Passing by the church she saw several strange silhouettes and something like an altar with a white light, but she didn't linger. On the way back, in the company of Mrs Beirne, she saw three people surrounded by a bright light standing in the grassy meadow. A diocesan commission investigated and found at least 14 witnesses. They had seen lights on the church, a large luminous globe or the apparition of "saints". (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - coll. J'AI LU, p. 194, 195)

#April 1879
USA, Sleight's Canyon (now Paris Canyon)
Albert Humburg, a German immigrant, owned a mine in Sleight's Canyon. He had it worked by the three Ludlum brothers. Henry Ludlum told his brothers he had heard strange noises behind the rock walls of the mine's tunnels while he was working. His brothers replied that it was only the ground settling. But Henry insisted that what he had heard sounded like little cries, murmurs, whistles, and metallic noises. His brothers made fun of him. Henry then wanted to get "proof" to convince his brothers. The rest is told by Humburg's daughter, Mrs. Emma Hymas: "I will never forget that April morning, it was barely 4 o'clock. There was still a lot of snow whose surface was frozen in a crust. Ludlum knocked on our door saying that his brother Henry had gone down into the mine the day before and had not come back up. They had been at the entrance of the mine calling him, but there was no answer. My father left the table and his breakfast, put on his red cape and accompanied the Ludlums. I remember that cape, new and red, which he was no longer wearing when he was found. In the mine there were pockets of bad air but the Ludlums lit fire torches, no doubt to purify them. When they arrived at the mine my father told them he wanted to go to the bottom, to see what was going on. So he got into the barrel that the brothers lowered with the pulley. My father found Henry Ludlum dead. With rope he tied the body to the barrel and gave the signal for it to be raised. About halfway up, the Ludlums heard a growl of a wild animal followed by the sound of a body falling. They started calling out with all their might, but my father did not answer. The barrel was raised, empty. So they quickly left for Paris (Idaho) to call for help. Several people arrived, with horses and sleds, but by then it was afternoon and no one wanted to go down into the mine in the dark. But they lowered a kind of grappling hook with a rope and, being as careful as they could, they managed to grab my father's blue overalls and raise his body. Bob Spence, a lawyer who was also there, thought he saw some signs of life still, but at that time no one knew about artificial respiration. I still clearly remember how my mother left the house with my six-year-old brother, climbing the hill and putting him in our homemade toboggan, to go and tell the Foxes, our neighbors, of my father's death.
The men near the mine finally managed to raise Henry Ludlum's body too. The two corpses were taken to the judge's room for some kind of inquiry." The mines were never worked again after these mysterious deaths, of which no one ever knew the cause. Humburg's mine is still known today as the "Hummingbird Mine" in Peis Canyon 40 km south of Soda Springs in Idaho. (Folklore from Utah, Wyoming and Southern Idaho, edited by Austin E. Fife, Volume III, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, 1958, pages 16-17)
