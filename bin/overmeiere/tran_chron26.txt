Israel, Sfat (Galilee)
This is the day of the biggest wave of UFOs ever observed in Israel. (...) It starts at 10 pm above Haifa, flies over Beersheva and the Negev, before disappearing beyond the Jordan. Ephi Sarid, photographer for Yediot Ahronot, who saw the vessel in the town of Sfat (Galilee) said: "I saw a huge light and smaller lights spinning around it. The length is not clear, but I estimate the width to be 30 meters. It was on a fast trajectory at an altitude of 2000 meters. It traveled without sound and lit up the whole sky." ("The Return of the Angels" - UFOs in Israel, Past and Present - Barry Chamish)

Liran Shor, 16 years old, saw it from Haifa: "It was flying above the houses, and since it made no sound, that's what made me look. Its shape was an enormous ellipse, the length of two jumbo jets. Its light was like burning coal, and it left an orange trail. The whole street was lit up." ("The Return of the Angels" - UFOs in Israel, Past and Present - Barry Chamish)

Pini Shechter, 17 years old, Tiberius; "A small white ball was flying towards the big ship and was connected to it by a white 'strip'. The big ship left a trail of flames, it was about 35 meters long and 9 meters high. Its color was white or red." ("The Return of the Angels" - UFOs in Israel, Past and Present - Barry Chamisch)

In the evening the man was agitated and couldn't sleep. He must have dozed off anyway because he found himself awake, standing in the parking lot near the basketball stadium, 50 km away in another suburb of Perth. About thirty strangers surrounded him. Telepathically one of the people told him he should be happy to have been chosen. A large blue light appeared, flew overhead and that was his last memory. The next moment he was in the basketball stadium and other people were there too. His confusion turned to panic because these people seemed absolutely sinister. They looked like humans except for their eyes, which seemed empty. Some people were receiving gifts from the entities. He was offered one too: a cricket bat... One of these creatures was on its knees and welcoming his sensations, his emotions and it seemed to him that he was devoid of his own thoughts. That was too much. He threw the cricket bat and said: "You are not what you seem to be, leave!" He was then exiting through the door, everything became a bright white and he found himself back in his bed.

Belgium, Henri-Chapelle
Example of serious distortion of the truth!
During the month of February 1992, Stephen Greer, a doctor, and some members of his research group, the CSETI (Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence), left the United States to go to Belgium and meet the main witnesses and investigators who attended this incredible wave of UFO sightings that took place in this country, that is, more than 3500 (note from vog: let's divide this number by 7 or 8, it will be more correct) cases since 1989. Dr. Greer and his team also had the opportunity to spot some of these unusual objects. Here is the detailed description of one of these observations by Dr. Greer: "During the night of February 10, 1992, we went with Dr. Brenig (from SOBEPS) to a ridge overlooking the town of Henri-Chapelle, about 15 km from Eupen... Around 10 pm, we noted the passage of a convoy of military or official vehicles... It was obvious that the material transported by this exceptional convoy was the subject of a great deployment of security forces... Dr. Brenig left us around 11 pm to return to Brussels... We continued our sentinel work for several more hours, and around 12:30 or 1 am, we saw another convoy of vehicles arrive from afar, larger than the first... and this time under very high surveillance... From our observation point, we simply watched this great parade when, through a break in the clouds, we noticed the appearance of an enormous, light yellow and very bright light, which moved slowly and seemed wider than the full moon disc. (...) In fact, the light was above the famous convoy. But soon other clouds gathered and the light disappeared from our eyes. A few minutes later, the convoy was no longer visible, we heard - and felt - a kind of deep rumble, a low and intense vibration, just above our car. This lasted from 10 to 30 seconds, and seemed to come from the clouds above us... This sound was nothing like anything we had known before; in any case, it was not the rumble of thunder or the engine of an airplane, or even the passage of the sound barrier by a supersonic jet. (Stephen Greer, MUFON UFO Journal, No. 289, May 1992. [IN REALITY: Professor Léon Brenig did not have to necessarily return to Brussels around 11 pm, but stayed with Stephen Greer and his team all night as well as investigator André Goffard, and even spent the morning of the next day with them. André Goffard, recounted in detail, their night of observation. He is in any case formal: no low and intense vibration. Not the slightest trace either of a military convoy. Nor even of light other than that of the moon...] (Timothy GOOD: "E.T. Connection" 1993 Trad. Presses de la Cité 1994 p. 285)

(cf: February 4, 1992) Again, around 2:30 in the morning, he was woken up by an intense blue light. In the dazzling light he saw a creature between 1.2 and 1.4 meters tall. What was terrible was that the man's son was in the power of this entity and he could not move to free the child: he was paralyzed in his bed. But the entity in the light gradually moved away, and then the witness could move, he jumped out of bed, grabbed his son, while the entity disappeared in a flash of white light. The immediate memory that follows is the sight of the son, sleeping in his bed, pale and shocked. Not too much though, since he was able to attend school the next day. Shortly after these events, during an evening meal (lamb) the child had something in his throat. He coughed and out came a small metal object. Analyzed, this thing would come from a computer manufactured in Sweden. (??? ) (Vlad Govic and Keith Baskerfield)

Germany, Wildeshausen
(Case No.: 19920504) The witness is Peter W., a 39-year-old businessman. Around 6:15 pm he observed in the local industrial area an object flying around 120 cm in diameter, emitting an unusual luminosity, near the buildings, without any noise, at an altitude of 10 to 15 meters. A few seconds later, the object flew away and disappeared into the clouds. (JUFOF Nr. 88, 4'1993:98ff) (Hans-Werner Peiniger, GEP e.V., JUFOF - Germany)

Australia, Shepparton, Victoria
In the early evening, caretakers Leo and Nola Jones saw upon opening their door two solid beams of light in the shape of an L, orange in color, arriving at the Waranga basin. For ten minutes they watched in amazement "these perfect square beams" which stood vertically, to come to a stop halfway between Harriman's Point and a commercial complex. They took the camera, but as soon as the flash (of the camera) went off, "bang" they had disappeared. The Jones are the caretakers and guardians of the Waranga Boat Club and the adjoining campsite. During the observation they noticed that these square beams seemed to come from two small orange lights, suspended at mid-altitude and already observed while they were drinking tea around 8 pm. These small lights had the color and size of an orange, were very bright. It was because of them that they went out of the house to see what it was. They were in front of them, on the other side of the basin. The photo of the beams shows orange streaks across the shot. The beams came out vertically from the two orange points, and as soon as they touched the surface of the basin water, they advanced while staying parallel for a distance of 300 meters. They did not reflect in the water. A phenomenon like this had never happened before at Waranga. After the photo was taken, everything vanished, the orange lights in the sky and the beams, and never reappeared. During the observation no sound came from the phenomenon. (Keith Baskerfield)

A couple, in bed around midnight, were reading before going to sleep. Suddenly, a strange buzzing sound was heard, between a purring and an oscillating noise like the blades of a helicopter. Their two dogs became like mad, growling, showing their teeth, moaning, howling, barking, their eyes rolling. The noise became unbearable and the man went out to see where it was coming from. He turned on the 500 watt security lamp on the nearby: immediately the noise stopped and did not repeat. (UFORA92070 - Keith Basterfield)

K.T. Francovich, photographer and filmmaker (documentaries on wild animals), great-niece of Mike Francovich Sr. who was president of Columbia Pictures, and cousin of two other Frankovichs who participated in the films "Exodus" and "Lawrence of Arabia," was walking with two large dogs. They were on leashes (dogs trained to attack). The place was a barren spot where there were still some dead lemon trees, without leaves, in the south of Florida. She heard a loud noise, like that of a lumberjack busy chopping down a tree with an axe. Turning towards the place where the noise came from, she saw a humanoid standing near a tree. Its skin was a grayish pink and seemed to be without pores, like plastic. It must have measured about 1 m 40. It wore a metallic-looking leotard, which showed all its shapes well. It had a very wide head at the top, and large black almond-shaped eyes, where one could not discern either white or pupil, they were uniformly black. It had two very small nostrils but without a marked nose, the lips very thin and ill-defined, just a small slit in the face. It had very small ears located lower on the head than in humans. It was disproportionate in everything: arms really too long, without muscle, ending in very long hands, with 6 fingers. (she counted them several times) The thumb was still exactly where the human hand has one. So there was a thumb and 5 fingers on each hand. The neck seemed very fragile, without tonus, too thin, and the shoulders very drooping, but a rather rounded belly. But the thighs were clearly overdeveloped, the legs of the entity resembled more those of a very trained athlete, muscular. The feet were small, too small in relation to the body. The witness was shocked, and something really strange was happening, because the two dogs lay down, as if they were going to fall asleep. She was thus looking at the entity, and it was returning her gaze, but suddenly the humanoid started to run and this is the most extraordinary part of the observation. It ran exactly like a Thompson gazelle, with lightness and jumping. Mrs. Francovich did not hesitate, but started to run with him, side by side, accompanied by the dogs, over a certain distance. Until the moment when dense vegetation formed a kind of tunnel. The entity jumped into it and disappeared. Mrs. Francovich wanted to follow him, but she entered into "a wall of stench" horrible, like a mixture of sulfuric acid and formaldehyde. This stench really formed like "a wall", while Mrs. Francovich's nostrils seemed to be burned. She immediately knew (vog: how did she know this?) that other entities were there and she knew that they were waiting for her. But she shouted "OOOPS!" and accompanied by the dogs she ran until she was out of breath in the opposite direction, certainly over a distance of two kilometers.

A young driver was near Wylandville around 10 pm when she saw a creature moving on the slope of the nearby hill. She stopped when the creature descended and crossed the road. In the headlights, she saw that it was 7 to 8 feet tall, walking on two legs, covered in dark bristly fur. The creature looked like a monkey and had long arms. It was followed by a similar creature, then two smaller ones, perhaps 5 feet tall. This sight scared the witness, who turned around and drove away full speed. (NABIN, Mark Francis)

A woman reported seeing in a field near her house two creatures, with amber-colored eyes, wearing some kind of computer equipment, which one of them operated. They glided across the ground without apparent effort. (Note from vog: what was the actual height of the vegetation in this field?) (Mufon, Mufonet BBS 11.3.1993)

Canada, Elk County, PA.
Three men were camping near the entrance of the State Game Lands when they heard a series of strange noises in the night. They then shone the torchlight in the direction of the vocalizations and saw the legs of a furry bipedal creature, covered in 6 inches of shiny black fur. One of the witnesses took out his camera to try and take a picture, but the flash apparently scared the creature, which ran off towards the river, "crying". It then seemed like there was a "response" from a second creature coming to meet the first. The witnesses did not see the second creature, but deduced its presence from what seemed to them to be a duet of vocalizations. The sound was loud, extended, and high-pitched. As soon as the witnesses saw the "legs" they climbed up into their truck and saw the huge creature facing them. They stayed there for another hour after the creature's disappearance.

Between 7 pm and 7:30 pm, Mr. E. Carette and his cousin Mrs. V.U. made an entirely atypical observation from the balcony on the 11th floor. In a clear sky without clouds, there were two generally rectangular, black, matte, irregular shapes and between these two large shapes, at the top of the larger one and towards the left, three smaller shapes. No visible structure, not even when looking through binoculars and apparently no movement. The smallest of the three small shapes was much larger than the size of a tourist plane. By the time they went to get a camera to immortalize this vision, everything had disappeared. (Investigation by Michel Bry for the Sobeps)

At 4:25 in the morning, the witness saw to the west of his route, a flashing red light. He had the impression of seeing a "ham" flying... At the closest to this thing, the witness stopped the car and saw it hovering above a vineyard. Under the red light, and seeming not to be attached to it, there was a large dark rectangular shape, the length of a jumbo jet. The sides seemed to be made of rubber inflated with air, like inflatable boats, or like the lower edge of a hovercraft. This thing remained stationary for 3 good minutes, then there was a flash of blue light, the object slowly moved in the direction of south, towards Perth.

GARZA: I don't know if it inspired American filmmakers, but for three years in a row, on September 16th 1992, 1993 and 1994, the parade was disrupted. In 1992 a formation of fighter planes was flying over Mexico City, when an oval disk emerged from behind the clouds to overtake the planes. Everyone saw it. The parade was being broadcast live on television, and everyone had a moment of hesitation. Everyone understood that it was a UFO, because on this special day of the parade, all other air traffic is forbidden. (article by Jan Hertoghs in the magazine HUMO of 24.9.1996)

USA, Elk River
"Around midnight I took the wheel and headed north, at the junction of highways 94 and 494 I saw three huge balls of light descending from the sky to the northeast of Rogers and the Elk River. They came one after the other, the second following exactly the trajectory of the first. I continued my journey on the 94 and at the exit of Rogers I took the direction of Elk River. Through the dark clouds, I still saw the formation of the three balls, whose lights were flashing all together. Two and a half miles away I had the surprise of my life. Suspended above a less wooded area, there was this UFO, the size of an airliner. It had a circular plate, with a smaller dome on top. The outlines were dark, and I did not see any lit portholes. On the other hand, the ventral part had on the contour, four regularly spaced white lights. Between the whites small green and red ones alternated one after the other. Behind the large white lights, there were always two green lights, and behind the two greens, another red one. It was a beautiful machine, completely motionless, making no noise. The lights were on all the time. It was beautiful, but also frightening at the same time. It was raining, the wind was blowing in gusts. It's strange, but the rain seemed to stop just above the object. Moreover, no drop was flowing from it. This thing seemed to defy all the forces of nature: gravity, wind and rain. (...) After such an experience, one becomes silent, one feels small, as if still living in the age of stone.

The witness, a nurse who wishes to remain anonymous, was in the bathroom around 4:45 in the morning. She saw three huge lights hovering less than two meters above the ground, above the neighbor's garden. The lights had a diameter of at least 50 cm and were spaced 3 to 4 meters apart, with a third one offset upwards. The witness then went to the kitchen and came out to get a better look. The lights had changed position and were sending a wide beam into the street. The beam was still there and the phenomenon had gone. The whole incident lasted 15 seconds. She remains shocked, having no explanation for this very frightening observation. (...) (Terry Townsend, Princeton) (The Elk River Star News of September 23, 92, journalist: Joni Astrup)

After two weeks of multiple sightings, no less than 22 close encounters were reported to the police in the night. Panic spread throughout the region. Most of the sightings took place above the Bonnybridge moor. Isabelle Slogett of Leapark Drive recounts: "My daughter Carol and I saw a UFO land right in front of us. An opening appeared in the saucer and we heard a sound like coming from a cave. I started screaming and running, terrified." The daughter, Carol, 31 years old, explains: "As I wanted to take a picture of it, there was a huge flash of light. When we went back into the house, the thing was hovering in the sky. All the neighbors saw it. This is confirmed by George Wilson, 43 years old, businessman: "We were a dozen near the cooperative and we saw the UFO above the moor. I have no intention of causing hysteria: if you have an explanation for all these sightings, I would be happy to hear it." (The Sunday Mail - Glasgow of November 8, 1992 - Ufo News Story)

Benjamin, 9 years old, in bed, couldn't sleep because it was so hot. "I got up to get some air at the window of my room. It was 3 o'clock in the morning, I looked at my alarm clock. I hadn't turned on the light in the room. When I got to the window (the street lamps turn off at 11 pm) I saw above the old quarry (about 300 m from the house) a very black object coming above the fir trees. It was moving slowly, horizontally, lying on its side. It was wide and you could see the whole face, from the bottom or the top, I don't know. It had a triangular shape with rounded corners. You could see it well because its color was darker than the sky. When it reached the top of the fir trees it stopped. The whole base was lit up with red lamps and in the center of the base, a big white spotlight the same color as the lamp in the kitchen. It stood up in a vertical position. It was very big. The big spotlight lit up part of the fir trees. I saw a lot of lines on the visible face, it looked like drawings. I didn't see anything else on the object. In any case there were no windows and I didn't hear any noise." After staying still for a while it lay back down slowly still on its side and left very quickly above the woods to the right. "I wasn't scared. I just wondered what it could be since it didn't look like an airplane. I observed this thing for about 1 minute." The young witness stayed very quiet about his observation, not even talking to his friends at school. (Inforespace n° 86 p. 38 to 40)

Ginat Aharoni, a young woman in her twenties, lives in her house in the town of Tel Mond, about 5 km from Kadima. She was driving towards the Netanya station on an isolated and unlit road, around 8 pm. Near the village of Tel Yitzhak, a very bright object passes over her car, about 30 meters above. More surprised than terrified, Ginat notes that the thing measures 13 to 15 m in diameter, and has a belt of about twenty orange lights that seem to rotate around the thing in the opposite direction of the clock hands. She also notes that the lights turn on one after the other, giving the impression of movement in the darkness. The observation only lasts about ten seconds. During this time the object seemed to land along the Tulkarem-Netanya road. Immediately after the village of Kfar Yonah, that is what it does, for a minute, while cars stop or slow down to get a better look.

At 6 in the morning Carmel Zsiporet was awoken by "something". She went outside and saw a UFO on the ground 50 m away from her. The UFO had the shape of an orange container and was silver in color. On its perimeter there were 18 lit square windows. Five vertical beams of light were coming from the object towards the sky. Suddenly, as if materialized, a second object appeared, identical in shape and size. Their size was 5 x 6 m. Next to the first UFO, Zsiporet saw an entity of about 2 to 2.50 m tall, covered in an overall of metallic-looking aluminum color. It wore a kind of short "beekeeper's cape" and its features were not visible. A conversation, apparently telepathic, started and to Zsiporet's question "why don't you take that thing off your face", the entity's answer in Hebrew was "Kakha zeh" = "This is the way". Zsiporet felt compelled to go back inside the house and when she came out the objects and the entity had disappeared.

At 2:20 two gendarmes saw a flying phenomenon with a beam of light at the front. At first they took it for an airplane preparing to make a forced landing. But the phenomenon, which left a luminous trail, suddenly stopped and remained stationary for several seconds. The gendarmes approached in a car and from then on the craft seemed to be elongated with something like rectangular portholes strongly illuminated along a fuselage. At a certain moment there was something like a kind of nebulousness under the craft and when another car arrived, the phenomenon disappeared on the spot. (Lumières dans la Nuit, No. 318 p. 4 + sketch) Around 2 o'clock in the morning, unusual luminous formations were seen by many people over nine French departments: Gironde, Charente, Haute Vienne, Haute Loire, Ardèche, Isère, Rhône, Loire, Esonne.

("The Return of the Angels" - UFOs in Israel, Past and Present - Barry Chamish) It was not until the summer that Mara's story was discovered. Indeed, Mara's husband, Torbatian, told the neighbor that they were thinking of moving, as their house was "haunted". He told that his wife heard voices and strange knocks on the walls, and that he heard them too. It was Torbatian who discovered a flattened grass circle with four indentations in the garden. The circle was 4.30 m in diameter, and the indentations were respectively 325 cm., 245 cm., 270 cm. and 290 cm. This Russian couple was now totally convinced that they had had "visitors". On April 24th, at half past midnight, the house was shaken by a "bang" so powerful that the 150 kilo air conditioning unit was dislodged from the wall. At first they thought it was due to an airplane passing the sound barrier. Half an hour later, another "bang" accompanied by frenzied barking from the neighbor's dog. The couple called the police, who came to the scene, and could not give any explanation: they saw with their own eyes the fall of the apparatus and heard the barking. During the following months, Mara distinctly heard voices, not in her head, but as if coming from the walls, calling her by her childhood name "Come with us, Marishka. Come with us". That was too much: the couple left Kadima and had no more contact with the neighbors or the ufologists who had come to investigate.

At 3 o'clock in the morning, Batya Shimon was woken up by lights outside, which she saw in her room. Batya Shiman is a middle-aged woman, not at all attracted to the paranormal. However, hearing a terrible noise in her living room, she jumped out of bed. Upon arriving in her living room, she saw, facing her, about twenty creatures; Batya wanted to scream, but no sound came out of her mouth. The creatures were tall, more than two meters, wearing neon-like bright clothes, round faces, small noses, a thin and circular small mouth, bald heads, but they had brown eyebrows. Believing she was dreaming, the lady went back to bed. Upon waking up the next morning, she found all the doors open, but nothing had been stolen. A kind of yellow sand was spread in the kitchen and in the bathroom, and had a smell of "phosphorus". It was then that she spoke of her nocturnal encounter to her husband. He himself had been woken up by lights, but he also thought he was dreaming, turned over to the other side and fell asleep again. The following night, at three o'clock in the morning, Batya is woken up by an intense light coming from the kitchen window. She gets up and looks out the bedroom window: from the sky, a large object in the shape of a mushroom with a lit door arrives. The light from this door touches her shoulder and she feels it like a punch. Her memory stops here, then she sees herself lying in bed looking at a large visitor, who was slowly passing his hand over her husband's head and she received a telepathic message saying "we do not want to harm you". While this great being is in the room, another one visits all the rooms floating in a standing position. His feet did not touch the ground. They both looked like the creatures observed the previous night, and this time she noticed more details. Their hands were like human hands, their skin that of albinos, their white clothes shone like neon and stuck to the body. Suddenly, the being who was visiting the place came back into the bedroom gesturing as if to make the other one come and see. They disappeared into the couple's son's room and stayed looking fascinated at the fish in the aquarium. All this only lasted a few minutes, the light went out, everything was over, but the next day again the doors were open, there was the same kind of sand, and the same smell. "Once they saw the fish, they seemed very excited," she said. And right after they left. (The Return of the Angels; UFO in Israel, Past and Present - Barry Chamish)

At around 10:30 pm, a farmer who had visited a single friend was returning home through the fields. His farm was only 400 meters away as the crow flies. First, the two witnesses saw a large, unusual star. Then, the farmer in the meadow saw an object very close, passing at an elevation of 30°, very quickly. "It looked like a minibus with lit windows. It arrived like a car's headlight, then it looked like a minibus." The witness heard a small noise, like that of a quiet electric motor. The object flew southeast and went out.

Opening her eyes, she then saw this strange creature, leaning over her, looking at her. In her head she heard a voice saying "Do not be afraid, I mean you no harm." The creature then circled around the bed, taking a glance around the room (note from vog: to estimate the price of the furniture?) The being was very tall, more than two meters, slim and bald. It had round and luminous eyes, the face was round as well and showed a friendly expression. The whole adventure lasted only a few minutes. "For the rest of the night, my body was itching and I was scratching everywhere" (note from vog: flea bag?) Two hours later, she got up, went to the balcony and saw two circles of flattened grass in the lawn. "The next day, talking to a neighbor, I learned that a lot of people had seen a UFO in the night. Everyone was talking about it."

It was about 10 pm when B.R., alone in his small trailer that served as his camp, was about to go to bed. (...) Suddenly he distinguished through the windows of his modest installation, a strange light floating 2 m from the ground and heading towards him. A bit worried, the witness remembers that there is no road in this place that could lead one to believe that the headlights of a vehicle could be the source of this light. Intrigued by what he observes, the witness concentrates his attention on the dimensions of the light, which he estimates to be 3 m in diameter. The weather is foggy and visibility is not very good. (...) The light seems to move in his direction in a zigzag. As the object gets closer and closer to the witness, the latter perceives a curious intermittent sound, whose cadence is regular and which seems to come from the object. (...) Fear then begins to take hold of the young man, who now suspects that something worrying is approaching dangerously close to him. The intensity of this emotion increases as the light approaches, to the point where the witness now only desires one thing: to flee, to leave this cursed place at all costs! While he plans to go outside to escape with the company truck, the sound and the white light that the object seems to emit become even more menacing. The light is now almost above the trailer and communicates such fear to the witness that he is unable to do anything, he is literally frozen in place. Terrified, the man waits, huddled in his torpor. (...) After what seemed like interminable seconds, the witness finds himself inexplicably lying over the blankets of his bed, completely dressed! (...) he then realizes that it is only the light of the sun that filters through the windows of the trailer: (it is day). (Jean THOMAS: "Synthèse Ovni" ed. Louise Cousteau 1999, p. 133, 134)

#June 1993
Italy, near Pescara
One of the most spectacular observations was made from a helicopter, by a crew of five men, all belonging to the fire brigade of Pescara. About 7 km from the airport, while they were at an altitude of 500 meters, the men observed something that seemed to be on a collision trajectory with their aircraft. The object measured 1 m in diameter, with two "legs" and a trapezoidal antenna on what could resemble a head. Panicked, the pilot veered to the right to avoid the object and made contact with the control tower. The controllers had nothing on the screen, but asked the helicopter to take the intruder in pursuit. The chase began. After 3 minutes, the humanoid turned towards the aircraft, seeming to look at it with large black eyes, then made two complete circles around the helicopter before diving towards the ground and disappearing.

Italy, Calabona beach (Sassari)
(Investigation by Antonio Cuccu of CISU - Itufor 10.7.95) Around 9 pm a dozen people observed for two or three minutes a strange object above the beach. It was a four-year-old child who saw it first, asking his father and a hotel bartender to "catch that balloon" for him. A group of hotel tourists were thus able to observe the phenomenon: round, black, hovering at about thirty meters. A kind of short rope seemed to hang down, which at first made it look like a balloon. But its shape changed, becoming oblong and irregular, then it began to undulate in the air, then disappeared from their sight. The people ran down the stairs four at a time to continue the observation from the street. The object became bigger and bigger, and changed shape again, becoming like a helicopter with a pulsing red light on top. Suddenly it shot off towards the southwest and was lost from sight in a few seconds.

Australia, Belgrave (Melbourne)
Night of 7th to 8th August. Kelly Cahill and Andrew (pseudonym) observed a bright light in front of them, the width of the road: it was an object violently lit at the neck. Andrew stopped the car and both occupants got out to take a closer look. At 100 m from their position, another car also stopped. While they were looking at the object, a group of large black silhouettes with red eyes approached them, floating above the ground. Kelly fell to the ground, blinded and nauseous. Then she probably lost consciousness. Later she noticed a red triangular mark near her navel and a small incision in her stomach skin resembling those after a laparoscopy. She bled from her vagina for 3 and a half weeks, and at the hospital an infection was detected. (Mufon UFO Journal, November 1996, P. 10 - 11)

Australia, Belgrave (Melbourne)
Night of the 7th to 8th of August. The other witnesses of this encounter were three people: Bill, an entrepreneur, his wife Jane, and a nurse Glenda. These people arrived at the scene (but they were driving in the opposite direction) and they were all feeling sick: nausea. The driver lost control of his vehicle and stopped against a pole along the road. At that moment two cars passed on the road, one of them had Kelly and Andrew on board? The trio saw the same kind of creatures, heard a buzzing sound and then their memories stopped. The driver, in addition, was blinded. Afterwards marks were found in different places on the women's bodies, and Glenda and Jane also had the small triangular mark near their navel. (...) (Mufon UFO Journal, November 1996, P. 10 - 11)

Belgium, Raeren
Armand, 45 years old and already retired from Belgacom due to lead poisoning, made an observation in the Raeren Woods near the Venn Kreuz. (Note from vog: I quote the case taken up in VOB 2, SOBEPS 1994, p. 95 with a color illustration 1.38, but I personally do not add any credibility to it. Indeed, when from 1992 to 1995 I was in charge of the Sobeps investigations, I found in the files a good dozen of observations from this witness, manifestly hallucinating due to his illness).

Belgium, Bassilly
At around 6 pm, the witnesses and their 4-year-old daughter first witnessed an incredible display of lights, then around 6:25 were flown over by a square object, accompanied at a distance by 3 glowing balls that, like cyclists, "took turns". The square object was so big that it filled the entire window of the sunroof. The witnesses, seeing this and arriving in the village where family members lived, honked to get them out and got out of the stopped vehicle themselves. The dark square, lit up in a blurry way, continued on its trajectory and after 8 seconds disappeared in place. It flew along a north-south axis, one side at the front, this side slightly higher than the back, so canted. (personal investigation by vog)

#1993, October 25
Belgium, Manage
At around 5:30 PM, Olivier C. saw a large, stationary light point in the direction of the north. He didn't pay it any attention. At around 6:50 PM, while driving to Familleureux, he saw a cigar-shaped object straight ahead of him. On the underside, three white lights were dimming and brightening in intensity, pulsing slowly. A red light was blinking near one of the white lights. He got out of the car: the object was 7 cm in size at arm's length. The object seemed to be moving very slowly towards Feluy (NE). He observed it with 12x50 binoculars and thought he saw a horizontal line on the upper part. The object was the same grey color everywhere. After 10 minutes, the witness continued on his way. Passing by the same spot on his way back from Familleureux, he saw two people at Pont Looza looking up at the sky, between 7:15 and 7:30 PM. The witness stopped his car, turned off the engine, and got out. That's when he found himself right underneath an immense diamond-shaped craft. "It was there, right above me. At an altitude of 200 m, no more. Each light had a diameter equal to the length of a car. Each light had the size of a car, can you imagine? At arm's length? Impossible to tell you the size, I should have spread my arms to the maximum (at the inquiry this was 110 cm). It was very close, you know. I'm sure that if this object had been on the ground, it would have been the size of the field next to my house (1 ha). On the ground, each light must have been the size of a house! Three white lights arranged in a triangle, they weren't quite in the corners of the diamond. Near two of the white lights was a dark green light. They were small. When the white lights dimmed and the blinking red light went out, I could see green reflections on the structure. It had a metallic look, clear. The surface was like galvanized sheet metal, embossed, a bit like the sheets on car ramps on tow trucks." The object emitted a sound, a bit like the sound of a washing machine in the last phase of draining the water, before spinning. This sound wasn't constant and varied in intensity. This sound seemed to come from everywhere at once. The craft was moving very slowly, but not in a straight line, it was like a car swerving from the back, to one side and then the other. The slowness of the movement prompted the witness to go home so his wife could also observe this thing. He started the car, made a U-turn, and when he looked up through the windshield, the object had disappeared and he never saw it again. After calculations, the dimensions of the diamond must have been between 80 and 100 m in altitude and its dimensions must have been 150 x 75 m and a thickness of 24 m.

#November 3, 1993
Belgium, Grand-Rechain-Stockis
Nicolas T., 12 years old, was alone at home around 6 pm. "I was sitting in the living room armchair. I was angry because my brother had gone to the neighbors and didn't want to play with me. Suddenly, I had my gaze drawn to a light through the curtains of the first living room window. So I looked through the window of the second window and saw a huge triangular-shaped craft pass in front of the house, from left to right, very slowly. It seemed to be following the road towards Xhendelesse (west). I clearly saw its triangular shape against the sky background and it seemed to me that the corners were rounded. The surface of the triangle was not smooth, but like grid-marked by some kind of reliefs or slats, which I couldn't see the exact shape of. In the center there was a big, round white light that shone brightly. There were also three smaller red lights, one in each corner. At the front, almost at the tip, there was a blue light. I was scared because this object was big, bigger than a house and it was flying very low, about one and a half times the height of the streetlight in front of the house. It emitted a sound that I can compare to a light purring, a bit like a dishwasher running at low speed. The television was off. If it had been on I wouldn't have heard the sound of this object. It was moving slowly, I think I could have followed it on a bike, but suddenly it accelerated sharply, so quickly that in three seconds maybe, it disappeared hidden by a tree. If I remember correctly, at the moment of acceleration, the white light in the middle went out. The passage of this craft lasted maybe fifteen seconds. I'm sure it wasn't an airplane. It was huge and very close to the house. I was very scared." (Inforespace n° 89 p. 19 and 20)

Belgium, Villers le Bouillet
Between 9:35 and 9:40 PM, Mrs. A. and her 16-year-old daughter were driving the cat to an annex at the back of the garden, as they did every night. Mrs. A. had a flashlight, as usual. "When we were two-thirds of the way there, we saw in the starry sky, airplanes but also two bright points: one red and one green, one above the other at a very high altitude. They seemed motionless. When we reached the shed, we saw three red lights in a triangular formation and a green light in the middle of the top, slightly below the red light at the tip. The formation was standing on its base, it was not very big (4 m on each side). None of these lights were illuminating. They were the size of a tennis ball. They were above the young maples, about 20 m from us and about ten meters in altitude. It was gliding towards us. And then we were in the dark. It was 4 m high and 6 m from us. We were in absolute darkness. My daughter was stiff with fear. We were motionless, as if paralyzed. Then the object suddenly stopped and at the same time it emitted a sound. Ah, that sound. It was not like an engine sound, it was a monotonous sound. Just before it stopped, the green light seemed to detach itself while still attached, as if by an elastic of the same brightness reaching a length of 80 to 100 cm. Just before it had become a bit brighter and a bit bigger. Mrs. A. shone the flashlight: towards the object the light did not come out of the lamp, towards the ground, the lamp illuminated. When the sound stopped, suddenly the object was no longer there: the sound and the object had disappeared simultaneously. Side effects: the young girl had stiffness in her legs and afterwards, she would have had greater ease in studying the so-called exact sciences (chemistry, math) (Inforespace No. 89 p. 17, 18 and important personal documentation of vog.)

#1993
Ireland, Armagh
Eight SAS (Special Air Service) soldiers, specially trained for tough and difficult missions, were in ambush in the early hours of the morning, to flush out armed IRA militants. They were near an IRA weapons cache, on the slope of a hill south of Armagh. When they observed a brief flash of light in the sky, but didn't pay much attention to it. Suddenly, within rifle range, they encountered four gray-skinned, small-sized extraterrestrials. For a few minutes they observed each other warily, then the extraterrestrials left. The soldiers were so affected by this encounter that they all together decided to leave their observation post. Their commander was furious when hearing this story and the other officers suspected them of being drugged. Only four years later, the story resurfaced and was published in "The People" on July 13th, 1997, by Joe Brady. (source Michael Lindemann Email CNINews1 at aol.com)

#1994, January 28
France, Taverny
At 1:14 pm an object in the shape of a bell was observed by the crew of a bus stop, while it appeared on the radar screen in the underground bunker of the Air Force in Taverny. (Paris Match of 13.2.1994 page 36) 1.3Vol Air France AF 3532 (January 28, 1994) Jean-Charles Duboc (P), captain of the Air France AF 3532 flight, providing the Nice-London connection on January 28, 1994, is assisted by Valérie Chauffour, co-pilot (CP). At 1:14 pm, while they are cruising at an altitude of 1,900 m, around Coulommiers in Seine-et-Marne, in excellent meteorological conditions, the head steward, then present in the cockpit, reports a phenomenon that appears to be a weather balloon. His observation is immediately confirmed by the co-pilot. P, who sees it in turn, initially thinks it is an airplane turning at 45 degrees of inclination. Very quickly, however, all three agree to note that what they see does not resemble anything they know. Excellent visibility and the presence of altocumulus allow P to estimate that the phenomenon is at an altitude of 10,500 m and at a distance of about 50 km. Given its apparent diameter, they deduce that the craft is of large size. They are struck by the changes in shape of the craft that first appears to them in the form of a brown bell, before transforming into a brown-brown lens, and then disappearing on the left of the aircraft almost instantly, as if it had suddenly become invisible. (...) This radar track, which was recorded for 50 seconds, crosses the trajectory of flight AF 3532 and does not correspond to any flight plan filed. It should be noted that the phenomenon disappears at the same time from the view of the crew and the radar scopes. The investigations carried out by the CODA allow both to exclude the hypothesis of the weather balloon and to know the precise distance of crossing of the two trajectories and consequently to reduce to 250 m the approximate size of the craft. It should be noted that the North Regional Air Navigation Center (CRNA), which handles 3,000 movements per day, has instructed only three cases, including that of flight AF 3532, in the last seven years.

Between 7:15 and 7:18 when the witness left her home on foot to go to the school where she teaches, it was still dark and the sky was starry. To her great surprise, a luminous phenomenon was just above the path she had to take, 45 m away from her. Compared to the height of the public lighting post, she estimated the altitude of the phenomenon to be 100 m. It appeared as an alignment of 4 round luminous balls, three white and one red. They were all the same size, about 5 to 6 mm at arm's length, and they were separated from each other by an apparent space of about 1.20 m, the whole making 5 m. The contour of these balls was well defined. She continued to walk "in her little shoes" and passed under this phenomenon, there was total silence, a little further on a dog suddenly started to bark, which scared her even more. She passed this phenomenon at 100 m before turning around: there was nothing left. (investigation by J. Dersin/L.Maetens for the Sobeps).

At around 9:15 PM, Mrs. B., who had been walking the dog, met her neighbor at the doorstep. As they discussed various topics, Mrs. B. had the curious feeling of a presence above her. She looked up and saw a strange phenomenon which she asked her neighbor to observe. Vertically above the vacant lot in front of them, at 70 meters away, a large luminous object flew very low (between 40 and 50 meters in altitude). It was composed of a kind of crown of a multitude of yellowish-white luminous points similar to portholes. There must have been about thirty of them. Each luminous point seemed to be separated from the next by a kind of post. Clearly below, three red lights arranged in a triangle blinked quite quickly. The brightness of the whole was quite strong but did not light up the surroundings which were flown over at a speed of about 30 km/h in the direction of NNE. After about twenty seconds, the phenomenon disappeared behind the trees. (Investigation by Guy BLESER for the Sobeps)

Mrs. Hermant and her companion made an observation in three stages late in the evening. First, an immobile light in the sky attributed to an airplane, but intriguing after 10 minutes. The light was filmed with an Explorer zoom x 8 camera, a common commercial video cassette, taking a shot of the immobile thing, sequence duration 3 minutes. In the foreground there were two white lights in an oblique position and immobile, in the background two small red lights, all forming a trapezoid, wide base towards the back. The witnesses did not see how the phenomenon disappeared because the camera battery was flat, so they connected to the network. At that time the phenomenon had disappeared. They thought they saw it in the distance and continued to film... "Sirius" low on the horizon. (investigation by Yves Mine and Vog for the Sobeps - film document deposited at the ERM-Brussels by Patric Ferryn - no more news of this film, why? On July 7, 1997, Lucien Clerebaut from the Sobeps called me to find out what had happened to this film, of which he had no memory.... the witness demands his property back... normal, after 3 years of silence from the Sobeps...)

Around 11 pm the witness went to his sheepfold, as some of the sheep were about to lamb. As he left the house he heard a loud whistling, like a propeller cutting through the wind. This noise came from the power pole in his field. Thanks to the electric lighting in the back of the garden, he then saw some kind of very dark disk spinning on itself and making this curious noise. It measured about 5 m in diameter. It started to move and some kind of lit-up portholes with a whitish light inside appeared under the craft, which was only 10 m in altitude. The witness had the impression that this thing had a very thin thickness. It moved away, turning in one direction and then the other, about a hundred meters, and came back towards the witness who went back inside to call his wife and daughter and get a gun. When they came out the phenomenon was moving away towards Lamormenil and the witness's wife and daughter only saw the white lights. (Investigation by Michel Warnier for the Sobeps)

The witness, an amateur painter, left his home in Rosyth to go to Craigluscar with the intention of taking some photos of the site to help him paint a picture of the place. Going around the retention basins, the witness heard a strange buzzing sound at the foot of the high-tension lines, then suddenly felt unwell. Turning around, he saw an aircraft made of a metallic material and estimated its diameter to be 15 m. The witness said that he felt at that moment immobilized, as if drained of his energy. He was unable to take any photos of the object at its closest point, even though he had his camera in hand. It was only once the object had moved away that he took two shots, one showing a saucer shape and the other a tiny point on the horizon. The phenomenon disappeared in a flash. ("UFO Files" - ed.

A young couple in a car were intrigued by the appearance of a light configuration above a house. They stopped the car, turned off the engine and the young man got out. He observed 3 immense red light sources, each with a diameter of 1.20 m, arranged in a triangle of 6 m side, one of the sides of the triangle was diffuse. This whole thing was just above the roof of a house, 20 or 25 m from the witness and was stationary emitting a low frequency low buzzing sound. At the moment of the sudden departure of this thing, the sound almost increased to a shrill whistle. Total duration of the observation: 10 seconds. (investigation by Yves Mine for SOBEPS)

(Renzo Cabassi) Two different observations alerted the CISU. At 4:30 pm, two men on board a Zenair 70 type ULM, flying at 200 or 250 feet altitude at a speed of 80 mph, observed a small sphere that reflected the sunlight, flying horizontally, at about the same altitude as them, but 6 km away. The mysterious object suddenly disappeared after 5 or 6 seconds of observation. (Italian Ufo Reporter, 10.10.96, Paolo Toselli - CISU)

#1994, March 6
Italy, Mutria Mountains
The next day's newspaper "Il Tempo" reported that a mysterious flying object had crashed in the Mutria Mountains around 4 pm that afternoon and that search efforts were still underway. These searches were carried out by rescue teams and the army, using helicopters. Angelo Giambattista, 18 years old, is one of the key witnesses. He was returning home to Guardiaregia, facing the Mutria Mountain between 2 pm and 2:20 pm. He saw a black object coming from the east and falling onto the mountain, bouncing. He called his father, a policeman and former air force officer, telling him that an airplane had crashed. His father, Franco, quickly went out and saw two dark shadows in the snow in a ravine 100 meters from the Mutria peak. Through binoculars he saw an oval-shaped object sunk in the snow and 30 meters away a kind of black fuselage, with a vertical tail and a series of portholes. So Franco called the carabinieri. They arrived around 4 pm and saw the wreckage. It took them another 90 minutes to cordon off the area, place a powerful beacon. Around 8 pm eight volunteers began climbing the wooded mountain in the night, while two helicopters helped with the search. At 1 am the men arrived in the ravine. Even being in the exact spot of the wreckage, they found nothing! In fact, from Guardaregia, people no longer saw the wreckage in the snow either. IN REALITY: in May 1995, the court asked for and obtained that Franco be fined heavily, for "foolishly reporting a supposed airplane accident mobilizing the civil protection and the army"....

Germany, in Mecklenburg
(source: Dr. Johannes Fiebag's conference, Germany) Carole is 36 years old and lives in a small village in Mecklenburg. It was around 11 pm and the children were already asleep. She was getting ready to go to bed herself. As she was heading to her bedroom, she felt strange, as if someone was watching her through the windows. Everything was dark in the garden. She suddenly panicked and ran to her bed. When the fear had subsided a bit, she heard a strange, light humming. Again scared, she wanted to sit up to listen better, but she couldn't move. She then saw several small, gray silhouettes at the foot of the bed. It seemed like they were talking about her. There were also two of these silhouettes near her 15-month-old son's bed. Her fear for her child was indescribable. She wanted to scream to call her daughter, but she couldn't make any sound. At that moment she knew it was useless because she could hear her daughter whimpering in her sleep. Then suddenly, Carole was unable to see or hear anything. The most unpleasant thing was that her brain was blocked, unable to think of words or ideas. She doesn't know what happened that night to her family and to herself. (note from vog: does anyone really think this person physically saw these silhouettes and everything?)

A mother and her three children, on their way to school around 7:30, saw a strange object on the side of the road. At first it was like an immobile cloud, but they quickly realized it wasn't one. It had a strange shape (sketch: vaguely like the tank of a small concrete mixer, with the bottom ending in a point) and a color of blue-black, or maybe black. Then it went away to the north while the wind was blowing from the west. There was something on the top that seemed to be turning, the witnesses stopped to continue the observation. It went up into the clouds where it disappeared. It was the strangest thing ever observed by this family and every day when passing the same place, the witnesses still think about it.

In the drive of the Tumulus, Mrs. H.B. and her daughter, and further down the street, Mrs. B.M.M. were witnesses, around 10:15 pm, of the slow flight, close to the trees, of a bulky object equipped with lights, emitting a high-pitched turbine noise. This object was heading from south to north, where it was seen shortly after by Mr. M. in Rixensart. The shape of the object could not be defined, its apparent size was 40 cm and its thickness 4 cm. Its white circular lights arranged in a triangle seemed to be at the level of the mass of the object and a small fixed red light was in the center of the triangle formed by the white lights. In the mass, several other white lights seemed to be embedded. The noise made by the object was more deafening heard from inside the house than perceived from outside; it was continuous in frequency. Its speed was extremely slow: about 10 km/h. Unusual fact: about 3/4 of an hour after this observation, fighter planes flew over the region. (Investigation by Michel BRY for the Sobeps)

Mexico, Mexico City
(cf: September 16, 1993) In 1994 everyone was in front of their television wondering what was going to happen. Again, a UFO appeared in the middle of a formation of helicopters.
HUMO: In September 1994 they even had to close the Mexico airport for an hour because of a UFO flying low and slowly.
GARZA: Yes, a UFO was hovering at low altitude above the takeoff and landing strips. The control tower stopped all traffic. For the pilots this situation was untenable. They couldn't talk about UFOs, being bound by professional secrecy, and here a UFO was preventing their work. The union of professional pilots asked for military assistance and since then pilots dare to openly talk about their UFO sightings, like the incident where an enormous saucer crossed an airplane right in front of the landing strip, or that other incident where a UFO hit the landing gear of an airplane.

Suddenly the disc disappeared to reappear on the other side of the stretched cloud (CISU, NOTIZIE UFO n° 48)
July 24, 1994
Belgium, Lierneux
Testimony of Mr. A.C., witness of "crop-circles" during their formation:
"On July 24, 1994, I was in the Belgian Ardennes, near Lierneux, where I was spending a few days of vacation. The heat was scorching and there was not a breath of wind. The sky was blue without a single cloud and the sun shone intensely. Around 2:00 pm, while I was walking in the countryside with my dog, I stopped near a small pond surrounded by pines. A high-voltage line passes over the place. In front of me was a meadow and a little further to the left were thickets composed of small pines and very dense ferns, about 1.5 meters high. My dog bathed in the pond and as he was coming out I heard a whistling of wind in the high-voltage line. I thought that this wind would be welcome in this heat.
After more or less two seconds, I heard an appalling crash a little in front of me. It started with two sounds that are difficult to translate into writing, but which I compare a bit to two huge bundles of straw falling to the ground, that is, a dull sound. <br/><br/>This sound continued with a continuous sound of broken branches that lasted 2 or 3 seconds. I thought that a herd of cows was running in the thickets, crushing everything in its path. My reflex was to look for shelter to protect me from this herd. My dog flattened himself to the ground, out of fear. I looked in front of me but my field of vision was limited by the trees and I could only see the meadow in which the grasses were moving, 50 meters away from me. When the noise stopped, after 2 or 3 seconds, I noticed that I had not felt a single breath of wind. I went to see in the meadow where the grasses had moved. To the left of this place was the fence of the meadow and behind it the thickets composed of small scattered pines and ferns. I then noticed that the ferns were crushed in two places and that this formed two circles of about 10 meters in diameter. A distance of one meter separated the two circles. The most curious thing was that in this meter (of separation), the ferns were intact. The two circles were separated from the meadow by a distance of one meter of ferns, also intact. Two or three young pines were inside these circles but had no damage.
I went inside the circles and saw that the ferns were lying down and formed a carpet of more or less 10 cm in height. They were directed towards the outside of the circles, the center being however located closer to the meadow. I then left the place, supposing that I had witnessed a mini tornado and feeling a retrospective fear of what would have happened if I had been in that place. I could not explain how the ferns were intact around the circles, in the hypothesis of a mini tornado. A little later, thinking about this phenomenon, I thought that the whistling of the wind in the high-voltage lines resembled the whistling caused by a glider. Could there have been an accident with such a device? A glider could have crashed a little further! So I went back to the place and searched around without noticing anything abnormal."

Garry and Jenny, along with friends, were on board their boat. They saw an object come and slowly fly over the boat. It was huge, with a lot of blinking lights, but totally silent. The observation lasted at least 6 minutes, from the appearance of the object on the horizon to its disappearance behind the Kariba Mountains. Three people took photos, but there was nothing on the shots. The observation caused them all a feeling of fear and unease. From its appearance on the horizon, in a few seconds the thing was already above them where its flight seemed then slow. (UFO-Afrinews - July 1996, No. 14, p. 15)

Garza: On September 16th, 1994, again on the anniversary of our Independence, a kind of mothership landed with five smaller craft in a rural village: Metepec. All the inhabitants saw it and from the closest house to the craft on the ground Maria Cueva then filmed for one and a half minutes, a luminous creature that was near the craft.

In this small rural town, everyone was sleeping around 4:30 in the night of Saturday to Sunday. Except for the two year old youngest of Mrs. N.N. She often cries at night, so her mother gives her something to drink and usually that's enough for her to fall asleep again. Not this time. The little one said she was scared. Mrs. N.N. took her to put her to bed next to her father and then went back to see in the bedroom what could have scared the child. It was at this moment that she saw light through the curtains. "I moved them aside and it was really well lit, like in broad daylight. I opened the window to look, but there was only a big white round beam of light about 3 meters wide, widening slightly towards the ground, to make about 4 meters. I thought a neighbor was playing a joke on me, that he had invented a 'thing'. I thought it was strange and then I went back to my bedroom. There I also went to the window, it was also lit up there. I saw the same white beam of light at a distance of about 1.50 m from the window. I went back and forth from one room to the other to see: it was the same thing. I tried to wake up my husband (he had a serious motorcycle accident), but there was no way. I wanted to see what was happening, I didn't insist on waking him up.
The big white spotlight, from what I could see, was embedded like a spot. The white light could be compared to about ten halogen lamps, at least, all lit up together, so strong. It was as if panels were preventing the light from going elsewhere, it was really well directed towards the ground, a precise point. The light was transparent and did not spread beyond.
The white beam was about the size of my living room (3.20 m). It was huge and a little wider on the ground, but not much (4 m). There was a kind of dull, regular noise, like a vacuum cleaner and, from time to time, a sound like crumpled greaseproof paper. On either side of the spot, towards the house, there was also a small rectangle of red light, which did not light up the ground. It was neither too hot nor too cold, I slept with the window open. There was no smell, no wind, no pulsed air because the leaves of the trees did not move.
I saw two rounded points, one on each side of the house. The outline was well defined, of an aluminum color, shiny. It looked like a material that could be molded. It was smooth, regular and at least one meter thick above the spots. From the white spotlight at the back of the house, a transparent blue beam, like a telescopic device, descended in jerks. It was about 8 centimeters in diameter and it moved, without noise, towards the door at the end of the garden (length of the garden 12 m). I don't know if it touched that door, because from the bedroom I didn't see anything. This blue beam then retracted in one go, faster than it had developed. The total duration of this maneuver can be estimated at a short minute. Then I only saw a white ball of light leaving horizontally, it was going so fast. It was as if something was lit up inside, without illuminating the outside. When the object was 600 meters away I had the impression that it was going up and then I saw nothing more. The noise remained the same throughout the observation. It "left" with the craft". (investigation carried out on October 5th, 1994 by Mrs. Léonce Maetens and Mr. F. Brael. From his report it appears that the craft, because it was indeed a craft, measured 19 meters long and was only 4 meters from the witness).

Belgium, Kain (Tournai)
At 8:15 PM, with the car parked in the garage, Mr. K. saw three strange lights coming from the south-southwest, from the bottom of the garden above the woods, at about 35° elevation. The object approached and revealed to the astonished witness its unusual bell shape. Apparent dimension: 4 cm at arm's length between thumb and index finger, the bell flew with a large diameter towards the front. The object seen from the front was a bluish circle with a red light in the center, flanked on each side by a yellow-white light; seen from below: it was grayish blue, with a row of twinkling lights like a crown on the back edge, and a large red rear light; seen from the back: it was a grayish blue circle, with a twinkling luminous edge and a luminous red center.
Surprised, he shouted to his wife: "Quick, come and see a UFO!"
His wife and daughter came out and arrived in the garden at the moment when the phenomenon was above them and enjoyed the strange sight of the craft seen from below. They continued to follow this thing with their eyes, which they gradually saw on its back side until it disappeared hidden by the houses. When the phenomenon was closest, the witnesses heard a very light "Bzzt" like the sound produced by an air purifier. Estimated distance 250 m in altitude during the overflight. Duration of the observation: about 1 minute for Mr. K. and 30 seconds for his wife and daughter. Speed of the object: 110° of arc in 1 minute. Trajectory: from SSW to NNE.

In the morning, around 7:45 AM, EH saw from a window of his house in Burnaby a round and dark object. It must have been very close as its apparent size was larger than his outstretched hand. (...) EH went to another room to get a better view, and the object then turned around and slowly moved eastward, with a slight ascent. Seeing it from the side now, the witness noticed that the object was conical, flying with the tip pointing upwards. It had no lights and disappeared from sight around 8 o'clock.

On this night, around 3:45am, Ms. C.L.G. was unable to fall asleep, as is often the case. She got up, as she had seen a red light flanked by a blue one in the distance, which intrigued her. Ignoring the plane, which was what it was, she was surprised to see a bright orange bar appear low on the horizon, at an altitude she estimated to be "three times the height of a four-story building", or about fifty meters. She grabbed her binoculars and, barefoot despite the cold, went out onto the terrace to get a better look at this unusual thing. The bar approached slowly, and was at least twice the diameter of a full moon. Through the binoculars, Ms. C.L.G. could see nothing more. She leaned against the wall and the railing to keep the binoculars steady, but it was useless: she could only see this very bright orange bar. The thing was now no more than 100 meters away, yet in the quiet night she could not hear the sound of an engine... Suddenly, to her great surprise, the phenomenon made a sharp turn and rose, and she saw the bar transform into a uniformly orange triangle, with the center appearing a bit brighter and a bit more yellow. Very quickly, the thing gained altitude and disappeared from the witness's view, towards the southeast. (Archives and personal investigation by Vog)

The witness left the workshop (garage) and went into the kitchen, he looked at the time: 10:35 pm. His gaze was drawn to two strong stationary white lights above the highway, at a low altitude, estimated at that moment between 50 and 100 m. Used to the sight of planes taking off or landing at Zaventem, these fixed lights intrigued him and he went out to the terrace to get a better look. The immobility of the two lights lasted for some time. At one point, one of the lights began to approach - followed a few seconds later by the second. The witness did not have enough of his two eyes to contemplate the strange craft that flew over him: in shape it resembled a rhombus, with the largest diameter being the width, the shortest the length. In the direction of the width, the corners of the rhombus are cut off, the back of the craft is vaguely rounded. On the front two large headlights project a very strong, white light forward. The top of these crafts is vaguely domed, the rear edge is only 2 m thick. In the upper part of this rear edge there are about fifteen green and red flashing lights, there are also some on the sides; in the lower part of this edge there are separations - spacings, ventilations? The body of the craft is light gray, matte, smooth, without any other visible structure, the ambient light is reflected on it. There is no inscription either, the flying phenomena so low that if there had been any inscription the witness could have read it. Apparent dimension: 40 cm at arm's length. After calculation this gives 12 m wingspan, 7 m length and 2 m thickness. At the time of the flight, very muffled, a slight turbine noise is heard, however for the altitude, the noise is clearly "silent". They fly on a straight trajectory, at very low altitude, and at a speed of 80 to 100 km/h. Once over the witness they quickly disappear from his sight hidden by the building. The flight was very stable, "like on rails", without oscillation, without breath, but from the fixed point the start seems to have been progressive, the flight at constant speed without acceleration.

#1995, 6 January
Great Britain, near Manchester - in flight
At 18:48, Commander Roger Wills and co-pilot Mark Stuart aboard a Boeing 737 approaching Manchester Airport observed a triangular phenomenon of a size between that of a light aircraft and a medium-sized carrier. The plane was flying over the Pennines in northern England about 8 or 9 nautical miles southeast of Manchester, at 4000 feet. Wills was heading north at a speed of 180 to 210 knots. As he was above some tumuli, the crew saw the object cross their path to the right of the aircraft at very high speed and coming from the opposite direction. They were able to follow the object for several seconds through the right portion of the windshield, then through the side window. There was no sound or vibration perceptible. There was no radar echo of the object. (Phenomenon No. 31 - SOS OVNI, pp. 25, 26) Was it following this incident that the BBC received an order of silence to no longer broadcast any news about triangular objects?

(Source: Rudder rudder at delphi.com, spontaneous testimony of a pilot) "On Friday, January 27, at 12:45 AM, I was flying from Orlando to Sarasota. I had a sleeping passenger in the back and another, to my right, awake. We were about 30 nautical miles from Sarasota, I was flying at 3000 feet, the sky was clear without clouds, unlimited visibility. My ADF radio (low frequency) began to "pulse" instead of emitting its usual noise. At first I didn't pay attention to it. Then my aircraft was shaken, although nothing on the dashboard indicated a failure. I was looking towards the ground (towards the earth) when the cockpit was lit up by a violent green and white light. At 11 o'clock I saw an orange-red, oval object, maybe a quarter of a mile from us, and the size of a semi-trailer, about 50 feet long (16 to 17 meters). The object left a double trail, merging into one about a half mile behind it. It crossed my route quickly descending. My first impression was that of an airplane fuselage in flames that was going to crash in Sarasota.... But the object rose, without turning, and rose as quickly as it had descended, always rising above Sarasota, beyond the bay and then... it was gone. Vanished! By radio I immediately alerted the Tampa Approach Control, explaining to them what I had observed for about 5 seconds. Tampa had no radar echo of the thing. (NUFORC Listing, Jan. 95)

At around 8:10 PM, the 10-year-old girl suddenly ran into the house and excitedly began to describe the flying saucer she had just seen pass overhead with her older brother and two friends while they were jogging up the hill. The boys arrived shortly afterwards, accompanying their description with gestures, holding their arms out above their heads to indicate the size of the object, which made a noise "like the microwave". The children said they were engulfed in a white light, then the saucer hovered close to the ground a little further away. It rose up to go west, then south, quickly disappearing from their sight. When asked why the boys came back much later than the girl, they said they had to get dressed! They explained that they were sitting in the mud with their clothes neatly folded on the snow and that they had dressed to come back. This was certainly strange, given that it was freezing and the outside temperature was 20° Fahrenheit, especially since the boys had never in their lives "neatly folded" clothes....

Two truck drivers, on Route 136, 15 miles from the Dixie Brothers Truck Stop, had a strange experience around 6:30 PM. The lead truck suddenly slowed down, while the driver of the other truck didn't understand why. Both eventually stopped completely on the ramp. At that point they saw in the hazy sky, on the side of the highway, a strange, stationary phenomenon. It presented itself as a set of two or three (it is no longer certain how many) "vertical lines of light". The middle line was longer than the other two and had a different tone of color. The witnesses watched this phenomenon for 5 minutes, when the "line" in the middle ejected a cloud of red dots, and the entire phenomenon suddenly disappeared. The drivers had noticed that during the observation, the highway remained totally empty of traffic, but immediately after the disappearance of the unusual phenomenon, traffic on the road resumed.

Belgium, Glimes
This Tuesday evening around 7:20 PM, Chantal S. was driving to the Perwez Sports Center for a mini-football match. She was accompanied by her teammate Stéphanie M., 16 years old. After crossing the St Michel intersection in Glimes, at the intersection of Glimes and Thorembais les Béguines, shortly before the crossing of Rue du Chêne (in Thorembais les Béguines), the two athletes saw in the sky, at low altitude (approx. 30 m, equivalent to the height of two traditional houses) at low speed, a dark rectangular mass flanked by blue and red lights at the four corners and arranged in a quincunx. This strange object, seeming to come from the direction of Perwez, flew over them and disappeared in the direction of Dongelberg (south/north trajectory) without producing any noise that could have been heard in the car, which did not stop due to traffic.<br/><br/>
While Chantal S., at the wheel, continued her journey looking ahead and driving at a speed of about 80 km/h, Stéphanie had time to see the aircraft move away to her right, whose lights suddenly changed color (becoming green and yellow), without ever flashing. The carrier mass apparently had no thickness, was dark (gray-black) but was not perfectly flat, as she could distinguish some kind of pipes, but not completely detached from the platform (kind of bas-relief). The length was twice the width and compared to the road the wingspan was around 15 m. (investigation by Mr. Gérard GREDE for the Sobeps)

At 9:08 PM, Jonathan, 15 years old, entered the bathroom on the first floor and, in the darkness, observed an unusual light above the woods through the window. This light, which seemed unique and fixed, was yellow and not dazzling. Jonathan opened the window. The light approached and Jonathan observed that it was 4 lights in a horizontal line, the two strongest in the center, the two weakest at the ends were slightly set back. He discerned a carrier element of about 10 m in wingspan that he perceived as being gray or black. The object flew over the house and Jonathan rushed to the north facade where he saw the back of the carrier mass with a halo of light above and below. The whole moved with extraordinary ease and seemed to glide on the air. The lamps seemed to be curved and there was no other lighting at the back which appeared to him as a half circle. At the moment when the object approached and Jonathan opened the window, he perceived a vibrating hum that he compared to the sound of a powered speaker. This sound vibrated in his head and it seemed to him that it must be reflected throughout the house. According to Jonathan, this sound must contain infrasound which he had learned to know in school during physics. As it left, the object pivoted on its axis and changed direction with extreme ease. The headlights had beams that, according to Jonathan, must have carried about 20 m away. (investigation by Mrs. Claire HAUZEUR for the Sobeps)

At around 3pm, Kevin McCarthy, recently moved to the province, was drinking his coffee in the kitchen, admiring the mountainous landscape that borders Vancouver. Suddenly his attention was drawn to three dark objects, shaped like bats, slowly approaching above the valley. It took from 5 to 10 minutes for them to get as close to the witness as possible. Then two of these objects flew off to the east, the third coming right in front of Kevin who, in the meantime, had gone out to the porch with his camcorder. At the top the object had three very visible protuberances. It was apparently stationary and rotating. Kevin was not only stunned, but also felt anxious at the same time, not knowing very well why. The apparent size of the object, to the naked eye, was that of a dollar coin held at arm's length. At no point did this object reflect the sunlight, yet the day was clear and the sun was shining. During the investigation the details provided by Kevin allowed to calculate the altitude of this object, which must have been around 1100 to 1200 meters. There was no audible noise perceived. Kevin then saw that other people had their noses in the air and went to join them: it was Joanne, Gay and their 8 year old son. They were observing the object with binoculars. It was only when the object resumed its trajectory that Kevin realized he had not taken a single sequence, which he did promptly. The total duration of this observation was around 45 minutes.

At 5:30 PM Peter Hickie and his brother were driving on the A 52. An hour away from Willington to Swarkstone they saw to their right a large triangular object approaching their position. The object had 9 three-dimensional light panels, like cubes of white light on the underside of the craft. These blocks were so bright that it was difficult to make out the outlines of the object. They saw it when it was almost directly overhead: a kind of flying wing. They stopped and got out of the car for several minutes. The object was flying really slowly and it was incomprehensible that it didn't spread out. If it was a military plane, the witnesses couldn't understand why it was carrying its large light blocks on its underside to draw attention. As it was cold, they got back in the car and stayed to watch until the object disappeared behind a line of trees. (Omar FOWLER: "Phenomenon Research Association" - Derby - England)

At around 5 o'clock, Mrs. K. heard her 11-year-old eldest child, who was sleeping in the attic, shout: "Come and see the big ball!" The mother went upstairs and to her astonishment saw an enormous ball suspended in the air above the neighboring houses. Before the mother went upstairs, the boy had seen two smaller balls in the vicinity of the large ball. They were all three white-yellow in color. Mrs. K. then woke up her husband, after which she continued to observe: a kind of yellow geometric shape seemed to be attracting the big ball. First slowly, then faster and faster. The ball and the geometric shape disappeared. Mrs. K. was quite anxious after the observation. (© 1997 Jeroen Slurf and Jeroen Kümeling.)

Since the 1980s, nothing was heard of the Popobawa (dwarf cyclops, pointed ears, wings). The first victim in April was Mjaka Hamad, a 55-year-old farmer. At first he thought it was a dream, but something was pushing him in his mattress, waking him up. He wanted to scream but had no voice. Then he knew that the "Popobawa" had come to do something sexual to him. For men it is worse than what it does to women. Mjaka Hamad fought with the "thing". The Popobawa appeared for the first time in 1972 and the whole island talked about the sodomizations suffered. It lasted for a few weeks. Then it started again in 1980. Hamad knew it was not a dream because the whole household was awake and panicked. "Impossible to see it, you can only feel it," he said. His family ran out screaming 'Huyo!'. Hamad had sore ribs from being beaten. (Chris McGreal in "The Guardian, 2.10.95)

Indeed, trying to get confirmations from the Glons radar station, Lucien Clerebaut suggested "Night Flight" to the plouc on duty who was not authorized to answer us. Between 8 and 12 pm (local time) military flight exercises took place and 15 F 16 planes, including those from the Florennes base, would have participated. At Florennes they denied it: the runway being under repair and unusable, their F 16s had stayed on the ground.

In Brussels (Berchem Ste Agathe): R. D. (17 years old) first observed at 10:55 pm, and then at 11:22 pm, from the 9th floor of his building, a flying phenomenon appearing as three red points flashing very quickly (2 times per second) in triangular formation and a white glow at one of the bases. At a third of the distance traveled and observed, there is a sudden acceleration and the red lights become white. Quite fast speed, flight direction NE towards the Koekelberg basilica. As the witness is used to the flight of planes (air corridor towards Dilbeek where the planes then turn south or east) he was surprised to see these light points at about 150 m altitude evolving so quickly, while hearing a slight humming.
In Aiseau Presles, C. A., 19 years old, amateur astronomer beginner, observed from 10:35 pm to 11:40 pm a total of 15 objects of which he estimated that 12 were of the same type.

Five people experienced a strange adventure. Two men, a father and his son, on a hiking excursion around this large isolated lake, saw an oval-shaped UFO, the size of a car, hovering over the water for 3 minutes, before shooting off like an arrow. When they arrived at the refuge, where they were camping with three other people, they told of their observation. The next morning, the father and son were packing up to return home, and on this journey, they stopped at a gas station on Route 97. They bought a newspaper, not understanding how it was dated July 23 instead of July 22: they had a missing day of an entire day. The strangest thing was that the same misadventure was shared by the other 3 campers at the refuge. They packed up on July 22, and on their journey home, they listened to the car radio: the speaker was announcing the news of the day, specifying that it was July 24!

At 11:30 PM GMT, as flight 674 of Aerolinas Argentinas from Buenos Aires, with 102 passengers and 3 crew members, was finishing its approach maneuvers to land on the Bariloche runway, the pilot Jorge Polanco suddenly saw a white light coming directly towards him at full speed, stopping at about a hundred meters away. The object made a strange turn to follow the plane's descent and stayed parallel to it at a hundred meters away. After a while, the saucer, the size of a commercial plane, changed color, two green lights appearing at the ends with an orange light in the center that blinked intermittently. As the pilot began the final approach, the lights of the airport runway suddenly went out and he had to climb to 3 miles, still accompanied by the UFO, which then rose at a supernatural speed. When the light returned to the ground, the pilot was able to land. He admits to having stayed, once landed, "five minutes in the cabin with his heart in his throat".

As he began it, the pilot observed a strange star. At the same time, the control center put a second plane arriving in the area on hold. Flight AR 674 continued its approach, but as it was at the end of the turn, in the axis of the runway, an object resembling a large plane appeared on its right side and flew parallel to it. This object had three lights, one red in the middle. The lights of the airport fell out again, the runway lighting and the approach ramp also went out; the plane on hold observed the same phenomenon from its position. The pilot, unable to land, increased power and made another turn to line up with the runway. At that moment, the object, which had become luminous, passed behind the plane, stopped, rose vertically and stopped again. It passed in front of the plane before disappearing definitively towards the Andes Cordillera. The crew, the passengers of flight AR 674, those of the other plane, as well as the airport controllers and part of the inhabitants of San Carlos witnessed, stunned, this unusual aerial ballet. This case is interesting for more than one reason: - observation corroborated by multiple independent observers, in flight and on the ground, - duration of the phenomenon of several minutes, - varied trajectories, some of which follow those of the plane, - observation of an electromagnetic phenomenon (extinction of the lights of the city and the airport) in direct relation with the presence of the object.

South Africa, Sedgefield
Sirk Jooste and Fanie Kleyn were out on the lake at night in a rowing boat, fishing. Suddenly a triangular object appeared in the sky, bigger than a passenger plane. It had three large lights on its belly at the base and small orange lights up to the top point. The object appeared at around 2am, stayed above them for two minutes in absolute silence. Then it came closer, made a turn and in a fraction of a second disappeared. Fanie Kleyn rowed to the shore and drove to the river mouth but nothing more was visible. Sergeant Steven Schneider of the Sedgefield police was out of the village in a car around midnight when he saw red lights above the road. At first he thought it was a vehicle on the mountain, but there are no roads there. He called his colleagues, as he had the feeling of something unreal: at one point he saw these lights less than 100m in front of him and the next second he saw nothing.

Spain, Canaries - El Hierro
A large festival was gathering more than 2000 people. At 23:35 they were able to observe a large UFO, in the shape of a pear, emitting a red light. At the bottom of the object, small white lights were spinning. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of 3000 feet and eventually disappeared, rising vertically at an enormous speed.

PORTO RICO, San Juan
Second week. This is what Madeline Tolentino and her husband Jose Miguel recount:
August: the first observation took place in the second week of August 1995, around 4 pm, in front of their house in Campo Rico, southwest of San Juan. Madeline's mother was also present. Madeline notes that something is rising in the sky and goes to the window to see what it is. Outside she sees the neighbor standing next to his car, talking to the passenger sitting in the car. Suddenly, the man turns around and looks stunned and scared. Madeline then sees the strange creature coming onto the road, walking towards the neighbor. The creature stops in front of Madeline's window. It is about one to one and a half meters tall, covered in dark brown hair or fur (not really a fur coat), wearing no clothing and with no apparent sexual organs. Its arms are held very close to its body, they are very long and thin and end in a three-fingered hand with long claws. On its skin there were circular marks like burn scars. Its mouth is just a slit, its nose nonexistent but there are two small openings there. It has small ears and large gray-white eyes that look like something gelatinous. When it moves its head, it does so in a mechanical motion. The upper part of its body is thin and disproportionate compared to the lower part which is big and looks robust. The neighbor did not wait and jumped into his car and drove away. Madeline shouted for her mother to come and see. The creature then started moving so fast that its legs seemed not to touch the ground. It was heading towards a field of tall grass (...) (AUFORA)

Belgium, Liège "Thier à Liège"
Patrick W., 19 years old, was walking and guiding his bike through the Thier woods to get home at 10:40 pm when he had a traumatic encounter. He found himself facing an apparition of vaguely humanoid shape, phosphorescent greenish in color, about 1m 80 tall, surrounded by a halo. This "specter" brushed against the witness's arm, who, terrified, started running to get out of the woods, leaving his bike and the bags with the provisions on the road. For at least three hours, 14 other witnesses, all from the neighborhood, witnessed unusual luminous and sound phenomena, while Patrick W., exhausted, had already been home for a long time. Strange attitude of the police in this case. Physical effects on the witness and on the "walkman" he was wearing, whose rechargeable batteries melted. Unfortunately, Patrick W.'s friend Mohamed M. (17 years old) handled these batteries, destroying them even more, so that Patrick W.'s parents threw away the debris. But there are at least 5 witnesses who saw the state of the batteries. (Investigation by Daniel BUKENS for the SOBEPS, at the request of the Liège police, in the person of Mr. Clerbout - full report at vog).

Netherlands, Heerlen
Davey de L. took a 22-second film sequence with his father's camcorder of a UFO. The boy explains: "Normally I was supposed to do my homework (it was around 4 o'clock) but I was playing with my father's camcorder. All of a sudden I saw this black thing above the trees and I filmed it." Mr. Souren from the Astronomical Institute says that indeed, the images obtained are very different from other UFO films... (Roy Deen) HOAX? (note from vog: and for good reason! Wim van Utrecht from Antwerp made a remarkable analysis of a copy of this film. His conclusion is that Davey stuck a small paper UFO on the window and then manipulated the camcorder by moving it strongly from left to right and from top to bottom, to give the illusion that the "UFO" was flying...)

Around 11:30 PM, Jorge Divino Pereira was woken up by his dog's barking. He noticed a bright light coming through his bedroom window. Taking a lamp, he went outside to see what was happening. At that moment, the light became much brighter, blinding him completely. He saw the oil from his lamp being sucked towards the light while burning, and then felt himself being pulled into the air before falling and passing out. When he woke up, 5 hours had passed. Everything was quiet and he was in pain all over. In the days that followed, he suffered from severe headaches, vomiting, and strong irritation in his eyes. (Phenomena #33, pp. 8-9)

Italy, Rocchetta Sant'Antonio (Foggia)
At 7:45 a.m. a young woman in her twenties, a shepherdess, had taken her sheep out to graze in the valley, when she saw something luminous in the air. She approached the object, which suddenly came towards her, revealing itself to be a very small humanoid smiling, 50 cm tall, wearing a tight-fitting brown garment and its head, from the shoulders up, was in a kind of transparent diving suit. It had two eyes and a nose, two legs as well, but apparently no arms or mouth. The diving suit was half silver-colored spherical shape, and had an antenna. The young woman remained amazed looking at it from a distance of 200 to 250 meters. (Note from Vog: this Italian woman had sharp eyesight, that's the least I can say. At 200 meters, I can only make out the general silhouette of people, but I can't say for sure that they have two eyes, for example, and no mouth!) Then she decided to go back home, but to her surprise, she saw that the creature was following her. In panic she started running on the road, and met a motorist who she told about the event. The man tried to get closer to the entity which he described as a dwarf who went back and forth in the valley, then started running on its short legs and then flew away, while the woman (but not the man) heard a motorcycle sound. The man seems to have seen a white trail coming out of the half-sphere covering the humanoid's head when it was in flight. Two other people from the small town also saw this phenomenon.

CUBA, Torriente
At 9:30 pm, a turtle-shaped object, surrounded by a blue fire, with two humanoids in conversation nearby. (Banque Ovni, Fichier Central, Bagneux-France, p. 313 1/2) On July 4, 1996, Radio Rebelde in Havana broadcast a special program dedicated to this event. The object landed in Torriente near Playa Giron. A witness, Adolfo Zerata, a farmer, was working in his field when an object shaped like a bell emerged from the clouds and landed in the vegetation. He saw "two little men", one behind the UFO's window and the other walking around the object. They seemed to be wearing diving suits. The humanoid who had come out began to pick "malanga", a kind of potato. With his small arms full of uprooted plants, he re-embarked. The craft was surrounded by white and blue smoke and disappeared into the clouds at very high speed. Zerata called the police who arrived at the scene and collected evidence of the landing. There were footprints of small feet and the foliage at the landing site was all black. (Ufo Folklore Center)

Porto Rico, Hato, San Lorenzo
Two Chupacabras had already been captured in Porto Rico. One of them was alive, presumably young, by a man who kept it in a cage for 6 days at his home. Upon learning the news, the local police dispatched several agents to the site to verify it. Two hours later, several men arrived in 4 grey 4x4 vehicles and took the creature away in a kind of quarantine box, made of a transparent material, like reinforced plexiglas with a mesh of iron. It was a kind of intervention team composed of agents from the Porto Rican Department of Agriculture and an American federal agency of indeterminate nature. (...) On November 9, Resolution 5012 was taken by the House of Representatives - 12th legislative session to order a thorough investigation into the deaths and mutilations of animals attributed to the Chupacabras.

China, Beijing
Around 5:45 PM, four Chinese pilots from four different planes reportedly observed an object. One of the pilots connecting Harbin to Beijing contacted authorities to say that he saw a white, oval UFO moving at 15km/Minute (900 km/h) near his aircraft. According to the pilot, "the object then became green". Neither the AP nor the Sunday Post of Bangkok specify how the observation ended. (Phenomena #32 p. 23) The commander of a plane flying from Harbin to Beijing reported by radio that a white oval UFO was moving near the plane at a speed of 900 km/h. Later he announced that the UFO was becoming green. Another pilot confirmed the presence of the UFO. Two other aircraft crews reportedly saw in the airspace above China, a UFO that was red for one, or yellow for the second. (Belgium, BRTN Teletexte p. 176, Sunday, December 31, 1995 at 9:50:22)
