Australia, Roxby Downs (near Port Augusta in the south)
At around 10:25 PM Jeff Cook and Mick Cartwright, both from Minlayton, were driving south from Roxby Downs towards Port Augusta when Cook (who was not driving) saw what he thought was the scene of a car accident about 1.5 miles ahead of them. There were a multitude of red lights and at least one flashing blue light. A few seconds later he realized that the lights were not stationary in one place, but were moving along the road at a speed similar to their own car. With the added strangeness that the lights would occasionally veer off the road on either side for a few feet. He pointed out the phenomenon to Cartwright, and looking at the car's speedometer they noticed that they and the mysterious lights were travelling at 110 km/h. After a few minutes they saw car headlights coming in the opposite direction, apparently going up a curved hill. Cook said: "As the headlights got closer, it seemed like the vehicle was going to be blocked by all these lights in front of us. Well, no. In two seconds the red and blue lights disappeared on the spot, the headlights of the car in the opposite direction seemed to be at the bottom of the hill and disappeared... but we never saw them again. Continuing on our way we noticed that there was no descent or ascent at that point of the road, nor any interruption in the row of trees that lined it on either side. There wasn't even a trace of dust that could indicate that a vehicle had left the asphalt for a dirt road at that point."

Spain, near Alicante
Several young people in a car were on their way to Alicante when suddenly the car lost all power and stopped. "At first we laughed, my friends and I. But then, noticing that our cell phones weren't working either, nor the digital clock in the car, nor the headlights, nothing that was electric, we were surprised. As we then heard a kind of buzzing, we got out of the vehicle. Looking up we saw three lights in a triangular formation and just as we saw them, they started up and disappeared. Immediately all our devices were working again and the engine started on the first turn of the key. The strangest thing is that we were right underneath this phenomenon and we didn't feel the slightest breath of air displacement. Yet the thing was at most 30 meters above us.

Malawi, Siledi, Mwanza district
A rectangular UFO caused excitement among construction workers living in the small village of Siledi, where they are working on the construction of a school. "They got the shock of their lives when an object resembling a coffin (a large rectangular box) flew over their houses just after 9 pm. It started with the sound of a very strong wind and believing it to be a storm they went out to see this "coffin" black flying over the roofs." (The Daily Times of Blantyre, Malawi of 10.3.1999, title "Coffin' flies over houses." and correspondent CNI Diane Cammack)

USA, LaVerne (California)
At 4 in the morning Ryan H. was sleeping like a log on the second floor of the family house, when he was suddenly woken up by shaking in the room, as if there was a medium intensity earthquake. However, he quickly noticed that the shaking seemed to come from the top rather than the bottom and from east to west. He then thought that a big animal might have fallen from a tree onto the roof of the house and he got up to look out the window. To his astonishment he saw high in the sky a big and intense orange light in the shape of a balloon. He then moved to another window to get a better view and noticed that the object was flying quickly towards the west. However, on this course, it would stop and remain still. Up to this point the observation had taken about 30 seconds and Ryan went to wake up one of his brothers in the next room. The two young men (both over 20 years old) then went out onto the balcony and watched the light balloon for about 10 minutes. At the moment the UFO finally started to move, Ryan shone some light flashes from his flashlight at it. Is it a coincidence that at this moment the object stopped again? It was then that the rest of the family was woken up, including the parents, so that as many people as possible could watch the phenomenon. After some time the object suddenly started to move again quickly in the direction of the south. Then suddenly it stopped in its course and the family could see a bunch of smaller objects coming out from the base of the balloon and descending towards the ground. After this performance, the light went out and the UFO disappeared. A certain time after, the family could then observe a surprising UFO completely different. It is described as a big cube with rounded corners, of a dark grey color. The color of the object almost blended in with the clouds in the sky. This floating cube was watched until it was lost from sight on the horizon (Tim Hagemeister from NACOMM, 5.4.1999).

Spain, Seville (east of the city)
Testimony of D.S.J.M. Two witnesses (him and his wife). Object of a size greater than that of the full moon observed from the first floor of a building at 22:30. No sound is heard coming from this object having a luminosity twice that of the brightest star. The speed of movement was faster than that of a jet, and the trajectory went from SSW to NNE. The center of the thing was dark, surrounded by lights and the general shape was that of a boomerang whose perimeter was lit by a multitude of small headlights. (the witness said that if the boomerang makes an angle of 90°, this object had a rounded obtuse angle of 130°) It must have been flying at a high altitude and at very high speed since from one end to the other of the observation neither its size nor its luminosity varied much. On arrival the witnesses only observed the lights at the front part, at the beginning they then saw the lights on the rear part, arranged in a kind of arc. It looked like a very open wide V of a flight of migratory birds. (this report is transmitted to me by Ignacio Darnaude Rojas-Marcos from Seville)

USA, Salt Lake City 
Maybe a bird, or an airplane?... What is certain is that it is excrement. And in the Salt Lake City valley, they don't joke around, where since April 9th and a dozen times, thick showers of filth have fallen from the sky, so big that they dirtied seven houses at once. The neighbors blame the airplanes, but the Federal Aviation Administration retorts that commercial jets don't dump their septic tanks in flight. They are studying the "splatter patterns" and the firemen are hosing down the houses to clean them... The complainants have obtained the collaboration of a judicial investigator because, as the mayor of Taylorsville, Janice Auger, says: "It has never been funny. The smell is terrible, health is at stake. Feces have always been potentially carriers of a lot of diseases". Captain Lee Smith of the police affirms: "It is feces, but nobody seems to be able to tell us if it is of animal or human origin. The FAA, often solicited in the case of bizarre phenomena, is dumbfounded about these "fallouts". "We have never heard of anything like this," says Mitch Barker, their spokesperson.

Canada, White Rock (British Columbia)
Debbie had gone to check on her son's room to make sure everything was alright during the night, when a blue light came in through the shutters. It was 4:30 in the morning. Looking out another window into the street, she was astonished to see a group of 8 to 12 rectangular stationary lights, illuminating the whole alley of the neighbor. The lights were stationary and the whole thing measured about 2.50m on each side. She also heard a kind of deep buzzing. After observing the phenomenon for about ten seconds she was so shocked that she returned to her son's room. As she went there, she saw a beam of white light at the back of the house, illuminating the whole Dogwood Park area. Glancing, she could then see the white light of the UFO between the trees.

Spain, Aznalcollar (Seville)
Phenomenon observed for half an hour, from 2:30 in the morning at the Aznalcollar mine by truck drivers and a mine guard. The object was moving in an area enclosed by the triangle Aznalcollar, Gerena and Castillo de la Guardas. According to the witnesses it was blue in color and had a shape resembling a round electric radiator. The approximate diameter of the object was 50 to 60 meters, according to the witnesses, but it is difficult to accept these figures without further triangulation.

Canada, Mud Bay (British Columbia)
A couple was walking along Mud Bay at 8:15 PM when they saw something black that was at least 10 meters long. It had a tail shaped like a fin that was raised up and it was moving in the water. It made no noise or even ripples in the water! The husband is convinced that it was neither a sea wolf nor a shark. Around 8:30 PM they were on the road near "1000 Steps" at Crescent Beach when they saw on the road an orange light spot that was about 3 meters in diameter. (Filer's Files # 22, Mufon, June 4, 1999)

#1999, May 16
USA, Columbus (Ohio)
William Jones, director of Mufon for Ohio, reports that three observations were noted on May 16 above Columbus, all three around 10:15 PM. First, a family of three people from Upper Arlington saw for about ten minutes a UFO in the shape of a disk but with a dome on the top and bottom. The craft had a very intense and flashing light at the top and bottom. The whole phenomenon was luminous, the domes more than the central part with a rectangular or elongated part. The object was in the south of the sky relative to their position and flying slowly in the west-northwest direction. Very shortly before this observation, a couple driving on Ackerman Road (2 miles east of the family of the above observation) saw a large ovoid object in the south sky. It seemed to be flying over the Ohio State University, or the nearby football stadium. It had a white, fuzzy and vaporous light above, more defined below and near the base several flashing lights. As they drove, they had the impression that the object was gliding. The observation was of short duration, until they crossed the Olentangy River. IN REALITY: A third witness reported seeing between 10:15 and 10:20 PM a large luminous object apparently traveling at 15 or 25 mph in the direction of the south. It seemed to be following the I-270 route; At one point, after turning west, the thing was close enough for the witness to read the word "Budweiser" on the side of the object. It was an illuminated advertising blimp.

Australia, Esperance
Diane Harrison, director of Australian Skywatch, reported that Peter saw tons and tons of a filamentous substance falling from the sky over an area of 90 km². Everything was covered: houses, hedges, trees, and it hung on electrical lines in large pieces up to 10 meters long. The sky was heavily covered with this material, apparently up to an altitude of 300 meters. The substance fell for five hours: from 10 am to 3 pm. Everything was covered. Peter collected some of the material for analysis. During this angel hair shower a Cessna flew at 80 to 100 meters through the downpour.

USA, near Lava Hot Springs (Idaho)
(Source: Peter Davenport, National UFO Reporting Center, and the June 24 edition of the Art Bell radio program) Janice Price recounts that she was sitting with her son on the porch of their trailer. The night was very quiet. It was about 11:15 PM. "Suddenly this light came through the woods up above our home. At first there were four separate flashes of light, of an intensity of one million watts. They only lasted a second. It went up to our car entrance and stopped: nothing! No sound. Perfect silence."
Not knowing what to think, Janice then went into the trailer to talk with her brother-in-law. When she came out again, her house was bathed in an intense blue-white light. The trees were lit up like it was daytime. Something was moving quickly in the sky, as the shadows of the trees and things were lengthening and shortening in all directions. "I was watching from the front door, talking with my uncle," said the son. "Through the trees I saw big beams of light moving. It went from west to east. It went through the trees which sometimes blocked the light. The shadows were moving in all directions, all the time. Then it went over a big pine tree, lighting up everything. I ran to the other side to get a better view, but the house was in the way. That's all I remember." The son's memory ends there. "Then I remember looking down and everything was black," he adds. Meanwhile, not far away, a retired Air Force pilot was in bed, looking out the window. He was surprised to suddenly see a bright object. Owen Mitchell, also present on the Art Bell program, said he had been retired for two years after 26 years of service and over 20,000 hours of flight. His trailer is a half-mile from the Prices'. He saw "a round object, flying from east to west at an elevation of about 60° in the sky." He had never seen anything like it. "It was above the trees and really very bright, like the light of a welding arc. It was hard to look at, but it was fascinating." The whole canyon was lit up, but his observation only lasted two seconds.
Mitchell estimates that the object was a half-mile away and at an altitude between 750 and 1000 meters. He looked at the time: it was 11:18 PM.

Eric Carman writes: "I would like to share an incident that I have only told my brother about. It was in June, I'm not sure of the exact day, and it was a beautiful day. I was sitting in my living room around 10:30 in the morning, waiting for my daughter's school bus. Near the panoramic window something caught my attention: I thought it was children's balloons, floating in the wind. But upon closer inspection, there was something strange. A high-tension line with 4-6 wires passes in front of the house, and these balloons were flying parallel to the line. Intrigued, I went outside and noticed three gray, slightly oval-shaped, almost metallic-looking balls spinning on themselves and each other as they moved horizontally. A fourth ball, flying even lower, joined the other three. For a few moments they all followed the high-tension line, then they rose up incredibly fast and disappeared. I even took a picture but it doesn't show much: it was just at the moment when the 4 balls were joining before they rose up. I don't know what it was, but I'm sure I'll never forget this phenomenon."

JORDAN, Mafraq
An unidentified creature that had been terrorizing the population and their poultry (vog: sic!) was captured Sunday night July 25. People had already seen the "beast" during the month of June, but generally it made its ravages at night, devouring dozens of chickens and pigeons. The creature with a small head and big eyes, teeth, and a tail was finally taken when it seemed to be methodically visiting certain residential areas of Mafraq each night. Provisionally the creature has been given the name "Al-Massara" and has been handed over to veterinary services to determine its species, but nothing says that it was the only one of its kind roaming the night in Mafraq.

Iraq, Haditha
Stories of ghosts are common around the old town of Haditha. But when the naked ghosts start dancing in front of motorists driving on the road, it creates traffic embarrassment. According to the Iraqi newspaper Al-Alwan, "motorists passing through the Horan Valley, just outside the town of Haditha (216 km northeast of Baghdad) saw the appearance of 'naked spirits' performing acrobatic movements, next to the bridge. The drivers were in panic," said the newspaper, which adds that motorist Shawki Sabar said: "They were rather human, but I could not focus on their exact shape because it was dark and I was scared to see it." The spirits seemed so alive that one of the drivers thought he had run over a person and went to report the accident to the police. (Weekly Al-Alwan of 21.8.99, and the Charlotte, N.C.

#1999, September 1
USA, Northwest Pacific Coast
Hundreds of residents reported seeing 7 or 8 glowing UFOs in the sky. Most of the sightings took place between 9 pm and 9:30 pm. One of the witnesses claimed that several F-15 fighter jets had taken off from the Portland military airport four minutes after the UFO flyover. Interceptor planes were also reported in the sky over Bend, Oregon. In total, there were reports of either 7 or 8 glowing UFOs, flying from northwest to southeast in a "formation" at low altitude and at a surprisingly slow speed; or 8 UFOs with fire trails traveling from west to east across the sky in one and a half minutes; or 7 or 8 flaming objects flying in a straight line and formation from northwest to southwest, with one object leaving the formation and then returning.
IN REALITY: Jerry Rolwes from MUFON contacted NORAD and discussed the sightings with Major Nouis, in charge of public affairs for the Air Force. This was re-entry number 25761 in the NORAD catalogue, the Russian SL-12 rocket launched from Baikonour on 28.2.1998. It entered the Earth's atmosphere at 22:11 (9:11 pm Pacific time) at 17,000 mph, which explains the fire trail observed by the witnesses. (Steve Wilson Sr. UFO Roundup vol. 4 no. 20, 8.9.99, ed.

Mexico, Monterrey - Garza Garcia (Monterrey)
At around 7 pm on Sunday a large V-shaped object appeared in the sky, above the Garza Garcia district of Monterrey where two supermarkets are located. According to Mexican ufologist Santiago Yturria Garza, "The UFO was large and stationary in the sky at low altitude. Its shape was a V and on the upper part it had something spherical that seemed to emit a continuous white light. In addition, the UFO continuously changed shape, into a boomerang, into a triangle, while rotating on its axis. At one point the two arms of the boomerang separated." Hundreds of Mexicans stopped their cars to observe it and several called the television stations. At 9:29 pm the television reporter Marta Zamarripa arrived to film the phenomenon for the show TeleDiario, on Channel 12. The object was still there at 7:45 pm. During the next day's broadcast, the presenter told viewers that a Boeing 737 was descending and was at 3000 m when the Mario Escobede airport control tower warned it to be "vigilant about something it could encounter on its descent path." But upon inquiry, the control tower firmly denied having made such statements. (Santiago Yturria Garza and OVNI Investigaciones de Mexico, Ufo Roundup vol. 4 no. 22, 22.9.99, Joseph Trainor)

(Source: article in 'Komsomolskaya Pravda.' magazine for young people from Moscow)
A respected Doctor of Geological and Mineralogical Sciences El'chin Hallilov used an advanced Sony video camera to film for 40 minutes a giant and shining UFO rotating above the capital of Azerbaijan. A conference of astronomers was held at the Shemahinskoj Astrophysical Observatory in Azerbaijan at the same time. The 50,000 video images were brought to the meeting and examined by expert astronomers who were impressed by the high quality of the digital video camera. They were shocked by the clarity and length of the film which seemed to show a huge spaceship or a confidential American weapon. The video is considered sensational because it shows a large illuminated object with a powerful and blinking blue light suspended above the city for several hours starting at 21:45 on September 24. The astronomers could not explain this as plasma or comet. The film then shows the object enlarged 300 times showing an apparatus of surprising complexity. It was composed of three main parts. The front was in the shape of a complete sphere. The back rotated around an axis crossing the entire object. It seemed to radiate a great power of heat and radiation. The object rotated and it was possible to see the entire length, and then it was a large sphere with a truncated base. There were blinking lights and portions seemed to turn showing an object with two decks. At certain moments it took the shape of an isosceles triangle then took the shape of an eclipse and disappeared. The astronomers agreed that natural objects do not take this shape and do not remain stable for several hours. The object seemed obviously some kind of technical object. The decision was taken unanimously to create a commission to study the film and obtain information about the film. (Thanks to Anatolij.- Ovni Science, mailing list - Oct. 1999)

Italy, Sicily, Mount Etna
Around noon a luminous UFO was seen above the summit of ETNA and stayed there for ten minutes, performing maneuvers (of smoke: there was an eruption less than a week later, and black smoke, sometimes mixed with fire, was already coming out of it...). The oval-shaped UFO was seen by hundreds of people from the town of Adrano, southwest of the volcano, and by those from the small towns of Belpaso and Viagrande. The UFO was described as a white round object, with a dark center and the whole thing seemed "reddish". The object changed its position from vertical to horizontal, and changed its shape from round to oval. In Adriano two people took video images and are convinced they filmed a flying saucer.

A rain of strange white filaments fell from the sky over Vercelli and the surrounding area on Monday, November 8. The unusual phenomenon had significant proportions, since the phenomenon repeated itself at various times over an area of about ten square kilometers, covering houses, fields, electrical wires, and even pigeons! There are photos, a film, and also residues of these angel hairs. Unlike other previous cases, the filaments, up to one meter long, did not dissolve immediately and it was thus possible to collect and preserve various samples that will be analyzed by the Italian Center for Ufological Studies.

On Sunday, December 5th, 1999, the Chinese newspaper China Daily reported that a scientific team in the Shenongjia Mountains had found traces of a large, hairy hominid, which they called the "Wild Man". Standing, it measured nearly 2.4 meters tall and was covered in long, red hair. It was searching for seeds in the nature reserve. The scientists set out to look for the creature after a hunter reported seeing it in the reserve two months earlier. The hominid left footprints measuring 40 cm long, and they found hairs and empty seed pods. (USA Today, December 8th, 1999, "Big Foot Returns," page 24A)

TAIWAN: Taiwan Strait
(Taiwan MND Confirms Incoming UFOs From China - From: Diane Lovett -
Translation: Phil – ovnipage) Taipei, Jan. 18 (CNA). The Ministry of Defense (MND) confirmed Tuesday that 10 unidentified objects had been seen crossing the Taiwan Strait from the Chinese mainland and heading north of the island before disappearing at an altitude between 14,000 and 25,000 (?) on January 16. Judging by the direction of the wind and air currents, the MND supposes that the UFOs come from the Chinese mainland and adds that these movements also threaten the security of Taiwanese air traffic as well as international traffic. During a press conference, the MND informed the Civil Aeronautics Administration and promptly indicated to them to pay great attention to this situation. The MND also urged the mainland to refrain from such dangerous behavior.
Following the MND's warning, the SEF (Strait Exchange Foundation) sent a letter to their Chinese counterparts (ARATS) so that the relevant authorities could investigate this matter. In the same spirit, the CAA (Civil Aeronautics Administration) set up an alert plan on Tuesday for pilots navigating the Taiwan-Kinmen air corridor in case they judged that the unidentified objects could cause problems for aircraft using this corridor.
So far, no unusual objects have been detected by the CAA's radars, but the MND's warning clearly illustrates that UFOs are a potential danger in the Taiwan-Kinmen corridor - Diane Lovett (OVNI-SCIENCES, Information Bulletin No. 17, 27.01.2000) (vog: given the political situation between China and Taiwan, one can wonder if these "UFOs" were not simply missiles ... of intimidation?)

Malaysia
(From: Muzzafar Zabidin - Trans: Phil - Malaysian UFO Report, March 8. - A report from the newspaper The Star (Malaysia) by UFO Folklore - Tanah Merah (Kelantan)) An observation of a large object emitting light beams was reported. According to the witnesses, it even landed in a marshy area. This observation took place three days ago and held the approximately 1000 inhabitants of Kampung Gobek in awe. The witnesses say they saw the shining object land around 3:00 in the morning. The lights coming from the object came intermittently, like flashes of lightning, but that day there was no sign of rain, according to Mohamad Mat Diah, 51. The lights from the object were very strong and the beams bathed the inside of my house.
"As I noticed something was happening outside I looked out and saw this object moving above the marshes for several minutes". Mohammad says that at daybreak he went to the area which is about 100 m from his home and there he noticed a kind of Y-shaped depression measuring 15 m by 5 m wide which could have been caused by the unidentified object. Near this depression was another crescent-shaped depression about 3 m and three holes around each one of 1 m in diameter. "I was accompanied by two people who were originally scared to come with me," adds Mr. Diah. Another resident of the place, Saupi Salleh, 28, recounts having been woken up by the intense light. "At first I thought it was a storm but I realized it was something else". He also went to the alleged landing site and concluded that if an object had come there, it must have been very imposing. Many other people then came to inspect the site. (Malaysian UFO Network http://myufonet.cjb.net)

A woman was driving on a country road between 9 and 10 pm. In the passenger seat was a baby seat with her young child. She told ufologist Davina Ryszka of Montrose, Colorado about her terrifying encounter with a UFO. "There was a very low flying object, displaying a very large white light and small green and red lights on the side. This UFO was on a deliberate collision course. Coming straight at me, and so low, I did everything I could to avoid a probable crash" she said. But the UFO stopped right in front of the car which the driver had managed to stop almost in place. Then, when she wanted to leave, the UFO made the same maneuver, she reversed, the UFO too. She made a maneuver in place to change direction, the UFO imitated her. She was really panicked, all the more so because her baby was in the car. Finally, she managed to get back in the direction she had followed first, the UFO still facing her. She drove fast and the object seemed to be following her now, she could see it in the rearview mirror. "Then, for a few moments, I couldn't see it anymore, and I was already relieved thinking it had gone". But suddenly a bright light came from above illuminating the car and the whole area around. She drove as if she had the devil on her heels and finally arrived safe and sound, but very shocked in Olathe. (UFO ROUNDUP, Volume 5, Number 13, March 30, 2000, Editor: Joseph Trainor)

(Ufotel No. 208) This report was published in a local newspaper. An employee and a teacher who were walking in the woods in Lucignano in the afternoon of March 8, would have observed around 4 pm, a stationary luminous triangular object in the sky. Shortly after they were aware of a presence nearby, behind them. It was a humanoid form (not otherwise defined) wearing a suit and a helmet with a visor, through which the witnesses would have seen blue eyes without eyelashes or eyebrows, a nose like that of humans, and lips barely outlined. A whistle from above drew the attention of the two witnesses to the object in the sky, which after a slight undulating movement catapulted itself into infinity, gaining more and more speed.

There would have been thousands of witnesses to a spectacular observation in the Peruvian capital, Lima, on March 10th. A cameraman from the local channel Canale 5 managed to film for a few minutes the lights seen for at least a quarter of an hour shortly after one in the morning. On the video one can see four lights of changing colors, arranged in a triangle, which moved slowly and at low altitude above the roofs of the city. According to some testimonies, among them those of journalists busy with the control of the observations, there were also around other smaller lights.

Ireland, Belfast
A Belfast worker in Northern Ireland reported that his car was lifted off the ground during the observation of a UFO and as a result he is missing 6 hours from his memories. The experience is said to have taken place on the evening of Thursday, March 23, when the man was returning home from work. Stopping at a gas station, he saw in the sky a large light, it looked like the moon but with an oval shape.
Getting back in the car, he noticed that the light was following him and, with amazement, he also realized that he had taken the wrong road. Terrified, he stopped and got out of the car in the middle of the countryside, realizing that the car was being lifted off the ground. His next memory is of him being in the driver's seat of his car, near his house, at 2:30 in the morning. What he thought had lasted five minutes had actually lasted 6 hours. A typical episode of "missing time", usually associated with abduction cases, which local ufologists are currently examining.

Cliff Blyth, 68, told the Grimsby Evening Telegraph that he had been struck by "a 5 cm diameter fireball that had gone through the window" and had passed through his chest. He experienced no physiological effects from the incident. His wife, who was on the phone at the time, witnessed the event and was shocked. She immediately lifted his shirt but could not find any marks from the fireball. They were left with only fear.

INDIA, New Delhi
Five minutes before midnight a bright yellow-orange UFO was slowly approaching the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the Palam Regional Airport in New Delhi. According to one of the witnesses, K. Anupam, "the UFO was approaching from the northeast. Its movement was irregular but slow." A group of people were watching it when it stopped above the Gandhi Airport terminal. "The UFO was at a rather high altitude and no sound was coming from it," said Anupam. "It stopped in the air and stayed there for a moment, then it suddenly veered to the left and descended a bit. Again it stayed still for a moment and then moved quickly to the right. It tilted and disappeared at an incredible speed. During the whole observation its bright silhouette suggested an oscillation, a swaying." Anupam described the UFO as cigar-shaped. "It was elongated with glows in three parts. There were two dark areas between the three bright parts. It seemed to be sending flashes suggesting a rotation on itself. It was at the altitude of commercial airplanes (10,000 meters), but its movement was very different, oscillating." (alt.ufo.reports, Jess, April 13, 2000)

On Saturday, April 15, 2000, between one and two in the morning, Alan S. was sleeping in his house in Ballwin. Suddenly, he awoke and "I looked to the right of my bed. It was standing there. It disappeared after two minutes. It was a very strange creature. Lemon-green in color, glowing, and there was like a big green aura all around it. It had two arms and two legs. Its eyes were glowing red. The skin seemed to be made of scales like that of a reptile. It was about 4 feet tall (1.30 m). I stayed motionless in bed until it disappeared, vanishing into the air." One could have taken Alan's vision for a waking dream if there hadn't been an earlier UFO sighting elsewhere in Missouri. (UFO ROUNDUP, Volume 5, Number 16, April 20, 2000, Editor: Joseph Trainor)

Ireland, Blackwater
Noel Duggan, of Ballyconnigar Lower in Blackwater, told Gerry Ryan's radio show in early June that he was having a drink in his mobile home with his girlfriend Kathleen Roche, and his friend Martin Egan from Wexford, when they were joined by a strange little man about 5 feet tall with peculiar ears.
"'The creature was sitting on the mattress next to my girlfriend but she didn't see it, nor did she hear when we spoke to it. It appeared out of nowhere and we didn't ask it where it came from. My friend Martin and I were in discussion with the creature, but I don't remember what about. The man had huge ears and slightly curly hair." The incident happened around 7 in the evening and after a short while the strange visitor placed his hands above the girlfriend's head saying "It's not her fault" and then vanished.

(From Dr. Virgilio Sanchez-Ocejo - Source:
http://www.elsur.cl/index2.html - 'Cronica' Newspaper, Chile Monday 24, 2000. Trad: Phil ovnipage npdc.) Jose Ignacio Prieto and 4 friends had just finished dinner when they felt a strong sensation of heat. The lights went out, they were in complete darkness when a powerful blue light entered the room where they were. It lasted a few seconds which were enough to blind them momentarily after the lights came back on. The next day they found a triangular mark. The base measured 35 meters and each side was nearly 20 meters. At one corner of the triangle there is a transformer that distributes electricity in the area. The triangle is located on a small mountain. The plants inside the triangle were twisted at the base just like in the mysterious crop circles. The place is only accessible by horse. There are no nearby roads or even vehicles in the area. In San Pedro de Atacama, the police received reports of strange red lights (UFOs?). The narcotics police went to investigate the site, thinking they would find a clandestine laboratory but to their great surprise they only found another triangular trace with a base of 50 meters formed of small stones not exceeding ten centimeters. The stones forming the triangle seemed burned and were still hot to the touch. (Dr. Virgilio Sanchez-Ocejo Miami UFO Center.)

[01/05/2000 12:47/Belgabrief/General/Afsud/Espace/Divers) Two metal balls have fallen from the sky in the last few days in fields in the Cape region, leaving police and press perplexed while awaiting analysis: UFO, piece of satellite? The first of these balls landed Thursday in a field 70 km northeast of Cape Town, the impact preceded by a double "bang", according to the testimony of employees of the Peter Viljoen farm, cited by The Star on Monday. The ball, which weighed more than 30 kilograms, was hot like it had been heated white at the impact and the witnesses could not touch it for half an hour. - The second ball, oblong and more massive, measuring between 1 m and 1.50 m in diameter and weighing nearly 100 kilograms, landed Friday in another farm in the region, near Durbanville. The balls, which according to the newspaper could be pieces of an old satellite, were transported to Cape Town Airport from where they were to be sent to Pretoria for expertise. (VPT)

Chile, Huepil (near Concepcion)
On Saturday, April 29, 2000, Jose Ismael Pino, 59, an agricultural worker employed on the Esperance ranch 2 km east of Huepil, near Tucapel, encountered a chupacabra. Pino was leaving the barn at 8 pm when he thought he saw a large bull running wild. He approached and shouted at the animal. Then he saw that it was not a bull. The creature was there, motionless, looking at him. It measured 1.50m, like a large monkey, with long arms ending in claws, huge fangs coming out of its mouth, and the creature also had wings. "I was so scared that I ran to get the dogs. I released the dogs to chase away this 'bird'. The dog Cachorro came back very quickly, his neck open and bleeding. My boss Jorge Venegas then armed himself with a rifle to defend us. Since there have been all these luminous phenomena around, he even sleeps with the rifle next to him." In the region four sheep were killed in one farm and one cow in another. But not everyone believes in the guilt of the chupacabras, says the farm manager Raul Perez to the newspaper Cronica. "A few years ago we had a big problem with stray dogs: in one night they killed 70 sheep." (UFO Roundup, Volume 5, Number 19, May 11, 2000, Editor: Joseph Trainor)

At 1:30 in the morning, while Professor Liliana Romero Castillo was deeply asleep in her apartment located in Laguna Redonda in Concepcion, she was awoken by the barking of her five young puppies. They were with a mastiff named Black in the garden. Looking out the window, she saw the puppies barking and noticed the motionless body of Black near the wall. To her painful astonishment, she also saw the back of what seemed to be a very tall man over two meters tall. At shoulder level, the back was divided, as if it had wings. His posture was as if he had just struck something. So she woke her husband, but he was too sleepy to get up. Going back to the window, Mrs. Romero saw that the creature had disappeared, leaving the dead mastiff in its place. The next day, when sending her children to the grocery store, they took a shortcut and returned home saying that a big beige dog had died in the alley. This dog had holes in its throat and was exsanguinated. (UFO Roundup, Volume 5 Number 19 May 11, 2000, Editor: Joseph Trainor)

Mr. Hugo Macias, aged 60 and employed for more than 37 years at the newspaper "La Capital" of Mar del Plata, who since 1997 has always taken the same route between Balcarce and Tendil, and claims to know the National Route 226 perfectly, contacted "El Eco de Tandil" to tell his experience.<br/><br/>
"On Tuesday, May 5th, as usual (details recorded in the National Gendarmerie), at the place called La Planta Terrena, after passing the "Puerta del Abra" road from Mar del Plata to Tandil and having traveled about 5 to 6 kilometers, I heard a strange noise of something approaching from behind. I felt enveloped by a very powerful light. I say enveloped and tubed because it was a light that covered a diameter of 50 meters and that entered from all sides of my vehicle. It seemed to go through the sheet metal of the roof." Hugo assures that it was at that moment that the radio went off, then the engine and the headlights stopped, but meanwhile, there was so much light coming from the outside that he could not see if the car lights were on. "It transported me for about 600 meters and then it cut off. It only lasted a few seconds but it seemed interminable. Everything started working again, I found myself facing a dark but starry night, and I saw in the sky at an approximate height of 1500 to 2000 meters an enveloping light in the shape of a tube that descended to the plain. During the rest of the trip I crossed two cars. It was a day of less traffic. (...) After my return to Mar del Plata I went to the gendarmerie post of Planta Terrena to see if the sentinel on guard that night had seen something. But I could not meet her, another guard commented to me that in this place five or six similar things had happened. He also told me that during the summer period witnesses had reported a circular shape in the prairie on which a burned paste rested as if acid had been poured over it. "(...)

Germany, Muchengladbach
(Source: Rheinische Post newspaper, 8 and 18.5.2000) About fifty police officers were sent to search for a UFO that people said they had seen falling outside the city of Munchengladbach in the night of Friday, May 5, 2000. Calls flooded in and a ufologist had already contacted the airport for information about the illuminated object, flying slowly in the area of the A52 highway near Hardt. One of the witnesses, Karl W., said that the object with red and white flashing lights had fallen shortly after 10 pm behind the trees. When an expert identified the position of the flashing lights as belonging to a small sports plane, the search was launched by 50 police officers, 12 firefighters, and 22 volunteers from the Red Cross with tracking dogs. At dawn, a helicopter also appeared, but nothing was found. One of the witnesses said that in fact the object was flying so slowly and in complete silence, at the height of the tree tops, that it must not have appeared on the radar screens. Ten days later, a "radio amateur" claimed to have listened to radio transmissions from the search team and to have heard the police talking about green humanoids, passing through our solar system during their journey.

"I got out to open the hood," he said, "and I heard a noise coming down the road from the east. I looked and saw an object shaped like a disk spinning very quickly on itself on the road. I got back in the car as quickly as I could, all the while watching this thing. Suddenly it started moving and went straight up into the sky. This happened about 25 yards from my car. I was scared out of my wits. I haven't told anyone, who would believe me. I'll never take that road again. The noise this thing made sounded like a faint buzzing."

Argentina, Concepcion del Bermejo (in the north)
(UFO ROUNDUP, vol. 5 no. 26 of 29.6.2000, ed. Joseph Trainor) "Seventeen people gathered at a party of the Overejo and Gomex families said they saw and struck a "lobizon" (werewolf) between midnight and 12:30 a.m. on Thursday, June 22, 2000. Eva Castillo, a witness to the scene, told the Argentine newspaper "Norte" that the first to detect the strange creature was her nephew Marcelo, 11, who saw the creature attacking the little dog and opened the window to see what was happening. The creature was standing on the platform where the chickens and ducks find water. Another family member said he did not believe in either the Lobizon or the Almamula (another legendary animal of the region) and that he thought people were telling lies about them, but that he saw this "thing" and gave it a terrible kick.<br/><br/>
"As if nothing had happened, the creature got up and left," adds Jesus Alcides Gomez, who joined the other family members to beat the creature with sticks, bricks, and whatever they had at hand. Mrs. Castillo said: "We joined Alcides because the lobizon was chasing Marcelito, who had to take refuge on the trailer to avoid being hurt." According to the witnesses, the creature looked like a dog with long, drooping ears, but with legs like a child's. The Argentines believe that the seventh son of a line of boys turns into a lobizon at midnight, during the full moon, and especially if it happens on a Friday. Colonel Juan Domingo Peron, president from 1943 to 1955, had even ordered that all seventh sons be baptized in a public ceremony, thinking he could thus subdue the superstition. In the case of the Gomez families, the police came to the scene after the creature's escape and collected samples of blood, and yellow and brown hairs, and some droppings. Another witness also claims to have seen the lobizon that night. It is Odilio Pontes, who runs the service station along Route 16: "Around 1:30 in the morning I saw a strange dog hiding behind the diesel pump, I was scared and I only looked at it through the window without going out. But it was bloody from the back, that I saw. It left towards the city, it had long "hair" of dark brown color.

"Diabolical Elves (El Diablillo) in Two Argentine Cities"
On July 5th, 2000, police closed the auxiliary office in Dande Varela and placed two guards there after the auxiliary sheriff had seen the apparition of El Diablillo.
Corporal Miguel Angel Aguero was hospitalized that morning in a state of shock, having had a nervous breakdown due to the alleged appearance of the infernal elf in the office. Aguero, age 37, and having been an auxiliary police officer for ten years, is a well-known athlete, especially because he was a marathon champion in his province. He was found unconscious, sitting on his chair, eyes wide open looking at the ceiling. When his colleagues approached him he started to scream: "There, there! He's here. He's coming for me!" pointing his finger up. Corporal Aguero was alone in the office around 1 o'clock in the morning when he made his routine round, passing through the empty cell block and returning to his office. He then heard something coming through the double doors behind him. "What do you want?" he asked, petrified. "I have come for you, as Satan wished" the thing replied. At the hospital, Aguero described the entity in detail: "It was a person, I don't know if it was a man, it had red eyes, very red eyes. Its face was deformed and horrible, full of warts. It was about my size and it was wearing black pants and a green shirt. Its eyes were red and bulging. Horrible!" According to a police report, around 1:30, after three unsuccessful attempts to contact the auxiliary office in Dande de Carela by radio, a vehicle was dispatched to the scene to check on the situation of the corporal.
