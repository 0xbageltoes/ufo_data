A farmer saw at around 6:15 pm in a field a white apparatus. Later flattened grass was found at the site of the phenomenon. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 263)
M. Vanhamme came to see his animals in the pasture, he had 40 of them including 10 white oxen. "I counted 11," he will say, "then I realized that the eleventh was actually a shiny rectangular device located 400 m away from me. I advanced towards it. Then I heard a whistling sound similar to that of a steam engine. The device left the ground quickly and disappeared." (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 102)

#1954, October 1
FRANCE, Ligescourt (Somme)
At 6:45pm three (two) cyclists saw an orange object in front of them,
shaped like a beehive. A strange being wearing a diving suit was
standing next to the craft. When they got to 70m from him, the object
moved away very quickly. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions
ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 266)(Jimmy GUIEU: Black-out sur
les S.V." - FLEUVE NOIR 1956 - p. 163 with the mentions between
parentheses) Bernard Devoisin and René Condette, on bicycles, saw a
craft shaped like a cereal stack that took up the whole width of the
road: 3 meters high, 3 meters wide at its base. Bernard Devoisin saw
on the left of the craft a humanoid whose size did not exceed 1 meter.
He was wearing a diving suit. He disappeared behind the craft, which
then rose gently to 1 meter above the ground, without making a sound.
Then it moved away at a speed of about 50 km/h (GARREAU et LAVIER:
"Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975, J'ai Lu, p. 34, 35) Bernard
Devoisin, 18 years old and René Coudette 19 years old saw at 150m
from them, resting on the tarred road, an orange mass shaped like a
hive. (...) The one who was riding in front saw something moving and
took it for an animal. They suddenly realized that it was a small
being wearing a diving suit (...) (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni,
Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 103)

FRANCE, Jussey
At around 7pm two young people saw a bright white disc moving in the sky. It dove to the ground and two very tall men dressed in white emerged, making gestures. The witnesses, panicked, fled. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 263, 264)

#1954, October 1
FRANCE, between Lormaison and St Crepin Ibouvillers -
(Croix d'Epine: Jacques Vallée, who puts October 2, 1954 at 8 pm)
At 7:50 pm Ernest Delattre was returning to his house on a scooter when an egg-shaped object, brightly lit, landed on the left side of the road 15 m further. He saw short and dark shapes resembling potato sacks, moving near the object. He accelerated, saw the object the size of a small car move away while its color changed from orange to blue and then to a bluish gray. The witness fainted while he was telling his story. Without being consulted, two people from neighboring villages reported having seen the object. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronicle of ET Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 265) (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, First Complete Dossier..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 104)

#1954, October 1
FRANCE, La Roulerie
At 10:00 PM (8:00 PM?) near St Jean d'Angély, two businessmen
Messrs. Estier and Phelippeau who were returning from Royan, saw a small man
cross the road in front of their car. Having stopped immediately, they
saw the silhouette disappear into the woods. (Jacques Vallée:
"Chronicle of UFO Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 264)

#1954, October 1
FRANCE, Branges near Louhans
As he was returning home at 10:00 PM, Gilbert Prudent saw a bright object on the side of the road 50 meters away from him. The engine of his cycle stopped. It had a flat part and a kind of mushroom on top. As the witness approached, the object became dark and rose vertically with a faint whistling sound. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 264) (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 105)

#1954, October 2
FRANCE, Feniers
Five witnesses, located to the right of the airfield, observed at around 7:30 PM an object of round shape going pointed at each side. On the round part several violently lit portholes were noticed. They saw the object descend vertically, make two stops of about one minute each, and then appear to land. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 108)

#1954, October 3
FRANCE, Nivelles (Nord)
At 0:15 Marcel Sénéchal was cycling back to St Amand les Eaux. He was following the towpath of the canal that runs alongside the Scarpe. At the exit of Nivelles he heard someone speaking in a language he didn't understand. "I turned my head and below the path, in a pasture, I saw in the faint light of the moon, a ball of about 3 m in diameter. Next to it were two small beings, no more than 1 meter tall, they were talking. They had big heads. Their clothes were luminous." Frightened, he ran away. The next day he made a statement to the gendarmerie. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 132)

#1954, October 3
FRANCE, Bressuire
At 5:45 in Bressuire (Deux-Sèvres), Angelo Girardo on a moped on his way to work saw a luminous object "like a barrel standing in the grass". A small man was standing 2 or 3 meters away. He was wearing a kind of dark suit but was bareheaded. He made signs to the witness, but the latter, not at all reassured, fled. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V." - Fleuve Noir 1956 - pp. 148-149 which mistakenly dates this to September 27, 1954, and whose description would be doubtful) The witness was riding a bicycle on the RN 148B. When he arrived at the grain silos of the agricultural cooperative of Bressuire, he found himself facing a circular object, 3 m in diameter, resting on the road. Surprised, he got off his bike. He saw near the object a small being dressed in a diving suit who made signs for him to approach. Surprised by fear, Girardo walked backwards without taking his eyes off the being. The latter returned to the apparatus and entered it. A few seconds later the disc rose at a dizzying speed. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 96)<br/><br/>IN REALITY:
The newspaper articles (Le Figaro of October 4, 1954, La Croix, Paris Presse, L'Aurore, France-Soir, Libération of October 5, 1954) constituted the only source of information for ufologists who cited this RR3. They did not refer to the journalistic source consisting of two articles from the regional daily La Nouvelle République du Centre-Ouest of October 4, 1954, p. 2 and 3 of the Deux-Sèvres edition. It took 17 years for someone, René Pascaut, to go and find the witness. (They Met Extraterrestrials, (Ed. A. Lefeuvre, 1978, pp. 177-178). - Also reported by A. Gamard in E. Zurcher, Les apparitions d'humanoïdes, Ed. A. Lefeuvre, 1979, pp. 176-177) R. Pacaud thus revealed that it was a hoax. Angelo Girardo, the witness, having died, he had gone to see his wife. She told him that her husband had invented the story because he loved to make his friends laugh. Gérard Barthel and Jacques Brucker, in La grande Peur Martienne, also mentioned that we were dealing with a mystification, according to the statement of one of A. Girardo's sons. (OVNI Présence n° 36 January 1987).

#1954, October 3
FRANCE, Marcoing, Quend, Hérissart, elsewhere in the North
Between 8:00 and 8:45 PM, about forty witnesses saw two immobile balls of fire in the sky at 500 meters altitude, moving vertically at times. Suddenly they transformed into a kind of flying cigar horizontally almost out of sight, then returning to the initial spot in the form of a spinning top. Quite a long time after their definitive disappearance, a bright light persisted in the sky. (Jimmy GUIEU: Black-out sur les S.V." - FLEUVE NOIR 1956 - p. 182) IN REALITY:
At 9:30 PM the Moon was setting in a crescent in the southwest. Optical illusion caused by a stratus cloud formation. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 657 à 660)

#1954, October 3
Canada, near Rouyn
At the edge of Lake La Pause between Mont Brun and Preissac, a miner from Rouyn, around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, was about to leave for home. "Suddenly, I felt a strange tingling in my back and at the same time I saw that the water of the lake was rippling over a width of ten feet, there was a shadow advancing on the water. I looked up. About fifty feet above my head on the right I saw a kind of big copper or bronze cauldron, with small spikes in the metal, so close was the thing to me. I had never been so scared in my life. Without the slightest noise, flying at about ten miles an hour, the machine went to land on the edge of the lake in a small clearing. I didn't hesitate, I took the oars and headed for the craft, very agitated, because this was not normal. I was about fifty feet from the shore when I saw a door open in the round mass which was about thirty feet in diameter and twenty feet high. Two small and very agile men descended and began to pick up "mosses". It looked like they were wearing some kind of plastic bag on their heads and they had a white rubber suit on their whole body, I didn't see any "zipper". I was quite surprised and didn't dare make a move.<br/><br/>They picked up grass for a good ten minutes and sometimes they "gargled" words that I didn't hear very well. They had a strange way of bending over: the lower back bent "square" without having to round the back. They had their faces almost on the ground. Finally one of them straightened up completely facing the lake where I was. He raised his hand and I noticed that he had steel claws. He didn't move for a good ten minutes. Through the plastic I could clearly see his round and shiny eyes. I was sweating buckets out of fear, those two minutes were the longest of my life. Then with a supple step he ran towards the saucer, the other one ran too looking at me through his plastic bag. They closed a hatch in the side of the craft which immediately rose without a sound. The water began to ripple all around me. Then the thing became bright red, it overturned about half a mile from me and it left so quickly towards the sky that I could barely follow it with my eyes. (Jean FERGUSON: "All about Flying Saucers" ed.; Leméac, Ottawa, 1972, pp. 167-169)

#1954, October 4
FRANCE, Saint Perdoux
At 8:10 AM, Mr. Lacambre saw at 200 meters from his home, at the edge of the stream, a small being strangely dressed. It was small (90cm), brown, wearing a wide leather belt, leather shoes, and a slip. Under each arm it carried an object shaped like a pear. The witness returned home to take his hunting rifle. Sneaking back, he found the small being bent over, drinking a sip of water from the hollow of his hand. Then he picked up some stones and put them in his belt. Mr. Lacambre approached to within 12 meters and heard a sound pronounced by the creature: "ortou" or "ortin". It then flew vertically and in 30 seconds disappeared. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 116-117)

#1954, October 4
FRANCE, Villers le Tilleul (Flize)
Around 6 pm. Eliane Berteaux, a ten-year-old girl, had just driven the cows into a meadow. She was riding her bike back when: "A little ahead of me, about twenty meters to my left, I saw something like a camping tent. As I got closer I saw a hatch open on the top of this thing which wasn't a tent, but a 3m tall object that looked like a big egg. It was resting on the ground on a rectangular foot. The hatch was about 1m tall and 60cm wide. A small man appeared. He jumped to the ground. His head was surrounded by a square shape. His eyes were very piercing. His arms were hanging but seemed to be made of one piece, with the fingers welded together. He was wearing clothes with long, reddish-brown fur. He advanced towards me. I got scared and ran away without looking back." Mr. Antoine Barrois, 70 years old, saw a luminous object, very bright red, rise up but he didn't worry about it. Another witness heard a noise, a kind of buzzing. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975, J'ai Lu, p. 26, 27)

#1954, October 4
FRANCE, Chaleix
Mr. Garreau, a farmer, saw an object the size of a cart land in his field. Two men of normal size came out through a sliding door. They were wearing khaki uniforms and seemed to be of European type. They shook the witness's hand and said something like "Paris? North?" (according to another version they uttered incomprehensible words). They petted the witness's dog and left at an astonishing speed. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronicle of ET Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. I HAVE READ - p. 267) IN REALITY: It would be a mistake: landing of a NATO helicopter. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "UFO, First Complete Dossier..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 664, 665)

#1954, October 5
ITALY, Roverbella (Mantua)
An Italian fisherman was approached by a mysterious individual of human appearance, dressed in red, who spoke to him in a language incomprehensible to the fisherman. The stranger left before the Italian had time to call his wife. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black out on the S.V. - FLEUVE NOIR 1956 - p. 196)

#1954, 5 October
FRANCE, Loctudy (Finistère)
Pierre Lucas, a baker, was drawing water from a well at 4:00 in the morning when he noticed an object at some distance. It was a round object about 3 m in diameter from which emerged a dwarf with an oval face, covered in hair, with eyes as big as crow's eggs (or pigeon's eggs in Jimmy Guieu's version) who touched his shoulder and spoke to him in an unknown language. The dwarf left and the object flew away. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 268) Pierre Lucas, a baker's worker who was occupied in drawing water in the bakery courtyard suddenly observed, at some meters from him, a "flying saucer" of 3 meters in diameter placed on the ground. Astonished, he saw a creature of 1 m 20 in height come out of it who approached him before touching his shoulder while articulating incomprehensible words. Mr. Lucas kept his cool and headed towards the bakery, followed by the unknown. In the light, the witness was able to make out the strange visitor: he had an oval face, covered in dark hair, and, striking detail, enormous eyes. The young man immediately called his boss for help, but the creature re-entered its craft which took off immediately, leaving one to believe that it was not only more evolved than us in terms of technique, but also in terms of prudence... » (Jean François BOEDEC: «Les OVNI en Bretagne, Anatomie d'un Phénomène», ed. Fernand Lanore 1978, p. 103) 

#1954, 5 October 
FRANCE, Voilecomte - Mertrud (Haute Marne) 
At 7:15 the road worker Narcy saw an object near the road between Voilecomte and La Neuville. In his report to the police he declared to have seen a hairy dwarf, dressed in a kind of orange jacket, who went back on board the vessel whose one of the sections had the shape of a cigar under a flat disc. Between the two sections there was a porthole through which the entity entered the object. Traces were found at this place. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 269) He saw in a field a circular object of 10 m in diameter. "I was at a hundred meters. I stopped. I then saw a small being, 1.20 m tall who seemed to be dressed in a long-haired cloak. I lay down and I called. The little man turned around. He looked all around him, then he went into his machine. This one took off immediately and it disappeared in the clouds. At the moment of the take-off there was like a big vaporous commotion under the craft". (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 33, 34) IN REALITY: Mr. Narcy had invented this story to excuse himself for a delay to his work. The press published this denial. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 665)

#1954, October 6
FRANCE, L'Isle sur Suippes (Marne)
At around 6 o'clock, Joseph Roy was on his way to work by bike: the night was still very dark. He saw in front of him at low altitude a blinding light, which went out. When he arrived at the place where the light had disappeared, he saw in a field near the road, a kind of giant shell 3 m long, vaguely lit by some kind of portholes. In front of this machine was a small dark figure. The witness was scared. He literally sprinted to the gendarmerie. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 210, 211)

#1954, October 6
FRANCE, Cozes (between Bordeaux and Royan)
At around 11:30 PM, a woman riding a bicycle saw in a field next to the road an orange, then green light coming from an object shaped like a turtle with a dome on top. The light went out and she could see two human forms, one of them armed with a rod and seeming to look for something. Suddenly a strong light illuminated the object and the woman saw two small cyclops without noses, with flat faces but with two holes above their mouths. Frightened, the witness screamed and the object disappeared with a faint buzzing sound. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 128, 129)

#1954, October 7
FRANCE, Monteux (Vaucluse)
René Margaillan (Margaillou?) saw at 2:30 pm an object that had landed in a field. It was hemispherical and had a diameter of about 25 m (note from vog: all other authors say: 2.50 m). The witness felt short of breath and paralyzed. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 271) He saw a strange craft, stopped his team, blocked the brake and moved towards the phosphorescent apparatus. It was of metallic appearance and measured about 2.50 m high, and was roughly spherical in shape. Intrigued, the witness looked long at this spacecraft, then, suddenly, he saw nothing. The craft had spontaneously disappeared. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V. - FLEUVE NOIR- p. 198)

FRANCE, Hennezis
At around 6:30 pm, the two Lansellin children witnessed the landing of an object that was red and luminous, shaped like an egg on a black lid, and saw two occupants that looked like normal men, dressed in black and with faces too (sic). Frightened, they ran back home. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V. - FLEUVE NOIR- p. 199)

#1954, October 7
FRANCE, St Etienne sous Barbuise
Marcel Guyot was returning from work around 19:30 near this village. His son followed the same route ten minutes later. Both of them saw, at a level crossing, three objects on the ground, which were producing a bright white light. One of them was circular, the other had the shape of a cigar (note of vog: and the third?) (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 271) IN REALITY:
The local correspondent, in need of a copy, who was at the café where a story was being told, telephoned his editor the incredible story which was widely disseminated in the press. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 665, 666)

#1954, October 9
BELGIUM, Huy (not Braives) (Liège)
Mr. Welliquet, a postman, reported having seen an elongated craft in the countryside at the place called "La Belle Thérèse". Two people occupied the craft which rose into the air. ("Le Soir" 11.10.54 - list by Daniel BUKENS, Remicourt, Belgium.) The people had an appearance that was almost human. When questioned in 1967, the witness changed his statements and said he had only seen a streak in the sky. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 272) The real name of the postman is Williquet. He observed an object that was luminous and left a streak. The phenomenon was heading towards Waremme. All of this was seen from very far away. The rest is journalistic hoax. (GESAG, cat. 27, inquiry by Roger Lortihoir of 14.4.68)

#1954, October 9
FRANCE, Carcassonne
At 4:00 PM, Jean Bertrand saw while driving on the road in front of him a shiny metallic sphere. The upper half seemed to be made of a transparent plastic material. Two figures of human appearance were standing inside. The craft quickly rose and headed east. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronicle of ET Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 273)

#1954, October 9
FRANCE, Pournoy la Chétive (Moselle)
Three children who were roller skating around 6:30 pm, Gilbert Calda, Daniel and Jean-Pierre Hirsch, near the cemetery, saw an object land close to them. The object was near the cemetery resting on three legs, it had a diameter of approximately 2.50m. A dwarf of about 1.20m dressed in black, with a face covered in hair, large eyes, came out directing a blinding light at them and spoke some words in an unknown language. The children turned in time to see the object take off. Robert Magnin, 16 years old, observed the scene from afar. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 137) (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 273)

#1954, October 9
FRANCE, Lavoux (Vienne)
At 7:00 PM, Mr. Barrault was riding his bicycle when he suddenly saw a being dressed like a deep-sea diver directing two beams of light at him. He had no-heel boots and his eyes were very bright. He walked on the road for a minute then entered the forest. The witness was paralyzed during the duration of the incident. The being had a hairy chest and there were two lights, one above the other, in front of him. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 273, 274) IN REALITY: an investigation by L.D.L.N. showed that the witness had been the victim of a prank organized by an 18-year-old young man who had disguised himself and whom he had perfectly recognized. Everything else was just the invention of a journalist in need of a story. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 666)

#1954, October 9
FRANCE, Briatexte (Tarn)
At around 8:30 PM, on National Road 631, at La Caiffe, J.P. Mitto was returning from Toulouse with two other people when they saw two small beings, the size of an eleven year old child, crossing the road, about 5 meters in front of the car, and then jumping into a meadow. Immediately stopping, the witnesses saw a large convex disk rise vertically. It was about 6 meters in diameter, orange in color, and was literally sucked into the sky. There were brown and oily spots at its location. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronicle of ET Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 274) IN REALITY: "The Martians were us" This big headline had just concluded a series of hoaxes organized by two Parisian journalists, Messrs. Michel Agnelet and Pierre Laforêt. (...)

#October 9, 1954
GERMANY, outskirts of Munster
Willi HOGE, a cinema operator, saw in the evening, 50 m from the road in a field, a quite bright blue light. Believing it to be a crashed plane, he approached a bit and saw a cigar-shaped craft immobilized at 1.50m from the ground. The thing was surrounded by a bluish light. Under the craft he saw 4 men, about 120 cm tall, with a rather wide torso, and the head too big in relation to the body. They had thin legs and were dressed in a kind of suit resembling rubber. The witness did not approach any further, just observing. After ten minutes the creatures got back on board using some kind of ladder. Then the craft took off vertically, appearing then only as a shining disc. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V. - FLEUVE NOIR- p. 205, 206)

FRANCE, Quarouble
New observation by Marius Dewilde. "It was between 11:30 and noon when my three and a half year old son came to tell me that there was a car on the track. I went out: 50 meters away, a device of the same shape and size as a month earlier, was on the same track, but on the one that passes on the other side of the house. There was a rectangular opening at the base of the dome of the device. All around there was a series of bumps whose meaning I did not understand and a row of portholes. Beings dressed in dark gray overalls were busy around. I was advancing towards the device and a being came to meet me. He spoke in a foreign language. He stroked the child's head. Then the creature grabbed a chicken, stroked the child again. (..) A door closed the entrance and the object took off towards the east. (Henry DURRANT: "First Investigations on ET Humanoids" - Laffont 1977 - p. 54 to 58) (note from vog: Marius Dewilde died on October 1, 1996)

#1954, October 10
FRANCE, Marville-Moutier-Brule
At 6:15 Michel Toutain was riding his bicycle towards Blanville when his machine seemed to be struck by inertia, despite his owner's efforts. Intrigued, he got off his bike, turned it over, checked the derailleur, and got back on: impossible to make it move forward. 500m away to the right, a luminous object then caught his attention. It was a red ball with, 4m above it, a greenish part resembling the lid of a washing machine. Between this cabin which housed four silhouettes, a luminous point changed color in connection with the movements that this assembly then began to make. During a sudden change of direction it became green, then pink during a horizontal displacement, and disappeared while gaining altitude, becoming blue. During all this time, about fifteen minutes, the witness was still struggling with the bike, which had only gone 200m. At the moment of the object's disappearance, a luminous ball split into two parts. M. Josse, who was passing with his truck near a small wood, saw the final phase of this observation. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 141, 142)

In the night, the inhabitants of an isolated farm a few hundred meters from the village were awakened by an abnormal whistling. Through the shutters they distinguished a blinding light, fixed on the side of the hill. A few minutes later they saw a luminous ball rise vertically and disappear quickly. Police report. At 1:30 a.m. farmers were awakened by a whistling in Doncourt-Village, and saw a flat object land near the woods. Soon it rose very quickly vertically and flew away. The ground was scorched. The police took samples. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 275)

#1954, October 11
FRANCE, Corbigny - Sassier (Nièvre)
Near La Carie, MM Gallois and Vigneron in a truck felt an electric shock at 04:30, while the car headlights went out. They saw an object in the pastures about 50 m away. It was cylindrical and quite thick and three small beings were standing next to it. No visible light, except for a small reddish point. The two witnesses were paralyzed until the object left. Mr. Chaumeau, independently of the other two witnesses, saw a luminous object flying over the woods of La Carie. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL.

A round object 4 m in diameter landed in a meadow. It emitted a powerful red light and took off with tremendous acceleration when witnesses Carrière, a garage owner, Gardelle, a farmer, Ginestre, a shoemaker, and two other people approached. Mr. Gardelle felt an electric shock. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 277, 278) IN REALITY: an investigation by L.D.L.N. showed that the garage owner Carrière had taken advantage of his equipment to deceive several of his friends. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

At 10:30 PM Spirite Stramare returned home and saw near an intersection,
an engine of blue color composed of two superimposed discs. They have the
approximate dimension of a "gardener's umbrella". Three small beings stand
next to it. They wear dark gray, tight uniforms and are wearing aviator helmets. Frightened Stramare
gets off his bike and runs to hide behind a tree, about twenty
meters from the engine. The three beings enter between the two
discs, the upper disc lowers revealing an antenna
about 1.50m high and the device takes off with a noise similar to
that caused by a small electric motor. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face
to the extraterrestrials" - DELARGE 1975 - I Read p. 171) IN REALITY: the
witness had to do with one of the hoaxes organized by the
journalists of "Saturday Evening" who were at that time at the
intersection of the roads of Fronton and Villemur, equipped with their
diving suits and all the equipment: rockets, fireworks etc..
to play "Martians". Note that the witness saw three beings, while
the journalists were only two. (M. FIGUET / J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni,

Jules Martin, a colonial teacher on leave, observed two beautiful "Martians" near an object on the ground. The two women were wearing leather boots and gloves, as well as shiny helmets. Before leaving, they kindly agreed to give an autograph to the teacher. (Saturday Evening of 14.10.54 - comm. J.L.

At dawn, around 04:00, Ange Hurle and Pierre Vidal see a giant rocket taking off about a hundred meters from their house, emitting an intense light. The two men go to the place where the craft took off. The grass is compressed on a circular surface of 5 meters in diameter. In the center, four footprints appear to have been left by the feet of a heavy machine. Air police investigation. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 112)

Mrs. Yvonne XXX saw at 6:20 a white ball three meters in diameter, seemingly transparent, descend to 50 cm from the ground and 60 to 70 m from her. Inside this object she saw two silhouettes, one larger than the other. It seemed to be two men wearing some kind of suit. (M. FIGUET/J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, premier dossier complet..." - ed.

In the evening, Mr. Laugère saw a metal object in the shape of a torpedo resting on the ground, near a gas-oil tank. A small being covered in fur was standing next to it, emitting incomprehensible sounds. Mr. Laugère went to get some friends. When they returned, the craft had disappeared. (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 105) IN REALITY: It was some railway workers who had decided to play a good joke on a too credulous colleague. One of them had dressed in an old goat skin and, while grunting, had waved a lamp in front of Mr. Laugère, while another railway worker fired off a firework rocket to simulate the departure of the UFO.

A saucer landed in the morning in the capital where it attempted to abduct a terrified man. Gashim Faili declared that upon waking he had discovered the saucer 18 m away from him, parked in the middle of the street in a populous area in the south of the city. Emitting a magnetic force, the flying saucer tried to draw him aboard, but his screams alerted the neighbors, forcing the pilot of the craft to take off. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V." - FLEUVE NOIR 1956 - p. 209). An object in the shape of a disc approaches very close to the ground in a heavily populated area. Chasim Faili, one of those who observed the event, screams when he thinks he is going to be kidnapped; a crowd gathers and the craft takes off. The report continues with a description of the operator of the machine, who is said to have been small and dressed in black. (Charles BOWEN: "En quête des humanoïdes" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 51)

At 9:00 PM, farmer Franzesko Beuc saw an object and a pilot of small size entering the craft. It glided along the road for 30 meters then quickly rose up. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 278)
The farmer returned to the farm and saw a vehicle resembling a 4CV supported by 4 wheels of 40cm in diameter, motionless on the side of the road. A meter away from the craft, he found himself face to face with a small being wearing a cap and leather clothing. Having addressed this mysterious visitor, the latter quickly climbed into the craft which, after rolling for about thirty meters on the road, took off like an airplane and gained altitude. (M.

Mr. Jean Marty witnessed the landing of a luminous disc. After the disappearance of this craft, the witness discovered "laid on the grass" two sheets of glossy white paper, covered with printed letters. They were two sheets of a brochure written in Indochinese which mentioned the entries of ships into the ports of Indochina as well as the arrivals of fish.

saw at 4 pm (10:30 pm?) a flying craft land in a meadow. "It looked like a cigar and it shone like a glowworm. I was about
ten meters away and I didn't dare approach. There was a man right next to it, dressed in grey. He had boots on his feet. He looked gentle and he approached me. In one hand he was carrying a ball that was shooting out little violet flashes. He took off his hat and scratched his forehead, he put the other hand on my shoulder and said to me kindly: "Look, but don't touch." Then, laughing, he got back into the craft and flew away."

BELGIUM, Monceau Imbrechies (Hainaut)
A small RAF training aircraft crashed around 8 o'clock, near the village of Monceau Imbrechies on the Franco-Belgian border. The pilot is unharmed, but other troubles await him. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Brussels has indeed declared that the aircraft in question had been stolen that morning from the Avanton Morley airfield in Norfolk. The pilot, a young soldier of the RAF, flew as long as his tank had fuel, then he tried to land but did so so badly that he completely damaged the plane. Safely out of the wreckage he went to the nearest farm. The alerted gendarmes brought the adventurous aviator to Chimay where he is detained pending the arrival of the British Air detachment, Colonel Peter Townsend. In any case, the incident caused some excitement in the village: the peasants working in the fields had taken the Englishman for a Martian landed from a flying saucer. Indeed, the young man was disheveled, dirty, and spoke an "unknown" language (La nouvelle Revue de Lausanne (GESAG cat. n° 1822).

Mr. Carcenac observed a strange white object at a high altitude. He looked at it through binoculars and saw a kind of flexible, wavy disk moving very quickly. This thing exploded in mid-air while a much smaller object seemed to emerge from the mass, following its trajectory south. The fragments of the wavy disk scattered in the sky and began to fall gently like shreds of fabric or paper. All the witnesses of this strange explosion rushed to collect the silver filaments clustered like spider webs and crumbling under their fingers. Part of it was deposited at the gendarmerie. This strange material sublimated without leaving any traces. (Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - p. 223,224) IN REALITY: the journalists of "Samedi-Soir" had launched a rocket which, on its return, had made the witnesses believe in the fall of "Virgin's threads".

At 7:35 PM, three witnesses, MM Olivier, Pérano and another witness, saw
a 4 m diameter disc and a small humanoid being in a diving suit. In relation to the body it had a large head and two enormous eyes. The clothing shone and glimmered like glass. The craft was
surrounded by a kind of misty brightness. One of the witnesses approached
up to 20 m of the craft where he was paralyzed, while the craft
took off at great speed throwing him to the ground. (Jacques Vallée:

(Michel BOUGARD: "From SV to UFOs" SOBEPS 1976 - p. 211) IN REALITY:
Returning from Graulhet, the journalists from "Samedi-Soir" decided to
have fun at the expense of the Toulousains. Wearing their diving suits they maneuvered in front of a red Bengal fire and
fired a fireworks rocket. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "UFO,

A group of young boys, including one named Bastiaan, were returning in the evening towards the village, after having played all afternoon in the heather. Bastiaan, who had stopped to tie the laces of his shoes, straightened up when he heard the cries of his friends. Like them, he then saw at a few hundred meters in the sky, above the pines, a strange thing. Nobody thought of fleeing. It was round, terribly large, at least twenty meters, and motionless, oscillating slightly above our heads, Bastiaan specifies. At this moment, the witness believes that he and his companions were immobilized by fear. The surprise passed, the boys then ran towards a young oak grove, in which they hid lying on the ground. As strange as it may seem, everything was silent, no branch moved, even the crows were silent. Slowly the phenomenon began to descend to remain in hover at a good meter from the ground. According to Bastiaan it was totally made like an airplane, of aluminum, round, without rivets or welds, but showing small windows on the circumference, like portholes. All topped with a protrusion of glass, a dome perhaps made of plastic. Then, coming out of the machine, one does not know how, three small creatures appeared. They looked like dwarves. They could not be taller than one meter to one meter twenty and wore a gray-green diving suit, topped with a large round helmet, which suggested that they had large heads. One could not see their face, partly hidden by the glass part of the helmet. Moreover, Bastiaan specifies, night was falling. At this moment, one of the boys, Pierre, son of the postmaster, stood up, arms outstretched as if to surrender. But he suddenly started to moan, trembling on his legs. Surprised, the creatures then looked in the direction of the young boys and returned to their craft which began to oscillate. The thing reddened, illuminating the heather and the first trees of the wood. The next moment there was nothing.

At dusk, farmer Duvivier observed the landing of an orange sphere. He approached it. It had the shape of a flattened dome, a diameter of about 5.50m and emitted a blinding light illuminating the countryside in a radius of 200 meters. It was transparent and inside one could see a dark silhouette. After staying at ground level for ten minutes, it flew away to the north; while at its location a bright cloud descended gently to the ground. On returning home, the witness noticed that his clothes were covered with a white film of adhesive substance, roughly similar to paraffin.

Early in the morning a bright object crossed the sky coming from the west, followed by thousands of spectators, most of whom thought they had seen a flying saucer. (...) there are no two reports that are alike (...) A schoolmaster was able to take two photos of the object: it was big, bright and reddish in color (...) "I saw the object," said Janos Horvath, "it moved faster than any plane can do in horizontal flight while I was on Vaspaya Street. It emitted a green light like that of a flare, but after ten seconds it suddenly went out."

At 6:00 PM, the witnesses saw an object shaped like a cigar resting on the ground. Length approximately 30 m, height 6 m. A fog enveloped the ends. Through the portholes the witnesses could make out helmeted silhouettes. Could this be the same craft seen a little later in Nîmes? (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 77) IN REALITY: according to OVNI Présence n°33/34 December 1985: it would be a "slow bolide" seen all over France and elsewhere. ANOTHER REALITY? Hoax that ends badly for at least one of the witnesses. Ottoviani is indeed prosecuted in the Correctional Court for slander. (Erich ZURCHER: "Les apparitions d'Humanoïdes" - ed.

A farmer who was leading cows to the pond suddenly saw an object flying above his house. The terrified cows scattered, throwing the farmer's daughter to the ground, while the object emitted a jet of light. The farmer ran into his house and fainted, while three other witnesses saw the craft depart. The machine was dark, surrounded by short blue and yellow flames. It had the shape of an egg and flew at about 15 meters from the ground. It was an intense source of heat. The small pond was found dried up and haystacks caught fire, while the livestock suffered from strange burns. (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 55). On October 16th near Rovigo, several peasants saw a metallic disc about ten meters in diameter descending slowly towards them, hovering. Terrified, the men fled, hiding among the nearby bushes. The craft landed about a hundred meters away from them. After a few minutes of immobility it took off vertically in a silent flight, quickly accelerating its speed. At the place where it had landed, the peasants discovered a fairly deep crater 6 m in diameter and they noticed that six poplars had been carbonized in the surroundings.

When she arrived at the top of a small hill, she found herself facing a craft on the ground at a very short distance. Almost at the same time, she fainted. When she regained consciousness, the craft had disappeared. She managed to return home but had to go to bed. A strange dermatosis appeared which would not disappear until very slowly: for several days the young woman's skin resembled a frog's skin.

Veterinarian Henri Robert, who was crossing the village in his car, saw at nightfall 4 objects at about 300 m altitude, flying slowly in formation. Suddenly, one of them fell to the ground with a movement of a falling leaf, 10 m from the witness who felt an electric shock while his engine stopped, his headlights went out and the car stopped while the object touched the ground. Unable to move, Dr. Robert saw a figure of about 1.20 m tall moving in the light of the object, then everything became dark. Some time later the headlights came back on by themselves and Dr. Robert saw the craft take off towards the north. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronicle of ET Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 283-284) He saw at a distance of 2.5 km and at 300 m altitude 4 overlapping circles of orange color. The one at the top detached itself from the group at a dizzying speed and rushed towards me, in two seconds it was placed a few meters in front of the vehicle zigzagging close to the ground. At the same time I feel a very strong electric shock. My car does not obey me, it is like crazy. This lasted about fifteen seconds, then the craft left towards the group which immediately disappeared. But the witness's emotions are not over. He tells: "Arriving at Bailleur-Neville, at the crossroads of La Motte, 3.5 km from the first appearance, 150 m in front of me, in my headlights, I see a being about 1.20m tall, quite corpulent, arms and legs spread apart. I barely have time to notice that his clothes are grayish blue, because the headlights go out. They come back on 2 to 3 seconds later, but the little being has disappeared. Instinctively I accelerate and have time to see on the edge of the embankment, a cylindrical craft that took off at that moment and rose quickly towards the north. "(Pierre DELVAL: "Contacts of the 4th type" - De Vecchi 1979, p. 195, 196) IN REALITY: According to Claude MAUGE, this case would be more than doubtful. It would be one of those cases where it is known that the witness is either alcoholic, or drugged or mentally ill. This case should therefore be taken with the greatest caution.

Emerging from the side of the road an object gray in color about 1.50 meters in diameter flew over him. The mare rose to a height of 3 meters and the witness had to let go of the bridle. Then the animal fell like a mass and was unable to move for 10 minutes. Finally she got up and tried to walk, but she was trembling with fear. The object had long since flown away at great speed.

The stories reported in the newspapers often have no basis in reality. Such is the case with this one from Reuters: Two motorcyclists near Toulon suddenly saw a flying saucer parked in the middle of the road. Mariro Rapellini and Pierre Ottoviani explained that as they slowly approached the saucer, which was only resting on two feet, a man of average height wearing a gray jumpsuit emerged. They began a polite conversation in French, and the occupant assured them that he was not a Martian but French. He asked for directions and after receiving them he entered his saucer which flew away with a loud noise. ("UFO's: A Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 231)

Ms. Paquet was tending to her cows at the place called "Côte de la Chambre" around 10 o'clock. To her astonishment, she heard a language she couldn't understand, a conversation coming from a heather field. Then two men emerged and approached to about fifty meters from Ms. Paquet. One of them turned towards Mr. Blanchon's mill, gave a cry, accompanied by a gesture. Two other men then appeared, descending towards the small Rozeille river, joining the two first and all of them disappeared. A quarter of an hour later, Ms. Paquet's dog started barking and she saw a dark-colored cigar-shaped craft rise without a sound, disappearing at a reduced speed towards the southwest. The men were about 1m80 tall and were wearing black or dark blue overalls. (FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, premier dossier complet..." - éd. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 184, 185)

At 5:30 PM, the gamekeeper Bachelard was driving in a van, it was still daylight. Coming out of a bend, Mr. Bachelard felt a strange numbness, a kind of paralysis. At the same time, the engine of the vehicle was misfiring and running out of breath. The speed dropped to 30 km/h. It was then that he saw in a nearby field off the road a large cigar with pointed ends, about ten meters long, about 2.50m high, of brown chocolate color with drawings in the shape of rectangles that seemed to grid the ends. The object was motionless, silent, without light or porthole. A few minutes later, Mr. Bachelard, without knowing how, found himself in Couhay, off his normal route. Farmers saw him arrive with a pale and decomposed face, obviously under the effect of intense fear. For several weeks the witness did not dare to go out in the evening or pass through the same place again.

Albert Géraud, 15 years old, was riding his bicycle on the D216 when he saw a light that changed from green to yellow. It descended in jerks and reached the road. Frightened, the witness felt his legs paralyzed. The saucer was on the ground and inside was a small being covered in hair from head to toe, looking at Albert: its eyes were big. Suddenly the object rose, causing a strong gust of wind towards the witness and disappeared in the direction of Lion d'Angers. The witness was prostrated for several days. (FIGUET/ J.L.

Labassière and other people saw at 9 pm two discs in the sky: one was orange, the other red and a kind of luminous green bridge connected them. They landed, a dwarf came out of each craft, and went into the other without any sign being exchanged. After this change of pilots, the two objects flew away in a dazzling flash. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 285, 286) "We saw, flying at low altitude, a luminous object in the shape of a balance. It was the swaying of the two objects that suggested to us the image of a balance" report the motorists who stop to see what it is. After a few seconds, the luminous beam uniting the two plates dissipates, disappears. They land on the ground not far from the witnesses who see in the luminosity of each of the two crafts, two small beings (so: 4 beings in total). The two crews head towards each other, cross without stopping and change of craft. The two balls then take off in a dizzying way and disappear in a few seconds. (FIGUET/ J.L.

A farmer saw a bright disc descend onto the roof of his farm, slow down for a moment, then speed away. This brief encounter stunned the unfortunate peasant: indeed, his watering trough had been emptied in a flash and the docile cow that had the misfortune of being in the path of the object went into a wild dance in which it seriously injured itself.

At 02:30 Lazlo Ujvari was suddenly confronted by a man wearing a jacket, boots, and a helmet like a pilot, who pointed a gun at him and said something he couldn't understand. When Ujvari spoke to him in Russian, the man responded in the same language, asked if he was in Spain or Italy and how far away he was from Germany. When he asked for the time and Ujvari replied "2:30", the man took out his watch and said "You're lying, it's 4 o'clock". Then he wanted to know how far away and in what direction Marseille was. He made Ujvari walk in front of him on the road and they approached a gray vessel with an antenna on top (2.5 m in diameter, 1.50m high). When they were about 30 m away, the stranger ordered him to move away. He obeyed but looked back from time to time and saw the object rise straight up, with a sewing machine noise, then take an oblique trajectory.

At 4:45 PM, Jennie Roestenberg and her two children had observed an object in the shape of a disc, aluminum in color, while it hovered above their house. She declared that she had seen, through two transparent panels, two men with white skin, long hair falling on their shoulders and a forehead so wide that all features seemed to be gathered in the lower part of their faces. They wore transparent helmets and blue-turquoise clothing that reminded of a ski outfit. The object hovered at an inclined angle, while the two occupants examined the scene "severely, not in an unfriendly way, but almost sadly, with compassion".

A man who had just put his car in the garage saw a strange being dressed in a luminous garment, about one meter twenty tall, standing near a tree. When the creature saw the motorist, it sent him a beam from some kind of torch. The witness remained paralyzed until he made a movement to tighten the fist that held the garage keys, which seemed to free him. He leapt forward to attack the creature, which rose from the ground and flew away in a nearly silent whirl. The 37-year-old witness arrived home in such a state of depression that he had to go to bed with a high fever.

The students of Jerome Primary School saw in the blue sky an object shining in the shape of a cigar, which was making circular movements at a great altitude. The object stopped and then left at great speed. Then beautiful tufts of a soft white like cotton fell and this lasted three quarters of an hour. They were long fibers like angel hair for Christmas trees. By holding them at the ends they could be stretched without breaking, where they were stretched they became shiny. The part held in the hand disappeared very quickly, but one could make a small ball by rolling a thread between the fingers. After a while the fingers became green. This disappeared by washing with hot water. In one place there was even a canopy of filaments above the road. (Inforespace #52 of 1980 p. 8) During a football match, 15,000 spectators observed a passage of flying saucers that dropped a substance similar to spun sugar or angel hair.

(Jacques Vallée: "Chronicle of ET Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL. J'AI LU - p. 280) ... completely covered in fur, oval eyes, the whites protruding considerably from the orbits. The nose flattened at the base. He had a kind of cap on his head with a ruffle around the forehead, from which very long hairs escaped. He seemed to have no fingers and his shiny, closed hands held two "metal rods" about 30 cm long. Casimir Stawski heard a noise of broken branches: he then saw in the middle of a thicket two tubes shining like nickel. He approached and then distinguished the tawny mane, then the humanoid, who approached without speaking. Casimir fled at full speed. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, First Complete Dossier..." ed.

He could see inside the craft, which resembled a submarine, four small occupants and some "furnishings". One of them came out and approached the witness: its head reached the level of Szimura's shoulder. They exchanged a handshake. It spoke to him in a language resembling Chinese for a few minutes. The witness was scared and dazzled by the craft. Then the being returned to the craft, which flew away at a dizzying speed.

Colonel Carmelo Papotto was making his usual inspection tour of the farm guards in the early morning when, as he approached a recently plowed area, he saw something like a snowflake silently descend from the sky to the ground. The object landed a few tens of meters away from him. It had the shape of an aerodynamic car with a tail like a rudder. The fuselage was 6 m long and 3 m wide. The lower part of the craft seemed to be made of a metal with a color similar to aluminum. The upper part, made of a transparent material, was divided into sections. On the nose there were two lateral headlights and in the center, a small external ladder. The object seemed to rest on 6 wheels, 4 in front in pairs and 2 in the back. Carmelo Papotto, having approached, seemed to also glimpse under the fuselage two horn-shaped tubes and on it he distinguished at the prow and stern two rods similar to radio antennas. Cylindrical tubes came out of the rear part, similar to machine gun barrels. The object was illuminated as if it were in broad daylight by a very white light that radiated with a halo of about 4 m. Inside, 6 men were fully dressed in yellow and had their faces covered. "One of them had a human face, because he had to uncover it to blow into a tube" Curiosity pushed Papotto to approach the object but, having put his foot on the small ladder to see more closely, a violent electric discharge that passed through his hand on contact with the metal of the ladder, pushed him back. One of the pilots gesticulating in his direction invited him to stay calm. Another one removed a wheel and then put it back, pushing a button that lowered a kind of casing on it. Inside, seats, control consoles, and a kind of radio device manipulated by a man wearing a cap with electrical wires were glimpsed. The crew was so busy around the internal mechanisms of the craft that Papotto was able to draw a sketch of the object on a cigarette packet. After about twenty minutes the craft rose from the ground without making any noise; vertically up to about fifty meters and then, at a dizzying speed, disappeared to the west. (...)

This individual directed two blue beams of light towards him and he was thrown back. No craft was observed. (Jacques Vallée: "Chronique des apparitions ET" - DENOEL 1972 - COLL.

ITALY, outskirts of Milan
A resident of Milan returning from an outdoor cinema, noticed a
glow inside a sports field surrounded by a rather dilapidated wooden
fence. He had seen a fairly large object that shone like a very weak
fluorescent lamp, resting on the ground. He had seen small dark shapes
moving between the object and him. Frightened, he had ridden his
bicycle at full speed towards the outskirts. 500 m further on he had
encountered a group of peasants to whom he told his story. They all
went back to the scene together. The peasants had seen the object and
the beings like him. There must have been 25 of them, no more than a
meter tall, all wearing a bulky apparatus connected to the front of
their transparent helmet. They wore light-colored pants, gray jackets.
Several cars and a truck loaded with rotten fruits had stopped to see
what was attracting people along the fence, some people had broken
down the door and entered the field. Seeing this, the little beings
threw themselves into the object entering it through the base and a
moment later the object buzzed, rose up not fast enough to avoid the
peasants throwing dozens of rotten oranges at it, some of which had
reached their target. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" -

Suddenly two "Martians" 1 m tall, dressed in a diving suit, appeared in front of her, babbling incomprehensible words and seizing the flowers. They then quickly went towards a hemispherical craft 2 to 3 m high which was located not far away in a meadow, which took off immediately. Mrs. Lotti filed a complaint and the carabinieri who came to the scene discovered traces. (Jimmy GUIEU: "Black-out sur les S.V." - FLEUVE NOIR 1956 - p. 233) On November 1 around 6:30 pm Rosa Lotti met two strange creatures (...)

They had beautiful eyes and seemed very intelligent and friendly. They had big protruding teeth, a bit like those of a rabbit. (...) The oldest one took her bouquet of flowers, gave her two carnations back and went to carry the others into the saucer. (...)

At 6 in the morning, it was raining, soldiers Christophe De Devi and Zopina were going to get milk when they heard a faint humming sound like that of a "solex". A white spherical object, like chrome metal, was resting on the ground near a ravine. At its circumference shone an orange-colored luminous band. It had a tail similar in shape to the rudder of an airplane. The military approached to within 10 meters. A man was in a kind of circular passage located at the bottom of the craft. He was wearing a pilot's suit, had curly hair and a tanned complexion. A door opened and a second man jumped out, he looked strangely like the first and addressed him in a language unknown to the two witnesses. These two "men" then headed towards the military who fled, only stopping in front of the chapel of the hospital. There they found their comrades, soldier Roch and nurse Issoujon who were returning from the kitchens. All four saw the UFO take off and gain altitude at a lightning speed.

One of them held a box that emitted a three-meter-long beam of light. The other two held objects that looked like weapons. Another witness felt tingling on his face as he ran away. Four photos of the scene were taken. After the object left, a whitish substance and a three-meter-diameter circle remained on the ground, where the soil had the appearance of ash.

At the height of the Blauwe Toren (Blue Tower) and the St Joseph dairy, he suddenly saw a blinding light coming from the sky, landing with a slight noise on the concrete road. At that moment the light went out and the craft remained motionless for two minutes. Roelants, who had suddenly braked, found himself 50 meters from the object and did not dare to approach it any closer. A few moments later the thing rose vertically and then moved away towards Holland. During the ascent the light was visible again. After the departure of the object, Roelants approached the landing site to examine the area with his flashlight. He discovered no trace that could justify that a flying saucer had landed there. He nevertheless claims that at the same place he picked up a small elongated box containing a parchment covered with unreadable writing. (Brugsche Courant 10.11.54) On November 3, 1973, the witness was found and contacted at his home and, with the help of Jean Bastide, the GESAG was able to determine that the small ivory case contained an extract in Hebrew from Deuteronomy XI 12-21 and constituted a mezuza, a Jewish religious protection fixed near the house or worn around the neck of the believer. There would probably be no connection between the observation and the find. (GESAG cat. No. 197)

[IN REALITY: The exact date remains confused, even after the GESAG investigation of 11 and 12.4.70, GS 2481, on 11.6.71 the GESAG received a letter: it would have been a joke organized by Pipers' friends, the affair was mentioned in the press which did not report it. cfr GESAG INFOLINK of April 1996, "Les incidents de type I en Belgique dans le cours de l'année 1954"] (GESAG, cat. n° 38 ref.

SPAIN, MadridBetween 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning Alberto
Sanmartin meets an entity from another planet 1 km from Moncloa Square, on the bridge overlooking the highway to La Coruna. The mysterious being wears a transparent one-piece suit covering him entirely. He has long blond hair falling in curls on his shoulders. He is as beautiful as an ancient statue. He puts a hand on Sanmartin's shoulder, signals him to wait, and near the bridge an staircase appears which the stranger takes and disappears into the darkness. After 3 to 4 minutes he returns, squeezes Sanmartin's hand so hard that he does not understand, then takes the staircase again and disappears.
A dark saucer, without any light, then takes off from somewhere near the bridge. In Sanmartin's hand a violet stone with yellow spots and a sign painted in violet. The stone measures 12 x 4 x 2 cm. (continued on November 16, 1957) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998) A space stone given by an extraterrestrial to the Midrilene nurse Alberto Sanmartin. (Semenario Pueblo Magazine, Madrid, Saturday 29.9.1956) Two of the nine symbols engraved on the stone show the fuselage of a UFO. (Lou Zinnsstag: "The Violet Stone Tablet" p. 117 to 121)

INDIA, Kariambkam (Madras)
One hundred people witnessed the passage of a flying saucer at 8:30 PM. The object flew slowly and was described as "a flying boat" with a bright light at the back. Amazingly, the object approached the ground and landed vertically. Three people "dressed in Western clothing" emerged and waved their hands, causing the people to panic and lock themselves in their houses. The craft stayed on the ground for five minutes and then took off vertically, flying away at great speed. ("UFO's: A Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 232, 233)

VENEZUELA, Petare, Caracas
Gustavo Gonzales and José Ponce were in the cabin of a truck driving towards Petare, in the outskirts of Caracas, around 2 o'clock in the morning to pick up fresh vegetables to sell at the market in the early morning. They found the road blocked by a luminous object in the shape of a disk that was 2 m off the ground. Gonzales had stopped the truck and the two men sat for a moment looking at the strange object in amazement. Then, driven by the same impulse, they both got out and approached the object. When they were about 7 m away, they had seen coming towards them what had seemed to be a kind of hairy dwarf. Gonzales had grabbed the creature and lifted it. It weighed about 16 kilos. The little being had freed itself and had given Gonzales a shoulder blow that had sent him sprawling on his back. Not waiting for anything else, Ponce had run to the police station. Before Gonzales could get up, the little adversary had jumped a meter in the air and had dived onto Gonzales who then noticed that his eyes shone in the truck's headlights like a cat's yellow eyes. Having managed to get on one knee, Gonzales had taken out a knife and when the creature had sent him a punch, he had noticed that instead of hands, it had webbed and clawed extremities. He had tried to stab it with his blade, but the knife slid as if on steel. Another of the little men had come out of the craft and had pointed at Gonzales a small tube with a bright light beam. Blinded, Gonzales had thought he was dead. When he had regained his sight he had seen the object rise above the trees and disappear into the night. Fortunately for the witnesses, a doctor from Caracas who had been called for a night consultation had seen everything and he agreed to make a statement. (Frank EDWARDS: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 157 à 159) In the middle of the night, in the outskirts of Caracas, two truck drivers see their road blocked by a big luminous sphere. One of them tries to capture a small hairy and clawed being that approaches, but he is pushed back and then blinded by the weapon of another dwarf. Two other creatures carrying various samples return to the UFO which takes off and disappears. (Science et Vie, special edition 1997: 50 years of UFO, Atlas of Unsolved Cases, p. 60 to 63)

FRANCE, Belle Hôtesse near Beaufort
The Mozin couple were on their way back to Maubeuge around midnight. In the distance, they saw lights on top of a small hill and thought there had been an accident. They quickly covered the distance to the light and discovered, 100 m away, on the side of the R.N.2, a craft, with an open door, and inside a "Michelin Man" seeming to move slowly on the threshold. The craft, a kind of large shell, rested on feet, was of a whitish metallic color like galvanized sheet metal and on the walls were vertical lines spaced 10 cm apart. The being, about 1 m 20 tall, resembled the Michelin Man: it was very large, with boudins around the arms and legs. Wearing large boots, it had a bulky helmet almost as wide as its shoulders, giving it a large head. The light came from the open door and spread onto the road. The interior was a non-blinding white. The witnesses saw conduits or large cables going down into the craft with some kind of handles or switches. They began their observation from a distance of 100 m and passed close by, at 4 or 5 m. The car headlights went out as soon as they were a hundred meters away, but the engine did not stop. When they had passed the thing by a hundred meters, the headlights came back on without the driver intervening. (L.D.L.N. "Mysterious Flying Saucers" - ALBATROS-ETAPES 1973 - pp. 119-122)

Philip Molava, 13 years old, was outside late at night, feeding his rabbits. He then saw a small ovoid disk flying nearby. The next day he was very ill, taken to the hospital, and the doctors suspected food poisoning. The boy was in bed, partially paralyzed. He reported that around two in the morning, three veiled silhouettes materialized next to his bed, in a kind of fog and then he lost consciousness. In any case, the next day he was completely healed. He tells me that following this event he has frequent astral outings, OBEs and receives telepathic messages concerning the dangers faced by humanity. (Randles 1988)

Mr. Charles Noel Martin, an atomic physicist, in a communication to the Academy of Sciences on the long-term effects of experimental thermonuclear explosions, addressed the UFO phenomenon. According to the atomist, the atomic mushroom which is strongly ionized will fragment and be carried by the winds around the Earth, this ionization can be the origin of plasma ball formations.

BRAZIL, Linha da Vista (Venancio Aires)
Farmer Olmira Da Costa e Rosa was tending to his green bean plantations when he observed a stranger standing near a machine that was almost on the ground and resembled a cream-colored colonial helmet surrounded by a fog. It made a sound similar to that of a sewing machine. Another individual was examining the fence, while a third was inside the apparatus, head and arms visible. As the witness dropped his pitchfork, one of the men picked it up and returned it to him after examining it. The unknowns entered the machine, motioning to the witness not to approach, and flew away. They were of normal size, had wide shoulders, long hair, very white skin, and slanted eyes. They wore brown jumpsuits and shoes without heels.

VENEZUELA, between Chico and Cerro de la Tres Torres
Jesus Gomez and Lorenzo Flores were hunting rabbits along the road. Having fired all their cartridges, they decided to go back. They noticed in the bushes, at a short distance, a shining object. They thought it was a car that had gone off the road. They went into the bushes to take a look. They found themselves a few meters away from an object resembling two huge shiny bowls connected by the edge. In their opinion it was 3 m in diameter, it stood 1 m from the ground and was spitting fire from the base.
"Then we saw four little men come out. They were about 90 cm tall. When they saw us they all four grabbed Jesus and tried to drag him towards the object. I could only grab my empty gun and hit one of them with it. It seemed like the gun had hit something hard like rock. I hurt my hands and my gun broke. It was too dark to see their features, but they had a lot of hair on their body and were very strong." When he was seized by the little men Gomez had been stunned by something. Flores had dragged his friend onto the road and when Gomez had come to his senses they had run as fast as they could to the police station where they arrived with their clothes all torn and bearing deep scratches.

Near the location of the observation of December 9, Pedro Morais heard his chickens stirring and saw an object "which had a bottom like a huge polished copper cauldron" hovering. In a nearby field he saw two small human-like beings, dressed in a kind of "yellow sack", take a tobacco plant and a chicken, then fly away leaving the farmer amazed.

VENEZUELA, San Carlos.
In the evening three friends stopped in the park of the Ministry of Agriculture of San Carlos. Jesus Paz had barely taken 10 steps when he called his friends for help. They found him lying on the ground, unconscious and bleeding. Not far from him, they saw a small furry creature of human shape fleeing in the direction of a shiny saucer-shaped object resting on the grass. One of Paz's companions, Luiz Meija, a member of the National Guard, had barely time to pick up a stone and throw it at the disc when it began to rise with a loud roar. Paz was taken to the city hospital and the doctors declared him to be in shock. He had long and deep scratches on his right side and along his spine. They looked like claw marks. He told the police that he was heading towards a flower bed, his steps muffled by the thick grass, when suddenly he almost stumbled upon a furry creature examining the flowers. He had tried to avoid it, but the creature had attacked him first by scratching and tearing his shirt, then by hitting him on the neck, which had knocked him out.

According to John Keel in 'Operation Trojan Horse' in 1954, Dr. Charles A. Langhead of the University of Michigan had telepathic communications with Asthar, a high-ranking member of the Intergalactic Federation. The entity told him the world would end on December 21, 1954, but assured him and his family would be saved by a spaceship. On the appointed day, the doctor and his family went to the agreed-upon place. They are still waiting.... (Jean SIDER: "Ovni, les envahisseurs démasqués", ed. RAMUEL 1999, p 77)
