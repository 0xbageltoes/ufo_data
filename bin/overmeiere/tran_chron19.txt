AUSTRALIA, near Warragamba, New South Wales.
A camper was woken in the night by a loud humming. In a clearing he saw an egg-shaped object, glowing with a white light. Dark, human-like silhouettes were moving around. The beings entered the object, the light went out and the egg flew away. (MYSTERIOUS AUSTRALIA by Rex Gilroy, Nexus Publishing, Mapleton, Qnld., 1995, page 22- Keith Baskerfield)

USA, Old Niver Road, Willard (Ohio)
Richard Williams said he observed an object 25 to 30 feet in shape of a diamond, equipped with white lights and two exhaust nozzles. The object initially looked like a bat, with wings wider than those of an airplane. In the middle of each wing it seemed there was a missile or a nozzle. The object had red and white lights on the wings and tail. (note of vog: did it perhaps look like a Convair Delta trainer?... or another plane of the same kind?) The object hovered first at about 100 feet from the ground before catapulting upwards. He thought he could make out a creature inside the object. In the back of the cockpit there was a blinking light. The sheriff's office of Huron County received 18 reports concerning this object (United Press International and Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch May 1997).

FINLAND, Kiunula
At 3:00 PM, a being 90 cm tall approached the witness with small, rigid steps. It was wearing a one-piece garment. Then it moved away and rose into the air, heading towards the UFO. The witness managed to grab the foot of the extraterrestrial as it rose, but had to let go due to a burning sensation in his hand. The effects of the burn remained visible for two months.

CHINA
Indeed, it took a year before a second satellite was placed in orbit, but it is true that in the meantime Chinese specialists had recorded a third failure. The "China 2" was launched in the greatest discretion in March 1971, since it was the American surveillance services who announced the news. The Chinese confirmation arrived only two weeks later.

#1971, March 5
FRANCE, between Trénal and Condamine (Jura)
M. Camus de Gevingey had a second store in Savigny: he made frequent trips between the two. That night he was returning around 01:10 and had just passed the small village of Trénal. A bright light in the distance caught his attention: it was not on the road, but more to the right. He continued to drive and quickly approached the place where this light source was located. He then saw that the lights were regularly arranged on the ground, on a line parallel to the woods. They were blue-tinted rectangles like fluorescent lights: he counted eight, the large side parallel to the ground. Then he almost simultaneously saw a kind of dull metal dome, about 8 m high and 15 m wide. Continuing to drive, a surprise awaited him: three beings were there, seeming to be waiting for him. He will qualify them as animals, so strange was their appearance. They were on all fours, climbing the embankment. Fear seized him. Especially when he saw about twenty of these beings in the meadow: some standing, others on all fours as if they were looking for something. The three near the tree were brownish, almost black, as if tanned. Their head had the aspect of an ant's, a rounded lobe framed by two other lobes swelling like cheeks. The car passed very quickly in front of them, they did not make any movement. Hardly had he passed them when a light filled his car: looking in the rearview mirror he had the impression that he was being shot at point-blank range. From that moment his fear disappeared. He had time to notice that the beings in the meadow were smaller and that they had their arms on the ground. Another feeling overwhelmed him: since he was hit by the beam, he was no longer aware of what he was doing. He had the impression that his car was driving alone, and it slowed down from 100 km/h to 20 km/h although it remained in 4th gear. He did notice that it was slowing down, but it did not affect him. A few moments later he noticed that the car's hood had become fluorescent, but this anomaly quickly disappeared. The car was only driving at 20 km/h and incredibly, it regained its regime on its own, without his conscious intervention. He did not stop, continued his journey at 50/60 km/h until Condamine completely disoriented. He only regained his senses in this village and continued to his home in Savigny. When undressing he was surprised to see traces of rectangles from 4 to 6 cm on 2 to 3 cm on the shirt, up to the belt. They were distributed on the left side; there were 7 or 8 of them. They were golden yellow, phosphorescent. Very fleeting they only lasted 5 to 6 minutes after he had taken it off. Three days later, brown rectangles appeared in the same places. It took three or four machine washes before they disappeared. The paint of the car was altered to the point that when washing it left green traces on the cloth. Pleasant consequence: for years M. Camus had suffered from headaches due to a liver disease: 6 months after this encounter he still has not felt any pain either in the liver or in the head. (L.D.L.N.

CHINA, near Paiyunopo (Mongolian border)
Sun Trha Wong and five other soldiers on a routine patrol to check the state of the wells on the track to Erhlieh saw a huge luminous ball the size of a two-storey Western house, resting in a kind of rock-strewn circus from which one of the springs emerged. They hid to observe the phenomenon. After about ten minutes the luminosity of the sphere began to decrease slowly: they could not determine whether the ball was made of metal or plastic, it had no openings. Yet soon they saw three beings bustling around it with strange devices in their hands. They seemed to be looking for something and frequently looked in all directions. They were much taller than average and wore some kind of helmets. After a while they re-entered the sphere just as mysteriously and it took off and went north. (Gilles DANJOU - Nostra - 18.11.1972)

USSR
THE SOVIETS WERE THE FIRST TO PUT A SPACE STATION INTO ORBIT, SALIOUT 1. THE VERY FIRST MODEL WAS SATELLITED IN APRIL 1971 AT 300 KM ALTITUDE AND WAS OCCUPIED BY THE THREE COSMONAUTS OF SOYOUZ 11 FOR THREE WEEKS; BUT THEY WERE TO PERISH ON RETURNING TO EARTH, DUE TO THE DECOMPRESSION OF THE SPACECRAFT.
THE INTERRUPTION OF THE SOVIET HUMAN FLIGHT PROGRAM PUT AN END TO THE OCCUPATION OF THIS FIRST STATION WHICH WAS VOLUNTARILY PRECIPITATED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE FOR DESTRUCTION, SIX MONTHS LATER. IT HAD ACCOMPLISHED 2800 ORBITS. ("The War of the Satellites" - Volume 3 - Pierre Kohler, ed. Famot 1982, p. 215)

Canada, near Gleichen (Ontario)
Wilton Eater and his wife Rosalin were driving home after visiting friends in town. As they were approaching a hill, they saw a very bright light burst out to their right, which disappeared after a few seconds. Suddenly Mrs. Eater felt the car lift off the road, and to her great surprise, it floated in the air without leaving the right side of the road. Meanwhile, her husband tried in vain to steer the vehicle, with the headlights still on. A quarter of a mile further, the two astonished witnesses heard the sound of tires touching the road. (Allan 1971) (A. SCHNEIDER-H. MALTHANER: "Le dossier secret des OVNI", ed. De Vecchi, 1978, p 35, 36)
At night, Mr. and Mrs. Raw Eater were driving at 70 km/h. Suddenly a flash of light hit their car. The car floated about 60 cm off the ground, the speedometer stayed stuck at 70 km/h and despite the bad condition of the road there were no more bumps. This continued for a distance of about 400 m. When the strange light went away, the car regained contact with the ground. (Canadian Ufo Report, vol. 2 n° 4 – 1972 which dates this to May 24 in a place located in the Blackfoot Indian Reserve in Alberta)

FRANCE, Dannes
Mrs. Pierrette Debofle was cutting grass for rabbits in her garden at 2:05 PM. Looking up, she saw in the direction of the chalk quarry, whose summit was 178 meters high, a dark mass in the shape of a saucer with a dome, the size of a bulldozer, suspended close to the ground. She continued her work while keeping an eye on the unusual and motionless object. After a long time, a small being, with an abnormally large head, seemed to float rather than walk around the object. He moved around the object, bent down as if to pick something up, passed under the object where he disappeared inside as if sucked in. Immediately the craft took off without a sound (800m from the witness) like an arrow towards the hill and disappeared into the clouds. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

The first "Big Bird" (formerly Super Samos) was put into orbit. These devices orbit at very low altitude, almost skimming the surface of the Earth on a scale of our planet. Initially launched at 170 km altitude, they then descend to 130 km and sometimes even less. This low altitude poses a problem due to atmospheric drag, multiplied by ten when descending from 170 to 130 km. (...) The big birds (officially "LASP") are enormous cylinders of 12 tons, equipped with an Agena rocket engine which regularly raises the altitude of the satellite above the fatal 130 km.

CANADA, Rosedale (Alberta)
Esther and Bill Clapisson, brother and sister, lived in a small house in the outskirts of Rosedale. On the night of June 7th Esther noticed a light approaching under the full moon. She went out onto the porch of the house with the dog. She saw an illuminated, rectangular-shaped object descending towards the ground near the intersection of two roads, 60 m from the house. The side of the craft facing her seemed to be occupied across its entire width by a control panel, but one of the men was hiding it with his back and outstretched arm. He made a sign to the other one inside, slightly leaning out to the right of the entrance, as if he wanted to attract the attention of a third one 6 m away on the road, collecting rock samples. She wanted to go and take a closer look, but the dog, in a state of panic, was pulling her back. She went inside to call her brother and when she came out again there was nothing, not even a light. The next day she found a 6 m long rectangular trace of burned grass at the edge of the road at the landing site. Four months later this imprint was still perfectly clear.

CHINA, Dayu (Qiufu)
At about 2 o'clock in the morning, the peasants were startled awake by the noise of the village dogs and roosters and by the strange vibrations of the houses. Believing it to be an earthquake, people rushed out of their homes. That's when everyone could see a large bright disc quickly crossing the sky from NW to SE, almost skimming the roofs of the village. The shock caused by the gust tore off tiles, the leaves of the trees made a dull sound. (...) the villagers confirmed to me that their houses had trembled and they confirmed to me the existence of a disc of more than 3 m in diameter, but in the villages around no one felt an earthquake, nor saw this bright disc.

CHINA, outskirts of Beijing
One day at dusk, the sun had already set and the sky was turning black. Having finished my work in the vegetable garden, I set off for the return. The moon was suspended in the sky in the southeast. I was walking in the direction of the north. I unconsciously raised my head and saw another bright moon in the northwest sky (...) which was almost blue, its brightness similar to that of a fluorescent lamp. (...) the blue moon shone particularly as if it had exploded. Two other luminous objects shot out at the same time from this moon, one above the other: they were even bigger, but less bright than the blue moon. This spectacle put me in a deep stupor. I couldn't believe my eyes.
A few minutes later, another strange phenomenon occurred: these two luminous objects themselves divided into two, making five objects in all including the blue moon. The last two were the biggest but the least bright. These five unknown flying objects were perfectly alike and they all stayed in the sky for a moment. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials". Ed.

At 11:30 Mr. and Mrs. Locogne were in the courtyard. They heard the sound of a large plane and then saw a Dakota at about 1000m. At 50m to the right of this aircraft was a small spherical thing that was moving at the same speed as the plane, it had reddish reflections under the sun. This red point passed the plane and disappeared. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 365)

AUSTRALIA, Gladstone, Queensland
A Finnish couple, Ben and Helen K., left Gladstone at 11:35 PM for Rockhampton. They were surprised to find that the journey had only taken them 40 minutes, when normally it would take much longer. Furthermore, they had no recollection of the journey, except that they had seen a strange green light at one point. Their car, a 1971 Valiant Sedan, was covered in an odourless oily substance. Attempts to learn more through hypnosis failed. (Keith Baskerfield, Australian Abduction Cases 1989) ("UFO Files", ed. Marshall Cavendish, Paris 1998, Special Issue, p. 35)

CHINA, Chungking (Sichuan)
(Li Chun) A peasant from my production brigade, named Zhang Rongchang, was tending to the corn fields. One day at noon, as he was returning home for lunch, in the middle of the path, he suddenly saw a man with a big head coming towards him. When Rongchang was 5 or 6 m away from the unknown man, the latter stopped. Astonished by the unexpected presence of this strange creature, Zhang stopped too and shouted twice to the man: "What do you want?" No reaction. The old peasant had the time to examine the man without seeming to and saw that he had a well-proportioned body structure. His body was dressed in a one-piece garment, like a space suit, made of metal leaves, with dots in front and behind. His clothing shone intensely in the sun. It was difficult to distinguish his arms and legs; His walk and his look seemed stiff, silent. His very bulky head was three times bigger than that of a normal man. It was covered with a helmet and the witness could not see any detail behind this helmet. Zhang Rongchang was very scared: he took a detour and ran desperately. When he was at some distance, he turned back to see the creature again, but it had mysteriously disappeared. (Zhang was never the same again, he remained prostrate, and died in January 1972) (...)

BRAZIL, Itaperuna, Serraria
Between 7:30 and 8:00 PM, Paulo Caetano Silveira in his VW car saw a luminous object circling his vehicle at 3 m, causing it to stop. As the speed was engaged, the car jumped forward when the UFO moved away, but stalled immediately. Panicked and sweating, the witness turned the key and was able to leave, but twice more the red and blue object approached him, and the car stopped again. Three humanoids of 90 to 100 cm in height were approaching him, floating, and he was taken by the trio and transported inside the craft where he was examined without being touched. He was brought outside by some kind of elevator and collapsed on the ground. They dragged him 5 m to the edge of the road, where he lost consciousness. Ten minutes later he was able to get up and saw someone approaching: it was Doctor Crespo to whom he asked for help. (...) He immediately went to tell his story to the police, who saw him arrive with his arms and clothes dusty as if he had rolled on the ground. (follow-up on October 11, 1971) (Inforespace n° 56 of 1981, pp. 38 to 41) Between Natividade and Itaperuna, RdJ (Br.) on 22/09/71 Paulo Caetano Silveira (27 years old): temporary blindness; scratches and bruises; state of shock (source FSR 17.6 page 24). Paulo Silveira recounts that two figures in blue one-piece suits took him inside a luminous disc. He was driving towards Itaperuna when the disc blocked the road. A beam of light came out of it and the engine of the car stopped, while Silveira himself remained without energy. He heard a motor sound when the two extraterrestrials, the size of children of about ten years old, carried him on board. He fell into a coma. He woke up when they laid him on the edge of the road near his car, then they entered their craft and left. A passing motorist found the unfortunate, disoriented, dazed, and blind, and took him to the hospital. The abduction had lasted three hours.

#1971, night of September 22
BRAZIL, Cataguazes
Benito Miranda, truck driver, returned home on September 25, with his clothes stained with red and black earth, and his eyes injected with blood. He was treated at home, lay down and fell asleep. He told the police that while he was traveling around 24 hours between Itaperuna and Cataguazes, he saw a strange round object on the road. Approaching, he saw two small men measuring about 30 cm. From their belt, the dwarves took out a lamp from which a light beam, sometimes blue, sometimes vermilion, came out. The beam was directed at him and when the light hit him he was suspended in the air like a bird hovering. Every time the light intensity increased, the witness went higher, up to about 50 m: he felt paralyzed, unable to even scream. After about 5 minutes, headlights appeared in the distance. The dwarves lowered the beam towards the ground and the witness was taken back inside the truck. It took him a quarter of an hour to recover. (...) He stopped on the bridge crossing the Rio Carangola to check a steering defect, not knowing why he suddenly fell asleep and woke up at 6:30 the next morning, not understanding how he was in the car and had his clothes soiled). He returned home not remembering anything but had pains all over his body. 10 days after the incident, his left hand was still shaking slightly.

Several witnesses during the night, including police officers. Shortly after 8pm, the UFO, a red ball of nearly 20m in diameter and equipped with a cockpit like a helicopter cabin, was observed by the crew of a fishing boat. It illuminated the surface of the sea as if it were broad daylight. The ball circled the boat, at less than 50 meters, for a few minutes before sinking into the water 3 miles from their position.

Joël Bodain and Philippe Bruntz observed in the direction of the east, at about a hundred meters away from them, around 5 pm, an enormous round mass, white, semi-transparent, more similar to a disk seen from the front than to a sphere, motionless above the roofs of the houses. The huge object (4 cm at arm's length, that is 6 to 8 m of real diameter) stands vertically and is dotted with round spots, all of the same size (1 m in diameter) whiter than the disk itself. As nothing happens, the children abandon their observation after one or two minutes. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." - Ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 369)

At 6:14 PM, the ANA Boeing 727 flight 69 from Tokyo to Sapporo was flying at 27,000 feet when the captain, Tadayoshi Sugimura, saw a golden glowing object two o'clock away. Two other members of the crew were also observing the object. It almost filled the cockpit window, resembling a glowing stick, with four lights two-thirds of the way down its length and a trail following it. It was flying southeast at around 12,000 meters altitude and remained visible for nearly a minute. At 6:15 PM, another ANA Boeing 727, flight 68, was flying at 26,000 feet and the captain, Kenji Yamada, the co-pilot Akio Ishii, and flight engineer Roye Hopper observed the phenomenon 90° to the left of the nose of the aircraft. They estimated the length of the object to be 200 to 300 meters and 10 to 12 meters high, with a golden glow, with sparks at the front and a speed of Mach 2. (Inforespace #62 of 1983 pp. 10-15)

Omar Salera Armond took the bus from Italva to Itaperuna at 01:05. The 39 passengers were asleep. 8 km after Italva he saw a yellow-orange light about 500 m away and with an apparent diameter of 2 m. He told the conductor and the driver, who stopped the bus. The passengers got off to observe the phenomenon, which was then still. After some discussion, everyone got back on and the journey continued. During the last 31 km, the light accompanied the bus, except twice, it was constantly in front of the bus at 60° and executed various trajectory evolutions. The driver was suggested to make a call of headlights: he did. The UFO disappeared and returned a few minutes later. This happened 5 times.

… At two o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking on the left sidewalk of a street in the city. (..) I looked up without any particular intention and to my great surprise saw a strange flying machine shaped like a tank. I estimated its height to be between 4 and 5 m, its diameter between 2 and 3 m. It was in the sky at 400 or 500 m from the ground. It was a shining metal machine that flew along the street without making any noise. Its speed was equal to that of the cars and it was turning slowly on itself. I stopped to look at it better and the passers-by followed my example: everyone in the street was looking at it for a minute, then it disappeared. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials" ed.

Ronald Johnson was working in the sheepfold and his mother was calling him for dinner when he heard a rumble. He then saw an object in the shape of a fly agaric mushroom, which lit up from top to bottom in all colors, the base being very bright. It came over the shed, broke a dead tree on the way, broke a branch off another tree and stopped near the latter, about 60 cm from the ground, for several minutes. Then its base became brighter and it rose obliquely at great speed, passing over the shed with a shrill noise like that of a jet plane. Ronald called his parents who finally decided to come and saw the light of the craft disappear in the distance. Going around the shed adjacent to the site, Ronald and his parents saw in the dark (night had come) a bright circle with a faint glow. The ground shone with a gray-white color. The branches of the site also shone in the same way. Approaching closer, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson touched the circular surface. It was not hot, but to the touch the texture of the ground seemed strange, as if the ground was crystallized. Mrs. Johnson immediately felt that her fingers had become numb. She then rubbed her hand against her leg to try to dispel this numbness, but the part of her leg where she had rubbed became immediately insensitive like the tip of her fingers. She compared this numbness to a local anesthetic. Mr. Johnson also felt the same sensation after touching the ground. (...) Broken branches, crown-shaped trace whose ground is waterproofed, containing a whitish substance. No radioactivity.

Angelo Cello, behind in his plowing, was with his tractor in the field and had been plowing since the night before at 9 pm, until November 14 at 1 am. At a certain moment he saw a light about 2 km away diagonally down and thought that a colleague was working like him. He went up the slope and felt that it was bright. He was flown over by lights without a defined outline, located at 50 m altitude and to his unpleasant surprise he saw these lights descend vertically and suddenly panicked. He left the tractor with the headlights on and the engine running. He fled to his brother's house a few hundred meters away. He nevertheless turned around and saw (it was as bright as day) five lights parallel to each other about ten meters above the tractor. Regaining courage he waited and after a few seconds the lights rose, rose to fifty meters and moved back on the trajectory followed on arrival. (J.C.

BRAZIL, Bananeiras
(cf: continuation of October 11, 1971) At 9:30 PM Paulo Gaetano was returning in a car with passenger Elvio Bianchi. He felt that the car was not pulling normally and he mentioned it to his companion, who replied that he was tired and wanted to sleep. The engine stalled and Paulo had to pull over to the side of the road. That is when he saw the craft about three and a half meters away from him. A beam of red light emanated from it, which apparently caused the car door to open. Several small beings appeared, took Paulo into the craft and laid him on a small table. After tying his arm they lowered an apparatus resembling X-rays from the ceiling. He felt a cut near his elbow. They then showed him three panels, one of which depicted the city of Itaperuna and the other an atomic explosion. Paulo felt numb. Did Elvio see the saucer? No, he only saw a bus. Elvio said that Paulo had become nervous and said that they were being pursued by a saucer. The car had stopped and Elvio had to come to Paulo's aid who had fallen to the ground behind the car. Elvio was unable to explain why the door was open and what had happened to Paulo who was injured on the elbow, nor could he explain why they had taken the bus. (see continuation on December 5, 1971 - also note that on November 15 and 16, 1971 Paulo Caetano had taken photos of the UFO each time) (Jacques VALLEE: "Other Dimensions" - trans.

At 11pm, two young men, Ytes and Schiller, saw an animated object of humanoid appearance, floating between the trees in a kind of fog, barely 20 meters away from them. It had a dog's head, pointed ears and a long nose. It was very large, nearly 2 meters and of a heavy appearance. The two men then moved to another point to observe better and saw on the ground a large object the size of a truck. This object was hemispherical and had windows. This object dissolved on the spot.

BRAZIL, Itaperuna
At 9:30 PM Manuel Silva e Sousa left the military base of Itaperuna when he saw a bright light, like an airplane trying to land. The light disappeared and then he saw it in a field near the runway. He approached: it was a very intense light blue light. At twenty meters he noticed that it was an oval shape emitting this blinding light. And then he saw the being. He was walking near the thing, he was small, one meter tall or less, bareheaded, wearing a khaki uniform and small boots. They looked at each other fixedly, the being and the witness, who was terrified. Then the creature turned around, raised his arms horizontally and lifted off the ground, he returned to his craft as if he was attracted by a force, from the top, head first. Inside there were at least two other beings, they were looking at the witness without moving. A kind of slide closed with a small sound. The object moved away first slowly and at fifty meters at a lightning speed, disappearing in a second. (J. C. BOURRET: "La nouvelle vague des S.V." - France Empire 1975, p. 147 to 149)

Fred Bell, who worked for NASA under Werner von Braun, who is a scientist, inventor, artist and mystic practicing alternative medicine, made a trip to India and the Himalayas. In 1971 he received his first sign from the extraterrestrial Semjase (note from vog: the one Billy Meier allegedly meets 4 years later...). The telepathic image takes shape under his pencil: he draws it very beautifully with long blond hair. In 1980 she will tell him that she comes from the planet Erra (note from vog: Billy Meier brings other entities from this planet...) whose configuration resembles the green valleys of the Swiss Alps. Semjase will be his inspiration for music and other inventions (note from vog: which he hastens to commercialize, of course) (...) (Hans Richter: "Die Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

#1972, night of February 12th to 13th
FRANCE, Saint-Pierreville (Ardèche)
We had just crossed the pass and were beginning to descend towards Saint-Pierreville, Bernard Vialle recounts, when we suddenly saw a brilliant light burst from the ravine, along the road, about 300 meters ahead of us. Surprised, and a bit scared, I braked. It took me about 200 meters to stop. We opened the doors, ready to flee, for during those few seconds, a luminous sphere had appeared, rising slowly from the ravine. It seemed to have a diameter of about thirty meters. It seemed to us that it was heading towards us. We ran away, abandoning the car. But we quickly realized that the thing was not pursuing us. At a very low altitude, it had begun to fly over the side of the valley, very slowly, sometimes stopping. It lit up the ground in a radius of 300 meters. A firework light. A bit unreal. It was something wonderful and terrifying at the same time. We were so captivated by the spectacle that we didn't notice the time passing. We suddenly realized that we had been there for more than an hour. We can't stay like this, Jean-Claude said. Tomorrow, when we tell this, we'll be called "lunatics". We got back in the car, but taking the road that follows the opposite slope to the one being flown over by the "thing". When we arrived at the hamlet of Feouzet, we discovered the valley again. The enormous luminous sphere was still there. Fascinated, we watched it again for a long time. Then we rushed to wake up the deputy mayor, Eugène Payot. "When Bernard and Jean-Claude came to wake me up, they were so excited that I had a hard time understanding what they were saying. Nevertheless, I got up and went out to look. It was more beautiful than I could have imagined, this kind of disc hovering, motionless, above the valley. I have no words to describe it. We couldn't take our eyes off it and we fought against sleep to observe it for as long as possible. Around six in the morning, the craft moved away towards the east. Its luminosity gradually weakened, then it disappeared. We parted without daring to talk. Thus, for five hours, the UFO explored the valley, sometimes motionless, sometimes moving very slowly and scanning the ground with its spotlights. And during those five hours, Saint-Pierreville experienced an inexplicable power outage. The gendarmes and the mayor confirmed it to me. A curious outage, since, if the light bulbs refused to turn on, the electric radiators and the clock of the bell tower continued to work. "It was an electromagnetic phenomenon," said a technician. "That is why only the devices in a closed circuit continued to work. (Charles GARREAU: Flying Saucers: 20 Years of Investigations" Mame, 1971 p. 218-220)

USA, Loveland (Ohio)
(Source: The Loveland Ohio Creature, by Charles J. Wilhelm) The witness was driving around 1am on Riverside Road towards Loveland. There was ice on the road and he was driving very slowly. He then saw what he thought was a dog on the side of the road. He had to maneuver to avoid it. As he stopped, the animal immediately stood up and in the headlights looked towards the driver, then jumping over the guardrail. The witness described it as being about one meter tall, its body resembling leather, weighing between 25 and 38 kilograms, and from the front looking like a lizard. Later that evening he returned to the scene with a friend. There were tracks leading to the river. There was no official report. (continued on March 17, 1972...)

FRANCE, Civières, hamlet of Aubigny
Daniel Laurets (Loretz?), a fireman lieutenant, saw at 9:25 PM through the windshield, to the right of the road, something descending towards the ground and landing very quickly. He braked. He estimated that the object was 200m away from him. At the moment of the landing, a kind of small red ball covering the UFO went out. At the front, two elliptical openings were diffusing a pale light obliquely towards the ground, which was lit. At the back, a weak red glow was lighting the plowed field. Thirty seconds after the landing, the lights went out and in the now black night, nothing was visible anymore. He had a hard time making the engine of the new R6 work properly and it coughed for several hundred meters before running normally. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed.

Mr. and Mrs. Dugué observed from 9:15 PM and for 3/4 of an hour a
large, immobile sphere, so bright that Mrs. Dugué put on her
sunglasses. Suddenly the ball began to move, swaying two or three
times from right to left and left to right and then... it was a bit
higher. There it stayed for 5 to 10 minutes, then it made the
pendulum movement again and was even higher. And so on. Around 11

(cf: March 3, 1972) Another driver had a similar encounter. He was driving in the opposite direction and saw, lying in the middle of the road, what looked like the corpse of an animal. He got out of his car with the intention of moving the corpse off the road. As he opened his door, he saw in the light of the headlights the creature moving, half running, half hopping, and jumping over the guardrail while turning its head towards the witness. The witness took his gun and fired, but missed. The description of the creature matched that given fifteen days earlier. This witness went to the police station to report it.

At 7:15 PM, Edouard Sessière and his 17-year-old son Christian, in a car, were suddenly blinded near the "Cantamin" house in the Brochet district. The light came from an object stabilized at 35 m high. The light was so dazzling that Mr. Sessière had to stop abruptly. It looked like an electric arc as reflected by rotating mirrors. The object did not appear to be metallic, its diameter could be 10 m. After two minutes it pivoted into a horizontal position, started, stopped 100 m further on to take up its vertical position and disappeared at great speed describing a yellow-pink-red "S" in the direction of Charvieu. The "S" disappeared after a quarter of an hour. Physical effects on the watch and on the car. (M. FIGUET/ J.L. RUCHON: "Ovni, Premier dossier complet..." ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 378)

Jacques Fortier was walking at 10:30 PM. "Having reached the top of a small hill (...) I saw lights that went out in front of me. (...) I continued to walk with my head down and it was after a while, when I looked up, that I saw with astonishment a kind of "machine" in the shape of a spinning top, difficult to describe. I am sure I heard something moving inside. At the same time I realized that I was no longer able to move, I was like frozen in place. A whole panel of the half of the machine in front of me opened (noise) and out of it came an extremely strange object, a kind of double triangle (thickness) attached at the base and which stayed close to the "machine" at the level of a kind of raised hem that separated the machine in the middle. It was like a kind of transmitter device that transmitted this to me: "Don't talk too much, for you too will no longer speak". The voice was hard, hoarse, separating the words (I heard it in my head and maybe not elsewhere...) The speaking thing was spinning while staying close to the central bulge of the machine and the background noise seemed like a kind of buzzing: bzz... bzz..." The witness's surprise came mainly from the fact that he was immobilized for half an hour while normally it only takes five minutes to go from the neighbor's house to his own. He arrived home at 11:35 PM. (...) (Jean FERGUSON: "Les Humanoïdes..." - ed. Leméac, Ottawa, 1977, pp. 71 to 73)

During an excursion with 4 cars and a total of 15 adult people and two children, when they arrived at Huaypo around 8:00 pm, all 4 cars suddenly stopped. Worried, they started to examine the engines and then heard a buzzing coming from the north. It was an object of 10 to 15 m in diameter moving quickly in a straight oblique line towards the lake and slowly submerging into it. It was a silver-blue disc surrounded by an orange halo and when it submerged, the water of the lake turned orange at the point of impact. The engines of the cars could be restarted 2 to 3 minutes after this phenomenon. (Inforespace n° 27 - 1976, p. 14, 15)

FRANCE, Sainte Soulle
Mr. X was driving and was 2 km from his home. It was around 10 pm. In a bend near a wood, he saw on the right a light seeming to come from a clearing near the road. When he got close, he was astonished to see a very large disc-shaped object with a dome on top, apparently resting on four legs. Panicked, the witness tried to drive away and noticed that the headlights were off and the car wouldn't start. He stayed there for 45 minutes. A progressive paralysis spread through his limbs and voice. At the end of his forced wait, in absolute silence, he saw a tiny, blackish figure, thin, 1m tall, jump out of the wood bordering the clearing, jump onto the edge of the disc, then jump again and disappear into the dome. Immediately the craft took off in a pendular ascent, stopping for a few seconds between 50 and 90 meters. Then, in a beam of light, it headed towards Marans, the marshes of Brie and St Michel to the north. Mr. X saw his headlights come back on but was still shocked. He was dazed, crying at the wheel of his car, unable to move. It was 10:50 pm, when Mr. G.'s (Mr. X's neighbor) magnetic detector went off, emitting a discontinuous sound. Mr. G., interested in UFOs, took his car and found Mr. X, half-unconscious. It was only the next day that he could tell his story and remember. However, he was left with partial amnesia, not remembering the events of 6 months ago. His memory returned several weeks later. There were numerous traces, including a cow in the meadow near the wood from which the humanoid had emerged: the farmer found it dead, marked with three neat holes in the middle of its forehead between the eyes.

Suddenly, the ball started moving in a slightly ascending straight trajectory, heading straight towards the Peugeot, whose driver instinctively braked. Less than a second later, the ball exploded on the windshield at the driver's face level, with a muffled sound, leaving no trace. (Inforespace n° 23, p. 14,15)

More than fifty witnesses saw appear at 9:35 in the morning,
a gigantic saucer coming from the west. It was the size
of a small truck. Its shape was perfectly oval and its color
gray-blue emitted a slight luminescence. The sky was cloudy and
the craft stood out against the clouds. It stayed for nearly twenty minutes
oscillating slightly above the suburbs of Pag Ting. It was
photographed. The military hunt intervened in order to
intercept it, but as soon as the planes got close, it disappeared
at a prodigious speed towards the north. According to the testimonies its speed
probably exceeded mach 4. (Gilles Danjou - Nostra - 18.11.1972)

A red fireball, one meter in diameter, changing color and becoming green, then white, was observed hovering above the trees of a farm. Bernie Smit fired several shots at the object, with no result. An hour later, the alerted police arrived and they then saw a black sphere fleeing behind the trees at their approach. They fired at the ball. It then became gray-white, frolicking above the trees, with a loud noise of air stirring.

Suddenly he saw a plume of smoke in the clear and cloudless sky. The smoke quickly headed towards him and exploded into a roaring fireball. Terrified, de Klerk dropped his bucket and ran to fetch the boss, Bernie Smit. Mustering a group of workers, Smit returned to the scene to find the fireball hovering above the meadow. As the men climbed the fence, the fireball fled and rose up. (Internet, 1998)

SPAIN, Logrono (Old Castille)
Javier Bosque, preparing a degree in theology and philosophy, lies down on the bed to read "Don Quixote" and turns on the radio at the lowest volume. At a late hour of the night, he does not hear due to this a crackling of background noise: around two o'clock in the morning he is still reading. Suddenly it seems to him that the light increases in intensity. He puts down his book and looking towards the window he sees a strong luminosity through the slits of the slightly open window. His curiosity turns to fear when he realizes that the window is opening slowly, allowing passage to a luminous object that comes towards the center of the room. It moves slowly, two meters from the ground, without noise. The light hurts the eyes and Javier has taken refuge under the covers, eyes half-closed. The object rises, descends to 40 cm from the ground, stops. Since this thing is in his room the transistor emits strangely high-pitched whistles. He sticks out his arm from the covers and turns on the recorder. The device descends even lower, begins an exploration with a laser-like beam of 5 cm in diameter, from the radio to the recorder. Once this beam is completely retracted the device rises to 2 m, after a few seconds of immobility, flies towards the window and disappears. When no more whistling was audible he stopped the recorder and went to the window: deserted street and partially cloudy sky.
The recording has been the subject of several studies. (Michel BOUGARD: "From S.V. to UFOs" - SOBEPS 1976 - pp. 55 to 59)

The child said he had seen the object rise up from behind the cane and banana plantations, in the middle of a whirlwind of dust, leaves and grass. The spectacle made the horses and cows gallop. The witnesses ran towards the object and saw that it was round, dark underneath, and shiny on top. It looked like an enlarged bladder. It moved without making any noise. Before accelerating southwards, it dropped a rain of shiny paper leaves, which the children wanted to catch, but suddenly they rose towards the craft, as if sucked up by it. Traces.

Severino Porchietto driving a 1968 Ford Falcon and his passenger Attilio Brunelli, both in their fifties, were surprised at 3:10 AM by a bright flash of light illuminating the area as if it were broad daylight. A few moments later they saw to the left of the road, 50 meters away, a row of rectangular lights which they took to be those of a stopped train: 2 meters high and 70 cm wide, separated by dark posts 50 cm wide, emitting an orange light. As they talked between themselves, they suddenly realized they were in a town they estimated to be Rio Primero, which they found strange since they should have gone through towns like Transito and Santiago Temple. They were back home at exactly 3:30 AM, having covered the 185 km in only one hour! The car had only consumed 12.5 liters of gasoline! Then the driver remembered, but two days later, that at a certain moment, after the flash, he had been surprised by the abnormal smoothness of the car's driving, as if it were swaying gently.

Around 4:40am Lina Orioli, shortly after getting up, opened the window and immediately saw the object while it was still dark. She called her husband. They thought it was a broken down truck parked outside the road. Around 5:00am Giordano went out with the tractor intending to move this "truck". But.. it was a rectangular object 6 or 7m long and 1.50m high with a curved top part bringing the total height to 3.5m according to his estimation. On the wide side, in the curved part, there were two rows of four round, nickel or silver-colored portholes, about 40cm in diameter, and a tube or curved antenna coming out of the narrow side and pointing towards the ground. When he got to 6 or 7m from the craft, it suddenly began to rise making a noise like 3 or 4 gas bottles opened at the same time. Too stunned, the witness didn't even follow it with his eyes (Notiziare UFO 46, July-August 1972 - CUN - Bologna)

At around 2:30 in the morning, the witness who was camping with her husband in the garden of a friend's couple was taking a breath of fresh air outside. She saw a very bright illuminated shape the size of a Fiat Isotta in the hills when she heard footsteps behind her, like those of a child. She turned around and saw at 3 or 4 meters a shape facing her. This shape was 1.20m tall, absolutely black. The body was parallelepiped-shaped. It seemed to her that the shape was made of wood 30 to 40 cm thick, topped with an ovoid shape in place of the head. Two white circles of 5 cm placed in place of the eyes were the only thing that stood out from this motionless mass, whose bottom was hidden in the tall grass. The witness felt a morbid impression as if the shape wanted to neutralize her, and she jumped into the tent to join her husband. He did not have the courage to come out and closed the tent from the inside. (J.C. BOURRET: "La nouvelle vague des S.V." - France Empire 1975, p. 108 to 113)

At 0:45 an UFO coming from St Damase swaying lightly
stayed at the top of the hill for 10 minutes. 3 witnesses. Estimated width
45 m at least. The object looked like the planet Saturn,
the hemisphere above the ring was gray aluminum pierced with oval portholes
three times wider than high. Two of the witnesses decided
to leave, the third had the idea of making headlights. To his
great surprise the UFO then started up and in the blink of an eye
dived towards the car, barely missing it before disappearing.
Wanting to leave, the motorist found that the engine was stopped.
He was trembling like a leaf and the next day he was still white
as a sheet: he thought his last hour had come.

The scene of the observations was the IKA-RENAULT factory. At 05:40 Merlo headed towards the changing rooms (of which he was the guardian). At 01:40 he had closed the access doors and he had to open them for the maintenance personnel who would arrive around 06:00. He opened the first door and switched on the light, then opened the second door and placed soap and towels near the first sinks. At that moment he noticed that the light on his left was off and that a person was sitting on one of the small sinks. He was surprised. Immediately a second lamp burst with a sharp noise, while the one that was off lit up and he noticed at the same time that the seated figure had disappeared. Merlo quickly stepped back, but he could not find any trace of him. He checked everything up to the inside of the metal cabinets: there was nothing. He did not dare tell anyone about his experience for fear of being accused of negligence. In the evening, at 21:10, taking the bus to return to his night shift at the factory, sitting on the 3rd row he suddenly saw in the rearview mirror the face of the figure observed in the morning. After 3 minutes the image faded and he then saw the scenes inside the bus. Around 22:30 he started work, but disturbed by the events he had experienced, he decided to confide in Romero, head of the factory protection department. The whole affair was kept secret. The witness suffered for 3 days from an irritation of the eyes and there were strange incidents with the lights in the changing rooms and with the witness's watch.

A motorist was completely paralyzed by three entities wearing green, with a yellowish-gray skin appearance. They transported him into the bushes and there the witness saw an oval-shaped UFO. One of the entities told him that his name was Freddy Miller (this man, very attracted to UFOs, disappeared in 1959 during a boat expedition) and had been abducted by a UFO and taken to Venus to live. After a few minutes of this conversation, the entities entered their craft which flew away. (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 324)

Again at the IKA-RENAULT factory. Around 10:30 PM, the young Moreno deposited documents on the table in the Engineering Office, without turning on the lights, as per routine. Immediately the lights turned on and off, three times in a row. After that he heard a sound like a turbine, quite unusual for the area. He was scared and quickly got on his motorcycle to head towards the depot, 200 meters away. At 11:13 PM he made the return trip when he saw, quite far to his right, a kind of rainbow near the ground. Suddenly, at a distance of 100 meters to the right of the path and 10 meters from the sidewalk, a bluish-green figure was moving slowly. When he was 30 meters away from the being, it turned around. The exhaust pipe of Moreno's motorcycle produced a discharge, the machine was shaken, the engine slowed down. His motorcycle eventually stopped inexplicably, facing the being. It was 230 to 240 cm tall, athletic, angular face, whitish or light green, no hair, pointed ears, bright and round eyes. No eyelids, no eyelashes or eyebrows, straight mouth. This lasted about 30 seconds before the motorcycle started again towards the left, made a sudden jump before starting to obey the witness. The factory's stop work siren sounded, it was 11:30 PM but the witness's watch had stopped at 11:13 PM. He informed the guards of the events. The next day, around 10:30 PM, looking out the window he saw the same being outside, in a deserted corner. (Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - p. 177 to 187)

At around 03:40, truck driver Rodriguez arrived at the IKA-Renault factory to unload some sheet metal. This he did. He was about to back up when he saw the air light up. Someone came from behind, walking along the right side of the truck. Through the window, Rodriguez saw the tall figure from the side, but not the head. When the figure arrived at the front right of the truck, the witness saw it through the windshield. The figure pivoted on itself and stared at Rodriguez, then made the same movement in reverse and continued walking. Its movements were those of a robot. As it moved away from the truck, the being crossed the road diagonally, heading left into an alley where it disappeared behind the metal frames placed there. (Inforespace n° 19, p. 36)

CANADA, Beauséjour (Manitoba)
Mc Farlan, his wife and the 3 children were driving at night. Suddenly a bright object approached the car at an altitude of 10m. It was oblong and shiny "the size of an oval dining table": 1.20m to 1.50m long, 30cm thick. The driver accelerated, slowed down several times: the object remained above the roof of the car. At a crossroads Mc Farlan stopped and turned off the headlights. The object was still there. So they left, accompanied by the UFO. Arrived at the mother-in-law's house: the UFO was waiting for them 3m above the house of the latter, swaying slightly and turning in oscillation. It appeared solid through a halo of white light, but no details were visible. Five minutes later still rotating, it slowly moved away to the west. (Canadian Ufo Report vol. 2 n° 6 - 1973 p. 23-35)

At around 3:15am, Gilberto Grégorio Coccioli, 50 years old, was taken to a laboratory by occupants of a UFO. They allegedly extracted blood from one of his fingers using a kind of instrument resembling a fat pencil. Then they took some of his sperm. After his experience, the witness noticed that his hand began to swell constantly. (Inforespace #41 of 1978, p. 9)

Halvard Persson, an engineer, and his mother observed at noon 6 objects resembling miniature planes or delta wings. They came from the south and flew over the lake at an incredible speed: in one minute they covered the entire length of 7 km. At the end they split into two groups: 3 flew towards the northeast, 3 others towards the northwest. They resembled Draken fighters, but were only 30 cm wide. They flew at 700 or 800 m altitude.

USSR, Tashkent, Ryzl Lake
Several witnesses observed a disk that seemed to be in distress
above the lake. One of the witnesses noted the fall of silhouettes
resembling vaguely wounded and disjointed men. The
police who arrived at the scene discovered the body of a being that
measured 1 m 34, with gray skin, and despite a long stay in the water showed
no signs of putrefaction. He had a prominent belly.
The specialized divers checked if there was no wreck
at the bottom of the lake: no wreck, no other bodies. But traces,
photographed: a long regular trench 4.60m wide which
widened in certain points. In rocky places the stone had been
cut to the same width, but no trace of metal torn off. The
rocky walls where the rock is attacked are literally vitrified.

passing by a pond near Tashkent sees an oval device of 10
m in circumference, violently shaken, falling into the pond. Little
beings are ejected during the fall. A few days later a
fisherman discovers the corpse of a small humanoid without ears, with
gray skin, 1 m 34 tall (...) (Jean-Francis CROLARD: "L'énigme des

MEXICO, unspecified location
(cf: May 10, 69, Mexico) Around 10 pm Enrique Mercado was enjoying the cool air on the terrace of his house. Suddenly a tall young man was behind him. "Enrique, do you want to come with me?" Enrique agreed. He had to attach himself to the young man with his belt and then they found themselves flying in the air, on an invisible beam to a saucer 10 meters wide. In the saucer Mercado was amazed by the apparent simplicity of the equipment: a panel with 5 buttons of different colors, a kind of screen and two armchairs, that's all. They flew to a mothership, around which twelve other saucers were circulating. Mercado was then dressed in a green suit and was presented to the commander of the ship, a tall man over two meters tall, who was dressed in blue. The commander's name was Yastek and he showed Mercado a map of the sky. "Where are we?" asked Mercado. "Some 100,000 km from Mexico". Suddenly, he found himself on the balcony of his house, two hours had passed, it was close to midnight. (continued on January 7, 77) (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1998)

BELGIUM, Tirlemont
Between Beauvechain and Tirlemont, shortly after 11 pm, the Garin couple in their car were accompanied at 3 or 4° elevation by two blinking light points. At 11:30 pm Mr. Garin stopped the vehicle to observe better. They then saw that these blinking lights belonged to a dark, metallic gray, oblong-shaped object, stationary above an apartment building. The front was pointed and the back had a vertical fin with a blinking light at its end. The couple stayed for ten minutes observing this strange, silent thing that had two rows of square windows clearly visible and lit up with a yellow light. Then, very slowly, the object started moving west and the witnesses then heard a very faint whistling sound, like a muffled electric motor from a coffee grinder. As it moved away, it suddenly emitted 4 or 5 flashes of silver light that illuminated the bottom of the object. Then it disappeared into the night. (Inforespace n° 26 - 1976, pp. 22, 23)

FRANCE, Hérisson Waterfalls (Jura)
In broad daylight, at 4:20 PM, in splendid weather. "It happened above my fish ponds," said Georges Vuillien. (...) my eyes were drawn to transparent spirals that descended to the ponds. And there, at 50 m, I discovered this enormous thing, motionless at about 10 m high above the small chalet. I saw it from the side. It had a diameter of about 25 m. It was topped with a small dome of 2 to 3 m high. The disc itself was of a matte aluminum color. The dome was shiny like a mirror. No trace of an opening. (...) frankly I was starting to get worried. Around this motionless and silent machine, no shrubbery, no leaves moved. Not even when it started to move. (...) I was really scared stiff. Slowly it pivoted as if on a horizontal axis to turn on its side and take the shape of a disc. It rose slowly to about 50 m. It lasted 4 or 5 seconds. Then, suddenly it shot up to the sky, like a cannonball. It stopped at 10000 or 12000 m and was then the size of a grapefruit. After three minutes it started moving again. My legs were shaking, I had to sit down to recover." (GARREAU and LAVIER: "Face aux extra-terrestres" - DELARGE 1975 - J'ai Lu, p. 155 to 158)

Professor Hernandez, an atomic scientist and director of the INEN (National Institute of Nuclear Energy) is giving a lecture in the large hall. For the first time he sees the female extraterrestrial Elyense or Lya. She is a beautiful young woman of Oriental type, dressed in black trousers and a black blouse, these clothes seem to be made of plastic. (Note from Vog: there are fans of this kind of erotism, we already knew that!) Her hair is long and black and she has beautiful green eyes. She approaches him and simply says "You will often have news from me" and then leaves the room. [Continued on December 18, 1972] (Mitarbeiter, "Ufo Geheimnisse", Berlin, January 1989)

Witness: 1; Time: between 10:00 and 10:45
It was after a conference on flying saucers that I met the Mercier family from La Sarre. (...) Mr. Louis-Charles Mercier, forty. Mrs. Rose Mercier, forty. Marlene Mercier, 14 years old. Mario Mercier, 11 years old, the main witness. The incident concerns Mario, but the whole family collaborated in the investigation with remarkable spontaneity. (...) "I was then 9 years old. I had gone to have fun on the skating rink located 214 m from the house. Then, for no reason, at one point, I looked up at the sky. It was then that, with astonishment, I saw like a cloud descending towards the ground at a vertiginous speed and which landed close to the shed attached to the house, on the side of the kitchen. This unusual spectacle was becoming more and more interesting, but also frightening, when three small "divers" black and square in shape, with a grayish face and measuring about 1.20 m, came out of this round cloud. I saw one who hid behind the shed, another behind the solid cloud and the third, he, was picking up snow with some kind of small black boiler as black as the costume of the one who held it. I did not see any hands, the handle was hidden in the costume. The owner of the boiler stood up, because he had bent down to collect the snow and he rushed towards the chicken coop, forty feet or more from the house. He was about to open the small door when I shouted loudly "ouch!" He turned his face towards me and he ran towards me, frozen with fear. I felt a great feeling of anxiety rising in me, not knowing what could happen to me. So I took refuge in my net used to hold hockey pucks when they are thrown in that place. I may have stayed a minute. Then, I got up. The square man was heading towards the cloud not paying any attention to my presence, contrary to what I had believed at first. With his companion, he got into the cloud. What I found very strange is that only two of them got in. The other, I do not know what became of him.".(...)

LABRADOR, at sea
The crew of the Romanian ship Moldoveanu observed, at 60° North latitude and 61° West longitude, an object radiating quickly towards the boat flying over the sea. When it arrived above the ship, it slowed down and changed shape repeatedly. Its color also changed, from red to yellow and then to a bluish white, each time the shape changed from circular to elongated oval. After an hour of observation (so from 3 to 4 in the morning) the object jumped up and disappeared, becoming smaller and smaller.

ARGENTINA, Buenos Aires Province
At 10:30 PM, the 73-year-old witness was sitting 6 m away from the small shelter in which he lived and was drinking his "maté". He had just finished his evening meal. Near him were his 4-5 year old dog and a cat with kittens. He was listening to his transistor when suddenly it stopped working. He then heard a loud humming, louder than that of an angry swarm of bees. He saw a light illuminating the whole region and distinguished a large floating object almost above his head at 10 or 20 m in height (...) At first only one figure was visible from the size of the head through a porthole, and then he saw a second occupant, and then others. He only remembers their slanted, fixed, deep eyes and a simple slit for a mouth. The object moved in all directions. On the tight-fitting uniform of one of the visitors he saw an emblem resembling a seahorse surmounted by a crown, next to it there were symbols on the right side. He saw a large number of instruments and dials. A blinding flash came out: this beam carried away the cat which disappeared on the spot. The humming became louder and the device became blue-green. In total the observation lasted only 20 seconds. The cat reappeared 48 days later, on February 16, 1973 and its back showed signs of burns and scratches. Different physical effects felt by the witness (having only two years of primary school): still under the device he felt tingling in his legs. This sensation lasted 2 days and only disappeared on the 3rd day. Three or four hours after the observation he had a terrible headache, which worsened, and for which aspirin was ineffective. This lasted eight days before gradually decreasing. At that moment the pains were also felt in the neck and neck. Eight to nine hours after the observation he had violent colic, up to 8 times a day. This diarrhea lasted eight days and it was then possible to cut it with Streptocarbocaftiazol. The first four days the colic were accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He lost his hair abnormally with each comb. Fifteen days after the observation he had red pustules in the neck that itched. After the observation the witness had difficulty speaking and could hardly move his tongue: this lasted 10 to 12 days. In addition, the eyes were crying, this lasted 5 days. (Perrin Jack R. "The Mystery of UFOs" - J'ai Lu / Pygmalion 1976, pp. 103-109, based on an article published by F.S.R.) Following a visit to Maceiras, from 19 to 21 February 1973, Romaniuk noted: "Since around 10 February, Maceiras has seen new teeth grow in his upper left gum. I can confirm that on the day of my visit, two front teeth and two side teeth were growing, and they already had two to three millimeters long" (Leonard STRINGFIELD, "General Alert UFO", ed. France Empire 1978, p. 84)

FINLAND, Pulkinnan
Two young women in their twenties saw a gray, metallic, egg-shaped UFO that was lit up. They were suddenly struck by a red beam and both were paralyzed from head to toe; they could neither breathe (note from vog???) nor hear, nor scream. After a fierce struggle, one of the two young women managed to free herself for a few seconds. As she was about to reach her companion, the beam struck her in the back. She then felt an unbearable heat and a vibration throughout her body. Both felt abandoned and had lost their sense of time (note from vog: still without breathing?). Finally freed from the beam, they rushed into the nearest house. Their clothes were covered in mud and one of them had lost a shoe (note from vog: logical, after the beam adventure!) (Leonard STRINGFIELD: "General UFO Alert", ed. France - Empire, 1978, p.78)
