A mother and her daughter heard music, like that produced by a harp and went (to see) towards the window. They saw in the sky a red object becoming smaller and smaller, and the music decreased likewise. When the object had gone, the music was no longer heard.

FRANCE, Beddes (Berry)
J. Algret, a farmer, clearly remembers that one evening he observed one of these UFOs, one meter in diameter, without any shine, flying close to the ground at a dizzying speed. The phenomenon moved over a distance of about 300 m and according to the witness, it was a "red moon". (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 234)

#1920
FRANCE, Brest
An infirmier from Brest was on Rue Traverse when a passerby pointed out to him an enormous red ball, two to three times bigger than the sun, followed by a black cigar-shaped mass. It was 6 pm, it was summer, and the sky was clear. The objects were moving in the direction of the street towards the south. (M. Pierre Gestin, investigator of Gepa) (Jean François BOEDEC: "Les OVNI en Bretagne, Anatomie d'un Phénomène" ed. Fernand Lanore, Paris 1978, p. 29)

USA, Texas
Ten people watched four discs move in the sky of Texas. These objects moved quickly, one behind the other, emitting a soft orange glow. From time to time blue or green reflections were visible. Each of the discs was composed of two large silver plates about ten meters in diameter and the whole disappeared in the direction of Austin. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 234) It was around 3 o'clock in the morning when the fisherman C..B. Alves saw four luminous discs. He said they were less than a hundred yards from his boat and looked like two silver plates placed side by side. Each seemed to measure 25 feet in diameter and in the center they were 10 feet thick.

Two planes were flying over the strait looking for a missing schooner. They saw unusual lights in the sky. One of the planes was approaching to identify them. The plane disappeared into a cloud and never came out. No trace of the schooner either.

#October 1920
NORWAY, Stavanger
At night, around 7:30-7:33 PM, H.B. Rage observed a light so strong that all the shadows of the trees stretched out on the ground to his feet. He observed a kind of red light ball, about the size of a small pea at arm's length, which came out like a red beam of light towards the ground, as if it were a searchlight looking for something. Finally, everything went out. The sky was quite clear, with some scattered clouds, without wind. The red searchlight had illuminated a very large area on the ground.

FRANCE, between Arleux and Péronne
In the afternoon, M. B.G., 8 years old at the time, on a stroll along the banks of the Canal du Nord, suddenly saw two beings emerge from the willows, wearing a kind of flexible diving suit. They dragged him forcibly towards a kind of "tank" and hoisted him into the machine. He started to cry. An opening appeared in the ceiling of the cabin and in a few moments he was outside, on the ground. He had to walk for part of the afternoon to find his way back. (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

Early in the morning William Lamb had gone hunting in the Hubell area. Around 5:00am he suddenly heard a piercing sound at the same time a dark object appeared in the sky, blocking the very bright stars of this winter morning. Just as suddenly the UFO lit up and landed in a hollow in the ground. Just before the craft took off, the witness distinctly saw a man flying about 2.50m high come out and take a few steps in the snow. Lamb followed his footprints but without result. Voices were heard inside the unknown craft. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 234)

John Morris, a lifeboat rescuer at Barmouth Life Boat, and William James were on a quay in Barmouth looking out to sea. Suddenly they saw a kind of aeroplane falling into the water. They immediately jumped into a motorboat and raced to the spot, in vain, as they found nothing. The investigation that followed was inconclusive, as no aircraft had been reported missing at the time of the event. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 234)

USA, Mount Erie, North of Wayne County (Illinois)
(Source: Evansville Courier (Indiana, USA) 12.8.1998) Title: "Illinois Man Convinced He Saw a UFO 75 Years Ago" Byline: Len Wells.
75 years ago Norman Massie was driving a pair of horses in the prairie near his Mount Erie home, when he looked up and saw what he believes today to be a spaceship. (...) Massie, now 85 years old, was ten at the time. He is a retired university math professor today, and he said nothing of the event since his father asked him to keep it to himself. That is what he did until 1990.
"I opened the gate to let the horses into the prairie. I got them through and I was closing the gate and behind me in the field there was an object surrounded by lights," said Massie. I got close to it, about 50 feet. I was there and I watched the five men who were on board." Massie describes them as being about four feet tall, with blond hair. "I was close enough to hear them talking," said Massie. "One of them was sitting in a chair and the others were calling him 'commander'. The other four were going back and forth in the craft. I didn't know what it was until the end, when I heard one of the men shouting to the commander that 'the repairs were done'. "The machine was metallic and it was on three legs. The top part was dome-shaped with holes in it. It looked like melted glass." Massie said the encounter lasted only five minutes. "In one minute they were hovering, the legs telescoped into the body and it went straight up to 200 feet then went west at the speed of a rifle bullet."...

BRAZIL, Sao Joa de Porto Alegre.
Four young children, Sextina Guerra, Valter Paiva, Mariana Lopes and Anita Becker were returning home at nightfall when they heard a curious noise in the sky, as if gears were turning up there. The noise got closer and the witnesses then saw a brightness that quickly increased in intensity. Against the starry sky, a triangular shape, like a ship's sail, stood out clearly (its apparent diameter was 1.50 m) passing through all the colors of the rainbow. Nearly ten other people were able to observe the phenomenon until it rose into the sky and disappeared on the horizon. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 235)

Mr. Volosnikov, on the steamship sailing on the Vyatka River, near his village, saw in the evening an object resembling a flying moon. He watched it for two or three minutes. The object then turned to the right and disappeared. Comparing his notes and documentation with what he had seen, the witness concluded that it must have been "an evil spirit". (Excerpt: Felix Zigel and FSR) At dawn on the Vyatka River, Mr. Volosnikov, a passenger on the steamship, observed for three minutes an oval object flying above a nearby village before turning at a right angle and disappearing into the distance.

The British headquarters sent Lieutenant Pilot W. T. Day and Co-Pilot Pilot D. R. Stewart on a surveillance mission over the Mesopotamian desert, which was only supposed to last a few hours. The plane did not return. It was discovered the next day in the desert, with enough fuel for the return. It was not damaged. Apart from the landing marks, there were no other tracks leading to or from the plane: no human, animal, or mechanical tracks. The tracks of the two pilots, side by side, were visible for 40 yards and stopped in the sand, without any change of direction or return.

#1924
Canada (British Columbia)
Albert Ostman, a prospector, recounts: "It happened in the middle of the night. I was half asleep when, all of a sudden, someone grabbed my sleeping bag and lifted me off the ground. I tried to reach my hunting knife, but I couldn't. The beast - if it was a beast - carried me on its shoulder, like a sack of flour, and it walked on two legs. I was scared to death and I couldn't move." Ostman was thus carried for many hours. It was only at the first light of dawn that he was thrown to the ground and taken out of his bag. That's when he saw an incredible thing: a group of creatures surrounding him and talking in an unintelligible way. (...)
"It was like a cross between a man and a monkey. These hairy creatures, with prominent muscles, were taller and bigger than men. There was even one that was almost 8 feet tall. They kept me prisoner for six days and I could only escape because one of them got terribly sick after swallowing the contents of my snuff box. He caused an awful commotion in the group."

A man suddenly had the biggest surprise of his life. Returning home he came face to face with a being 1.20 m tall and wearing a green-colored uniform. The character had rigid arms and legs, he had something like a disk in his hands and was standing on a flat object that allowed him to move. The witness approached within two meters of this amazing apparition, but no words were exchanged between him and this entity. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 236)

The American physicist Goddard launched a liquid fuel rocket. It travelled 26 metres at 96 km/h. ("Astronautics" Pierre Rousseau, Hachette 1965, p. 10) This liquid fuel rocket, the first in the world, was only a small engine, which covered a distance of 60 metres in 2.5 seconds, but the fact that the apparatus had taken off constituted a turning point in the history of rocket development. ("Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K. Kaiser, ed. Amiot-Dumont 1954, p. 46) It was a strange and fragile engine three metres high. The combustion chamber (60 cm) suspended at the top of a kind of lyre made of two thin tubes bringing liquids from two reservoirs located at the lower part of the device, so as to be kept approximately 1.5 m from the nozzle. (...) It took off with a roar, described a high trajectory and travelled a distance of 56 metres in 2.5 seconds. An average speed of 95 km/h, calculated, proudly, its builder.

"... something remarkable! We were at our camp, in the Koukounor district, not far from the Humboldt chain. In the morning around 9:30, some of our caravaners saw a remarkably large black eagle flying above us. Seven of us began to observe this unusual bird. At the same time, another of our caravaners noticed "there is something far above the bird". And he expressed his astonishment. We all saw, in a direction from north to south, something big and shiny reflecting the Sun, like a huge oval moving at great speed. Crossing our camp, this thing changed direction, from south or southwest. And we saw how it disappeared into the intensely blue sky. We even had time to take our field binoculars and clearly see an oval shape with a shiny surface, one side of which shone in the Sun".

#September, late 1926
USA, near Salt Lake City
Colin Murphy, a pilot providing air mail transport, had a close encounter one night in September, around 11 pm. He was 70 miles from Salt Lake City where he had taken off when a huge, luminous object flew past his small DH-4 biplane, a survivor of the First World War. It was a cylinder-shaped object, without wings or engines, measuring about 90 feet long and 8 to 10 feet in diameter. Three times this strange object approached the small plane. Each time it was less than 50 yards away and the engine of the plane began to sputter. Finally Colin had no other alternative than to make a forced landing in a sheep meadow. Quite frustrated by the turn of events, Colin got out of the cockpit and looked up. The object shot away like a bullet and disappeared in a few seconds.

Farmer Ian Brunescu, who was leading his horses to a pasture, saw,
around 01:00 in the middle of the night, like a lightning spear as big as
the full moon. The object stayed for about ten minutes above the nearby
meadows, then came to rest vertically in front of the witness. During
this phase, which lasted from 3 to 4 minutes, the witness clearly saw a
boat shape that was 3 m long and one or two meters wide. The center of
the body was darker than its ends. Soon the device took the direction
of Arapasul de Jos, and made a curve above a small wood 3 km from Cirta
and then suddenly went out. The UFO emitted a whistle and when it
passed, the surroundings were lit up like in broad daylight. (Michel

ENGLAND, Bolton (Lancashire)
Henry Thomas, the young son of a policeman, had been put to bed early. He wanted to play with his friends who were outside. He sneaked out of the house to join them. They began a game of hide-and-seek in the alleys. Seeing a back door ajar, Henry entered the yard in the hope of finding one of his friends hidden there. In the yard were three normal-sized people, looking through the back window of a house. The trio was dressed in strange costumes, which seemed to be made of gray-silver rubber tubes, and were wearing black boots. They looked like 'skinny' versions of the "Michelin Man". They wore on their heads "transparent dome-shaped helmets". Tubes came out of them to tanks that the creatures carried on their backs. (note from vog: this description really makes me think of people who have put on diving suits for one reason or another...) The men turned to face the boy. They had pale bulb-shaped faces, dark and slanted eyes, almost no nose and no visible mouth. Henry had the impression that they were benevolent despite their frightening appearance. One of them made a gurgling sound and all three began to move towards the terrified boy. ("UFO Files", ed. Marshall Cavendish, Paris 1998, Special Issue, p. 7)

It was heading from west to east, standing vertically in the sky. Its color was smoke gray, it was not lit. It moved in total silence. Young shepherds who were tending sheep outside the village followed this strange object with their eyes and were convinced that they had just seen God in the sky..."

This town is located about 20 km south of Lipetsk. Early in the afternoon, engineer I.V. Surkov saw a milky white disc in the sky to the north. It was twice the size of a full moon, and flew slowly to the east. The weather was warm, and there were many cumulus clouds in the sky. As it approached one of these clouds, the disc "disappeared" into the cloud, which reappeared when the disc had passed through it. This happened with each cloud on the object's trajectory. The observation lasted more than half an hour. (Felix Zigel and FSR)

It passed over the village at a fantastic speed without emitting the slightest sound. This object was bigger than the full moon. Yellow in color, its light illuminated the streets so brightly that it seemed like the middle of the day. It exploded in the air with a projection of red sparks (Petre Eremencu) (Ion HOBANA/Julien WEVERBERGH: "UFOs in the USSR and in the Eastern Countries" - trad. Laffont 1976 - p. 293-294)

#1927, Autumn
USSR, near Omsk
A peasant was suddenly awoken in the night by a deafening noise. He jumped out of bed, wondering what could have caused such an infernal racket. The neighing and stamping of hooves on the other side of the wooden partition made him immediately understand where he had to run. The man, thinking of a thief, went out into the courtyard, grabbed his pitchfork and opened the stable door. His two horses, terrified, pushed him, threw him to the ground and galloped off into the fields. Furious, covered in manure, he got up, took a lantern and went back home where he found all the neighbours gathered, alarmed, carrying lights and sticks. The aspect of the stable was astounding. The shack was crossed in all directions by silver wires of various thicknesses, from the ceiling to the walls, from the walls to the floor. And these wires were so strong that it was difficult to cut them, even with an axe, to penetrate the centre of the room. In the middle of the ceiling there was a large hole. It looked as if an enormous rock had gone through the roof, yet looking on the ground there was no trace of stones or pebbles of any kind. But what did all these brave people see when they looked around them? A horrible, terrifying, and undoubtedly living "thing" was hanging from a bundle of hay: a whitish mass the size of a pumpkin. It contracted and expanded in sequence like an open heart. The "thing" started to move, it turned around to advance towards those who, rooted to the spot, were looking at it. As it turned, it showed that its entire mass resembled a human face. From this monster, which was nothing but a head without a body, long tentacles stretched out towards those who were watching it, their teeth chattering. Those who were too scared ran away screaming prayers. The bravest threw themselves on the abominable thing and managed to reduce it to an amorphous, sticky, bluish-white mass.

Floyd Dillon, 17 years old, was driving a car on a dirt road about 15 km from Yakima. It was 4 o'clock. As he reached the top of a small hill, he saw the craft appear in the sky. It was flying 20 m above the ground and moving slowly. The object looked like a metal hexagon, topped with a dome of dull olive color. It was about 7 m long and 2 m high. Dillon could see rivets along a vertical section and a window of one meter by 75 cm, embedded in the metal frame. In this window he observed the head and torso of a man dressed in a dark blue uniform who "could pass for an Italian in this world". The object moved slowly, without stopping, while the occupant looked intensely in the direction of the car. Then the object turned on itself, crossed the road and suddenly moved away at a terrifying speed. (Jacques VALLEE: "Confrontations" - Laffont 1991, pp. 185-188)

GERMANY, Wasserkuppe (Rhön)
The first world flight with a human on board by rocket, from the top of the Wasserkuppe. The pilot was F. Stamer, an enthusiast of gliding flight. He used a "duck" type glider from the Rhon-Rositten test institute, in which two Sander slow combustion rockets with a thrust of 12 and 15 kilos were mounted. The launch was made at Sandow, in the manner of gliders. The two rockets were then to be electrically ignited one after the other. It was finally the third attempt, the first two having failed, which carried the aircraft to approximately 1300 meters in an approximate time of 60 to 80 seconds.

CHINA, Jonhong (Anhui)
One night in August 1928, I was taking the air outside with the villagers. The moonless sky was starry, there were no flashes of lightning. Around 8 o'clock, we saw above the Dabi mountain range, an enormous and very long white snake heading towards us. Silver, this flying snake, head raised, flew over the mountains and the countryside and came straight towards us. But as it flew just above my head, the snake extinguished all its lights and disappeared mysteriously. My observation lasted five minutes and the witnesses number in the hundreds. The white snake was at a few thousand meters altitude, people were gaping at this phenomenon. The head and tail of the flying object were luminous; it looked very much like a snake standing straight up in the sky. It measured more than 200 m and moved without twisting. Its apparent diameter measured more than one meter. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials" ed. Mercure de France, 1983, p. 75)

A UFO round like an upturned saucer flew over the area emitting powerful light rays that scared the livestock. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 238) Two brothers accompanying the livestock near Milton, saw a craft shaped like an upturned saucer, flying at very high speed, at less than 20 feet altitude. The object had 4 or 5 lights on its belly, bright enough to light up the whole area. The passage of the object was accompanied by a sound resembling the passage of air through a tube.

USA, Griffith Park, California
Leo Bentz, a former car manufacturer, stated that he and a friend had witnessed, in 1928, at Griffith Park, a confidential demonstration of an aerial craft model, in the shape of a saucer.
The inventor was George De Bay, who was looking for new principles of aerial propulsion. He had drawn the plans of a craft that was to move through the air like a flat stone, or rather like an overturned saucer, and use the principle of vacuum for its propulsion, which required ten times less energy than was being spent at that time for airplanes. It is thought that De Bay went to the USSR (F. Scully: "The Mystery of Flying Saucers", ed. Del Duca, Paris "Les Editions Mondiales" 1951, p. 171, citing the "Los Angeles Examiner" of July 5, 1947, title "A test of "flying saucer" took place in California in 1928") (to be verified if possible...)

Testing of Aircraft Propulsion by Rocket by the "Rhön-Rositten Company in 1928 and by Engineer Rudolf Kollmorgen from 1929. The latter, with a fully metallic scale model, with a span of 3 meters, reached speeds of 360 km/h during very short tests. Most of the scale models could not withstand the propulsive force of the rockets: they would deteriorate in flight or be destroyed upon landing. ("The Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K.

CANADA, Fermeneuve (200 km from Montreal)
At around 11:00 PM, Lévis Brosseau was returning home. "When I reached the top of the hill, just before the fork in the road, I saw a large blackness on top of the rocky hill you can see there. A kind of black cloud with a yellowish opening inside... like you could see a flash of lightning through it. I thought a storm was coming and I urged my horse on, as I didn't want to get caught in the rain. When I got to the stable, at the bottom of the valley, I quickly unhitched him and led him by the bridle towards the small bridge that crossed the stream at the time, to take him to the pasture that started around here. (..) So I was climbing the hill, when, when I emerged here, I saw on the left my yellowish light in the middle, like dandelions... then blackness all around and I heard a confused noise... At that moment, my horse started to get agitated and to neigh, raising his head. I was still climbing, looking at this black mass with a large yellow circle in the center. And it seemed to be resting on the ground, about 150 feet from me. I said to myself: "tell me... it's stopped!" And I vaguely distinguished in the night four or five little guys who seemed to be running around... in a radius of about twenty feet. I heard their high voices confusedly and I thought "Well! The little Legaults went fishing with the little Browns - it was the time of the bullhead in the lake - That's funny! Why did they pass by here? They always used to pass by the small bridge..." When I opened the gate... my horse took off like an arrow... At that moment I no longer saw the little guys. But the black mass suddenly rose from the ground with a sound of a centrifugal machine, a purring of a cream separator: "iiiii..." It passed over me, at about fifty miles an hour, at the height of the barn, not very high since it caused a displacement of air and a slight trembling of the earth. (...) It seemed round to me and then, passing over me, it spoke inside. It spoke in a small voice, then a loud voice... As if someone was answering themselves ""u... A ...u... A..." (...) It spoke loudly. Then I followed it with my eyes, it was going towards Lac des Journalistes and towards the village. (...) It was round and quite large, about fifty feet, and the luminous circle with the squares about fifteen feet in diameter. (...) In any case it was lighting me up. It was yellowish, a bit like the sun. And then, there were "things" all around. Let's say, every three feet, it was almost like what they show us on television (note from vog: like a lattice of diamonds on the black border) (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 239-241)

Goddard used a new propulsion rocket again. The fuel used was gasoline and liquid oxygen. The rocket carried a camera and a barometer, and both devices returned to the ground unharmed, supported by a parachute. Around this time, Colonel Lindbergh, the famous aviator who first crossed the Atlantic, intervened in favor of Goddard's tests. He obtained a donation from Guggenheim (King of Copper) which allowed Goddard to continue his research near ROSWELL (New Mexico) in more favorable conditions. On the new experimental field an workshop was erected and, in the vicinity, a tower 7 meters high was built to serve as a test bench. About 25 km away was a second tower, 20 m high, serving as a launch tower. ("Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K. Kaiser, ed. Amiot-Dumont 1954, p. 47)

(cf: 1906: La Celle sous Gouzon) Jules B. was returning to the village by the road. It was between 9 pm and 10 pm. The witness saw a small being cross the road, about forty meters away from him. The character was walking at the normal pace of a man, but his legs were motionless, vertically stuck together and he was sliding on the ground. When he arrived on the other side of the road, this strange little man instantly vanished in place. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 243)

Suddenly, in the evening, in the paternal house of Beryl Hickey, appeared a small bald entity, with large ears, a wide slit mouth without lips, globular eyes, shining all over its body as if it was greased, with small hands and well-formed little pink feet, like those of a baby, about 50 cm tall. Her father, who was a very religious man, thought it was the devil. He threw a net over this creature to evacuate it outside. It started to scream like a mouse. It was forbidden to Beryl to talk about this event to anyone, but she nevertheless confided her secret to a friend. This one reminded her of it when they left the movie "ET".

(Source: Ufo Roundup vol. 3 no. 15 of April 12th) The Spanish magazine "Enigmas" published by Iker Jiminez, devotes an article to Ribera. The famous Spanish ufologist Antonio Ribera claims to have had contact with an extraterrestrial at the end of 1930, when he was ten years old. Today, Ribera, 78 years old, claims that it happened in his bedroom in Barcelona. A very powerful green light, coming from nowhere, appeared. The young Antonio Ribera then saw "an entity of small size, corpulent, and quadruped". He could not distinguish arms, chest, or legs. He was not really scared, but was dazed and very curious. This extraterrestrial explained to the boy that space travel had now reached the point of coming to "calm contact" with selected humans. Ribera, who has written more than 40 books, claims that he was chosen, received knowledge, and had to instruct the population....

At the age of 8 or 10, living with his father (his mother having passed away), Mr. J.R. had gone out to attend to a natural need about ten meters from the house, on the other side of the courtyard, behind a hedge of privet, on the edge of a small stream. He was partially hidden by the hedge and when he stood up he saw in the courtyard, 5 or 6 meters away from him, a small man about 50 to 60 cm tall (much smaller than him) who was coming in his direction. He seemed to be wearing some kind of gray uniform. When he saw the young witness, he turned around and ran away at full speed through the vegetable garden and disappeared into the night.

AUSTRIA, Graz (Steiermark)
Oberth in the USA had a project for a transoceanic mail rocket. But it was demonstrated by the Austrian engineer Friedrich Schmiedl that mail rockets could also be used conveniently for short distances, for example for the supply of mountain villages with difficult access. On February 2, the first mail rocket named "V7" left the vicinity of Graz (between Hochtrotz and Semriach) carrying 102 postal shipments. They were franked with regular postage stamps but private "rocket stamps" and special seals were also added. After the rocket landed, the official postal services took charge of the transmission and delivery of the letters to the recipients. (...) But an official and regular postal service by rockets was never organized. ("Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K. Kaiser, ed. Amiot-Dumont 1954, p. 72, 73) The service lasted for several years and it must be noted that Schmiedl's rockets functioned remarkably. They were only simple powder rockets 1.7 m long and 25 cm in diameter with three stabilizing fins at the rear. The total weight of 30 kg included a bit more than 20 kg of propellant. The mail carried was lodged in the penetration cone at the front. Their parachute never failed to open and not a single letter was lost. ("Assault on Space" Georges H. Gallet, Ed. de la Pensée Moderne p. 53)

The witness, who was driving a bus, suddenly saw on the road a kind of mound with a "luminous cascade" that split in two to reveal the "virgin". She was tall, 1.8 m, and stood in the middle of the road like someone waiting. The clothing was tight, long and white, with a wide blue belt, a panel falling on the side. The apparition had a veil on her head, not covering her eyes. The features of the face did not move, she simply extended her arms towards the witness, then she rose from the ground and merged into a round cloud that was next to her. It left silently and at full speed. It took an ovoid shape and disappeared in less than forty seconds, leaving behind a luminous trail. It was observed during its passage over Nice (Erich ZURCHER: "Les apparitions d'Humanoïdes" - ed. Alain Lefeuvre 1979, p. 209)

GERMANY, Osnabruck (Lower Saxony)
The experiments of engineer Teinhold Tiling conducted around 1931 deserve special attention. Tiling built powder rockets in the shape of torpedoes, which were automatically piloted and equipped with wings. During the ascent, the wings were folded into the tail and held in place by a locking device. At the peak of its trajectory, after the propellant charge had been burned, a timed rocket released the locking device. The wings then unfolded and brought the rocket back to the ground in a gliding flight. With his models, Tiling would have reached a maximum altitude of 800 meters. The horizontal range must have been close to 8000 meters. He conducted hundreds of tests with models and organized countless days of rocket flight for the public.

Engineer Reinhold Tiling had secretly designed (but with the hidden support of the German government) powder rockets with a pair of retractable wings, in the body of the rocket. An automatic device triggered at the top of the trajectory, which the rocket then extended in a gliding flight, considerably increasing its range. From April 1934 he made numerous successful public demonstrations, notably on a lake near Osnabrück. But in Berlin a gust of wind caused one of the rockets to deviate and fall among the spectators.

In 1930, the municipal administration made available to the Junkers factories the terrain of an old shooting range, which was converted into the first world rocket launching site (Raketen-Flugplatz). Klaus Riedel built a simpler liquid fuel rocket, of the tractive type, designed for only 1 kilo of fuel. In order to distinguish it from the others, it was called "Repulsor". The first Repulsor took off on May 7 from the Raketenflugplatz. Further work allowed them to soon reach altitudes of a thousand meters. ("The Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K. Kaiser, ed.

"It was in the meadows, one of those hot days of June or July that I began to have different sensations, difficult to explain. It was at this moment that we began to see saucers in the sky. My brother and I saw these bright lights in the sky and one day one of them landed in the field where we were playing. The object had the shape of a disc and measured about 3 meters in diameter. Curious and intrigued, we approached it. Meanwhile, we saw in the sky another bright light hovering as if to observe us. With our hearts pounding but courageous, we kept advancing and when we were about 25 meters from the disc on the ground, the one in the sky suddenly disappeared. We tried to be brave but the disc on the ground began to vibrate and then, in a dazzling flash and at an incredible speed, it flew away."

GREENLAND, east coast
Observation in broad daylight by pilots LTC Peter Grunnet and LT Tage Anderson, of the Royal Danish Air Force. "One of the earliest observations by Danish aviators took place in 1932 when 8 H.E. planes were sent to the east coast of Greenland for a photogrammetric survey. At that time, the planes were not equipped with heating and the aviators did not yet have an insulating suit. So the strongest and bravest were sent. Lt. Col. Peter Grunnet had Lt. Tage Anderson as co-pilot, who later became commander-in-chief of the RDAF and who died in 1961. Wrapped in long parkas and numb from the cold, they saw their breath condense in front of their faces. At that moment they were flying over a glacier, shining like a mirror. Suddenly they saw a second shadow added to that of their plane in this "mirror". "I looked back and saw something incredible," said Anderson. A mile behind them they were followed by a flying object on the same route. Then Grunnet made a turn to get a better view of the unknown plane. "It did not look like anything known at the time," said Grunnet, "it was hexagonal in shape, flat, apparently made of aluminum or another metal, without openings, without anything, all smooth, no bolts or rivets. I had a strange feeling, as if something or someone in this unknown object was hostile to me. I cannot explain this feeling. It was only in the following years that I realized that this object was in the shape of a saucer. ("THE SAGA UFO REPORT" for October 1977, article "UFO Crisis over Greenland" by Rufus Drake.)

After a period of laboratory work, Goddard continued his rocket launch tests in New Mexico in September 1934. He turned his attention to the development of an automatic guidance device to ensure his rockets an impeccable vertical ascent. His rockets weighed from 26 to 35.5 kg approximately and reached extreme speeds of 1126 meters/second. ("The Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K. Kaiser, ed. Amiot-Dumont 1954, p. 47)

HIMALAYA, MONT EVEREST
Frank Smythe recounts this adventure: "Strange, to say the least. It was, most likely, a hallucination due to the lack of oxygen which affects not only physical faculties, but also mental faculties. I was descending towards Camp IV when chance had me look up. I saw two black objects floating in the blue sky. Their shape was that of observation sausages, except that one of them seemed to have short fins. Gliding, motionless, they seemed to swell and deflate alternately, as if they were breathing. I stared at them, dumbfounded, with extreme interest. I had the feeling that my brain was functioning normally, but to test myself, I looked away. The objects disappeared from my view, but when I looked back, they were still there. A second time I looked elsewhere, but this time, to test my mental faculties, I identified by name various details of the landscape. And yet, when I looked for them again, the objects were still visible. A few minutes later, a fog drifted across the north-east shoulder of Everest, above which they were suspended. It thickened, gradually masking the objects, and they disappeared from my view. A few more minutes passed and the fog dissipated. I looked again, expecting to see them, but they had vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared (...) (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 244-245)

In the night, four Hawker Fury I biplanes flying in formation, encountered an enormous circular light above them. It descended into the middle of their formation. The engine of the plane piloted by Capt. Niger Tompkins of the RAF, failed, forcing him to make an emergency landing. Then it was the turn of the plane piloted by Bruce H. Thomas. The light passed so close that not only was he forced to land, but he had his hands and face burned, as if by a radiating heat.

CANADA, Nipawin (Saskatchewan)
In the northwest of the region made up of hills and marshes, many lights were observed at night. Two men and a woman approached as close as possible to the area around midnight, the rest of the way being done on foot. They then saw that the light came from an oval object topped with a dome, resting on stilts. Through the central door there was a back and forth of about a dozen shapes that went up and down a kind of ladder. These beings were small, dressed in silver uniforms and their activity was carried out in an impressive silence. The orange-tinted light illuminated the entire region. After half an hour of observation, the witnesses returned to the truck. A few nights later, the witnesses had the opportunity to return to the scene. The UFO was not present. But there were traces: 6 squares of 45 cm on each side, spaced 2.5 to 3 m apart, 5 to 7 cm deep, forming a rectangle in the center of which was a circle of burned grass.

The Norwegian cargo ship "Tordenskiold" was leaving the port of Kabelvag to return to Tromsö. On the way, as Captain Sigvard Ulsen confirmed, the crew suddenly saw an aircraft approach with a powerful searchlight that swept the deck. The object was dark gray, without any markings, and on board what could only be interpreted as an airplane, there was a pilot wearing a cape or anorak, he had large glasses and a kind of hood on his head. After making a complete circuit around the ship in about twenty seconds, the aircraft disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 247-248)

In the evening, an unknown aircraft crashed or made a forced landing in the Fager mountains during a snowstorm. The valley population followed the descent of the aircraft on the mountain. The next morning, the aircraft was motionless on the snow and two men visible next to it. A little later the aircraft attempted to take off twice without success. Eight inhabitants of the valley climbed the slopes with difficulty and discovered two parallel tracks in the snow near the point where the aircraft had been spotted. These tracks were 75 m long and 80 cm wide and were accompanied by footprints. But the aircraft remained untraceable. (Pierre VIEROUDY: "These UFOs that announce the Superman" - Laffont 1979, p. 54)

GREAT BRITAIN, Ringwood (Southampton)
After spending the afternoon of July 14th on various sports activities, Paul Faiveley had returned to his room around 11:30 pm. As he was reading a few pages before going to sleep, he realized he had lost a small wallet containing the remainder of his savings for his stay in Great Britain. He immediately went out, heading towards the nearby swimming pool's bath cabins, in the hope of finding the precious object in the one he had occupied in the late afternoon. Relieved to have recovered his money, he was returning home when suddenly the sky seemed to light up and the witness clearly saw the silhouette of his body outlined on the slope of the terrain. He stopped and turning around, he saw almost vertically a dazzling disc moving slowly in a sky of exceptional purity. After a few seconds the phenomenon stopped, and then he was surrounded by a blue glow. For two minutes he remained thus motionless, then the blue ring began to fade, while the disc changed from white to a golden yellow, then to a bright red. At this moment the object started moving very slowly. It quickly accelerated, keeping this red hue and projecting yellow and bright spots. In about ten seconds the phenomenon had disappeared, rising into the sky towards the south-southwest. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 248)

Lucien Aerts was able to observe from his home, at the corner of Koolstraat and Dageraadstraat, an enormous object made of aluminum that shone in the darkness. This device had the shape of an overturned basin and was stationary at 70° elevation above a large neighboring building. What is more extraordinary is that from the back of this disc two dwarfs dressed in metal then appeared, floating in the air. These characters seemed to inspect the perimeter of the object and carry out some repairs. According to the witness they were wearing a kind of cubic-shaped helmet and they moved in jerks like automatons or robots. After a few moments the two beings disappeared behind this windowless craft which flew off to the southeast. (J.G. DOHMEN: "A Identifier et le Cas Adamski" - ed. Guy Dohmen, Biarritz 1972, p. 153)

The night was advanced and the heat was stifling. After midnight, all the members of my family were sleeping, except my father who was still taking the cool air on the balcony. The night was calm and the sky was pitch black. Suddenly the sky, facing my father, became as bright as day and one could even count the tiles of the roof of the kiosk "Sinfengting" perched on the crest of the Yushan mountain, to the west. Between the kiosk and the balcony, there was 400 m. Suddenly, in the northwest sky, a small black ball appeared, heading east at great speed. When the black ball was above Bailangcang Street, 130 m from the balcony, it stopped and remained 20 m from the ground. My father looked at it carefully and he noticed that its diameter was 1.5 m. Then the ball began to open from the bottom, very widely, and to spew out a thick, blood-red liquid. This liquid was going straight down, but my father did not know if it touched the ground because the roofs opposite prevented him from seeing well; The red blood column was very large and measured about 3 m wide. Surprised, my father called my mother, who came out to see this unusual spectacle, but when she arrived on the balcony, the blood column had already shrunk, becoming as thin as a bamboo. Suddenly the red liquid disappeared and the lights went out. Everything sank into darkness.

Ms. E. E. Loznaya was 15 years old at the time. One morning, on her way to school
she saw, flying quickly through the air, a humanoid figure dressed in black. It was at mid-height and its clothes covered it completely. In place of the head something like a square helmet, it had massive, square arms, very close to the body. She saw neither hands nor feet, but noticed on its back something oval, like a backpack. In place of the face, the surface was entirely black and as it passed near her it made a rumbling noise. It was less than 30 m away from her. Frightened, she looked around for help. In that short period of time the flying man had disappeared.

They placed themselves one above the other, rose in a spiral through the clouds. During the previous 10 minutes, some had been hovering, motionless, others were flying in all directions in an area of perhaps 150 m in diameter.

At Barra do Garcas, 500 km east of Cuiaba, the monster made descents on the fazendas and ranches roaring in the night like the father of a thousand devils coming out of hell. The farmers said "We all stayed inside all night, trembling with fear to find dozens of yellow cows (of Spanish origin) dead in the pampas, their tongues widely out of their mouths. Of course, the jaguars were already there to devour them. But there were large footprints resembling feet of at least 46 cm long." Along the Aracargas River: "Night was falling and again we heard that roar coming from the darkness. Our nerves gave way, and at dawn, a whole band of panicked Brazilians took their gear to go to the nearest civilized post." There were even reports from distant regions 240 km away like Ponte Branca. "No dead animal bore any marks of a possible struggle with what had come out of the dark Mato Grosso to kill them." This wave of terror lasted three weeks making the headlines of the newspapers of Rio and Sao Paulo. Then everything returned to normal.

ITALY, Naples, San Pietro a Patierno
Two customs security agents were near the Capodichino airport at around 2 o'clock in the morning when a cry was heard: "The guard! Let's run!" probably coming from smugglers who were leaving the area. One of the customs agents G.R. (29 years old) was pointing a beam of light from his electric torch in the direction of the voice to discover a disc-shaped object "like the moon" quickly approaching the ground. It had the shape of two plates overturned one on the other, with a diameter of about 25 m and a height between 4 and 6 meters. The object was heading towards Vesuvius, flying over the airport, and dragging a white-bluish luminous tail accompanied by a kind of low humming. The object was illuminated by itself, with a kind of opaque white-silver luminescence not dazzling. The lower part was more rounded and had a small turret at its base, while the upper part had something dark and hard to define. On the entire surface there were three rows of portholes from which a faint light from white to pink was coming out. The lower part seemed to be the only one rotating. The observation lasted about thirty seconds. (letter from the witness to the CISU, report of the SOLARIS group, cfr CISU, archives D. n° 37001)

One evening in June, around 11:00 PM, Mr. and Mrs. Barbot, accompanied by their daughter and son-in-law Mr. Bénéteau, were driving on the road that connects Xanton to Chassenon. Suddenly, coming diagonally from their right, the four witnesses saw an enormous luminous mass, as big as two hay carts and of a yellow-greenish hue. Mr. Barbot stopped the car and the witnesses who got out were then literally blinded by this intense light that surrounded them for a second and continued its route at great speed following a perfectly straight trajectory. The next day Mr. Barbot noticed that his headlights were not working anymore: the bulbs were burned out. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 251-252)

BELGIUM, Anderlues (Hainaut)
Henri Houck recounts his adventure thus: "It was during a beautiful summer night in 1937, I was returning home to the northwest of Anderlues. Taking a shortcut leaving the road behind me, I entered a narrow path bordered on one side by hedges and brambles, and on the other by a barbed wire fence. The difficult path was barely 80 cm wide. Raising my head and looking at the end of the path, I suddenly saw a light shining above the passage... At first I took it for a cigarette butt, but soon I saw that it was not, as it was too big. I was very intrigued and I approached. During my advance, this thing began to swell, reaching the size of a football. I was only one meter away from it when this luminous sphere deformed, lengthened and flattened, completely blocking the passage. It remained motionless about 50 cm from the ground. I could have jumped over this form with well-defined edges, tinted white and orange.. But suddenly, a sudden feeling of insecurity overwhelmed me and I hurried back. " Henri Houck, very tall, of very robust physical constitution, feared neither God nor devil yet... Arriving near the road he turned around, the worrying phenomenon had disappeared.

BRAZIL, Galipolis (Rio Grande do Sul)
Mr. Vergani was involved in the construction of a house in Quarta Legua near Galipolis. One day, between 12:00 and 15:00, Vergani, along with six work companions, his wife and their child, had his attention drawn to a group of about ten shapeless objects in the sky. These bodies had the color of samambaia leaves (very light brown), with an apparent size of about one meter and they moved in a wavy motion. At the beginning of the observation the formation was 200 m away from the witnesses. At one point the objects approached the ground, one of them seeming to even land behind a fold in the terrain while the others continued on their way. Vergani and some masons went to the presumed landing site but found nothing. The objects moved silently and were not shiny. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 253)

USA, Boston (Massachusetts)
When Malcolm B. Perry (22 years old) got off the Metropolitan Transit Authority bus (currently the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority - MBTA) at Somerville Avenue at midnight, he was returning from a date on the other side of the Boston River. The night was beautiful, with the smell of vegetation after a light rain. Some small clouds were being pushed west by a light wind, it was a full moon night. The streets were quiet. As he was walking, Perry suddenly felt a strange chill, as if he was being watched by eyes he could not see. He looked over his shoulder: there were only houses and street lights. He stopped and listened for footsteps: he heard nothing. He started walking again and again this strange feeling came over him. That's when he looked up at the sky, where to his surprise he saw a flying object barely a few meters above him. "At first the object was behind me and near the moon. I was walking east to west and the object was flying in the same direction (from the Bunker Hill monument to Cambridge). I thought it was a Navy dirigible and I kept walking without worrying about it. Looking again to my left, I saw it flying steadily west. I started looking more closely, expecting to see a gondola or propellers, but there were none. This balloon was flying against the wind, always at the same slow pace. Its shape was well defined and it looked like a 50 cm school ruler held at arm's length. The craft seemed much thinner than a conventional dirigible. The two ends were pointed and there were four rectangular portholes on the side that I could see. An orange light was coming from these portholes. That's when I saw the dark silhouette of a person looking out at me. "What a person! Tall, gaunt, almost skeletal, with a long head, drooping shoulders, and thin arms hanging down. The entity seemed to be leaning on the edge of the porthole to look at him. Because of the orange light in the background, Perry could not see the details of the face. "I had a terrible urge to wave to him, but I resisted the temptation, just looking around the street to see if anyone else was there to share this strange vision. Unfortunately, there was no one. Again I looked at the craft and behind the other portholes there must have been people: I could see them changing places and coming to look out the porthole in turn. That's when the craft disappeared into a cloud and I never saw it again. The next day I looked through the newspaper to see if anyone had reported the sighting of this unusual object, but nothing of the kind was published. So I decided not to tell anyone about it."

Militias with orders to defend the position, in the midst of a civil war, saw at around 7 o'clock in the morning, in a clear sky, a kind of object in the shape of a Mexican sombrero clearly defined and having the appearance of matte aluminum. Despite the distance of the object its outline was well defined, and the sun reflected off its surface. It was at an altitude of about 200 meters. All eyes (at least 65 men) were fixed on a row of windows in the center which curved to the sides, following the shape of the object. On its base was like a "photographic lens" which seemed to suggest a certain depth and was darker. A kind of dark vapor was escaping all around the perimeter.

NORWAY, Herne;
Sverre Brevik was 21 years old at the time. The night was warm and he couldn't sleep, so he went outside for some fresh air. Suddenly he heard a sound like that of a generator spinning faster and faster. The whole area was illuminated. The noise became unbearable, causing him a headache. He then saw, at about twenty meters away, a bluish object rising from the ground. The object was surrounded by a reddish halo and had, around its perimeter, openings from which blue and whitish-bluish light was emitted. He remembers that the smell was horrible: it reminded him of burnt rubber. His eyes and throat were irritated. The object rose without making any noise, then fell back softly. It measured 20 to 25 meters in diameter and 2 to 3 meters in height. The witness felt like he was being watched. The object then rose again, spinning in the sky and illuminating a large part of the area with the lights coming from its perimeter. Suddenly, it disappeared to the north. Ten years later, the witness observed a similar phenomenon. (HJEMMET. UFO-NYT, 4/1970, 159-60. Liljegren: A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF REFERENCES TO UFO INCIDENTS DURING WORLD WAR II., 1987, 2.

While the Civil War reigned in Spain, Franco's troops had implemented "propaganda rockets". These were rescue rockets at sea, whose hollow head carried large quantities of propaganda tracts on extremely thin paper. Above the enemy lines, a detonating charge of grain powder caused the explosion of the rocket head and scattered the tracts over a large area. ("The Rockets, Vehicles of the Future" - Hans K. Kaiser, ed. Amiot-Dumont 1954, p. 93)

At around 8:30 PM, still in the midst of the civil war, military personnel at the front made an astonishing observation. As they were descending a talwag at night, a lieutenant accompanied by his aide were suddenly illuminated by a dazzling white light. Believing it to be the beam of an enemy projector, they attempted to escape as quickly as possible, but as soon as they did the light went out. It was then that they made out an object about 60 m away from them, dark in color and lenticular in shape, estimated diameter of 10 m, height of 5 m, seeming to be suspended 2 m above the ground. It looked like two plates joined by their edges and separated by a slightly darker line of section. Suddenly, without a sound, from the center of the lower part of the object a column with a platform descended and touched the ground. On this part, the witnesses thought they could make out the presence of small figures. One of these beings raised its arm and a bluish light beam was projected in a circle that reached the witnesses. Immediately, without knowing if it was fear or the action of this new light, the two military personnel felt a sensation of cold. Soon the beam went out, the platform went back up and a few seconds later sparks of various colors shot out from underneath the craft. The witnesses then had the impression that the two plates were spinning in opposite directions. Immediately the object was surrounded by an intense white light and it disappeared, moving away at great speed. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977, p. 254)

Two people reportedly saw at this time an astonishing "frog-man"
one meter tall, with a round head, no neck and some kind of hump on
the front of the body. The mouth was only a straight slit and the
eyes were very narrow, almond-shaped. The skin was olive-colored, tending towards
brown, but the hands were normal. The creature moved by nodding its head up and down, while the legs seemed to hesitate to move. As soon as it felt pursued, the thing accelerated so quickly that its feet became invisible. After 100 m of running, this creature completely disappeared. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des

In England, an inventor, Harry Grindell Matthews, proposed rockets capable of "launching an aerial minefield in the sky around London and other cities." He envisaged 76 mm rockets, 3.50m to 4.50m long with gyroscopic stabilizer and fins. At a predetermined altitude they were to launch a series of parachutes to each of which would be suspended 300 m of metal wire intended to entangle in the propellers of attacking aircraft. This project was not carried out. ("Assault on Space" Georges H. Gallet, ed. of Modern Thought, p. 38)

The British War Office was preparing a serious war machine which proved to be among the most effective weapons of the war and whose secret was not revealed until 1944. This first rocket was developed after seven years of experimentation by Dr. Alwyn Douglas Crow, director of ballistic research at the Woolwich Arsenal. His tests were carried out in Jamaica. Modestly called UP (Non-Rotating Projectile) it was ready just in time for the Blitz of the summer and autumn of 1940. About 1.20m long and 76mm in diameter, they had the explosive power of an anti-aircraft shell of 94mm. Propelled by a tubular charge of cordite pellets, they were fired in salvos of six, by means of a crude launching device called the "Z Gun" or "Mattress" ("Assault on Space" Georges H. Gallet, ed. of Modern Thought, p. 38, 39).

A military transport was leaving the San Diego (California) airbase for a routine flight to Honolulu. Three hours later, various distress calls from the plane were received, then silence. Later the plane was found, having made a forced landing. When the base personnel entered the aircraft, they found the crew dead, including the pilot (having survived long enough to land). Author KEEL continues: "each body showed large gaping wounds and those who touched the outside of the plane were affected by a mysterious skin infection. One of the most unusual aspects was that the charges of the 45 automatic weapons were missing, and the shells were found on the ground. An odor of rotten eggs pervaded the plane.

German engineer Andreas Epp declares: "I absolutely do not believe in the 'saucers' that come to us from Mars or Venus, but on the other hand, I believe in mine, those that I have built myself, or those that I intend to build. (...) The idea of making engines resembling two overlapping plates, the hollow part inside - was exploited by the military aeronautical offices. (...) Italian, Russian, German, and English technicians built kinds of bombs launched by means of special catapults. These weapons appeared during the Spanish Civil War. They were quickly stopped using because of the lack of precision of their shots. (...) Andreas Epp imagined a plate with eight propellers for suspension and two jet engines for flight, while Schriever and Habermohl built a vehicle consisting of a central pilot cabin, surrounded by a wide and flat ring. This ring rotated at a fantastic speed. It was made up of segments to which the desired inclination was given by maneuvering the device. Miethe and Belluzo invented flying saucers 42 meters in diameter, the edges of which were equipped with adjustable reactors.
