"...one night, there appeared something resembling a woman dressed and moving high in the sky. It had colossal dimensions and an aspect so horrible that the witnesses who contemplated it were terrified. It went back and forth in the sky, above the streets of the city. It constantly emitted a sound similar to the whistling of a whip and the air reverberated with it. This sound was like that usually made by a tamer when he excites wild beasts to enrage them before presenting them to the spectators of an amphitheater..."

The emperor answered: "We are the Waka-taka-no-Mikoto." The tall man said: "Your servant is the god Hito-Koto-Mushi. The god who chases away with one word the good and with one word the bad. He joined the emperor until the setting of the sun, when the hunt ended. The god accompanied the emperor to the waters of Kume".

When St. Columcille convened the synod of Drum Ceatt (or Drom Ecart), he asked Aedh Mac Ainmuire to release Scandlann Mor, which was refused. During the same night, a pillar of fire was seen above the city. It headed towards the prison where Scandlann Mor was held, stopped and emitted a beam of light that penetrated the cell. The chains that held the prisoner then detached and he heard a voice calling him. An angel came to free him. Following this, Aedh Mac Ainmuire, greatly impressed, recognized the divine mission of which St. Columcille was invested. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des Ovni" - Delarge 1977 - p. 55)

#682
Japan
On the third day of the eighth month of the year 682 a great star crossed the sky from east to west above Tsukushi. The term great star seems to exclude a meteor or comet. Eight days later: "Something appeared that had the shape of a Buddhist baptismal flag, flame-colored. It hovered in the void, headed north and was seen in all provinces. Some said it plunged into the sea off Koshi." (Richard D. NOLANE: "Once Upon a Time Aliens - Myths and Realities" Presses de la Cité Poche 1993 p.184, 185) On the twelfth day there was a strong earthquake. The next day the vice-governor of Tsukushi reported that he had seen a three-legged bird. On the seventeenth day there was another earthquake. At dawn an arc of the sky was seen in the middle of the sky at the height of the sun. [note from vog: there is nothing supernatural or extraterrestrial about this. This rather rare phenomenon of a complete circular rainbow around the sun, I was able to contemplate in the 60s when I lived in Africa.] (Yves NAUD: "UFOs and ETs in History" - FAMOT 1977, VOLUME 2 p. 240, 241)

Under the reign of Pepin the Short (715-768), very singular phenomena were publicly shown in France. The air was full of human figures, the sky reflected mirages of palaces, gardens, agitated waters, ships with sails in the wind and armies lined up for battle. The atmosphere was like a great dream. (...) Dreams and wakefulness were confused and several people thought they had been taken away by aerial beings; all that was heard was talk of trips to the land of the sylphs .... madness seized the best minds and finally the Church had to intervene".

BYZANTIUM
The Byzantines, relaying the Chinese and Arabs whose recipe was then transmitted to all of Europe, shot off rockets. They were called "Rocchetto" in Italy, a name which the French translated as "Fusee", the Germans as "Rakete", and the English as "Rocket". It became the absolute weapon in the Middle Ages and Charles VII made abundant use of it in the reconquest of the Kingdom. (L'Astronautique", Pierre Rousseau, ed. Hachette 1965, p. 8)

#810
GERMANY, Saxony
Charles himself was the victim of a significant accident during his last expedition in Saxony against the Danish king Godefrid. One day, when he had left the camp and set out before sunrise, he suddenly saw a dazzling torch miraculously descend from a serene sky and traverse the air from right to left. And as one wondered what this phenomenon portended, the horse he was riding suddenly lowered its head and fell, precipitating him to the ground with such violence that the fibula of his cloak broke and the belt of his sword was torn off. When his servants, witnesses of the accident, rushed to raise him up, they found him without weapons, without a cloak, and a javelin was picked up at least twenty feet away which had escaped from his hands at the moment of his fall." (Michel BOUGARD: "The Chronicle of UFOs" - Delarge 1977 p. 61)

Eginard further reports that during the expedition to Spain of Pépin
Ir, second son of Louis the Pious, strange things happened:
".. in truth this disaster was preceded by terrible apparitions of things
in the air. During the night they were sometimes pale lights, sometimes
bright and red fires like blood". (Michel BOUGARD: "La

#840 
FRANCE, Lyon
(Before 840.) Agobard (779-840) had conducted an investigation and discovered that missing people claimed upon their return to have visited a country they called Magonia. Being a Christian and a rationalist, he refused to believe it and had even stoned three men and one woman in his presence who claimed to have gone to Magonia in an aerial ship. (Jacques BERGIER: "Les E.T. dans l'histoire" - J'AI LU 1970 - p 146) (note from vog: this seems, to say the least, a rocambolesque interpretation of what was really happening with Agobard...) One day, aerial saucers arrived in Lyon from which three men and one woman were seen descending. The whole city gathered around them, shouting that they were magicians sent by Grimaldus, Duke of Berreventum, the enemy of Charlemagne, to destroy the French crops. In vain, the four innocents defended themselves by saying that they were their own and had been carried away a short time before by extraordinary men who had shown them wonders never heard of before, and they had desired to make their own account of what they had seen. The raging populace paid no attention to their defense and was about to throw them into the fire, when the brave Agobard, Bishop of Lyon, alerted by the noise, arrived running and after having heard the accusations of the people and the defense of the accused, declared gravely that both were in error... the men and the woman were released. [note from vog: which also does not seem to be the correct interpretation: Agobard was neither wise nor balanced, he was a kind of fanatic towards unbelievers and heretics, and those "returning from an aerial vessel", what else were they?] (Yves Naud: "Les E.T. et les OVNI dans l'histoire" Famot 1977, volume 2 p. 126)

Charles II, the Bald (823 - 877) was one day taken away by a being of dazzling whiteness, armed with a weapon throwing an extraordinary light, like that of a comet. During the journey, the stranger protected the king from certain wild animals by enveloping him in a brightness that so offended these dangerous beasts that they could not reach him.

There was one day two suns that fought ardently. And another day of the same month, two suns rose together and fought in the sky, merging into one single star in the eyes of all spectators. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials" ed. Mercure de France, 1983, p.47)

On the third moon and the day I-Cheou at midnight, a great ball of fire appeared at the zenith. It was the size of five bushels. It headed towards the northwest. At a distance of one hundred feet it stopped. Above it, a multitude of small stars were seen, like sparks of a yellowish red. Its tail was fifty feet long and resembled a snake. All the small stars were in motion. Soon after, the ball went out and was replaced by a greenish vapor, like tufts of bamboo, which extended to the zenith and whose color was fading.

#950 
IRELAND, Cloera
(Approx. date.) On a Sunday when people were at mass, a miracle happened in the town of Cloera. There is a church in the town dedicated to the memory of Saint Kinarus. A metal anchor with a rope attached to it fell from the sky and one of its pointed legs got stuck in the wooden arch that tops the church. People rushed outside and saw in the sky a ship with men on board floating at the other end of the anchor rope, then they saw a man jump overboard and descend the rope as if to go and unhook the anchor. It seemed as if he was swimming in the water. People rushed to grab him but the bishop forbade them to hold him for fear of killing him. The man, once released, quickly climbed back up the rope to rejoin the ship. The crew cut the rope and the ship, rising, disappeared. But the anchor remained in the church as a testimony to this singular event (in "Speculum Regali" manuscript "Konungs Skuggsa") (Frank Edwards: "Les S.V. affaire sérieuse" - trad. Laffont 1967 - p. 17- other authors place this event around 1215) ANOTHER VERSION: A ship sailed in the air, everyone saw it. One of the crew of the ship threw a javelin to catch a fish, which people also saw swimming in the air. The javelin missed its target and fell to the ground. The unfortunate fisherman plunged out of the ship and swam to retrieve his weapon. But among the terrestrial spectators, a man had already taken the javelin. The aerial fisherman failed to take it back from him and then said: "But let it go, for I shall drown". The man let go and the fisherman swam back up to the ship, where he climbed aboard.

As for its applications (that of powder) as a propulsion agent, they are placed around 970, at the time of Tai-Sou, founder of the Song Dynasty. At the time, arrows were used with a bamboo tube filled with powder attached; the charge was set on fire just before releasing the bowstring, and the range of the arrow was thus considerably increased.
