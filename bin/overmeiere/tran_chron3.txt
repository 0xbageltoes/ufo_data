#August 1, 1608
MEDITERRANEAN: Cannes, Genoa, Marseille, Nice
On the sea of Genoa were seen the most horrible signs that have ever been spoken or written of! Some were in human figures, having arms that seemed to be covered in scales and each holding in their hands two horrible flying serpents, which entwined their arms and only appeared from the navel upwards, out of the sea, and they threw out cries so horrible that it was a terrifying thing, and sometimes they plunged into the sea and then reappeared in other places far away, howling cries so terrifying that many were made ill from the fear they had. They saw some that seemed to be in female figures. Others had a body like a human, all covered in scales, but the head was in the shape of a dragon. From the first day of the said month, they were ordinarily seen to the great astonishment of all the Genoese. The seigniory had some cannons fired in order to try to make them leave that place. About 800 shots were fired at them, but in vain, for they were not in the least astonished. The churches assembled and, going to the true remedy, made many processions, commanded the youth, and the good Capuchin fathers ordered the 40 hours in order to try to appease the wrath of God, with their salutary remedy. On the fifteenth day of August, on the said sea of the port of Genoa, three chariots were seen, each drawn by six figures all on fire in the semblance of a dragon. And the said chariots were drawn by the said signs which always had their serpents, continuing their terrifying cries and approaching quite close to Genoa, so that the spectators, at least the greater part, astonished, fled, fearing the effects of such a prodigy.<br/><br/>
But when they had made the circuit three times along the port, after they had thrown such powerful cries of noise that they made the mountains in the vicinity resound, they were lost in the said sea and since then, none have seen or heard any news of them. This brought great damage to many citizens of Genoa, some of whom died of fear, such as the son of Mr. Gasparino de Loro and also the brother of Signor Anthonio Bagatello, and many women were afflicted and had such fear that they died of it... From the length of the sea of Nice and all along the coast of Provence, both on the marine side and on the plain, it was found to have rained natural blood which ran and tried to redden the leaves and fruits of the trees. At Toulon, most of the houses on the roof were stained with the said blood, and the pavement of the parish church of the said place, at the exit of Mass, was seen to be sprinkled with a horn of real and natural blood. On the eighteenth of the said month, it rained blood in such abundance that it ran along the streets and it seemed as if an infinity of people had been slaughtered at Riliane.<br/><br/>
At Lambex, on the twentieth of the said month, in the presence of all the people, it was seen to rain blood so much that none went out of the houses without being stained with the said blood which distilled from the roof of the houses, or else from that which fell from the first rain. In short, along the marine from Nice to Marseille, blood rained on various days... Dreadful things, worthy of memory, happened almost at the same time in the town of the Isle of Martègue, on the twenty-second day of the said month, when two men appeared in the air, each with weapons and shields in their hands, and they fought in such a way that they astonished the spectators, and after having fought for a long time, they rested for a certain time, then returned to battle and their combat lasted two hours. On the twenty-seventh of the said month, they fought on foot and quarreled in such a way that it seemed to some that each of them was armed with a fortress or castle, and after having made a good show against each other, there was a noise as of some shots from a cannon. The noise was so frightful that it seemed to the listeners to be the end of the world, then having continued the said days for seven hours all at once, a thick cloud appeared in the air and covered so darkly that nothing was seen for two hours but clouds and black mists, darkened, smelling like gunpowder, and after the air was purified, none of these chimeras were seen, which had vanished.

SWITZERLAND, Fluelen (Uri).
Herr Christophorus Schere, Prefect of the Canton of Uri, saw near Fluelen, along the Lake of Uri, a long and shining flying object. (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970, p. 61) In 1619, in Flüelen, an enormous elongated and fiery-colored object was seen near a lake by Professor Christopher Scherer, Prefect of the Canton of Uri: "Having lingered on the balcony to admire the purity of the firmament, I saw a brilliant fiery dragon emerge from one of the caves of Mount Pilate and quickly head towards Flüelen at the other end of the lake. It was enormous, its tail long and its neck stretched out...It left behind, in flying, numerous sparks...At first I thought I saw a meteor, but then, looking more closely, I was convinced by its flight...that I was seeing a real dragon." (UFOs in Heidi, cfr GREPI, 1997)

#1620, February 1
FRANCE, Quimper-Corentin
Between 7 and 8 PM lightning struck the lead-covered pyramid on the roof of the cathedral. It caught fire, exploded and crashed to the ground with a terrifying noise. People who came to see it then saw in the flames and smoke a demon of either green or blue color, doing its best to stoke the fire... (Jacques VALLEE: "Chronicles of E.T. Appearances" - DENOEL 1972 - coll. J'AI LU - p. 95, 96)

#1620, April 5
SWITZERLAND, Geneva
Palm Sunday. Another pamphlet published in 1620 entitled: "Horrible Battle Seen
over the City of Geneva on Last Palm Sunday..." recounts:
"Two suns were seen, one red and the other yellow, which clashed with each other... Shortly afterwards a long cloud like an arm appeared from the side of the sun, which stopped near the said Sun, and from this cloud a great number of people dressed in black and armed like soldiers emerged... and then yellow clouds like saffron appeared, from which clouds reflections resembling large high and wide hats emerged and the whole earth was shown yellow and bloody... The sun split in two and everything ended in a rain of blood." (Les Soucoupes chez Heidi, cfr GREPI, 1997)

#1621, July 28

The presence of a cross in the sky of Geneva is still reported on July 28, 1621, a cross that threw flames as if to burn the city and its surroundings. (Les Soucoupes chez Heidi, cfr GREPI, 1997)

#1621, September 12
FRANCE, Paris and Saint-Denis
"Various small white clouds appeared which, as if in squadrons, separated from each other, came afterwards to join each other with prodigious speed, after which they disappeared, and others presented themselves and, on approach, sent out shapes and forms like lances and arrows against each other, just like squadrons that come fiercely to the shock and, after having fought for a while, were lost and no longer appeared..." wrote Pierre de l'Estoile. While Jacques Thevenyn, notary, described: "The night of Sunday, the twelfth of September, between Monday the thirteenth, although we had no moon, nevertheless it was very clear and in the air there were swans of medium size. Around ten o'clock in the evening I saw, being at our door, in the sky like three long white paths, one smaller than the others and they moved. I thought it was the wind but I do not know what it was and on this, I saw like a crown which was not at all closed on the side of the Saint Anthoine Gate and was around it, against which there were several branches that came to merge..."

#1621, October 12
FRANCE, Lyon, Nismes, Montpellier
On the night of the 12th of October last, around eight o'clock in the evening, with no moonlight at its last quarter, the air, beyond what is natural, began to clear up from the east and continued for an hour and a half or so, making the time as clear and bright as the most beautiful days of summer, which caused great astonishment to the inhabitants of Lyon. Most of them, looking up, perceived things that were entirely strange and beyond the course of nature. Namely, on the large Bellecourt square they saw like a large mountain, on which was the figure of a castle, from which came forth many flashes of light that gave off light in all directions and lost their light in an instant. And this figure of the castle was consumed as these said flashes came out. It seemed to cover the entire quarter of the Rosne gate, Saint Michel, the Saone river, and reach as far as the faux-bourg of Saint George. On the side of the Terreaux square it was seen (by more than four hundred people) in the air, like the shape of a battalion of soldiers on horseback, at the head of which there was a very luminous star, which seemed to lead them, which was larger and brighter than those usually seen in the sky. This star, like a second sun, made all the clouds that presented themselves in various shapes disperse before it, and seemed to want to keep its brightness, but being overcome by its great light, they entirely lost their shapes and were no longer visible. The whole city and surrounding areas were covered this night and others following with various signs and prodigies, like burning lances, which seemed to come from the side of the faux-bourg of La Guillotière, which, approaching the Rosne bridge, dispersed and were no longer visible, and this until daybreak.<br/><br/>
In the city of Nismes (...) at the same time previously mentioned by the inhabitants of the said city, principally the night of the thirteenth of the said month around nine to ten o'clock in the evening, on the Amphitheatre there was seen like a great and very resplendent sun, which was surrounded by a number of other luminous torches and seemed to want to go straight to the Roman Tower.. on which there appeared like carts on fire all around surrounded by very bright stars. There also appeared other signs both on the Capitol and on the Temple, which seemed to cover the whole city, which greatly astonished all the inhabitants of the said city and other surrounding areas. In the city and town of Montpellier... there began to appear on it a quantity of burning torches in the form of torches of light from which came a number like lances of fire that went back and forth. This way of doing lasted from nine to ten o'clock at night until three o'clock in the morning when there appeared a great and luminous star with a long tail, other small stars, which seemed to make a large cloud mixed with various flashes disperse, which wanted to cover it and prevent its brightness...

FRANCE, Belle-Ile (Morbihan)
Extract from the letter of the Duke of Retz to his friend the R.P. Césarée -
Méjanes Library in Aix-en-Provence, manuscript no. 1209) ... the man
marain was on a rock on the west side called Arbonne... and
appeared to be sitting. The great height of the coast prevented him from
judging what was under the water, but what appeared outside was the belly, the navel, the body, the head, the arms and the
hands very well proportioned, except for the hands which were
extraordinarily large and white inside and the arms which
were a bit short. His body appeared to be the size of a barrel of wine and the rest in proportion. His hair down to his shoulders
very greasy and whitish, his beard similar and going down to
his stomach, his eyes very big and rough, his skin neither white nor tanned,
but it had the appearance of being rough. ... but they saw well that
the groin appeared wide of more than a foot and that his back was
like the top of his hands and arms with a grayish skin without scales. .... instead of legs, two fish tails made
like a salmon... sometimes he beat his hands against
each other and made a certain whistle that they took for laughter... At
the same time that it appeared in Belle Ile, inhabitants who went to
Vannes assure that in broad daylight they saw the same thing...

#1639, April
CHINA, Yuan (Shansi)
The villagers were offering their condolences to the family of Yuan Yingta, National Defense Minister during the Ming dynasty, who had sacrificed himself on the battlefield while resisting the Man soldiers. Then a luminous thing in the shape of a star, of red, white, yellow and blue color, flew over the funeral procession (...) This bright thing did not land on the ground, but it circled over the village for a very long time, then it rose into the sky. Its lights were seen up to more than five kilometers away.

#1640
BELGIUM, Knokke,
The Spanish Memorial Historica Tome XVI states that in 1640 at the Fort of Kenoque (Knokke), which was a defense of the city of Ypres, the soldiers of the fort saw at the zenith a complete army marching through the flames. Hardly had it been deployed when they saw two others, one coming from the east and the other from the west. According to the text "these two armies put themselves in battle order and fought against the one coming from the north. The battle lasted an hour and the shots were heard clearly..."

#1644, January 18
USA, Boston (Virginia)
At around 8 o'clock in the evening, several inhabitants of the Boston area by the sea saw a light the size of a full moon rise above the sea to the northeast. Shortly afterwards, another light appeared to the east. Then the inhabitants witnessed a curious game of hide and seek between the two lights. (...) During this celestial ballet, several people known to be sober and pious who were on the water between Dorchester and Boston claimed to have heard a voice in the sky pronouncing "in a most terrible manner" the following words: "Little, little, come, come" .... These calls were repeated about twenty times from various directions. A week later, other witnesses saw the same ballet and heard the same calls coming from the depths of the sky.

Antoine de Nantes, a messenger from Goult, suffering from a cruel illness, saw
a child of wonderful beauty, hovering above the debris of a halo of fire. And when the divine figure had disappeared, the messenger found himself perfectly restored. A chapel was erected, inaugurated on January 3, 1663; "miracles multiplied from that day: meteors of fire burst in the shadows on the blessed dome." (M. FIGUET/ J.L.

RUSSIA, Belozero
Extract from the report of the St Cyrille monastery: "The peasant Levka Fedorov from the village of Mys told me the following: ... from various lands and various domains people were attending mass, ... in great numbers.. and at that moment a very loud noise came from the sky, and many people went out to the courtyard and saw... from the winter side of the brightest sky, not from a cloud, a great fire came out from Roboziero and headed towards the South, along the lake, above the water and had this flame twenty sagènes (1 sagène = 2.13 m) and more on all sides, and a blue smoke was next to it and becoming the flame, on twenty sagènes, two beams of fire as well ... and from the great fire and the two smaller flames, nothing more was seen. After about an hour, the same fire returned again to the lake, from the same place where it had disappeared the first time and went from the south to the west for half a verste (1 verste = 1.066m) and disappeared in the same way. The third time this fire became more frightening than the first one due to its size and then went towards the west. And it stayed on Roboziero, this fire, above the lake, for about an hour and a half and said lake was two verstes long and one across... On the lake peasants were sailing in a boat and the flame of this fire was so hot that they could not approach it. And the lake was lit up to the bottom, to the deepest, in the center of it, this lake, four sagènes and the fish fleeing to the shores, all saw it and under the fire, the water became, due to the flame, as if covered in rust.."

#1672, February 8
At sea, in the English Channel
At one hour after midday, in the clearest of weather, a star appeared above our heads, about fifteen feet in length. From there it went to fall to the north side, leaving a smoke which formed into two ships, each with two masts and the mizzen and their large sails tight and furled, both having the front facing upwards. The one to the north was larger than the one above. And as they went thus, they separated about four feet apart, in the middle of which formed another ship, appearing larger than the others, all black, showing us the back and turning the front to the north, without any sail but yet equipped with its masts, yards and ropes, as if it had been at anchor. This appeared to us for the space of a large half hour. And then afterwards, having come together, they dissipated, going to the side of the above without leaving any mark...

Companies of armed men marched in order along the river, companies
meeting companies rushed against each other and falling to the ground,
disappeared. Others reappeared immediately and marched in the same
direction... those who had seen were seized with such fear and such
trembling that those who had not seen were troubled... (Yves Naud:

(notes of Gu-Sheng, chap. 6) between the end of spring and the beginning of summer of the twenty-seventh year under the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing dynasty, my brother-in-law Bixilin went to his home in the mountains 20 kilometers from the city of Kunmin. During his stay, he saw every noon, when it was nice, a large lid young like an umbrella rise slowly from a ridge. This thing threw bright lights that he did not dare to look at directly. It took height and penetrated into the clouds. Soon after it descended, always slowly, to go up and down in the same way. When night fell, the flying object lost the brightness of its yellow color and became paler and blurred. It completely disappeared when the sky became black.

It always happened at nightfall, most often on a Saturday or Sunday, and it lasted for a few months. The only way to extinguish it and make it flee was to sound a hunting horn or fire shots..."

The one in the middle was raised above the others. Here I said to myself, the lights of which I have been told. Immediately I fell to my knees and I blessed God for such a great wonder. At the same time, two new lights appeared but a little above the place where the chapel is. I advanced to the oratory where the mystery of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is represented.

They seemed to collide with each other in a terrifying way, yet without any noise. The sky, although clear, seemed to be all ablaze. One could also see among these troops of fire, large luminous circles, open at the bottom, which pushed each other, like the waves of a stormy sea.

At around 5:00 PM, Mr. Thomas Short was the witness of "the appearance of a dark red cloud beneath which was a luminous body sending out very bright beams of light. This was nothing like the aurora borealis as the light rays moved slowly for some time and then stopped. Suddenly it became so hot that I had to take off my shirt even though I was outside.

GREAT BRITAIN, Bradly, Selborne, Alresford.
According to the Wernerian Natural Historical Society Transactions (vol. 5, p.386) it would have fallen between Bradly, Selborne and Alresford over several tens of square kilometers "like spider webs in the form of flakes or tatters, about 3 cm wide and 15 to 18 cm long".<br/><br/>
Apparently this fall was made in large quantities and twice.
After several hours of calm, a second "shower" would last from 9 am until dusk. The "All the Year Around" (vol. 8, p 254) describes the same phenomenon but specifies that the three locations form a triangle of 13 km side and that the matter fell at great speed.

"Around 12:00 or 13:00 a terrible thunderclap was heard in the direction of the north. It sounded like two very large cannons firing one after the other. But the rumble and echo did not resemble those produced by a cannon shot. Within a 30 km radius, all the houses were shaken." Another witness, a canon at Canterbury, was luckier. On the same day, also around 13:00 his house was strongly shaken by what he took for an earthquake. But he rushed out and then saw "what seemed to be a cloud of storm in the sky and a ball of light that passed very quickly over the eastern region towards the west. It had begun with two loud detonations like cannon shots. It was like a very large shooting star in the middle of the day." (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p.106-107)

#1743, August 31
ITALY, between Castel-Nuovo and Rome.
In his memoirs Girolamo-Giacomo Casanova, barely 18 years old and not yet having acquired the reputation of a seducer that will be attributed to him, wrote: "From Terni I went to Cirocoli.. and from there to Castel-Nuovo, from where I went to Rome where I arrived on the first of September at nine in the morning. I must not forget to mention here a particular circumstance which will please more than one reader, however ridiculous it may be in the end. An hour after Castel-Nuovo, the air was calm and the sky serene, I saw to my right and ten steps away from me a pyramidal flame of the height of a cubit and raised four or five feet above the level of the ground. This apparition struck me because it seemed to accompany me. Wanting to study it, I tried to get closer to it, but the more I went in its direction the more it moved away from me. It stopped as soon as I stopped and, when the part of the road I was crossing was bordered by trees, I stopped seeing it, but I found it again as soon as the edge of the road became free again. I also tried to turn back, but each time it disappeared and only reappeared when I was heading back towards Rome. This strange beacon did not leave me until the light of day had chased away the darkness.... I had the prudence not to tell anyone about it."

Mortimer Cromwell, a physicist, was returning home at 8:40 pm when he saw a light towards the southwest from St James Park. It moved in a wavelike motion, and he saw it for 30 seconds. At the front was a bright flame projected backwards, followed by a glowing fire in an opaque capsule, followed by a long tail becoming increasingly darker towards the end. The head of this tadpole-shaped object had an apparent diameter of half a degree, the tail a length of three degrees, and for the thickness 1/8 of a degree.

GRANDE-BRETAGNE, Peibio (Anglesay - pays de Galles)
At Peibio, near Holyhead, two farmers working in the fields saw
"a ship with its sails, flying in the air." The object came from the
southeast, from the direction of Mount Snowdon (Caernarvan) and was
heading towards the witnesses. They added that a "flock of birds
gathered to watch the phenomenon and then dispersed in all directions".
According to the farmers, the object must have weighed 90 tonnes and
was moving at an altitude of about 40 m. The "airship" resembled the
old steamships that used to shuttle between Holyhead and Ireland. They
could clearly see the bottom of the "ship" when it passed almost
vertically. The weather was quite cloudy. According to the witnesses,
similar observations had already been made in the region ten or twenty
years before. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p.109-110)

The Ruggieri, of Bolognese origin, were famous throughout Europe. Louis XV had them come to his court to organize real pyrotechnic spectacles at Versailles. But it was in London, in St James's Park, that the firework display was fired that has probably never been surpassed in magnificence. King George II had asked Gaetano Ruggieri, assisted by Giuseppe Sarti, to celebrate the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. He was so impressed that a complete description was published in a special book.

Some kind of fiery house approached close to the ground and caused some damage in the town. "It took the form of a pyramid and suddenly moved forward in the direction of the Erick. It then rushed into this river at great speed and disappeared a little after Blairgowrie (more than 7 km away). This caused considerable excitement... When it passed, this object carried a large cart and transported it several meters away, into a field. A man who was on the main road at that moment was thrown off his horse and knocked out; he remained unconscious for a long time. The object also destroyed a house and the arch of the new bridge in Blairgowrie. After that it quickly disappeared." (Michel BOUGARD: "The Chronicle of UFOs" - Delarge 1977 p.113)

#September 1768
GERMANY, between Frankfurt and Leipzig
Excerpt from the 6th book of Goethe's autobiography. At the time he was 16 years old and was on his way to the University of Leipzig. The journey was arduous in the pouring rain and on the hills, the travelers had to get down to relieve the effort of the horses. During one of these forced marches, he noticed an astonishing phenomenon: "Suddenly, in a ravine to the right of the road, I saw a kind of amphitheater, wonderfully lit. In a pipe-shaped space an incalculable number of small lights were placed one on top of the other. They shone so brightly that the eye was dazzled. But what troubled most in this vision was that the lights were not fixed, they jumped here and there, went up and down and vice versa, in all directions. The greatest number of them, however, remained stable and radiated. It was with the greatest reluctance that I consented, when I was called, to move away from this spectacle that I would have liked to examine more closely. The postilion, when I questioned him, declared that he had never had knowledge of such a phenomenon, but that there was an old stone quarry nearby whose excavation was filled with water. It remains to be seen now whether this was a pandemonium of goblins, or an assembly of luminous creatures, I cannot decide. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p.113-114)

He made, as captain, three voyages from China to Nootka Sound. (...). In these travel memoirs he recounts a story of an extraordinary stranger from the sky, of whom the Nootka Indians spoke. The stranger was dressed in copper, traveled in a copper canoe and that all the stranger possessed was made of metal.
The stranger warned the Indians saying that he came from the sky and that one day their nation would be destroyed and all the people killed. Finally it would be the Nootka who would have the last word on the stranger by killing him and stealing all his metal objects. (UFO Joe website, collected from the Internet May 1997)

Mr. Tiberius Cavallo made an exceptional observation from the terrace of Windsor Castle: "To the northeast of the terrace, in a clear sky and warm weather, I suddenly saw an oblong cloud moving almost parallel to the horizon. Below this cloud one could distinguish something like a luminous object which soon became spherical, brightly lit and eventually stayed stationary. It was then about 9:45 pm. This strange ball first appeared bluish and pale, but its luminosity increased and soon it started moving east. The object then changed direction and moved parallel to the horizon before disappearing to the southeast. I was able to observe it for half a minute and the light it emitted was prodigious. It illuminated any object on the ground. Before its disappearance it changed shape, became oblong and at the moment when a kind of trail appeared, it seemed to split into two small bodies. Barely two minutes later the sound of an explosion was heard." The same kind of phenomenon was reported that evening in Deptford (Wiltshire) as well as in Hartlepool.

#1785, 7 January
THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
Frenchman Blanchard and American Jeffries make the first crossing of the English channel in the history of aerial locomotion. They cover approximately 50 km in 2 hours and 20 minutes. They would have carried some letters, which would bring the birth of air mail to this first crossing of the "channel". ("The Conquest of the Air, Chronology..." A. Van Hoorebeeck - ed. Marabout University 1967, p. 24)

#1785, June 3
GREAT BRITAIN, LONDON
During an ascent made in London, Blanchard carried, for their first air
flight, the two youngest passengers to date, the Simonet Sisters, aged
17 and 14. A dog accompanied the travellers. On this occasion,
Blanchard tried out a parachute of his own invention: the dog was
released from the balloon, it landed without harm. ("The Conquest of
the Air, Chronology..." A. Van Hoorebeeck - ed. Marabout University

#1785, June 15
THE CHANNEL
Pilatre de Rozier, accompanied by P.A. de Romain, attempts a crossing of the channel on board of an "Aero-Montgolfiere", a combination of a hydrogen balloon and a Montgolfiere. A few minutes after taking off, the aerostat returns towards the French coast, catches fire and crashes in Wimereux. Both occupants are killed. ("The Conquest of the Air, Chronology..." A. Van Hoorebeeck - Ed. Marabout Université 1967, p. 24)

#1785, June 17
IRELAND, DUBLIN
Dr. Potain ascended from Dublin in a balloon with the intention of crossing the St. George's Channel. He advanced far out over the sea, but a contrary wind drove him back to the Irish coast. Some claim that Dr. Potain did not even reach above the sea. ("The Conquest of the Air, Chronology..." A. Van Hoorebeeck - ed. Marabout University 1967, p. 24)

#1785, 29th June
GREAT BRITAIN, LONDON
The Italian Lunardi and the British Biggin ascend in London, accompanied by the first British female aeronaut, Mrs Sage. This fact is often contested despite an engraving depicting Mrs Sage and Biggin in the balloon's gondola. It seems that the ascensional power of the aerostat was insufficient. The authentic passengers of Lunardi would have been a dog, a cat and a pigeon. We have not found the name of the one who would be the first female aeronaut of English nationality, if one disregards Mrs Sage. ("The Conquest of the Air, Chronology..." A. Van Hoorebeeck - ed.

FRANCE
Pierre Testu-Brissy makes the first night ascension. [note from vog: after reading his numerous tests and flights carried out in the 18th century, I am forced to think that the appearance 100 years later in the USA of the famous "airships" is a hoax...] ("The Conquest of the Air, Chronology..."

#1790, June 12
FRANCE, Alençon (Orne)
Report written by Inspector of Police Liabeuf: "At five o'clock in the morning, some peasants observed an enormous globe that seemed to be surrounded by flames. At first they thought it was a burning hot air balloon, but its great speed and the whistling it emitted intrigued them greatly. The globe descended gently, turned and eventually crashed at the top of a hill, uprooting the vegetation that grew on its sides. The heat emitted by the object was so great that the grass and shrubs caught fire shortly afterwards. The peasants managed to contain the fire which otherwise would have spread throughout the region. In the evening, the globe was still hot and then something extraordinary happened, barely believable. The witnesses of this event are two mayors, a doctor, and three other local personalities who confirm my report, not to mention the dozens of peasants who were also present. The sphere, which was large enough to contain a whole crew, was intact after the flight it had just made. It slowly aroused the curiosity of the people who came from all directions to see it. Then, suddenly, a door opened and a person came out, just like us, but dressed in a strange way with clothes that clung to his body; seeing the crowd, this person muttered some incomprehensible words and fled into the woods. ('but he seemed to have dissolved in thin air,'"Liabeuf wrote: "he dissolved like air, Liabuef wrote - cfr John KEEL) The peasants instinctively recoiled, frightened, and ran away. Shortly afterwards the sphere exploded silently, sending debris in all directions; these debris burned until they were reduced to powder. Searches were carried out to find the mysterious man but he seemed to have evaporated into the air and so far no trace of him has been found..." [note from vog: is there really a report about this somewhere, or is this stuff made up by an author and taken up by others without further ado?] (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970, p. 62, summary) (Michel BOUGARD: "The Chronicle of UFOs" - Delarge 1977 p.116-117, full text) (See OPERATION TROJAN HORSE by John A.
