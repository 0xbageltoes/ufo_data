EUROPE
A strange ovoid-shaped object of fire color crossed the sky of Europe. It went from south to east and changed direction before disappearing to the west. This fact was reported by the German humanist Hartmann Schaeden in an incunable written in 1493. On this document, which would now be in the possession of the Verdun museum, one can apparently see a representation of the UFO. A kind of cylinder or cigar surrounded by flames, flying over a verdant countryside. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p. 66) (like a comet???)

At sea, in the English Channel
"...coming from Normandy, several members of a crew perished at sea in the English Channel... A fire shone and burned superbly in the air. It came close to the ground and illuminated it for some time. Then, it departed, rose very high and then shot into the waters. In many places it burned woods and crops. In Northumberland this fire was seen twice in the year.. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p. 66)

For three nights, starting at midnight, a man of fire was said to have run from one birch tree to another. Georg Miltenburger, who lived near a hop field near Railbach, Freienstein district, explained that the figure had first appeared on Sunday night, between 11:00 PM and midnight, quite far from him: he was nevertheless able to count all the figure's ribs. Many other people saw him on the crest of the hills as he ran in all directions. He spat fire from his nose and mouth. (Michel BOUGARD, Inforespace n° 23, p. 35) That year, one night, a man of fire haunted the mountain like an apparition; it was just midnight. The man went from one birch tree to another, setting them on fire, the guard declared that he looked like a bright fire. He did the same thing for three nights, and that was it.

#1186, August 9
GREAT BRITAIN, Dunstable (county of Betford)
Benedict of Peterborough in his "Gesta Regis Henrici Secundum" reports that at the ninth hour of the day (around 2 pm) the sky suddenly opened and both the laity and the clergy of the abbey saw a very long and astonishingly large cross. The apparition lasted until midnight.<br/><br/>
Walther of Hemingford, chronicler and canon of Gisburn, also reports the event in his "Chronica" but places it in 1189, specifying that the cross was bright and white like silk. William of Newburgh, on the other hand, also places the event in 1189 but in Dunstaple this time, on the road to London and adds "one hour after noon the Emblem of the Lord and the shape of a crucified man were seen". But this is not the end of these mysterious crosses. The archives of the Dunstable abbey obviously report the majestic passage of an immense cross, high in the sky, from east to west, but this time the observation was made in 1217.

#End of 1200's
USSR, Russia, Don region
(Note: this was in chron3, and marked "End of 13th century".) The inhabitants of a large village were one day surprised to find, 2 km from their home, a metal ball 3 meters in diameter. The whole population came to admire this strange object, wondering what it could be and where it came from. It certainly had not arrived by road, as there were no traces of wheels on the road or in the fields. If it had fallen from the sky, or been vomited from hell, one should have seen a hole or something. But there was nothing abnormal. The surface of the gray ball was as smooth as a marble. Not so smooth, however, as circles, very regular, as if drawn by a compass, and of various sizes, were engraved on it. The villagers tried to push the thing, to make it roll on itself. Useless efforts: it did not move a millimeter. (...) When Pouchkine arrived, a Cossack of very bad reputation but, despite all his faults, very courageous, the villagers immediately informed him of the presence of the mysterious object. (...) Drawing his saber, he rushed on horseback on it, swearing and defying it to resist him. (...) ... the spectators are ready to go home. But they start screaming in fear: a circle of the ball has split, revealing an eye, a round cyclops eye that stares fixedly at its assailant, who, in turn, laughs and continues to strike, striking so hard that his sabre breaks (...) The peasants flee. Some hide behind the trees. And what do they see? They see Pouchkine and his mount becoming transparent before disappearing completely into the air. Yet they still hear his curses (...) Two days after this great fight, rider and horse, staggering like people who have drunk too much, made their entrance on the square (...) He started to shout that he was going to set fire to the wood and that the horrible thing would roast with everything around it. So everyone ran after him to witness the spectacle, but only witnessed his sad disappointment: the ball was no longer there. (Peter KOLOSIMO: "Shadows on the Stars" - Albin Michel 1970, p. 315, 316)

CHINA, Pien King, (Honan)
Ogdai, son of Genghis Khan, was marching south when he came upon the walls of Pien King. There, he had the greatest surprise of his life. The defenders possessed two secret weapons. One was a real thunder that shook the skies, in Chinese: "chin-tien-loui", the other, worse, flying fire arrows, not simple arrows dipped in flaming pitch but authentic rockets that their wand allowed them to shoot from a bow. The thunder of the firecrackers and the flashes of the rockets spread terror among Ogdai's horde. ("Assault on Space" Georges H. Gallet, ed. of Modern Thought, p. 18, 19)

Extract from Liou Ying: I get up at dawn and through the window, I see a very bright star crossing the Milky Way. Now I see three bright objects appear in the southern sky, two of which fly away and suddenly disappear from my sight. The one that remains has five unequal lights under it and on its upper part I notice something dome-shaped. The unknown object begins to zigzag, like a dead leaf. At the same time something burning falls from the sky. Soon after the sun rises but its brightness is dulled by the bright object moving quickly in the direction of the north. In the western sky, a green cloud is suddenly agitated by another unknown object, oval, flat, which descends quickly. This object is more than three meters long, it is surrounded by burning flames, it rises shortly after its descent. . (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials" ed. Mercure de FRANCE, 1983, p.37)

"At the beginning of the month of September, many asud (name given to celestial objects by Professor Marzocchi) appeared in the sky and shooting stars." "On the second day of the month of September, at the second hour of the night, a great asud appeared to men who were on the public square of Forli and to others gathered in other places. It crossed the sky very slowly and stayed in the sky for the time of two Pater Noster and was as long as a step. When it disappeared, the men who were on the square reported that it sent out a smell of burning wood. We have also heard other people who assured that the said asud in fire was travelling through the air in its own way. But then it remained still for a little while in the sky and after that time it gradually disappeared leaving in its place like a cloud and the rest of the vapours had taken the shape of snakes, a thing quite admirable".

According to Jean Juvenal des Ursins, the following text can be read: In the country of Languedoc, a large star and five small ones were seen in the sky. It seemed as if they were attacking and wanted to fight the large one and followed it for half an hour. And voices were heard in the sky like cries. And afterwards a man was seen who seemed to be made of copper, holding a lance in his hand, and throwing fire, who seized the large star and struck it. And nothing more was ever seen. In some parts of Guyenne, voices and the clanking of armor and people fighting were heard. These things gave people great fear and terror, and not without cause. And because these things happened before the battle of Hungary, some said that this was its meaning. (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p.73)

SPAIN, Jaén
Between 11pm and midnight, one of the most impressive supernatural performances in human history was orchestrated in the city of Jaén. A diverse angelic militia, strong from 400 to 1000 anthropomorphic silhouettes, was materialized, slowly advancing towards the St Ildefonse church, from the first belt of streets outside the city to the main street of Les Cantarerias, along the cemetery to the parish. It was like one of those Catholic processions organized at that time, with crucifixes carried in arms, followed by a score of clerics marching in double file and praying aloud in an incomprehensible jargon for the inhabitants of the city. Then there was a kind of matron, a mature woman carrying a baby of a few months, she was raised above the other characters, and curiously at the time nobody identified her with the Holy Virgin. This character was escorted by a follower who held an open book in front of her. A cortege of 300 boys and girls followed. All this theater gradually faded away in the air, disappearing as incomprehensibly as it had appeared. All this is recorded by a notarial deed bearing all the names of the witnesses on parchment on June 13, 1430 before the provost Villalpando.

On this day of Our Lord, on All Saints' Day, November 1, there appeared in the sky an object shining like a bar of iron, long and wide like half the Moon. It remained motionless for fifteen minutes. Then, suddenly, the strange object began to rise in a spiral, then it turned and whirled like an unwound watch spring and afterwards it disappeared into the sky (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970, p. 60). That night (All Saints' Night 1461), indeed, he (Sir Jean Du Clercq, advisor to the Duke of Burgundy) witnessed, along with a crowd of stunned Arrageois, a very strange phenomenon. He saw, motionless in the sky of Arras, "like a kind of iron bar, quite long and thick like half a half-moon". The sky was clear and the apparition was perfectly visible. It lasted well a quarter of an hour. Then the "thing" began to "corkscrew, twist and twirl like a watch spring in the sky and disappear"... The emotion was great in Arras and people will talk for a long time about this extraordinary event to which nobody can give an explanation! (Phil..., Mail-list: OVNI-SCIENCES, 1999)

On these two ships measuring more than ten arms, men two arms long were busy, each wearing a red hat and multicolored clothes. They all held a pole in their hand. The ships moved very quickly. At Lü Yu's house that day there were a dozen scholars who, alerted by Lü Yu, came out of the house and stood next to him to observe the phenomenon. Then, the men in multicolored clothes passed their hand over the mouths of the scholars: their mouths immediately became black and none of the scholars could speak anymore. At that moment, they saw a man, escorted like a mandarin, dressed like a retired scholar, emerge on one of the ships, accompanied by a bonze. Long after, the ships flew away, as if pushed by the clouds, and fell a kilometer away in a cemetery. The ships gone, the scholars felt their mouths become normal again. But five days later, Lü Yu died for unknown reasons. (SHI BO: "China and the Extraterrestrials" ed. Mercure de FRANCE, 1983, p.42)

It appeared to be of excessive length and was of a blood-red color; at the top of it, one could see the figure of a bent arm, holding a great sword in its hand, as if it wanted to strike. At the tip, there were three stars. On both sides of the rays of this comet, one could see a great number of axes, knives, swords colored with blood, among which there were a great number of hideous human bundles, with beards and bristling hair.

#1528
NETHERLANDS, Utrecht
During the siege of Utrecht "a cruel and strange observation was made in the sky, which terrified the citizens and made the enemies believe they were going to occupy the city. It was yellow in color and passed over the city, high in the sky, and was frightening to behold". (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p.79)

#1529 to 1555
ROMANIA
In the museum of the small town of Sibiu, Romania, extraordinary documents are available to those who wish to consult them. In 1555 a three-stage space rocket was built running on solid fuel. The author of this invention of a prodigious technique returns to the master of fire, Conrad Haas. The chronology of inventions is found in the Sibiu Manuscript: 1529: Two-Stage Rocket (ignition in both), 1529: Three-Stage Rocket, 1529: Rocket Battery, 1536: Flying House. Experimentation of the principle of ignition in the multi-stage rocket, 1555: Use of delta wings to stabilize rockets in flight.

#1553, January 13
PERU, Porco and Potosi
At the time when Sebastian and his allies were preparing troops and weapons for the execution of his uprising in this city and Captain Francesco Hernandez Giron was doing the same in Chaqui, three Suns and two Moons appeared in the sky above the Porco site, in the middle of a circular halo, and inside it two blue and red arcs. Two other arcs of various colors and an admirable comet of blood red color appeared above the rich hills of the imperial city. On Friday, January 13, 52 days before General Hinojosa was assassinated, at 7 o'clock in the morning, a large circle was seen in the sky above Porco, passing through the middle of the natural Sun and it was all white, the size of an empan. It was reddish, tending towards the color of blood and the two others at its sides were very red and made of blood, to the point that their brightness and fire took away the sight of those who looked at them. The two Moons located at the limit were of a kind of white and a little red tending towards the color of blood. The two arcs that appeared were blue and red, the smaller arc was wider than the other. The comet that seemed to be born from the halo was blazing and made of blood, with a formidable head and a tail of the same material. This prodigy was seen from the Porco site and all its surroundings. The comet was seen again seven days later, at dawn, on the hill of Potosi, with two other arcs, one very white that seemed polished silver, the other that was above it, of a red tending towards blood and shining like a fire. One end of this arc ended in a kind of spiral ray of blood color... (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p.81)

GERMANY, Tübingen (Baden-Württemberg)
"Many black clouds appeared around the Sun, like those we see when great storms rage. And soon after other clouds of fire and blood emerged from the Sun, and others yellow like saffron. From these clouds came light effects in the shape of large, high and wide hats, and the earth itself appeared yellow and bloody and covered with high and wide hats that took on different colors such as red, blue, green and mostly black...

#1561, April 14
GERMANY, Nuremberg
At sunrise the inhabitants of Nuremberg had a very frightening vision... "In addition to red, bluish or black balls, and circular discs, two large pipes were seen..., in which small and large pipes there were three balls, also four and more. All these elements began to fight against each other". This battle seemed to have lasted an hour, then, "as mentioned above, from the Sun and the sky, it fell to the earth as if everything was burning and with a great vapor everything was consumed". In the middle of these spheres a elongated shape was also observed "similar to a large black lance". (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970, p. 61; cites Nuremberg Gazette in "A Modern Myth" by C.G. Jung, Paris, 1961)

Shortly before Christmas. Absalon Pedersson Beyer, a Protestant priest, and Christern Ulff as well as a goldsmith, the latter two accompanied by their wives, women and servants, observed a round, black, abnormal cloud passing in front of the moon and covering it. The black cloud emitted a puff of black smoke and the witnesses then heard a whistling sound. The cloud then went back and forth and finally disappeared. All this happened from around 5:30 pm until around 9 pm.

Many discs, both white and black, appear in the sky of Basel and move; the whole population sees them. (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of UFOs" - Laffont 1970, p. 61) The "Gazette of Basel", written by Samuel Coccius, "student of Holy Writings and of free arts, in Basel, in the homeland, in August of the year 1566", reports, in the dialect of the time, that on August 7th of that year, at sunrise, "one saw in the air many large black balls which moved quickly and very rapidly towards the sun, then they turned around, crashing into each other as if they were fighting; a great number of them became red and fiery, and afterwards they burned and extinguished". As the period illustration shows, the observation took place in Basel; the image shows the "Munster" square, the cathedral, with the Antistitium. (UFOs with Heidi, cfr GREPI, Switzerland, 1997)

#February 13, 1575
BELGIUM, Brabant
At 9 o'clock in the evening, Cornelius Gemma, a professor of medicine at Louvain, saw two large hoops coming from the north, as well as two arcs and a vast light. One of the hoops had several colors and both were leaning on the west, on the equinox point. The southernmost arc broke near the belt of Orion and a multitude of rays, lances and javelins came out of the breach. Moving, they formed the image of a bloody battle. A red vapor spread in the sky and then became a vivid purple. Meanwhile, a white cloud with a dark spot rose towards the sky. The lances and javelins rose towards the sky and the fire became universal.

#1575, 28 September

FRANCE, Tors (Charente Maritime)
Agrippa D'Aubigné relates: "A few days after the taking of Tors, the lord of the place took his guest to a garden, a little before sunset, and they saw a round cloud of a horrible color to look at, for which the Latin word subfusca (dark brown) must be used. This cloud seemed like a hat with an ear in the middle, with the colors of an Indian cockerel's throat that the spectator judged to be similar in all respects to the phlegmon that had been torn from him in the aposthume of his plague that he had had in Orleans. This hat with its fateful sign came in and melted near the bell tower..." [note from vog: I could not find a village called Tors, nor Beauvais in Charente Maritime...] (Michel BOUGARD: "La chronique des OVNI" - Delarge 1977 p.85-86)

FRANCE, Turnac (Sarlat, Dordogne)
At vespers it happened in the parish of Carsac, land of Monfort, that in the air, as on the plain of a place called Turnac, on the side of the Midi, facing the West, there appeared a great army equipped and in good order, both on foot and on horseback, making a hundred paces in front and remaining for about two hours, as if preparing to clash. And suddenly they rushed into the skirmish, one among the others: some of them could be distinguished by the color of their clothes which were yellow, and by their banners. During this first battle, from the side of the East, and from the part of the Roc de Carsac, a larger and better formed army of people dressed in white was seen, holding a white staff in their hands.
