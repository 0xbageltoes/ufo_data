The rockets were applied to essentially (note from vog: but not 100%...) peaceful purposes: for sounding the upper atmosphere. The explosive charge was replaced by special devices, photographic chambers, spectrographs, etc. destined to descend by parachute, and knowledge of our aerial envelope could thus be extended up to 135 km, and even 183 kilometers of altitude in 1947.

Mrs. H. V. Olavick and Mr. Rawlins, who later became her husband, observed 10 flying saucers performing bizarre aerial maneuvers above Tucson. One of the saucers was larger than the other nine and was estimated to be 100 feet in diameter. While they watched, the nine smaller saucers seemed to be "playing hide and seek" together around a cloud and this game was accompanied by violent maneuvers that lasted seven minutes. Finally, regrouping behind the largest saucer in a V formation, the group flew off to the northeast at a dizzying speed.

At approximately 8:30 PM, an aerial phenomenon was observed crossing the sky from SE to NE following a practically rectilinear trajectory. A consensus of the observers placed the object at an altitude of approximately 3000 feet and a speed greater than 400 mph and the witnesses described the object as being spherical in shape with an approximate diameter of 3 to 4 feet. It seemed to be burning and left a generally uniform trail, but with, sometimes, enlargements that could suggest successive pulsations. The object also apparently emitted a trail of flames of about 3 meters long, but no sound was heard. (Phenomena #35 of 1997 pp. 6 and 7)

Seven employees of the Pike's Peak Railway were peacefully having lunch when, around 12:15, a bright silver object approached quickly. When it arrived above the witnesses, the UFO almost stopped and began to circle. At times it reflected the sunlight and when observed through binoculars it was impossible to accurately estimate its dimensions. The object moved silently for more than 20 minutes, diving towards the ground and changing direction before finally disappearing. (Michel BOUGARD: "From S.V. to UFOs" - SOBEPS 1976 - p. 32,33)

USA, Bakersfield (California)
Richard Rankin, Palm Springs, California, pilot, reported having observed 10 flying saucers above Bakersfield on the 23rd (error, it was the 14th) of June. They were flying at an altitude of 9000 feet, quickly, at a speed of 300 or 400 mph. "I counted 10 in formation," he said. "They were heading north. At 2:15 pm (error, it was noon) they turned around, heading south, and there were only seven left in the formation. I couldn't see their engines, or where they were located, and they had no wings. They appeared round to me. They resembled the drawings of the "Navy's Flying Flapjack". The Navy claims the Flapjack have not left their base.
Rankin has logged 7000 hours of flight, and is the brother of stunt pilot Tex Rankin. (from the "Las Vegas Review-Journal, July 2, 1947. Portland, Ore., July 2.") Richard Rankin was outside at noon and watching a boy mowing the neighbor's lawn. The weather was clear and sunny when Rankin and the young man saw ten objects flying in a loose V formation. They were heading north. But then seven of the discs turned around and flew back over them on their way south. Their diameter was 30 to 35 feet and they were flying at an estimated speed of 350 mph at an altitude of about 8500 feet.

On July 8th Colonel Blanchard announced the recovery of a crashed flying disc. That same evening General Ramey denied this information saying it was a weather balloon. For 50 years now this affair has been the subject of much ink: UFO or not UFO? Recovery of some small dead and alive creatures by the USAF? Will we ever know?

#1947, June 21
USA, Maury Island, Tacoma
14:00: Dahl, on a patrol boat in the harbor, saw when looking up, at 600 m altitude, 6 machines resembling giant inner tubes with portholes. 5 of them were slowly turning around the 6th, which seemed to be in trouble. They slowly and silently descended to 150 m above the water. After a muffled explosion, the central object started to pour out slag and molten metal, which hit the water with a hissing sound. The whole group then rose and moved away out to sea. Dahl made a report to his superior Fred L. Crisman, who was initially skeptical before seeing a saucer himself in the area. Through editor Ray Dero Palmer, Kenneth Arnold met Dahl who claimed that in the meantime he had been contacted by a mysterious man in black. This man described the Tacoma incident as clearly as if he had been standing next to Dahl during the observation. The man ordered him to keep quiet. (Philippe SCHNEYDER: "Ovni, premier bilan" - éd. du Rocher 1983, p. 185)
(...) "Five minutes passed like this, then one of the machines detached from the formation and approached the one that was not moving. It seemed to us that it touched it, then in turn it stopped. After a few minutes we heard a muffled sound and the lowest placed object started to eject thousands of (...) fine white metal particles that were fluttering in the air (...) Then the same object spat out black metal fragments that were thrown into the water or onto the beach. They must have been hot because their contact with the water caused a release of steam. We ran to take refuge on the rocks, but my son was burned on one arm by a fragment of this metal, while our dog was killed. Suddenly the metal rain stopped. The strange object and its five companions rose silently and headed west, towards the Pacific. (...) (A. RIBERA: "Ces mystérieux Ovni" - De Vecchi 1976, p. 66 to 71) All this affair would be a hoax set up to discredit the Kenneth Arnold case - also read "The coming of the Saucers" by K.

USA, between CHEHALIS and YAKIMA, Mount Rainier (Washington)
"Kenneth Arnold Incident".
Against the whiteness of the snow, he saw nine bright discs rushing at a frantic pace, a speed he mentally estimated, by comparing their angular speed and their approximate distance given by the mountain, at more than two thousand kilometers per hour. For three minutes the astonished American saw the nine bright discs maneuvering around the peaks, in formation, "exactly," he recounted later, "as if they were connected to each other at 4,000 meters of altitude." Still relying on the approximate distance of the mountain, he calculated that their size must have been that of a DC-3"... . ("Lights on Flying Saucers" Aimé Michel, ed. Maison MAME, 1954, p. 15) Kenneth Arnold had taken off from Chehalis for a mountain search mission: a C-46 of the Navy would have crashed somewhere in the Cascade Mountains. Sunny afternoon and very good visibility. Suddenly, around 3 pm, a white-blue flash illuminated the entire right side of his cabin. He looked around to see where it came from, when a second flash, then others, made him turn his head. He then saw a formation of nine sparkling objects, of a metallic shine, coming from the direction of Mount Baker and going in that of Mount Rainier; it flew very close to the peaks and at a very high speed. The objects that composed it seemed to be connected to each other and it disappeared behind a high peak. Taking Mount Rainier and Mount Adams as reference points, Mr. Arnold calculated by triangulation the speed of these objects and was surprised to obtain 2,700 km/h; the formation was 30 to 40 km from his plane. Its speed was astonishing at the time because the sound barrier had not yet been broken, that is 1,200 km/h. He also noticed that the objects flew in two parallel lines, one of five, the other of four and that their flight was not straight, regular, but erratic. That same evening he declared to journalists that these objects had behaved like saucers bouncing on the water. Each disc-shaped object had about the size of a four-engine C-54, which is respectable. Their appearance was similar to that of a hammered bronze bowl. The bottom of each saucer seemed flat and the top more bulging. (Henry DURRANT: "The Black Book of Flying Saucers" - Laffont 1970 - p.86-87) Hans Van Kampen, after a thorough examination (...) concluded that Arnold could have seen a flight of F-84 Thunderjets which were still secret planes at that date. Were the first UFOs really planes? (Janet and Colin BORD: "Modern Mysteries of the World" - Guild Publishing London 1989, p. 47) Pendeleton (Oregon) June 25 (A.P.) - Kenneth Arnold reports that he observed nine bright objects, flying at 2000 km/h above the Cascade chain in the western part of the state of Washington. These objects were saucer-shaped and were at an altitude of 3000 meters. When Arnold had spotted them, they were 40 or 50 km away and were heading north (F. Scully: "The Mystery of Flying Saucers", ed. Del Duca, Paris "Les éditions Mondiales" 1951, p.169, which cites the "Los Angeles Times of June 26, 1947, title "Nine saucers flying at 2000 km-h have been observed. But what are they?" (also read "The coming of the Saucers" by K. Arnold, 1952, Palmer: of the nine objects 8 were similar and one was very different.) (continued on July 29, 1947)

USA, Cascade Mountains (Oregon)
On the same June 24, 1947, before the aviator's story was released by the press, a prospector working in the Cascade Mountains named Fred Johnson had seen in the sky six objects exactly like those of Kenneth Arnold. He was even able to follow them with a telescope for several seconds. Curiously, while these objects were passing, the magnetic needle of his compass, gone mad, was agitated in its case. ("Lueurs sur les Soucoupes Volantes" Aimé Michel, ed. Maison MAME, 1954, p. 15,16) A prospector, Mr. Johnson, reported the daytime passage of several UFOs that made the needle of his compass swing from side to side. The witness was questioned at length by the FBI. (doc. FBI - Bruce Maccabee trans. Jean Sider) Johnson had his attention drawn to a flash of light in the sky and saw six bright, round objects. As these objects flew towards the southeast at an altitude of about 1000 feet, Johnson noticed they had tails and flew silently. The observation lasted from 45 to 60 seconds as the prospector watched them through a hand telescope. He estimated their diameter to be about 30 feet, their shape was not perfectly circular, it ended in an oval point towards the front. At the tail end he also saw something swinging from left to right. The objects flew at a speed never seen before.

Jets have circular exhausts and when they fly people can have the optical illusion of seeing round objects." ("UFO's: A Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 39)

J.E. Johnson went down to the basement, around 1:30 in the morning, to check the plumbing. A basement that was entered from the front of the house. When he came out, while he was in his yard, his attention was drawn to a circular, luminous object that crossed his field of vision 8 meters in front of him. It had a diameter of about 4 meters, appeared flat and quickly moved at low altitude from south to north. Its appearance surprised him "not so much in itself, but because the object emitted rays that had numbed me from head to toe. I could barely get back home". His wife, a nurse, was in the kitchen and confirmed his state. The next day he felt pain in his chest and had difficulty raising his arm. He said that the observation was accompanied by a "fireworks rocket noise". (Phenomena #35 of 1997, p. 8)

Two citizens reported having observed mysterious objects rotating, luminous, and flying at high speed above the city. William Crodie saw a silver object, without wings or tail, he said that the phenomenon was descending slowly. A woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, reported having seen some vaporous objects in the shape of a disk pass over her house about a month ago. She did not dare to say it right away, for fear that people would consider her crazy. (source: Jan Aldrich of UFO activity over British Columbia during the summer of 1947 - newspaper articles).

At sea, off the coast of KENYA
The steamer Llandovery Castle was sailing along the Kenyan coast southward. The night was very starry but without a moon. A passenger who was walking on the ship's aft deck noticed an unusual shadow that partially masked the stars. It seemed to him that it was descending and approaching the boat. He told an officer who, having seen it, called the captain. At that moment twelve people, nine of them passengers, were observing the object that was approaching. It was huge and had no running lights. The thing settled at a height of 30 m above the sea and at a distance of 800 m from the ship, between the coast and it. It lit up a blinding white searchlight that illuminated the sky from the bottom of the object to the surface of the water and the reflection of this light allowed to see a gigantic dirigible-shaped craft, controlled intelligently, which advanced in concert with their ship. It was about twice the length of the Llandovery Castle, that is to say about 300 m, was silent, seemed to be made of a shiny material that reflected the light reflected by the sea as well as the glow of the stars. This craft sailed in concert with the ship for several minutes then turned off its projector and rose quickly and silently into the night sky from whence it came.

Clarence Hale and his wife Ruth said they saw hundreds of UFOs in the area. The first one in 1947. They got so used to it that they no longer pay attention. "We have a kind of intuition," said Ruth. "We feel that there is one outside, and when we go out, of course, there is one. They give us the impression of a kind of warm friendship. They are trying to make the earth and the universe better, filled with friendship and love. Most of the people in the area think the same thing.

In addition, they claim to have provided the US authorities with a lot of evidence and evidence, such as this powder that is often spread in circles. Cliff Johnson found 5 each 4 meters in diameter, in his lawn one beautiful morning. Clarence Hale adds that he also found circles of powder after observing a UFO at 8 o'clock in the morning, flying at 30 mph, measuring nearly 300 meters long, with lit portholes and doors "(Roger BOAR and Nigel BLUNDELL: "The World's Greatest Ufo Mysteries" ed.

At 11:45 the Baillet couple saw two groups of flying saucers pass over their new house in Portland. The second group was composed of ten or twelve objects and flew low over the small hills near the Columbia River. A quarter of an hour later another woman in the area saw a bright object for fifteen minutes near the Columbia. A welder at work had his gaze drawn outside and watched the bright object with his protective glasses still on. There was an influx of observations and phone calls to Fort Stevens and the Coast Guard of Port Adams. The young county officer Robert E.

(Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - p. 35) An air patrol of the Oregon National Guard almost saw one of these objects. They considered sending an airplane that day to do research near St Maries, where a woman reported that at least ten people saw eight of these flying objects disappear into the fog on July 3rd.

USA, Santa Rosa (California)
Interesting observation because it takes place at the Auxiliary Naval Station and the witnesses are all well trained in observation.
One of the witnesses recounts: "I saw it a few minutes before 5 pm. From my position the phenomenon seemed to be at 1000 feet above the north-south runway of the airfield and I estimated its diameter to be 15 or 20 feet. (...) It had the shape of an enormous pocket watch, without the winding stem. It was covered with a silver material, like aluminum. There was no mark or sign on the surface, which was perfectly smooth. The object flew at the speed of a glider under normal conditions and my first impression was that it was one. However, there was something strange about it, and I observed it better. That's when I realized there were no wings, or any protruding parts. It flew gently north until it reached the end of the runway, there the object turned east, with very little inclination, and headed towards Santa Rosa. I had a moment of inattention and when I looked up again, the thing was gone. But the object must have been controlled. It only deviated when the winds were strong, to resume its straight trajectory. In short, the object behaved exactly like a glider. ("UFO's: A Century of Sightings" by Michael David Hall, Galde Press Inc. 1999, p. 44)

USA, Portland, (Oregon)
In Portland, Oregon, there were hundreds of simultaneous witnesses: pilots, port officers, police officers. And their testimony was consistent: they all had seen a dozen shining discs in the sun, moving quickly in the sky at an altitude that the most qualified estimated at 13,000 meters. ("Lueurs sur les Soucoupes Volantes" Aimé Michel, ed. Maison MAME, 1954, p. 16) At 11 o'clock the passengers of a bus saw, near Redmond, four objects in the shape of a disc flying like lightning over Mount Jefferson. At 1:05 p.m. a police officer, on the parking lot behind the central police station of the city of Portland, noticed that the pigeons were fluttering around as if they were frightened; he looked up and saw five objects in the shape of a disc, two going south and three east. They were flying very fast and seemed to oscillate on their lateral axis. A few minutes later, two other officers, both former pilots, declared that three of these objects were flying in a line. Shortly afterwards, the port patrol called the central police station: a crew of four patrolmen had seen three to six of these discs, in the shape of a chrome wheel hubcap, and moving very quickly, they were also oscillating while flying. (Henry DURRANT: "Le livre noir des S.V." - Laffont 1970 - p.94) It is evident that the multiple fireworks fired at different times on the occasion of Independence Day multiplied the observations of unidentified flying objects, often seen as simple or multiple lights.

Having heard the radio call from Portland, 7 or 8 deputies of the sheriff went out to check. They saw 20 to 30 discs heading southwest, just above the city courthouse. Fred Krives, one of the witnesses, stated: these objects were dark, not at all shiny, they flew in a single line, separated by equal intervals. They headed towards Portland, 7 km away. They stopped flying in formation above Portland by spreading out to the south and west. The witness would have heard a faint buzzing during the observation. (Inforespace n° 20, p. 14)

Observed for 12-15 minutes four white objects with flat base and structured top, flying at varying speeds. One of the objects flew higher and to the right of the other three. (Project: Blue Book - cfr Don Berliner) "Five things," the pilot wrote in his report, "thin and smooth underneath and appearing rough on top, were silhouetted against the setting sun shortly after takeoff from Boise at 8:04 p.m. We saw them very clearly and followed them for about 70 miles in a northeasterly direction. They then disappeared, without our being able to say whether they moved away or disintegrated. We also cannot say whether they were round, oval, or of some other shape, but we are sure they were neither airplanes, clouds, nor smoke." (Edward J. Ruppelt: "Face aux Soucoupes Volantes", ed.

Miramon said they were heading northeast of San Carlos, at 2000 feet altitude, that they were round, silver in color, and the size of a car. A twin-engine transport plane was in the same region of the sky and it seemed to him that the pilot was observing these phenomena and heading towards them.

At around 5:15 in the morning, at least five witnesses saw an unusual object in the sky, flying above Highway 5, near Corning. Jay Munger was drinking his coffee, as he worked the night shift at a bowling alley. He was with the police officers James Overton of Corning and Frank Rakes of Orland. It was Munger who first saw the object through the window. All three of them quickly went outside and saw something oval-shaped and dark grey in color, with a light on the top part, which shone upwards, and a less intense light illuminating downwards, on the base. A darker or black band encircled the object at mid-height. At first the thing was to the west, at a quarter of a mile away, and at around thirty meters above the ground. The thing was practically motionless. The sun had not yet risen, but the lights of the object itself were bright enough. Munger was calling his wife, but she couldn't see anything from where she was, trees blocking her view. He then rejoined the two police officers. The object had barely moved, now being at half a mile away. But then suddenly it accelerated, heading south and disappearing from their sight in less than ten seconds. Paul Heideman, from Fremont, California, was driving on Highway 5 southwards at the same time. He was accompanied by his friend Robert King. He saw the light of the object turn eastwards and remain almost motionless five blocks to the west. The diameter of the object is estimated to be 15 to 30 meters, the thickness 5 to 8 meters, and the black band could have been 1.50 to 3 meters. This object made no sound.

(United Press) A P-38 pilot reported on July 7 that he had shot down a flying saucer on the 6th, above the Root Mountains in western Alabama. He called the saucer a "flying yo-yo". The pilot, Vernon Baird of Los Angeles, flying for the Fairchild Photo-grammetric Engineer's Company, said he spotted the "yo-yo" from his firm's P-38. For the firm, aerial photos were to be taken between Helena and Yellowstone Park. Vernon Baird and his photographer George Suttin of Los Angeles were flying at 360 mph at 32,400 feet when they had engine trouble. "One hundred yards behind us, the yo-yo was there. It was a kind of small, nicely made round plane, pearl gray in color, with a Plexiglas dome. It measured 15 feet in diameter and nearly 4 feet thick." The "yo-yo" came over the P-38 and Baird made an evasive maneuver, in which the propeller touched the "yo-yo" which split into two parts, like a shell. The two halves spiraled down somewhere towards the Madison Range. (note from vog: and nobody found a single little piece?) Baird adds that after the fall of the two parts of the "yo-yo" he saw a lot of other of these things, spinning around "like a bunch of molecules dancing the rumba" Baird said he was too preoccupied with his maneuvers to have noted if there was a pilot in this craft. His photographer didn't even think of taking a photo. (note from vog: doesn't this look like a journalist hoax?)

Mrs. Olavick was in her kitchen at 2101 East Hawthorne Street, Tucson, while Mrs Down was in the garden. Suddenly Mrs. Down called the neighbor in an excited manner. It was noon, with a beautiful cloudless sky. A little to the north of their zenith was a single fluffy, vapor cloud, at an altitude difficult to estimate but probably at 3000 meters. Into and out of this cloud were entering and exiting white, matte objects that moved erratically in the sky, occasionally disappearing into or above this strange cloud. They stayed in observation for 5 or 6 minutes when suddenly the entire group of white things disappeared into or above the cloud. A minute later, a new object emerged from the cloud, it was two to three times larger than the white objects observed previously. Behind the largest object, the small ones followed, and they flew in a "V" formation: four objects just behind the largest, then a row of three and finally two objects in line to finish. As soon as the last two objects closed the formation, the whole group shot off like an arrow towards the northeast, rising, so that in 2 or 3 seconds they had disappeared from view. The witnesses do not know what happened to the cloud after the departure of the objects. In their opinion, they had just had the chance to observe American top-secret planes.

(Las Vegas Review-Journal, July 8, 1947) A rotating disc is said to have fallen into a ravine behind the trees, near Lancaster. "Fifteen or twenty trees caught fire," said the witness. A farmer by the name of Frits Godde denies it, he says that the ovoid and silver saucers were flying in a straight line towards Redlands, he told H.J. Stell, truck driver, who saw eight of them this morning at 6:12. Another farmer, R.V. Allen, says that a whole troop of these objects passed over Ontario. "They flew through the air like a pole swimming in water," he said. Another witness recounts that they flew so low that their engines could be heard. As for Hall Hibbard, vice president of Lockheed, he claims to know nothing of a secret project.

The FBI office in New Orleans reported by telex on 7.7.47 that a small disc had been found. It had descended from the sky emitting smoke. The secret service of the army (G-2) of Barksdale was charged with retrieving it. It was a small flat disc 16 inches in diameter (40 cm) to which two small nozzles were applied. The G-2 of Barksdale had proposed to the FBI to take care of it themselves and the director (Hoover) was informed the next day, July 8, that the Milwaukee Sentinel and Milwaukee Journal had published the day before that Father Joseph Braskey had discovered a wooden saucer. The FBI could not fail to note that Braskey was a confirmed drinker and that he was telling any story and that there was no need to make a more thorough investigation.

USA, Rogers Dry Lake (near Murdoc)
On July 8, 1947, at 11:50, we were in an observation car in Sector 3, Rogers Dry Lake, to follow two P-82s and an A-26, flying at 6000 meters which were to carry out an ejection seat test. We noticed a round object, the color of aluminum, which at first seemed to us to be a parachute. Our first impression was that an ejection seat had been prematurely ejected, but this was not the case. The object was below 6000 m and was falling at a speed about three times greater than that of the test parachute which we saw open 30 seconds after the discovery of the object. As it fell, it was moving slightly to the north of true west, against the prevailing wind. We were unable to determine the horizontal speed but it seemed to us to be lower than the maximum speed of an F-80. When the object reached an altitude allowing us to observe its lateral silhouette, it presented itself in a clearly oval shape with, at the top, two projections which could be thin ailerons or caboches. They crossed each other at intervals, suggesting a slow rotation or oscillation.” (Edward J. Ruppelt: “Face aux Soucoupes Volantes”, ed. France-Empire 1958, p.35, 36)

Astronomer Lincoln La Paz, accompanied by his wife and two daughters, was travelling from Clovis to Clines Corners when they all noticed a curious bright object almost motionless in the sky amidst thin clouds, around 4:50 PM. This object was ellipsoidal and began to climb slowly before disappearing behind a cloud. It reappeared a few seconds later, but much higher, which made Dr. La Paz think he had just encountered a brand new aerial invention.

A flash of light to the left of their plane made them look in that direction. They then saw a huge object, rounded on top, with a black band outlining the central part, flying at an incredible speed towards the north. The base of the object was rotating, and regularly there was a fire emission coming from it, as if it was a jet. The pilot had turned to get closer to this 'thing', but his maneuver was not yet finished when the object passed him and disappeared in the direction of the north, towards Winston-Salem, on a trajectory that passed through High Point and Thomasville."

A works supervisor, José C. Higgins, heard a very sharp, piercing sound and saw a large disc land that was about 50m wide. It was made of a grayish-white metal and stood on curved metal legs. The other workers fled and Higgins was left alone with three entities over 2 meters tall wearing "transparent suits covering head and body, and inflated like rubber bags," as well as "metal boxes" on their backs. Their clothing, visible through the suits, resembled brightly colored paper. The entities, all identical, had huge round eyes, enormous round and bald heads, no eyebrows, no beards, and legs that were proportionally longer than ours. Higgins couldn't tell if they were male or female but he found them strangely beautiful. They surrounded him, one of them raised a metal tube towards him and they seemed to want to draw him into the disc. But observing that they feared the bright sun, he managed to escape and hid for half an hour in a bush where he then observed that, with extraordinary agility, they jumped and gamboled while throwing huge stones. Then they went back into the craft which vanished with a whistle towards the north. In the previous phase one of them had dug eight holes in the ground with a stick and showed Higgins that the largest hole was "Alamo" while the seventh, the farthest away, was "Orque". (Charles BOWEN: "In Search of Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 107) José C.

Suddenly, I saw in the sky, high above the said Tour, a luminous disc. It was the size of the moon (the size is difficult to evaluate, now I have the impression that it was bigger), of a bright white-silver, like aluminum, slightly tinted mauve-light blue, and accompanied by green and red balls. The most characteristic was its descent movement towards the ridges, turning slowly on itself, like leaves falling in autumn. The apparition was very beautiful, I was very moved, it disappeared behind the Tour d'Azeindaz, in the precipice towards Solalex. The whole movement lasted about 15 to 20 seconds, if not more. What was also characteristic is that the object seemed to rush towards me, to "come" from very high. I went to the others to announce this wonderful extraordinary vision, but nobody paid attention and I was even answered very evasively.

"It looked like an airplane wing burning at both ends, but when it passed over me I could see it was round in shape. It was the size of a tractor wheel and four feet thick. It was spinning and flames were coming out all around it. I had laughed at stories about these things, but this time I wasn't laughing, I was scared. The object was real. I wish I had found another witness to this apparition, but at that hour there was no one around." The witness said the object was silent and he was able to observe it for about 20 seconds.

Two women saw three discs topped with dark domes, coming in a triangular formation from behind the hills. They crossed the sky in a straight line, from WSW to ENE. All three seemed to have a lower part in rotation and had a metallic look. (Phenomena No. 35 of 1997 p. 15)

#1947, August 2
CHILE, Santiago
A Lancastrian Star Dust of British South American Airways,
was due to land in Santiago at 5:45 pm. At 5:41 pm the radio reported to the
control tower that all was well on board and that the pilot, Capt.
R. J. Cook was about to begin the approach procedure. At the end of this
message, the Santiago radio operator heard three times, very clearly, very loudly, pronounced by another voice than that of
the pilot, a word that could be spelled as "STENDEK"... (note of vog:
"stand on deck"? It is the cry launched when a ship (mariner) is in distress) From that moment on, there was no more news either from
the plane, or from the 5 crew members, or from the six passengers, or from the radio, or from any other testimonies. A large corridor of 400 km² was combed through with several aircraft, without result. (Henry
DURRANT: "First Investigations on Humanoid ETs" - Laffont 1977 - p. 103, 104) IN REALITY: But in December 1999, Argentinian aviation
enthusiast Juan Carlos Mouso was flying over Mount Tupungato, 110
kilometers (66 miles) southwest of Mendoza and 500 kilometers and 500
kilometers (300 miles) west of Buenos Aires, "when he spotted the glint
of sunshine on a fuselage on the mountain's south face." Mouso convinced
the Argentinian government to mount a search of Tupungato. Assisting
Mouso in the arduous climb was Argentina's 11th Mountain Infantry
Regiment. On Monday, January 24, 2000, Mouso and two Argentinian
soldiers "found a badly-damaged four- engine Lancaster and three frozen
bodies" on one of Tupungato's glaciers at an altitude of 5,500 meters
(17,600 feet.)." Apparently, the Star Dust had exploded in mid-air,
scattering debris over the snowfields to a distance of one kilometer
(0.62 miles). "Investigators huffing through the thin air at the crash
site found twisted metal and the remains of three frozen bodies amid the
wreckage of the fuselage."<br/><br/>
"Besides the three bodies, the searchers also found a woman's hand and a
shoe with a Royal Air Force (RAF) insignia that may have belonged to one
of the pilots." "'The urgency now is to fence off the (crash) site so no
one removes any of the discovered remains until a group of specialists
can arrive, which is difficult but not impossible,' Lt. Col. Bustos
said." Argentinian "federal judge Alfredo Manuel Rodriguez is in charge
of the forensic investigation and is taking fingerprints and DNA samples
to establish the victims' identities." Paul Simpson was reportedly
wearing a small silver lapel pin in the form of a running greyhoud. This
is the insignia of a King's Messenger and will probably be used to
identify his remains, if they are found. (See the Argentinian newspapers

On a day in July, with a cloudless sky, it was still daylight, around 10 pm. (...) The pilot was arriving with his DC 3 towards the Béthel airport. He saw the object to his left and declared that the co-pilot saw it at the same instant. They made a 45° turn to leave the object's trajectory and then had the impression that it was moving away. The pilot described it as a winged object of the apparent size of a C.54. He could not see any propulsion system, any combustion, or any vapor trail. (...) The civil aviation authorities of Béthel had no other plane in the sector. (...) The object was at 1000 feet, and was moving at 300 mph. No radio interference. The object appeared dark and very sharply outlined against the sky. (...) (Phénoména n° 35 of 1997, p. 12 which falsely relates the story in July) At 10 pm (but it was still daylight) the pilot and co-pilot of a military plane saw a UFO in the shape of a winged object without engines or trace of combustion smoke.

Professor R. L. Johannis, a painter and geologist (but also author of science fiction books: 15 or 16 titles in the collection "I Romanzi di Urania" by Mondadori in Milan - cfr Charles BOWEN: "In Search of the Humanoids" - J'ai Lu 1974, p. 228 - for the Italian CISU group: he is only a painter and science fiction author, and Johannis is the pseudonym of Lugi Rapuzzi) on an excursion in the Italian Alps, discovered around 9 o'clock in the morning, while going up the Chiarso stream, a lenticular disc about 10 m wide and two "boys" 50 m away from him. He called them by showing the disc and heading towards them. Halfway there he stopped, stunned, noticing that the boys were 90 cm tall dwarves who were taking a few steps towards him. Big head, no hair, no eyebrows, greenish face, straight nose, widely split mouth, somewhat fish-like. The skin around the huge, round and prominent yellow-green eyes formed rings rather than eyelids. The excited professor started shouting at them, asking who they were and where they were from, while gesturing with his ice axe. One of the two dwarves put his hand to his belt from which then came a very short beam. The professor found himself on the ground and the ice axe flew towards the dwarves who took it away. The witness felt a violent electric shock. The disc rose into the air and a cascade of stones and earth came down from the place where it had been stationed.(Michel BOUGARD: "Des S.V. aux OVNI" - SOBEPS 1976 - p. 216)
<br/><br/>While he was lying on the ground, the two dwarves advanced and stopped 2 meters away from Johannis. He managed to turn and lie on his side. He saw one of the adversaries bend down and pick up the ice axe which was bigger than him. At that moment he could clearly see the green hand taking the object. It had eight fingers of which four were rigid, without joints. It was not really a hand but rather a kind of claw. He also noticed that the breathing of the two beings was oppressed. (A. RIBERA: "Ces mystérieux ovni" - de Vecchi 1976, p. 252, 253) (The CISU group - which also assumes that it is a hoax - gives the following details: the saucer was very shiny as if varnished and of a beautiful red color with a pinkish transverse slit, in the center there was a dome topped with a telescopic antenna. He saw two beings and thought they were small shepherds, before seeing their way of walking in small steps. They had a big head covered with a kind of brown helmet, their eyes were huge and protuberant, the pupil of yellow color crossed by a vertical line and surrounded by a dark iris. They wore a dark blue tights. To the question of what they were doing there, one of the beings manipulated a small box at his belt from which a light smoke came out. Johannis found himself on the ground and one of the beings took his ice axe. They returned to their craft which first rose vertically, then inclined a bit, and left at an enormous speed. At their departure Johannis noted the loss of his ice axe and various aluminum elements of his equipment. Johannis would have made a report of this adventure in 1964, for the Clypeus group.

Mr. and Mrs. Busby, as well as Mrs. Henry Swift, were sitting on the porch of their house around 9:30 pm when suddenly Mrs. Busby cried out, pointing to the sky where she had seen an object fly off to the northeast at an incredible speed. Ten minutes later, the three witnesses saw similar objects, moving in the same direction in a triangular formation. Just as the formation disappeared, three objects detached from its left flank and flew off to the north. The others seemed to tighten their ranks and continued to the northeast. Three to five minutes later they saw three more objects in the same direction, and five minutes after that, five to six objects, still in a triangular formation. Very shortly after, a group of 35 to 40 objects were flying in the same direction in a triangular formation. Twenty minutes later, objects grouped in threes were returning to the city to the southeast. Inspector Frazier of the police arrived with two officers, following Mrs. Busby's call, and they too observed these objects. (J. Allen HYNEK: "New Report on UFOs" - Belfond 1979, p. 39, 40)

Coming from the northwest they were descending slowly. At about 150m altitude, they leveled off, made a wide 110° right turn and resumed an ascending course towards the southwest. They rose with a rapid acceleration and seemed to be moving between 500 and 650 km/h. Seen in a horizontal plane they had an elliptical shape and the size of a B.29. No sound or condensation trail.

Finally it appeared that there was only one object, but it cut the trajectory of the flight and the pigeons returned precipitously to the pigeon loft, refusing to come out for a certain time.

"Reliable people living in La Rosiaz, Lausanne, witnessed a curious phenomenon on Friday evening. At around 6 pm, they saw a large, very bright star slowly crossing the sky from the Villeneuve region to above Evian. At 7 pm, a second star crossed the sky in the same direction, but this time it "attached" itself to the Dent d'Oche, where it stayed for several minutes before disappearing."

Something off the coast of Southern California greatly disturbed the population. The incident occurred on September 20 and was reported by the US Coast Guard as: "A flaming object (that) fell into the sea off the coast; no missing aircraft; Griffith Park Observatory does not believe it was a kind of meteorite". Strange indeed, since it looks very much like a meteorite and, in such cases, this is normally the first line of defense of orthodoxy. However, a more thorough investigation revealed that this darned "thing" was maneuvering, and for quite a while, and consequently it had greatly distressed the Coast Guard. (Yvan T.

#1947, 23 September
USA: Document TWINING.
DATE: 23 September 1947
SUBJECT: AMC Opinion Concerning "Flying Discs"
TO: Commanding General
Army Air Forces
Washington 25, D.C.
ATTENTION: Brig. General George Schulgen, AC/AS-2
1. As requested by AC/AS-2, the considered opinion of this command concerning the so-called "Flying Discs" is presented below. This opinion is based on interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and preliminary studies by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory Engineering Division T-3. This opinion was arrived at in a conference between personnel from the Air Institute of Technology, Intelligence T-2, Office, Chief of Engineering Division, and the Aircraft, Power Plant and Propeller Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3.<br/><br/>
2. It is the opinion that:
a. The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.
b. There are objects probably approximately the shape of a disc, of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft.
c. There is the possibility that some of the incidents may be caused by natural phenomena, such as meteors.
d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely.<br/><br/>
e. The apparent common description of the objects is as follows:
(1) Metallic or light reflecting surface.
(2) Absence of trail, except in a few instances when the object apparently was operating under high performance conditions.
(3) Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top.
(4) Several reports of well kept formation flights varying from three to nine objects.
(5) Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a substantial rumbling roar was noted.
(6) Level flight speeds normally about 300 knots are estimated.<br/><br/>
f. It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge - provided extensive detailed development is undertaken--to construct a piloted aircraft which has the general description of the object in subparagraph (e) above which would be capable of an approximate range of 700 miles at subsonic speeds.
g. Any developments in this country along the lines indicated would be extremely expensive, time consuming and at the considerable expense of current projects and therefore, if directed, should be set up independently of existing projects.
h. Due consideration must be given the following:<br/><br/>
(1) The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin -the product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this command.
(2) The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered exhibits which would undeniably prove the existence of these objects.
(3) The possibility that some foreign nations has a form of propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of our domestic knowledge.<br/><br/>
3. It is recommended that:
Headquarters, Army Air Forces issue a directive assigning a priority, security classification and code name for a detailed study of this matter to include the preparation of complete sets of all available and pertinent data which will then be made available to the Army , Navy, Atomic Energy Commission, JRDB, the Air Force Scientific Advisory Group, NACA, and the RAND and NEPA projects for comments and recommendations, with a preliminary report to be forwarded within 15 days of receipt of the data and a detailed report thereafter every 30 days as the investigation develops. A complete interchange of data should be effected.
4. Awaiting a specific directive AMC will continue the investigation within its current resources in order to more closely define the nature of the phenomenon. Detailed Essential Elements of Information will be formulated immediately for transmittal thru channels.

Then on the 10th. Test pilot Chuck Yeager, on P-51 (XS-1), which he had named "Glamourous Glennis" in honor of his wife, reached a speed of Mach 0.93. (...) On October 10th Yeager reached Mach 0.94. But ice was forming inside the cockpit. Fighter pilots Bob Hoover and Dick Frost on Lockheed P-80 then assisted him "viva voice" to land blind. Analysis of the oscillographic film compared to ground data confirmed that the XS-1 had reached Mach 0.997 at 12000 meters altitude, or a speed of 1059 km. It was also, for everyone, the experience of the first "supersonic bang". (NASA Website, 1997 see "On the Frontier, Ref 1-19)

The Sound Barrier was broken on October 14. Preparations began at dawn. There was a secret kept by Jack Ridley and Walt Williams about the horse fall that test pilot Yeager had the day before: He had two broken ribs and was bandaged roughly by a civilian doctor... So they made a short cut for him to be able to enter the plane. The crew of the B29 who had heard of the fall but ignored the case of the broken ribs, presented him with a carrot and a turnip. The Glamourous Glennis was put into the bomb bay of the B29 and then the tanks were filled with 1177 liters of liquid oxygen and 1109 liters of ethylene fuel (...) At 10:02 the Superfortress took off. Two P-80 fighters accompanied it. At 10:26, at 6000 meters of altitude, the Glamourous Glennis was launched into the sky above the Mojave Desert. (...) Soon it reached Mach 1.05, at 13100 m of altitude (speed 1125 km/h). Fourteen minutes after the launch it touched the ground in the bed of the dry lake. The Sound Barrier had been definitely broken.

Selman Graves (22 years old) and his brother-in-law Bob Malody (16 years old) were hunting rabbits and exploring abandoned mines in what is now known as the Cave Creek Recreational Area. At one point, standing atop the highest hill, they looked south towards their friend Walt Salyer's house. From their vantage point they could make out the house, the corral, and even the water tank. But when they looked west, they saw something unforgettable. It was an aluminum dome erected in the middle of the desert, like an observation dome. There were five men and two trucks near the dome. One of the trucks was a military-style (2.5-ton) personnel and equipment transport. But there was no equipment, no small cranes, nothing. Moreover, the five men didn't seem to be working either. The dome was estimated to be 11 meters in diameter and was located about a mile from their position. (See the newspaper Newsday of Melville, N.Y. for July 6, 1997.

Thomas C. Smith, recently graduated from Penn State University with a degree in mechanical engineering, was working for the Chance-Vought Aircraft Company in Stratford, which was manufacturing airplanes for the US Navy. He had the opportunity to see on the ground and then in flight, a perfectly terrestrial flying saucer. The disc was in a hangar, was elliptical in shape, measured about 12 meters in diameter and was powered by propeller engines. Its takeoff was vertical for the first three meters (like a helicopter) and then it took an ascending trajectory. The bubble-shaped cockpit allowed the pilot to see in front of him and below him. The edges of the craft were thick, about ten centimeters, and the bubble was only 60 centimeters high. Smith saw the pilot enter and lie down on his stomach on the provided bunk. At the back there were two propellers. The metal parts were painted khaki. Smith claims that many such devices were being developed and tested by test pilots and that there were obviously from time to time, accidents. (Source: Lancaster New Era, Pennsylvania, 12.7.1997)

#1947 (Spring or Summer)
CANADA, Langley Prairie (C.B.)
Excerpt from a letter from an anonymous witness: "We were living there, on the side of the road called the Trans Canada Highway, the Cloverdale/Langley road crossed our property. The area is very sparsely populated and consists mostly of flat fields as far as the eye can see. We were on vacation, I was 16 years old. With my brother I was near a pond close to our house. While he was trying to fish for minnows, I was reading, leaning against and in the shade of a tree. It was quiet, it was nice. I had heard a humming sound, but I didn't think anything special about it. Then, I remember, we see in the sky something gray-silver, right in front of us. What happened? For an hour we experienced conscious situations, interspersed with moments of unconsciousness. In the object a door opened, its full height, and four or five grotesque creatures, resembling praying mantises, but dressed in gray-silver tights, without buttons, zippers, nothing, came out. I had gotten up, still holding my book in my hand, and one of these creatures came straight towards me. I was petrified, it put a hand on my shoulder and looked me straight in the eyes, as if to read my thoughts and I had the impression of hearing "clicks" like a camera, produced by its huge black eyes. It was terrifying.
Then there was a blackout.<br/><br/>
... I felt calmer, and I sent my mother, who was screaming, back inside, telling her that he "would kill her if she didn't go back into the house". The creature left me to join its congeners. They walked around the UFO, which seemed to be broken down, because they seemed to be repairing something on the side of the door. Little by little I regained my senses and noticed that several vehicles were circulating on the road. The drivers could not fail to see the scene. But the first creature was coming back towards me, putting its hand on my shoulder again, looking me straight in the eyes again and I understood this telepathic message: "We are leaving now, don't look up, don't look, don't look." I was there, head bowed, but I thought: "I have to look" which I did. The thing was there, above the tree where I was standing, going up vertically into the sky, where there were also four military planes. The saucer was going faster than anything I had ever known before or after, without any noise. The UFO disappeared in the direction of Washington, and I had the impression that the military planes were trying in vain to chase it. In my opinion, there must be a report about it. I called my brother, who was not moving. I had to get into the pond and take his hand, saying "Come, let's go back now". When I got back into the kitchen, my mother was angry "Finally, here you are". We didn't talk, couldn't talk, but we were terribly thirsty. We drank water, a lot of water and went to bed, both of us. We spent several days in bed, drinking only water and sleeping. When I finally recovered, going down to the kitchen, I could see through the window near the pond, a large circle of scorched grass. A few months later my parents moved. We never talked about this event, neither between us, nor with others." (Source: UFO UpDates Mailing List, from: boliver at Direct.CA (Bill Oliver) 4.8.1997)
