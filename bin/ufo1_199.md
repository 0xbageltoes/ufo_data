812 — [Agobard](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agobard&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727236392&usg=AOvVaw2xqRM7UFhseUKHGauWO7bO)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agobard&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727236692&usg=AOvVaw3n2429YsZZAic0JHMxsV8L) the archbishop of Lyon, France, writes De Grandine et Tonitruis (“On Hail and Thunder”), in which he condemns pagan folk beliefs, such as the notion of a “certain region called Magonia, from which ships, navigating on clouds, set sail to transport back to this same region the fruits of the earth ruined by hail and destroyed by the storm.” He cites an episode in which some foolish peasants capture “three men and one woman who they said had fallen from these ships.” Brought out in front of an enraged mob, Agobard intervenes and prevents their lynching, persuading the crowd that the charges are false and absurd. Some ufologists interpret this as a visitation from an alternate reality or an abduction case, while Jean-Louis Brodu observes that in the 9th century the atmosphere was likened to an ocean in which aerial ships could navigate from point to point on the earth. Miceal Ross argues that Magonia is a corruption of Magonianus, relating to the city of Mahón, the port of the island of Menorca, Spain.

December 15 — Mariners in the port of Hamburg, Germany, see a fireball moving to the south. Its rays are so hot that passengers cannot remain inside the ships. Thinking the vessels are about to burn, they hide and take cover.

April 4 — Dusk. A “frightening vision” is seen in the sky above Nuremberg, Germany, said to be observed by many.

Printer [Hans Glaser](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Glaser&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727241014&usg=AOvVaw2oxgDblKDSkRWVh32Q_brH) describes in his broadside many blood-red, blue, and black balls or discs near the Sun. “They were three alongside each other, sometimes four in a square, and several alone, and between these balls blood- colored crosses” are seen. Two “great pipes” (cannon) are also observed, and everything starts to “fight against each other.” The battle lasts about one hour, then the burning balls fall to the earth and vanish on the ground.

Although cited as a possible early UFO report, the narrative is simply about a battle in the sky by phantom armies told as an allegory of what awaits an unrepentant humanity on Judgment Day.

1638 — Night. John Everett and two companions are crossing the Muddy River near Boston, Massachusetts, in a boat when a “great light” appears above them. It darts back and forth across the river, sometimes hovering and “flaming up,” for about 2–3 hours. After they stop watching it, they discover that their boat has moved about one mile against the current to the place where they had embarked.

August 15 — 12:00 noon. The faithful gathered in a church in a village near Lake Zarobozero, Vologda Oblast, Russia, hear a loud noise outside and see a large ball of fire descend from the north and then head south following the lake, low over its surface. The fireball seems to measure about 140 feet across and has blue smoke issuing from its sides. Two fiery rays extend from its front part. Less than an hour later, a similar fireball reappears over the same lake. Moving from south to west, the object again disappears. It reappears a third time a short while later, this time larger than before, and stays over the lake for an hour and a half. Peasants in a boat try to get close to it, but the heat is too intense. The water of the lake is illuminated to a depth of 30 feet, and fish are seen swimming away from the object, which then flies off to the west.

April 8 — 6:00 p.m. Numerous wonders are seen in the sky over Stralsund, Germany, including ships, large flocks of birds, fire, and smoke, as well as a dark “round flat form like a plate and like a big man’s hat” that hovers above St. Nicholas Church for one hour. Witnesses include several fishermen who later complain of tremors in their hands and feet.

The cause seems to be one or more clouds in which are embedded brilliant lights as bright as the full moon that give off slow-moving streamers or rays. The

The dogs are blinded by it when they attempt to hunt. At 9:00 a.m. more cobwebs fall from the sky and continue until dusk. They are “perfect flakes or rags; some near an inch broad, and five or six long, which fell with a degree of velocity that showed they were considerably heavier than the atmosphere.” The fall extends to the neighboring villages of New Alresford and Bradley.

When it reaches 20° against the sky, it takes a horizontal path with an undulating motion before disappearing in the northeast after a full 30 seconds. The front part is luminous with a frame-like structure behind it, and it has a faint trail. The date is questionable since Mortimer calls this a “Thursday” and December 16 was a Sunday.

April 27 — 4:00 p.m. Following a clap of thunder, a flat, pale object is seen “dancing” in the sky over Longdon, Somerset, England. It is joined by three similar objects, all of which move from west to east for 30 seconds and disappear in a cloud.

August 9 — 12:00 noon. An amateur astronomer named de Rostan is observing the Sun at Lausanne, Switzerland, when he notices a large, spindle-shaped body moving across the solar disc from east to west at a slower rate of speed than sunspots move. It is surrounded by a thin “nebulosity.” An observer named Croste in Solothurn, Switzerland, also observes the object, but French astronomer [Charles Messier](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727260758&usg=AOvVaw1RR9mMPZ5mIoKYVJoyWnwS), who is also taking solar measurements in Paris, France, does not see it.

By 1778, he is seeing circular formations that he thinks are towns and villages. He also notes canals, roads, and patches of vegetation, but never writes about it publicly, since he knows that telescopic observations can be tricky.

1790

June 12 — 5:00 a.m. Several farmers in Alençon, Normandy, France, see a large globe surrounded by flames and making a whistling sound. The object slows, oscillates, and moves toward the top of a hill, unearthing some plants along the slope. The heat is so intense that grass and small trees start burning. In the evening the sphere is still warm.

Witnesses include two mayors, a doctor, and three other authorities in addition to the dozens of peasants who are present. A kind of door opens and a person emerges. He is dressed in a tight-fitting suit and, seeing all the people, says some words that are not understood. He runs into the woods. The sphere explodes silently, throwing pieces everywhere, and these pieces burn until they are powder. The original source is allegedly from a June 17 report by a Police Inspector Liabeuf and forwarded to the French Academy of Sciences. However, the Academy reported in 2006 that it has no knowledge of such a report in its archives. Probable hoax.

February 22 (or March 24) — An attractive young woman aged 18–20 years old arrives on a beach aboard a “hollow ship” (Utsuro-bune) that looks like a rice cooking pot or incense burner in Hitachi province, Japan. Fishermen bring her inland to investigate further, but the woman is unable to communicate in Japanese. She is dressed in a foreign fashion made of unknown fabrics and is clutching an ornate box also marked with the unknown script. The vessel is covered in hieroglyphs that no one can decipher.

This region contains a series of somewhat linear ridges that have a fishbone-like pattern, and, with the small refracting telescope he is using, can be perceived as resembling buildings complete with streets. His claims are readily refuted using more powerful instruments. Gruithuisen also thinks that the mysterious “ashen light” observed on Venus’s dark side is due to a festival of fire in honor of the “ascension of a new emperor to the throne of the planet.” Later, he speculates that the illumination is caused by burning jungles to create new farmland.

April 1 — 4:00 p.m. Stone mason Johannes Becker hears a noise resembling thunder at Rastpfuhl, northwest of Saarbrücken, Germany, and sees a grayish object “like two pieces of tin” approaching the earth with lightning speed and expanding itself like a sheet before falling to earth, apparently not far away. After one minute there is another sound like thunder and a strong whirlwind, as if coming from an impact. Pastor Köllner collects testimony from other nearby witnesses and visits the supposed landing site but finds no burn marks or meteoritic stones.

August 20 — 11:00 p.m. A man on the York Road east of Leeds, England, sees a moon-like object split into two halves, the upper half of which gives off an apparent shaft of light. He sees two human figures visible to the waist, one of which has a red cloth around its head. The object is visible for more than one hour and is seen by others, during which time a cloud passes in front of it.

May 11 — At the Palermo Observatory in Italy, astronomer [Niccolò Cacciatore](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%25C3%25B2_Cacciatore&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727283852&usg=AOvVaw3gI4m73jiSVCqIm9Q6cyiE) detects a starlike object in the Southern sky between the constellations Virgo and Crater moving at a slow rate that might indicate a planet beyond Uranus. It is nowhere to be seen during his next observation on May 14. (“Supposed New Planet,” American Journal of Science 31 (1837): 158–159)

August 25–31 — The New York Sun publishes a series of six articles on the alleged discovery by English astronomer [John](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herschel&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727285075&usg=AOvVaw30kloYH2jRKtmo55wQrTrN) [Herschel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herschel&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727285441&usg=AOvVaw1tXKFg3JBJutcq2WU51Voi) of plants, animals, and winged people on the lunar surface. Using a huge and powerful telescope, Herschel supposedly sees herds of bison-like quadrupeds, a spherical amphibious creature, and a bipedal beaver that lives in huts. The humans are man-bats “covered, except on the face, with short and glossy copper-colored hair, and had wings composed of a thin membrane, without hair, lying snugly upon their backs.” The article is an elaborate hoax. Herschel hasn’t observed life on the moon at all, nor is Herschel even aware of the story until much later. The announcement causes enormous excitement throughout America and Europe. Authorship of the article is usually attributed to Richard Adams Locke, a reporter who is working for The Sun at the time. Locke publicly admits to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper New World, although his intent is satire, not misinformation.

Then the wind suddenly stops, and the crew feels an overpowering heat and smells a sulfuric stench. At this moment three “luminous bodies” emerge from the sea about one-half mile away and remain visible for 10 minutes. Shortly thereafter the wind picks up again. (This could be a magma plume from an undersea volcanic vent.)

March 19 — 8:30 p.m. A woman and her companion are in Highbury East, London, England, when they notice what seems to be a fire balloon ascending slowly in the west, seemingly over Hampstead. It shoots out “several fiery coruscations” and turns into an intensely radiant cloud, which moves on further west. Its light shines down on the houses below. Suddenly another bright cloud appears above the first. After 2–3 minutes, a fiery ball drops from the upper cloud to the lower one, followed by two others. Soon after this, both clouds disappear.

June 19 or 20 — Sunset. A large cloud moves in over Carbondale, Pennsylvania, from the northwest, accompanied by considerable wind. It emits a dark-looking substance that falls to the ground, where it becomes highly luminous. It moves toward a large barn and passes through its center, setting it on fire, and continues on in a straight course for the woods, burning up the underbrush.

Then in 2000, Texas State University–San Marcos physicist Donald W.

An examination of contemporary newspapers revealed that this was probably Whitman’s meteor procession. Around 9:40 p.m., two meteors with trails, one behind another, are seen in New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Norfolk, and other locations in the East, proceeding slowly from northwest to southeast for nearly one minute.

The train depot operator and a few friends are walking at Galisteo, New Mexico, when they hear loud voices and laughter coming from a “large balloon” shaped like a fish approaching from the west. A flower is dropped from the car of the balloon to which is attached a slip of silk-like paper on which Chinese characters are written. The next morning, searchers find a cup of peculiar workmanship, but both artifacts are purchased by a “wealthy young Chinaman” and a “collector of curiosities” who visits town on March 28, although this part of the tale seems facetious and racist.

have split into several pieces; these objects were estimated to have had a size of between 150 and 3,350 feet, and to have passed only 334 to 5,000 miles from the Earth; they thought a fragmented Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks was one possibility, in which case Earth barely avoided multiple Tunguska events or even a mass extinction; this was reported in the media and disputed in October 2011; but the source of these objects could also have been comet C/1883 D1 (Brooks-Swift) or even a third, unknown comet that year; the event also coincided with the

annual Perseid meteor shower; even migrating birds cannot be ruled out.

October 24 — Night. Nine persons who are sleeping in a hut some 10 miles from Maracaibo, Venezuela, are awakened by a loud humming noise and a dazzling light that illuminates the interior. The people begin to pray but they start vomiting as extensive swellings appear on the upper part of their bodies, especially around the face and lips. They feel no heat, although the light has a smoky appearance and a peculiar smell. The next morning, the swellings subside but leave black blotches. By November 2, the skin peels off and the blotches are round sores. Portions of their hair falls off. Trees around the hut show no damage until November 2, when they suddenly wither. The symptoms are similar to those of ionizing radiation syndrome.

March 19 — 5:00 p.m. Captain Cornelis Dirks Swart of the Dutch bark J.P.A. sees a “meteor in the shape of two balls” during a storm in the North Atlantic about 590 miles northeast of Bermuda. One ball is black and the other is luminous and oblong. The luminous object descends with a roar and lights up the ship and surrounding water. The crew feels heat from the object even as solid lumps of ice fall on the deck and the rigging becomes iced. The side of the ship where it falls turns partially black and the copper plating is blistered. The wind increases to “hurricane force.” (“[Rare Electrical Phenomenon at Sea,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id%3Dhvd.hxgnys%26view%3D1up%26seq%3D120%26skin%3D2021&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727347296&usg=AOvVaw2QN6QBj0Z5c1MBKnve0Lxz)” American Meteorological Journal 4 (July 1887): 98–99; Chris Aubeck and Martin Shough, Return to Magonia: Investigating UFOs in History, 2015, pp. 205–217; Martin Shough and Wim van Utrecht, Redemption of the Damned, vol. 2, Anomalist, 2021, pp. 201–210)

Early September — 3:15 p.m. During a severe thunderstorm, after a flash of lightning and a peal of thunder, witnesses see a huge flame at Highland Lake, near Winsted, Connecticut. The water is parted for yards by a huge ball of fire at least 10 feet in diameter, and billows rise on either side to a height of 20 feet. The light moves toward the head of the lake with great velocity. When it is within 100 yards of the shore, another flash of lightning strikes, and the fireball disappears. The waters of the lake remain disturbed for hours.

June 13 — Day. An unnamed witness claims to see a “meteor” explode with a loud noise over the Wasson & Miller flour mill and cotton gin in Dublin, Texas. The object looks like “a bale of cotton suspended in the air after having been saturated in kerosene oil and ignited, except that it created a much brighter light” that dazzles people standing several hundred feet away. The object shatters into pieces before it hits the ground, the fragments setting the grass and weeds on fire. In addition to the fragments is a scrap of paper with writing in a strange language.

They are visible until roughly 12:00 midnight, sometimes appearing as a mass, other times strung out more in an irregular line. The ship’s crew observes them again the next night as they are sailing east from Port Hamilton \[now the Korean islands of Geomundo\]. This time they are visible until dawn.

Thousands of small discs, seemingly about the size of a wagon wheel, appear in the sky, all of them in motion. They appear round in shape from far away, but when closer to the ground they change to triangles, squares, or odd forms.

The visible seasonal melting of Martian polar icecaps fuels speculation that an advanced alien race indigenous to Mars has built the canals to transport the water to drier equatorial regions.

Lowell publishes his views in three books: Mars (1895), Mars and Its Canals (1906), and Mars As the Abode of Life (1908). He remains a strong proponent for the rest of his life of the idea that the canals were built for irrigation by an intelligent civilization.

She keeps records of her planchette experiments and puts them at Hyslop’s disposal. In August, she makes several references to the planet Mars and Jupiter. She provides a crude map of Jupiter’s surface, and the planet is said to be the “babies’ heaven.” At the next sitting, she draws a map of Mars, the different zones named in the Martian language; she gives several communications about the inhabitants and the canals. Martian revelations cease for another 5 years until September 1900, when the communications return in a developed state. She draws men, boats, houses, and flowers, named in Martian and written in hieroglyphic characters. Some of the sketches (a self-winding double clock) are very ingenious, while others (a Martian airship) are peculiar but unconvincing.

He claims the airship is a 150-foot metal contraption with two canvas wings 18 feet wide and shaped like a bird’s tail. It has been built in Oroville and is now hidden in the San Francisco, California, area as the inventor deals with technical problems. However, people in Oroville sense a hoax, as they know of no such inventor. On November 24, Collins complains to the San Francisco Call that another newspaper, the San Francisco Examiner, has been printing falsehoods about him, including an interview with another attorney, Frederick Bradley. Suspicion falls on an itinerant dentist from Maine, Elmer H. Benjamin, who insists his only inventions are dental fittings. A prominent citizen of Oakland, [George H.

But Hart is also blabbing prolifically, saying that two or three airships exist (a second built in an eastern state) and his role is to “consolidate both interests.” Hart asserts that the airship can carry four men and 1,000 pounds of dynamite for dropping on Havana, Cuba.

February–July — The mystery airship wave continues, from Nebraska and Colorado to Texas and Ohio. Hoaxes and pranks pollute the information pool in a major way during this era and the planet Venus and other celestial objects undoubtedly play a major role, but many airship reports emanate from manifestly sober, puzzled citizens, and they continue long after the initial excitement subsides. To all appearances, they are objects of some kind, but since newspapers rarely question witnesses critically about details at this time, little can be deduced from the mass of reports. (Loren E.

see a dark object with light coming through its windows. It appears to be a “long, narrow car, resembling a corset box in shape,” some 30–35 feet long and 6–7 feet high. Above the car floats a cigar-shaped bag about the same length and 8–10 feet thick. When his horses see the object, they bolt and tumble his wagon into the ditch. By the time Butler recovers, the object is moving briskly in a descent to the south. He watches it as it moves out of sight.

Early April — An airship allegedly lands near Elburn, Illinois, where some farmers run across it. It is made of “some light substance like aluminum.” Two aeronauts are repairing the vehicle and will only say that they are flying from the Pacific to the Atlantic by following the Chicago and North Western Railway.

Jones are riding one mile west of Lake Elmo, Minnesota, when they notice a figure in a clearing, walking around as if he is looking for something. They turn off the road to investigate and hear a cracking sound followed by a rushing noise. A moment later they notice a gray-white object that looks like the top of a covered wagon. It has two rows of four red or green lights. The object rises quickly at a sharp angle to clear the treetops. They can make out no machinery or wings or rudders or even an outline of the object. In the mud, Chamberlain finds 14 footprints, each 2 feet long, 6 inches wide, “arranged seven on each side, and in an oblong pattern.” Adam Thielen, a nearby farmer, independently sees a dark object with red and green lights flying overhead about the same time.

When they are at the middle fork of Wildcat Creek, they hear a “swishing, roaring sound” and see an object with a blinding white searchlight and smaller green and yellow lights. The object is cigar-shaped with wings or fins. It descends to just above the treetops, hovers there for a moment, then rises and noisily shoots off to the southwest.

April 14 — 4:30 a.m. Farmers see an airship land about 3 miles northwest of Howard City, Michigan, and some go to investigate. Inside the craft is a “strange man” dressed in heavy furs although he seems “to have no use for them, as he was almost naked and seemed to be suffering from the heat.” The man is 9.5 feet tall and speaks in a musical language that, however, sounds like bellowing. One farmer gets too close, and the giant kicks him severely enough to break his hip. (“Trip of the Airship,” Saginaw (Mich.) Courier-Herald, April 17, 1897, p. 5)

Byrnes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113775966/patrick-christopher-byrnes&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727417928&usg=AOvVaw2kcwFOcdviDMbjRFJEygL_) is operating a railroad handcar about 7 miles west of Cisco, Texas, when he sees a light a little distance from the track on the south side. Knowing there is no farmhouse in the area, he goes to investigate. It is a landed cigar-shaped airship about 200 feet long and 50 feet across at its widest point. Several men are repairing its searchlight, and they tell him that the craft is loaded with several tons of dynamite for bombing Spanish troops and ships in Cuba.

April 15 — Night. An airship with red, green, and white lights lands on a farm near Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Five witnesses see an odd-looking man in a fur coat emerge and walk to a farmhouse belonging to [Melvin Bannister](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68901211/melvin-bannister&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727418563&usg=AOvVaw2vaPF4SLv_YGJ5l6XtapuL), whose dogs are barking fiercely. The stranger points a lantern-like device at them and sends them running. Bannister answers the door and converses awkwardly with the man, who is speaking an odd language, but loans him a hammer, some nails, and a can of skim milk. The man returns the tools, along with a strange coin. The airship takes off with a whizzing sound.

Thinking it might be a meteor heading toward the Earth, more people gather outside to watch. City Marshal Brown is in the western part of town making his rounds, and the “ship or balloon” passes overhead about 200 feet in the air.

Mid-April — 3:00 p.m. Railroad conductor Capt. Jim Hooton is hunting near Homan, Arkansas, when he hears a loud mechanical sound like an air brake. Investigating, he discovers an airship undergoing repairs. The aeronauts are not very communicative, so once the repairs are complete, they reenter the airship and take off with a loud hissing sound.

Mid-April – Night. F. Crocker is sitting near the window of his apartment on Barr Street in Fort Wayne, Indiana, when he notices a yellowish light coming from the west. It seems attached to a pear-shaped object with the apex pointed downward. Two yellow rays of light come from its sides as it sways to and fro in the air. He calls R. J. (or R. T.) and J. L. Tretheway, who live in the apartment below his, and they also glimpse the object, which is in sight for 20 minutes. (“Sighted Here,” Fort Wayne (Ind.) Weekly Gazette, April 15, 1897, p. 1)

But when the pursuers get within 2,100 feet of the airship, it spreads out four massive wings and ascends again. The two occupants have extremely long beards and make desperate efforts to conceal themselves. They toss two enormous boulders “of unknown composition” out of the airship.

Next to it is a nude female with hair down to her waist. As she picks flowers, she speaks in an unknown language with a musical voice and fans herself as if the day is hot. In the shade cast by the craft lies a naked man with shoulder-length hair and a long beard. After a few minutes, Hopkins approaches the woman, who shrieks and runs toward the man. Hopkins speaks soothingly and the two aeronauts relax. Hopkins asks where they come from, and they point upward, pronouncing a word that sounds like “Mars.” The two examine Hopkins’s clothing, hair, and watch with great curiosity. They show him the interior of the ship but take off shortly afterward, “laughing and waving their hands.” (“[Golden Haired Girl Is in It,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/27731160/st-louis-post-dispatch/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727426814&usg=AOvVaw1mZVcrTs9yv4glaJZXdw6Z)” St. Louis (Mo.)

A brilliant light as if from an arc lamp shines on him for less than a minute and then moves over to a nearby field. The light suddenly ascends to an altitude of 1,000 feet. As he watches, the searchlight blinks out and smaller lights surrounding a dark object become visible. The object moves slowly to the south and disappears. (“Seen near Hillsboro,” Dallas (Tex.)

April 16 — 12:00 midnight. C. G. Williams is walking across a field two miles south of Greenville, Texas, when he comes across a brilliant light and a large, cigar-shaped object resting on the ground. Three aeronauts emerge from it; two go to work on the ship, and the third approaches Williams and asks him to mail some letters. The man tells him that the airship runs on electricity and that his invention was perfected in a small town in New York State. (“C. G. Williams Saw It,” Dallas (Tex.)

Wreckage from the crash site is either dumped into a nearby well located under the damaged windmill or ends up with the alien in the grave. Adding to the mystery is the story of [Brawley Oates,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43968438/brawley-hoyle-oates&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727431199&usg=AOvVaw0P8ma_mfvDxYA9xRTuVQiJ) who purchases Judge Proctor’s property around 1935. Oates cleans out the debris from the well in order to use it as a water source, but later develops an extremely severe case of rheumatoid arthritis, which he claims is the result of contaminated water from the wreckage dumped into the well. As a result, Oates seals up the well with a concrete slab and places an outbuilding on the spot in 1945. The entire yarn is widely regarded as a hoax, although Proctor’s windmill apparently did exist.

They are the owner Mr. Wilson (formerly of Fort Worth, Texas) and his friend Scott Warren. The man is taken into the airship and introduced to two others, a Mr. Waters and a Hispanic man. Wilson tells him the airship is sustained by a gas, and that several of them have been built. (“Was Aboard an Airship,” Dallas (Tex.) Morning News, May 16, 1897, p. 18)

He sees an object with two brilliant white lights on either end landing in a nearby field. He tethers his horse and approaches the object, which seems as large as a house.

The craft is called the Aeribarque, and they are on a test flight. The aeronaut says that they often land in remote areas and come to nearby towns for supplies or mechanical parts, posing either as tourists or “harmless cranks trying to invent perpetual motion.” After giving the witness a demonstration of the electrical lighting system, they take off into the sky.

He goes outside and sees an oblong airship with wings and brilliant lights. When he first sees it, the object is hovering 150 feet above the ground. It circles a few times then lands in a nearby pasture. Barclay goes down to investigate with his Winchester rifle, but the lights go out as he gets closer. Some 90 feet away from the airship he is stopped by a man who asks him to put his rifle down. He identifies himself as “Smith” and gives Barclay $10 to purchase lubricating oil, two chisels, and bluestone. When Barclay returns with the materials, the aeronaut will only say he is from “anywhere,” adding that “we will be in Greece tomorrow.” (“[Supplies for Airship,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/26495409/the-houston-post/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727444570&usg=AOvVaw2tq7WF5pyY46BPd1bSmWod)” Houston (Tex.)

As some residents of Merkel, Texas, are leaving a church service, they notice a heavy, anchor- shaped object being dragged by a large rope that is attached to an airship in the sky not far above them.

October 4 — 9:00 p.m. A brilliant object passes over Italy, Greenville, Garland, and Blossom, Texas. Initially moving in an easterly direction, it seems to change course and shoot upwards then burst, throwing out three distinct objects, one red, the other white, and the last one blue. The red and blue lights die out, but the white one continue a few seconds before it too bursts, emitting a shower of sparks. Blossom merchant Dick Moore says the light is so glaring that he thinks his “house was falling on him.” About 2.5 miles north of Sherman, 12-year-old George Campbell is riding with his father when they see the fireball descending, apparently coming as close as 3 feet above the ground before moving upward; they can hear a buzzing noise and think the object is about 10 feet in diameter.

A few minutes later, distracted by the meteor, she is standing in her kitchen when a “female ghost” appears and chats with her for a few minutes, saying that if she would follow her, she will lead her to a fortune. Peveto becomes terrified, and the entity flees through a closed door. The entity visits her again on other nights, again talking about treasure in the basement. They continue until February 1899 when they occur nightly. At one point the ghost claims to have been murdered years ago in Fort Washita and shows her strangle marks around her neck. Poltergeist phenomena (tables moving) occur and a male ghost also talks to her. Peveto becomes ill and apparently moves away from the place. (“Ghosts at Old Fort Washita,” Dallas (Tex.)

He mentions them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900.

Reporters treat it as a sensational story and jump to the conclusion Tesla is hearing signals from Mars. In 1901, Tesla writes that it has not been immediately apparent to him that he is hearing “intelligently controlled signals” and that the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It is possible that he is intercepting [Guglielmo Marconi](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727462800&usg=AOvVaw2vGI77SxI0HgoUf8S8xB3Y)’s European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot dot dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.

The townsfolk chase the creature toa local mine shaft, down which it disappears, never to be seen again.

June — 10:00 p.m. When Tony Darby goes outside to the well on his farm 5 miles north of Rolling Prairie, Indiana, he notices two round, orange-colored, silent objects hovering 5–6 feet from the ground near the barn. He estimates they are the size of wagon wheels. One of the objects is 2 feet behind and to the left of the other. Running back to the house, he calls for his mother and brother, and all three walk toward the objects, which move away slightly then stop when the witnesses stop. Soon the objects move steadily away to the northeast, still maintaining their relative positions, at about the speed of a man walking. They pause briefly in a small hollow, then continue over a small hill and out of sight.

It is a narrative channeled by Oliver in Yreka, California, through automatic writing and mental dictations by a spirit calling itself Phylos the Tibetan, an Atlantean who reveals his story from 1883 to 1886. The book deals with deep esoteric subjects including karma and reincarnation and describes Phylos’s final incarnation in 19th century America where his Atlantean karma plays itself out. In that incarnation (as Walter Pierson, gold miner and occult student of the Theo-Christic Adepts) he travels to Venus in an astral body while his physical form remains at a temple inside Mount Shasta, California.

August 3 — 1:30 a.m. Farmer John A. Jackson is driving a herd of hogs from Silsbee (a former settlement 6 miles southwest of El Centro) to Imperial, California, when a bright light flashes on him from above. He is momentarily blinded, and the hogs start running away. Jackson sees it is a searchlight from an airship about 100 feet long and propelled by wings that move up and down. It has smaller lights along the sides. Jackson wakes up W. E. Wilsie, who lives nearby, and they watch it disappear to the northeast. Another farmer, A. J. Morey, also glimpses the airship.

As he approaches it, a door rolls back and he is welcomed inside by two human-like occupants who are sitting inside on camp stools. They converse with him fluently, but he does not know where they come from. He sees a lever that apparently can cut off the earth’s “magnetism,” allowing the object to rise. The occupants take water from the farm’s horse trough to be “used in making electricity.” (“[DeMott Rock Study Crosses Continents,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/92060822/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727493373&usg=AOvVaw3ZkhXQ271IHBtKoCDNIJ5X)” Albany (Oreg.)

January 4 — Night. Martin Meyerson is on the beach at Paia, Maui, Hawaii, when he sees a green object with the shape and diameter of the full moon appear from behind the southern slopes of the Wailuku Mountains. It is so bright it illuminates the cane fields below, then travels like a “slow-pitched baseball” and disappears behind Mount Haleakala to the southeast. (Clark III 1168)

September 16 — Late afternoon. Hundreds of people in Indianapolis, Indiana, see a “cigar-shaped object” like an airship pass over the city.

The explosion has either knocked down or stunned a horse in College Street. A strong downpour of rain ensues shortly afterward.

May — Late evening. Helen C. Peterson sees a string of lighted beads in the sky over Great River, Long Island, New York. The first light stops and as the others reach it, they seem to bump into it. It grows a little bigger, appearing like a large star. Suddenly it begins to spin like a pinwheel, but without sparks. The motion stops and what looks like a very bright star takes off at great speed toward the southeast. (Clark III 1168–1169)

June 30 — 7:14 a.m. A large explosion takes place near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Yeniseysk Governorate \[now Krasnoyarsk Krai\], Russia. Evenki natives and Russian settlers in the hills northwest of Lake Baikal observe a column of bluish light, nearly as bright as the sun, moving across the sky. About 10 minutes later, there is a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion report that the source of the sound moves from the east to the north of them. The sounds are accompanied by a shock wave that knocks people off their feet and breaks windows hundreds of kilometers away. The explosion over the sparsely populated eastern Siberian taiga flattens 770 square miles of forest and possibly causes up to three human casualties. The event is generally attributed to the air burst of a meteoroid. It is classified as an impact event, even though no impact crater has been found. The object disintegrates at an altitude of 3–6 miles rather than hitting the surface of the Earth. The

Summer — Repeated sightings of unidentified airships, sometimes flying against the wind, take place in Denmark.

July 25 — About 6:00 p.m. A “large airship sailing very high” is seen passing from north to south over the Forestville neighborhood of Bristol, Connecticut. It seems to be an elongated gas bag under which a framework with a propeller is suspended. After “maneuvering” a while, it stops and circles over Lake Compounce then changes course toward the southwest. An East Bristol man named Wilson later claims it was a pig-shaped balloon he had sent up for his daughter’s birthday party, but “balloon” sightings continue in Massachusetts through December.

October — Skipper J. H. Stockman of the smack Superb is fishing in the North Sea 35 miles out of Lowestoft, Suffolk, England, when he sees a large “star” rise out of the water and approach his ship. He signals it with a red flare, and to his surprise he is immediately answered with a red flare above him. He then shows a white flare and receives a blue flare in response. The object appears sausage-shaped and carries a single light. It disappears in the direction of the Netherlands.

May 18 — 11:00 p.m. Charles Lethbridge (part-time dock worker and Punch-and-Judy showman) is traveling on a “spring cart” from Senghenydd on his way home to Cardiff, South Wales. At the summit of Caerphilly Mountain he sees a long, tube-shaped object sitting on the grass by the roadside, with two men busily working on something. They are wearing heavy fur coats and fur caps that fit tightly over the heads. Lethbridge proceeds to about 60 feet of them when they notice him and start jumping up and jabbering in a foreign language. They quickly pick up something from the ground, then jump into a little carriage suspended from the object (with wheels at the bottom), which rises into the air in a zig-zag fashion. When it clears the telegraph wires, two electric lights shine out and the craft heads toward the southeast. Lethbridge returns to the site with a newspaper reporter and they find signs of trampling in the grass for about 45 feet. They also pick up a small red French military label, letterhead from a London stockbroker, many newspaper clippings with references to airships or the German army, and a tin box with paste for polishing metal.

August 3 — Night. A man is riding in Waipawa, New Zealand, when his horse becomes nervous. He sees a large, gray, torpedo-shaped object passing overhead. Three persons are visible in it, one of whom shouts to him in an unknown language. The object rises to a great height, showing lights fore and aft. After circling around, it disappears behind a hill.

Summer — Morning. Lawrence J. Crone is playing on a baseball field in the Violetville neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, when he sees a metallic, brown, blimplike object, more than 100 feet long, hovering above a pine tree 200 feet away. It has a row of colored, rectangular windows. Through one he can see as many as 20 strange entities taking turns looking at him. Their heads are pointed, and they are dressed in light-colored garments with a fur-like texture. Each has small dots for eyes and a slit for a mouth. Two other young men also see the object and are badly frightened.

He dismounts and walks the horse into a clearing, where he sees a row of lights a few feet above the ground. They are attached to a huge, hovering disc. After watching it a while, he steps toward it, and it makes a buzzing sound as if in warning. As he advances, it rises slowly into the sky until it reaches an altitude of several hundred feet, when it suddenly streaks off to the north. (Clark III 1169)

February 9 — 9:00 p.m. An earth-grazing meteor procession is seen from locations across Canada, the northeastern United States, and Bermuda, and from many ships at sea, including eight off Brazil, giving a total recorded ground track of over 7,000 miles. The meteors are particularly unusual in that there is no apparent radiant—no point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate. Witnesses are surprised to see a procession of between 40 and 60 bright, slow-moving fireballs moving from horizon to horizon in a practically identical path. Individual fireballs are visible for at least 30 to 40 seconds, and the entire procession takes some 5 minutes to cross the sky. Subsequent observers also note a large, white, tailless body bringing up the rear, but the various bodies making up the procession continue to disintegrate and travel at different rates throughout their course, so that by the time observations are made in Bermuda, the leading bodies are described as “like large arc lights in appearance, slightly violet in colour,” followed closely by yellow and red fragments. Research carried out in the 1950s by [Alexander D. Mebane](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rr0.org/people/m/MebaneAlexander/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727567643&usg=AOvVaw1wLj0r5lN-cJGCv4687fhu) uncovers a handful of reports from newspaper archives in the northern United States. At Escanaba, Michigan, the Press states the “end of the world was apprehended by many” as numerous meteors travel across the northern horizon. In Batavia, New York, a few observers see the meteors and many people hear a thundering noise, while other reports are made in Nunda and Dansville, New York (where several residents again think the world is ending) and Osceola, Pennsylvania. The observations are analyzed in detail later in 1913 by the astronomer [Clarence Chant,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Chant&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727568224&usg=AOvVaw3EF_UN-I3hAMkBth5jb1dE) leading him to conclude that as all accounts are positioned along a great circle arc, the source is a small, short-lived natural satellite of the Earth. One curious feature of the reports, highlighted by Mebane, is that several appear to indicate a second meteor procession on the same course around 5 hours later, although the Earth’s rotation means that there is no obvious mechanism to explain this. One observer,

A. W. Brown from Thamesville, Ontario, reports seeing both the initial meteor procession and a second one on the same course at 2:20 a.m. the next day. Chant’s original report also refers to a series of three groups of “dark objects” that pass on the same course as the previous meteors from west to east over Toronto on the afternoon of February 10, which he suggests are “something of a meteoric nature.” (Wikipedia, “[1913 Great Meteor](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1913_Great_Meteor_Procession&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727568879&usg=AOvVaw1AKSWZErXZcPQXCkojY7n9) [Procession](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1913_Great_Meteor_Procession&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727569224&usg=AOvVaw1cOswFglYSGU6Xp6JSCB0Y)”; Clarence A.

October — Swiss astronomer Fritjof Le Coultre at the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland reports seeing “bluish-white flashes” on Mars for 17 consecutive nights. Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, also observes them.

However, astronomer [Guillaume Bigourdan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Bigourdan&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727580248&usg=AOvVaw1SPZuwBYUQIi0fCaLe2avZ) at the Paris Observatory thinks the flashes are merely “auto- suggestion.” (“[Is Mars Trying to Signal Us?](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/92119005/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727580649&usg=AOvVaw32JjO1KzG6xSBNlDsi8uIV)” Santa Cruz (Calif.)

1914 — 3:00 p.m. Hans M. Schnitzler, 7, is sitting in his front yard in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, when he hears a musical humming sound and sees a 30-foot domed object about 25 feet away hovering about 10 feet above the ground across the street in front of a church. An opening appears and eight small entities emerge and begin singing a melody over and over again. Then they return inside. The object rises slowly and disappears behind the church. He remembers the melody and plays it on his harmonica years later.

Summer — Mid-afternoon. For about 60 minutes at Mount Lyndhurst Station, South Australia, an unusual substance floats by at a constant altitude. Some pieces, 6–8 inches long, fall to earth and leave no trace. (Keith Basterfield, “Angel Hair: An Australian Perspective,” IUR 27, no. 1 (Spring 2002): 6)

June — 4:00 a.m. Gustav Herwagen sees a cigar-shaped object with luminous portholes in a field next to his house in Hamburg, Germany. Near it are 4–5 dwarfs about 4 feet tall.

August — William J. Kiehl, 18, is with seven others in a small cove along the shore of Georgian Bay, Ontario. They see a strange machine on the surface of the lake. Two little men wearing square masks and purple-green coveralls are working with a hose leading from the water to inside the UFO. Three other figures, dressed in khaki, are adjusting some rods that are pulsating with various colors. The beings notice the group watching them and run into the machine, which starts vibrating with colors. It starts to ascend, but one being has not made it inside and is hanging on. After hovering 12 feet in the air to balance itself, it rapidly accelerates upward. A likely hoax.

August 11–September 9 — Many British residents in South Africa observe a mystery monoplane that is assumed to be on a German reconnaissance mission. Most of the sightings are at night and at a distance. The government issues a statement on August 29 that there are no Union airplanes in South Africa, so any mystery aircraft are assumed to be enemies and should be fired upon.

It is accompanied by a loud noise. One man says the heat of the object has scorched his hands. The plant motor stops as the object passes over, and insulation from some electrical wires is found burned off.

A few seconds later, another appears going in the same direction. More follow, and the display continues until at least 3:00 p.m. when the sky becomes overcast. He watches several hundred bodies pass; about half are perfectly round and the rest are dumbbell shaped. All the objects are well defined and intrinsically brighter than Venus.

February 14 — 9:15 p.m. The mayor and three city constables of Brockville, Ontario, see the lights of unknown aircraft crossing the St. Lawrence River heading for Ottawa. They can hear the sound of motors. A second flying machine is heard as it crosses the river from the direction of Morristown, New York. Three balls of fire drop from it into the river. Two more objects pass from the east and west ends of Brockville. The mayor, who has seen one of the planes flash a searchlight beam that lights up a city block, tells the police chief to alert the mayor and police chief in Ottawa.

February 29 — 4:30 a.m. John Tullyson, head watchman at Globe Elevators, and John Gustavson at the Carnegie Coal Dock in Superior, Wisconsin, hear an engine noise and see a large flying object “50 feet wide and 100 feet long,” with three lights, “one on each end and one in the middle.” Moving swiftly at 600 feet altitude, the object carries a long rope trailing behind it with a large object attached to it. Three “men” are inside the craft, one of them sitting in the front of the machine. The other two seem to be looking around. Possible Chinese lantern or airplane.

March 12 — Early evening. Claude D. McGee is walking home from a trip to a ranch outside Lowry, South Dakota, when he sees a strange glowing light in the hills ahead of him. Suddenly the light swings in a huge arc down into the valley but stays close to the wall of hills where it comes to rest. It stays there a few moments then swings back to where it had been about 2 miles away. It repeats the action twice then disappears. (Clark III 1171)

wears a white mantle edged with gold and holds a rosary in her hand. She asks them to devote themselves to the Holy Trinity and to pray “the Rosary every day.” The children had seen an “angel” at the cove since the spring of 1916.

August 13 — Some 18,000 people have been flocking to Fátima and nearby Aljustrel, Portugal, drawn by reports of visions and miracles. The assembled multitude hears thunder and witnesses lightning in a clear blue sky. Then the sun grows pale and a cloud hovers above the oak tree where the apparitions usually appear. Provincial administrator [Artur de Oliveira Santos](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artur_de_Oliveira_Santos&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727607132&usg=AOvVaw3JAzdZqXaLO6rsXFfwfl-m), believing that these events are politically disruptive, takes the children into custody, jailing them before they can reach the Cova da Iria. Santos interrogates and threatens the children to get them to divulge the contents of the secrets. ()

August 19 — Instead of the promised apparition in the Cova da Iria on August 13, the children see the Virgin Mary at nearby Valinhos, Portugal. She asks them again to pray the rosary daily, speaks about the miracle coming in October, and asks them “to pray a lot.” ()

Late Summer — 12:30 p.m. John Boback is walking along railroad tracks in Youngstown, Pennsylvania, when he hears a swishing sound and sees an elliptical object about 100 feet away on the ground in a pasture. It has portholes emitting ligt from the interior and a smooth surface. Moments later the object ascends smoothly in a gradual climb and flies away to the east. (Lore and Deneault, [pp. 104–105](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/mysteriesofskies0000lore/page/104/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727607618&usg=AOvVaw2mv5qzVnclDPrr-FkFvHhB))

Early September — Witnesses at Salida, Colorado, watch distant moving lights flicking on and off over a period of several days. Through a telescope, one light appears to be a revolving wheel with lights on it. (Arlene Shovald, “Edwards’ UFO Sighting Not Salida’s First,” Salida (Colo.) Mountain Mail, September 7, 1995; Clark III 1171)

September 13 — With the three children in attendance, the crowd at the Cova da Iria, Portugal, see a “luminous globe” sail across the sky. A white cloud envelops the children and the oak tree. A rain of white roses is said to have fallen out of the heavens but dissolves just before landing. Behind the cloud, the crowd can see [Lúcia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_L%25C3%25BAcia&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727608070&usg=AOvVaw3SjS2FAUd9rERp2xgAvNds) talking to the invisible lady.

October — Seven-year-old [Elizabeth Klarer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Klarer&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727608416&usg=AOvVaw1xGWuobkrqSp8m3bOCgcM8) and her older sister Barbara have their first alleged encounter with a UFO on their parents’ farm Connington in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa. While playing outside the farmhouse, Elizabeth claims to witness a giant orange-red wheel rolling across the sky. The plummeting object, also described as a fiery pockmarked meteor or planetoid, is intercepted by a silver disc bathed in a pearly luster. Around this time Elizabeth begins receiving occasional telepathic messages from a friendly space alien named Akon. (Clark III 657; Elizabeth Klarer, Beyond the Light Barrier, Howard Timmins, 1980)

October 13 — After some newspapers report that the Virgin Mary has promised a miracle for the last of her apparitions, a huge crowd, possibly between 30,000 and 100,000, including reporters and photographers, gathers at Cova da Iria, Portugal. What happens then becomes known as the “Miracle of the Sun.” Various claims are made as to what really happened. The three children report seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those

of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and Saint Joseph blessing the people. Father John de Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher who wrote several books on the subject, included descriptions by witnesses who believe they observed a miracle created by Mary, the mother of Jesus. After a period of rain, the dark clouds break and the Sun appears as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It appears significantly duller than normal and casts multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The Sun then seems to careen towards the earth before zigzagging back to its normal position. Witnesses report that their previously wet clothes become “suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling.” Not all witnesses report seeing the Sun “dance.” Some people only see the radiant colors, and others, including some believers, see nothing at all. The only known picture of the Sun taken during the event does not show anything unusual. No unusual solar phenomena are observed by scientists. Some theologians, scientists, and skeptics have offered alternative explanations that include psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, a sundog, and optical effects caused by natural meteorological phenomena. The Miracle of the Sun is interpreted by others as a UFO event. Investigator [Joe Nickell](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Nickell&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727609411&usg=AOvVaw0KU-_fpnA_z2Vmx119P5GS) thinks that the effects are “a combination of factors, including optical effects and meteorological phenomena, such as the sun being seen through thin clouds,

causing it to appear as a silver disc. Other possibilities include an alteration in the density of the passing clouds, causing the sun’s image to alternately brighten and dim and so seem to advance and recede, and dust or moisture droplets in the atmosphere refracting the sunlight and thus imparting a variety of colors.” (Wikipedia, “[Miracle of](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727609807&usg=AOvVaw1B3kBl5r4vlZUHQCVWOHgL) [the Sun](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727610015&usg=AOvVaw0_EG7hoHT8fLwixH3Y-ygY)”; Clark III 484–485; “[O Milagre do Fátima,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1917/N610/N610_item1/P15.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727610259&usg=AOvVaw0zS8l_dgMc-HWxg_lCZDMQ)” Ilustração Portuguesa, no. 610 (October 29, 1917): 353– 355; John de Marchi, [The True Story of Fatima](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/fatimafullstory00marc/page/n3/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727610620&usg=AOvVaw2xKaUt-mAfxBkWYfZFcVCa)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/fatimafullstory00marc/page/n3/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727610808&usg=AOvVaw03ge4Lls_D3Sn_fM3SjsT6) St. Paul, Minn.: Catechetical Guild Educational Society, 1956; Joe Nickell, “[The Real Secrets of Fatima,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2009/11/22164423/p14.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727611082&usg=AOvVaw1YGCHQr3UM01r_WDOpemUQ)” Skeptical Inquirer 33, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 2009): 14–17; Jeffrey S.

January 22 — After 10:00 p.m. A brilliant light the size of a tennis ball appears in a garden at Shuttlewood, Derbyshire, England. When the witness approaches it, it moves away at a leisurely pace and passes through wire netting. It follows the top of a hedge, turns right, and ascends until it finds a break in the high branches of a tree, where it hovers for 3 minutes before flying on. The witness then notices his neighbor’s farm is illuminated with bright white light. Several minutes later, the sphere returns to the garden, hovers another 3 minutes, then approaches the witness. As it does so, it turns from white to orange. It moves away, stops above a neighbor’s garden, travels

along a hedge, traverses a field, and circles a row of houses before soaring into the sky and disappearing. The light is seen for 40 minutes. (Mark Ian Birdsall, “The Luminous Pearl of 1919,” Quest International 10, no. 2 (1991): 26–27; Clark III 1171)

June 2 — 9:30 a.m. A tiny circular cloud appears in an otherwise cloudless sky over Ottertail, Minnesota. Suddenly it expands to several times its size. Seconds later, the window that the witness is watching through starts to shake and creak. By the time it stops, the cloud has expanded more and now has a ragged appearance, bending toward the earth. A black object shoots out of the bottom of the cloud, leaving a vapor trail, and begins making 6–7 barrel rolls. It then peels off in a straight line, headed north. (Clark III 1170; “Supersonic Jet in 1919?” IUR/Frontiers of Science 3, no. 6 (Jan./Feb. 1982): 14–15)

July — 11:00 a.m. A young brother and sister who live on a farm near Webster City, Iowa, hear a strange chirping sound while out playing. They turn and see a brown-green object under a tree near a creek 75 feet from them. They notice a similarly colored figure standing in a door that has been lowered down. It makes strange guttural sounds. They see another figure running toward the stream leading to a pond. This smaller one dips up some water into a can. The larger figure seems to be hurrying the smaller figure back into the object. The door slams shut with a metallic sound, and the vehicle rises up quickly with its three legs still out and goes over a hill. The soil where the object had been is covered with round spots that resemble cane marks.

Late summer — 10:00 p.m. Harry Anderson, 13 (or 16), is out riding with his family and two friends when their car runs out of oil east of Barron, Wisconsin. A passing farmer offers to give them some oil, and Harry accompanies him 2 miles away to his farmhouse. Harry walks back to the car alone and sees 20 little men walking in single file towards him. Their heads are bald, and the figures are dressed in leather “knee pants” held up by suspenders. They are mumbling but pay no attention to him. Terrified, he continues and does not look back.

1921 — An 8-year-old is playing in the hillocks near a canal in Marseille, France. He is suddenly accosted by two tall, slender men wearing apparent diving suits who drag him into a strange looking “tank.” After a while, an opening appears in the ceiling, and in a few moments he finds himself back on the ground.

1925 — Thomas Green is riding with another young man on a farm near Moora, Western Australia, when they come across an object “like two saucers placed edge on edge” resting on a paddock. Some oval-shaped windows are visible, and it is resting on four legs splayed outwards. The two decide to return home. Several days later they return and find the earth “scuffed about” on the spot.

1926 (or 1927) — 3:00 p.m. A 14-year-old girl is tending cows in a meadow between Brzezie and Ujazd, Poland.

Suddenly the cows become agitated and pull on their halters. She notices three cement-colored spherical objects some 650 feet away in a field to the north. In front of each is a small entity dressed in greenish uniforms. (Poland 9)

An illuminated globe moves toward him with a light so strong that it brightens the River Olt some 2.5 miles away. (Hobana and Weverbergh 224–225; Romania 9–11)

August — Dusk. Frank Tezky and his father watch 6 disc-shaped objects in Westmont, Illinois. Five smaller discs are trailing in a straight line behind a much larger one, moving west beneath cirrus clouds, which reflect the light cast by the objects. (Clark III 1170)

Late September — 11:00 p.m. An Air Mail pilot named Colin Murphy is repeatedly buzzed by a huge glowing object one hour after he takes off in his DH-4 biplane from Salt Lake City, Utah. The object is a 90-foot-long cylinder with no wings or propeller. Every time the object approaches closer than 150 feet, his engine sputters and misfires. He is forced to land in a sheep pasture, whereupon the object shoots away to the south. Possible hoax.

October 27 — Attorney and “telepathist” Hugh Mansfield Robinson, who has been in contact with a female Martian entity named Oomaruru since 1918, convinces the central radio office in London, England, to send out a message, “MMM opesti nipitia secomba” over the airwaves. He intends for it to be picked up by Martian wireless. The next day, he claims that Oomaruru telepathically told him that only the first three letters had been received.

1929 — In Hertford, England, a 5-year-old girl and her 8-year-old brother have such an unsettling experience that they do not talk about it themselves until about 1960, and the woman herself does not reveal it to outsiders until 1970.

They are playing in a garden when they hear engine sounds and see a tiny (12 or 15 inches wide) biplane coming over the fence from the direction of an orchard.

1930

1930 — 10:00 a.m. A woman is driving the family car in an isolated hilly area of Texas when she rounds a curve and sees a huge object about 100 feet across by the side of the road. A small door is open with steps leading down to the ground. One side of the object is braced up by two slender legs with round plates for feet. A man of normal size comes walking toward her and forces her to stop. He seems to speak to her telepathically, telling her to leave the road and make a shortcut through a gully. Some 8–10 other figures walk forward, much smaller and with slanted eyes. They are wearing tan coveralls and tight caps. Despite potential damage to her car, she drives through the gully as the larger man walks alongside. The next thing she remembers is walking up to her porch at her home 15 miles away. It is around 12:00 midnight. In March 1968, having read Interrupted Journey about the Betty and Barney Hill case, she writes to the Colorado project and offers herself for hypnosis and research.

Spring (or spring 1931) — 7:00 p.m. As he walks down a country road near Newberry, Michigan, high school student Ralph Newman sees a “distinctly green fireball” in the low eastern sky that moves from south to north. About the size of the full moon, its light brightens the countryside, then it vanishes. (Clark III 1175)

May — 4:30 p.m. Pasquale Masala is out riding his horse with a friend a few miles southeast of Paulilatino, Sardinia, Italy. When they reach a megalithic tomb known as Nuraghe Trudumeddu, they dismount to enjoy the view. Suddenly, a strange object the size and shape of a football emerges from the partially blocked entrance of the tomb. It travels at a height of about 3 feet above the ground at a constant speed of about 10–15 mph and enters a thick patch of undergrowth.

1933 — Earl J. Duncan and a Native American boy are in a truck near Fort Washakie, Wyoming, on the Wind River Indian Reservation. As they reach the crest of a hill, they see three perfectly round, pulsating, orange-red balls about 900 feet away. They are moving “in absolute alignment” about 20 feet from the ground toward the nearest mountain range. After 5 minutes of silent movement they disappear over a nearby mountain.

Summer — For weeks, strange lights in the sky are reported around Tobin Lake, Saskatchewan. Curious about the reports, two young men and a woman drive to the lake from Napawin. On their way they see a glow near the horizon, so they park and trek a quarter mile into the woods where they can see a large, oval-shaped craft sitting on legs.

From an open central doorway shines a bright orange glow; a ladderlike stairway extends downward with a dozen figures dressed in silver suits moving up and down the steps. They appear to be repairing the craft. The witnesses watch for 30 minutes when they decide to return to their truck and get closer. Two nights later they return and find imprints and burn marks, which they photograph. Two of them write an article that they submit to magazines, which refuse to publish what they consider outlandish fiction.

Summer — 2:30 a.m. A man who still insists on anonymity in 1964 is driving near Cherryville, Pennsylvania, when his car gets a flat tire. As he is jacking it up, he sees a faint violet light in the field on his right. Curious, he walks about 200 feet toward the light and sees a bell-shaped object about 10 feet in diameter and 6 feet high on the grass. Light is issuing from a circular door about 1 foot in diameter. He pushes it and it swings open. Putting his head inside, he cannot see much because of the peculiar light coming from the ceiling. The chamber inside is about 6 feet in diameter, 4 feet high, and full of tubing and dials on a console. An ammonia scent pervades the room, which is notably chilly. The man then walks around the object, touching the surface, which is slick, metallic, and cold. After 10 minutes, he goes back to the car, replaces the tire, and drives home.

The beams are “blinding.” The sighting is part of a wave of “ghost flier” reports of gray monoplanes without identifying markings that are reported over rural areas of Scandinavia from November 15, 1933, through February 11, 1934. The Swedish Military Record Office accumulates 96 reports from Sweden, 234 from Norway, and 137 from Finland, and the Swedish Air Force undertakes at least two reconnaissance missions in search of the mystery planes. More than 50% of the reports take place between 5:00

Occasionally a light would fly across the circle and take up another position until they all seem to relocate. They watch the display for about 30–40 minutes. (MUFON UFO Journal, no. 150, August 1980, p. 12)

October — Night. Holger Berg and another worker at the Civilian Conservation Corps in Eklutna, Alaska, are walking south toward Anchorage when the see a light approaching them from the south. It is attached to a cigar-shaped object embedded in a blue-green haze and making a strange buzzing noise. As the object passes directly overhead, they notice it actually has a triangular shape and multicolored lights on its tail end. Frightened, they dive into a nearby snowbank then run back to Eklutna. (Marler 64–66)

October 10 — 4:15 a.m. Capt. Mario Rossi, flight instructor at the airfield at Orbetello, Grosseto, Italy, is flying a Savoia- Marchetti SM.62 at 12,465 feet over Talamone, Italy, when he sees an unusual light ahead of his plane. He follows the light, which is at a slightly higher altitude and moving at nearly 440 mph. Rossi loses it after flying into a cloud for 12 minutes and finding himself over Elba.

Winter — Robert Damion, an astronomer of Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France, who has a private observatory in the Alps, claims that for several nights a “certain portion of the sky in the vicinity of Mars” has been lit up with a deep bluish tint for 40 seconds each time. He is convinced that Mars is trying to signal Earth.

January 1 — Noon. Pilot Howard S. Behr is flying a Curtiss-Wright CW-15 Sedan at 3,000 feet over Virginia on his way to Raleigh, North Carolina. Suddenly he sees an object beginning to cross his flight path about 1,000 feet below him. It looks like a gondola, gun-metal gray in color, with both of its ends turned up. He estimates it is about 35– 40 feet long and traveling at 150 mph. It moves off to his left and disappears.

1938 — The Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation begin contributing large amounts of money to the Council on Foreign Relations. They create various Committees on Foreign Relations throughout the country, which later become governed by the American Committees on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., funded by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. Influential men are chosen in several cities and are brought together for discussions in their own communities as well as participating in an annual conference in New York. These local committees serve to influence local leaders and shape public opinion to build support for the council’s policies, while also acting as “useful listening posts” through which the Council and US government can “sense the mood of the country.” (Wikipedia, “[Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727704155&usg=AOvVaw2BaZsJXodaT6C3WN2IIHd4)”)

January 25 — A Columbia University team conducts the first nuclear fission experiment in the US in the basement

of Pupin Hall on the south side of 120th Street in New York City. The experiment involves placing uranium oxide inside an ionization chamber and irradiating it with neutrons, then measuring the energy released. The results confirm that fission is occurring and hints strongly that it is the isotope uranium-235 that is undergoing fission.

Late summer — A girl sleeping in the back yard of her home in Fort Worth, Texas, is awakened by a whirring noise. She sees a small object approaching from the east at an altitude of 20–30 feet. When it gets close, it descends to the level of her bed and hovers briefly at the foot, so close that she can touch it. It has the shape of an “old-time Mississippi steamboat with a deck around the bottom.” Strata or veins run through it, and a soft, blue-green glow surrounds it. It is 3 feet around and 1 foot high. It rises suddenly and disappears.

Early August — George Pârvu and four other schoolchildren are playing in an open field in Armășești, Romania, when they see a bright light in the sky moving in a zigzag fashion. It circles a few times then descends in their direction, getting bigger and brighter. The egg-shaped object hovers silently at an altitude of 230–260 feet. Suddenly it becomes a dull coppery color and lands about 140 feet away. Two of the children flee but Pârvu and two others remain. The bottom of the object has a ring of small turbine blades that look like paddles in a water mill. It seems to be 16 feet high. A hatch opens and two little men about 4 feet tall come out, dressed in gray diving suits. They walk toward the children, one of them holding a rectangular box pointing at the ground. The children approach them, holding hands, but when they are about 23 feet away the other man points a thick stick-like device at them and they are no longer able to move forward. The little men bow in their direction, waist deep, then turn around and reenter the object, which takes off. The children find a circular area of yellowed grass where the object had been. Pârvu feels energized, but one of the other boys is temporarily sick. Pârvu encounters what he perceives to be the same object in August 1944, August 1949, and the summer of 1954 (in the center of Bucharest).

November 13 — 7:00 a.m. A building foreman is driving past a deserted farm near Brockworth, Gloucester, England, when he hears a high-pitched humming sound. He watches a gray, bell-shaped object hovering about 20 feet above a field 100 feet away. He estimates it is about 25 feet across. Dark window-like patches are visible on the side. A “curtain” of blue-green light emanates from the underside. After about two minutes, the green light retracts into the base of the object. The object then tilts to an angle of about 80° and moves away without a sound.

February 24–25 — The Battle of Los Angeles takes place, a rumored enemy attack and subsequent anti-aircraft barrage over Los Angeles, California. Air raid sirens sound throughout Los Angeles County on the night of February 24. A total blackout is ordered, and thousands of air raid wardens are summoned to their positions. At 3:16 a.m., the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade begins firing .50 caliber machine guns and 12.8-pound anti-aircraft shells into the air at reported aircraft; more than 1,400 shells are eventually fired. Pilots of the 4th Interceptor Command are alerted, but their aircraft remain grounded. The artillery fire continues sporadically until 4:14 a.m. The “all clear” is sounded and the blackout order lifted at 7:21 a.m. Several buildings and vehicles are damaged by shell fragments, and five civilians die as an indirect result of the anti-aircraft fire. Three are killed in car accidents in the ensuing chaos and two die of heart attacks attributed to the stress of the hour-long action. The incident is front-page news along the Pacific coast and earns some mass media coverage. Within hours of the end of the air raid, Secretary of the Navy [Frank Knox](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Knox&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727752375&usg=AOvVaw2XObi-2LXafKp2wh9p682o) holds a press conference, saying the entire incident was a false alarm due to anxiety and “war nerves.” Knox’s comments are followed by statements from the Army on February 26 that reflect General [George C.

In 1983, the US Office of Air Force History attributes the event to a case of “war nerves” triggered by a lost weather balloon and exacerbated by stray flares and shell bursts from adjoining batteries.

June 25 (or March 25) — Midnight. Flight Lt. Roman (Ray) Sabiński of the 301 Polish Bomber Squadron is flying an RAF Wellington bomber after returning from a run on the Ruhr Valley, Germany; he sees a bright copper-colored light the “size of the moon” following the aircraft over the Zuiderzee in Holland. When it gets within 200 yards, the rear gunner shoots at it with all four machine guns. After two minutes, it moves at terrific speed to the port side, and the front gunner starts firing at it. Sabiński takes evasive action, but the object keeps pacing him.

Finally, it moves in front of the bomber, stays there a while, then takes off at fantastic speed. (Strange Company 23–25; Gordon W.

The aircraft is over or near the English coastline when it is allegedly intercepted by a strange metallic object that matches the aircraft’s course and speed for a time before shooting away. The plane’s crew photograph the object, which “hovered noiselessly” near the aircraft before moving off. According to the documents, details of the cover-up emerge when a man writes to the government in 1999 seeking to find out more about the incident.

Summer — 5:50 p.m. An RAAF pilot is on flying patrol off the Tasman Peninsula, Tasmania, following reports by fishermen of strange lights on the waters of Bass Strait. A “singular airfoil of glistening bronze color” appears out of a cloudbank. It’s about 150 feet long, 50 feet in diameter, and has a dome on top. It accompanies his plane for a few minutes before departing at “a hell of a pace.” It turns again and dives into the ocean, throwing up a “whirlpool of waves.” (Bill Chalker, “[Australian A.F.

Late summer — Pvt. Albert Lancashire, 27, is standing guard at Cresswell radar station near Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland, England, when he sees a cloud-enshrouded light approaching from the North Sea. As it descends, he is drawn up into it by a beam. Small men grab him and carry him into the craft, where he sees other human figures of normal height, including an apparent captain with dark hair and goggles. He is made to lie down on a couch or table. He has only vague memories of what happens next, but he thinks a medical exam is performed. He wakes up back at his sentry post.

August 12 — Day. Sgt. Stephen J. Brickner of the 1st Marine Division on Tulagi in the Solomon Islands is cleaning his rifle when an air-raid warning is sounded.

October 14 — Night. A group of B-17s from the 384th Bombardment Group are returning from a mission over Germany when they see a cluster of silver-colored discs in the path of their formation and closing with the bombers. The crews talk back and forth, discussing and confirming the sight before them. They describe the objects as “about one inch thick and three inches in diameter…gliding down slowly in a very uniform cluster.” One of the bombers goes directly through the cluster “with absolutely no effect on engines or plane surface,” even though one is heard to strike the tail assembly. A mass of black debris about 3-4 feet long is also observed. (Clark III 502; Martin Caidin, Black Thursday, Dell, 1962, pp. 188–190; Frank Edwards, Flying Saucers—Here and Now!

Those ancients also abandoned some of their own offspring here, a minority of whom remained noble and human “Teros,” while most degenerate over time into a population of mentally impaired sadists known as “Deros”— short for “detrimental robots.” Shaver’s robots are not mechanical constructs, but robot-like due to their savage behavior. These Deros still live in the cave cities, according to Shaver, kidnapping surface-dwelling people by the thousands for meat or torture. Deros can be blamed for nearly all misfortunes, from minor “accidental” injuries or illnesses to airplane crashes and catastrophic natural disasters. Though generally confined to their caves, the Deros sometimes travel in spaceships or rockets, and have dealings with equally evil extraterrestrials. Shaver claims to possess first-hand knowledge of the Deros and their caves, insisting he had been their prisoner for several years. The article stirs considerable reader interest, and the pages of Amazing Stories are soon filled with stories and articles about the “Shaver mystery.” (Wikipedia, “[Richard Sharpe Shaver](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sharpe_Shaver&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727800492&usg=AOvVaw321wrVyWcUh1CVna0XA9uO)”; \[Richard\] S.

Liquid sulfur mustard from the bombs spills into waters already contaminated by oil from the other damaged vessels. The many sailors who abandoned their ships into the water become covered with the oily mixture. The wounded are pulled from the water and sent to medical facilities whose personnel are unaware of the mustard gas. Medical staff focus on personnel with blast or fire injuries. Within a day, the first symptoms of mustard poisoning appear in 628 patients and medical staff, including blindness and chemical burns. That puzzling development is further complicated by the arrival of hundreds of Italian civilians also seeking treatment, who have been poisoned by a cloud of sulfur mustard vapor that blows over the city when some of John Harvey’s cargo exploded. As the medical crisis worsens, little

April 26 — Night. RAF pilot Arthur Horton of the 622 Squadron is returning from a bombing mission to Essen, Germany, when he is followed by four orange balls of light with “short stubby wings” and emitting sparks, two on each side of the aircraft. He takes evasive action with his Lancaster, but the objects follow all his maneuvers for 10 minutes.

Early July — 10:30 a.m. During Allied operations in the area around Loreto, Castelfidardo, and Osimo, in Ancona province, Italy, Antoni Szachnowsky, of the 2nd Polish Artillery Regiment, notices an egg-shaped, glistening, metallic, motionless object. The Polish Army anti-aircraft gun fires on it, then the German batteries join in.

Eventually both sides stop, and the object remains motionless for a minute. Then it tilts at a 45° angle, moves rapidly upward, and disappears. (“1944: An Italian Foo-Fighter?” UFO Sightings Italia, no. 2, March 2002)

Late July — Evening. Jaakku Kivistö is serving in the Finnish Army as a noncommissioned medical officer stationed on a farm near Impilahti, Karelia \[now Russia\], by Lake Ladoga. He notices a large object next to the corn-drying building on a steep hillside that he at first takes for a military truck. As he walks closer, he sees it is reddish in color, moving slowly about 150–230 feet in the air, 100 feet long, and has a row of black windows.

Summer — 5:00 p.m. François Panes watches a cigar-shaped object at an altitude of about 5,000 feet above the Kamensko Forest north of Blovice, Czechoslovakia \[now Czech Republic\], glittering brightly with no wings, no rudder, and no propeller. It is about 150 feet in diameter and 300–400 feet long. The object is lit up from underneath. It slowly descends, after which it rises up again and vanishes into the blue sky after 10–15 minutes. (Hobana and Weverbergh 215–216)

Summer — Fred Wieland and some friends are riding their bicycles on a footpath adjacent to the Grand Central Parkway in Queens, New York City. As they climb a hill, they look up and see a cigar-shaped object “broadside” to them. It is of smooth metallic construction with no windows or openings. They race to the top of the hill for a better look, but by then the object has completely disappeared. (Clark III 1178)

Summer — Mid-day. Franceen Andron is at Camp McCain, southeast of Grenada, Mississippi, when she sees a large, fat, cigar-shaped object that changes from dull black to gray to “fog blue.” It is joined by three smaller discs that appear below it after emerging from a cloud. The large object disappears first, followed by the discs, which race away in different directions. (NICAP case file)

Late August — Sgt. Ness and another man of the mine-laying platoon of the 175th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division, see a large rectangular object “like a railroad boxcar” with no apparent source of propulsion move steadily at about 90 mph over the front lines near Brest, Brittany, France, and out to sea.

Late August — 4:20 p.m. A nurse, Mrs. E. M. Church, on her way to a tram station in Christchurch, New Zealand, sees an object like an “upturned saucer” resting on the ground near the road. It seems to be 20 feet across and 9 feet high. Two beings, not quite 4 feet tall, are inside, visible through a rectangular window. A third stands motionless, just outside an open door. All three seem to be looking toward the lights of a nearby fairground. The nurse cannot decide if their skin color is green or they are dressed in green, but all are encased in a transparent oblong box. The head takes up half of their bodies and there are no apparent legs or arms. She inadvertently makes a noise, and the outside figure notices her. Its helmet flips over automatically, and it drifts inside the object, which rises up and disappears in the clouds.

It is glossy white in color and about 30 feet long and 4 feet wide. Nelson eases the car up to the object, but it withdraws; when he stops, it also stops. Soon the light rises high in the air and disappears over Black Oak Ridge. (Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story, Signet, 1969, pp, 23–24)

September — 9:00 p.m. Canadian Army Lance Cpl. Carson Yorke is just outside Antwerp, Belgium, during a German bombardment. He steps out of his vehicle and sees a glowing globe traveling at about 30 mph and 40 feet altitude from the front lines toward the city (in the same course that the German V-2s are following). It seems to be 3–4 feet in diameter and looks “as though it was cloudy glass with a light inside.” It disappears from view, then is followed by another, then five others in succession.

October — Late night. Members of a family who live in an isolated area on the outskirts of Rochester, Pennsylvania, are awakened by a loud noise and flash of light. The father goes to the door, where he sees a 4.5-foot-tall figure dressed in a brown robe. Fifteen feet to its left are five other figures dressed in luminous brown metallic suits.

Their heads seem large, with only a slit for a mouth. The arms are long, with long thin fingers. Three of them enter the house and the father accompanies them to a landed craft nearby. He remembers nothing else when he wakes up in the morning. A round, burned circle 20 feet from the house and 25 feet in diameter is found the next day. (Clark III 265–266)

October — Nellie Carlin and another woman are about to drive to work in St. Paul, Minnesota, when they see what seems to be an airplane about to crash.

November 3 — The Japanese Army launches the first of some 9,300 Fu-Go bomb-bearing fire balloons intended to land in North America to instill fear and terror. About 300 are found or seen in America. It is likely that more of them land in unpopulated areas. On November 4, a US Navy patrol craft discovers one of the first Fu-Go balloons floating off San Pedro, Los Angeles, California. National and state agencies are placed on heightened alert status when balloons are found in Wyoming and Montana before the end of the month.

Late December through February 1945 — Radar operators at Naval Air Station Pasco, Washington, report unusual blips that appear out of nowhere and proceed from northwest to southeast. A Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter is scrambled on at least two occasions with orders to shoot down anything that appears to be hostile, but nothing is seen. In another incident, Lt. JG Clarence R. Clem accompanies Lt. Commander Richard Brown and Ensign C. T. Neal to a waiting aircraft and Brown takes off in pursuit of a ball of fire that quickly leaves him behind as it speeds off to the northwest and is lost to radar. On another occasion, naval officer R. W. Hendershot, flying an SNJ aircraft, is asked by ground radar to make contact with two high-altitude blips flying at the speed of a single- engine Piper Cub.

March — A man is squirrel hunting in a wooded area near Belfast, Maine, when he sees a huge, elongated object just above the trees. He runs after it, thinking it is a dirigible about to crash. The object crashes into the trees at the far edge of a clearing, splitting a huge pine tree down the middle. He smells burned rubber. The object seems to be as big as several B-36 bombers. As he stands there stunned, the lowest end of the craft begins to rise and he hears a humming sound of increasing intensity. After it rises to a horizontal position, it begins to spin faster and faster and the hum becomes very intense. Suddenly one end spews a shower of fine, silvery threads that glint in the sunlight. The object begins to change to a white metallic color and it takes off straight up at fantastic speed. (“I Saw a Flying Saucer,” Flying Saucers, May 1959, pp. 6–18, 78; Clark III 1178–1179)

April 25 — 9:45 a.m. Acting Squadron Leader Kit Francis Williams of the RAF 617 Bomber Squadron is flying a Lancaster with 25 other aircraft to bomb Hitler’s headquarters at Berchtesgaden, Germany, in the Bavarian Alps. Just after a turn near Kaiserslautern, Germany, at 16,500 feet, Williams witnesses an object like a large woolly blanket that takes up his entire windshield. He thinks it could be as much as 4–5 miles wide. It moves vertically and is gone in an instant. Suddenly his aircraft loses its electrical power and loses one of its bombs. He and his bomber and engineer get severe headaches. They return to base in England after regaining power.

July — The 9th Bombardment Group on Tinian in the Northern Marianas: “During our night missions in June and July a UFO phenomenon was reported. Our air crews started sighting balls of fire, i.e., glowing objects about the size of a full moon which flew around in the vicinity of our flying patterns over Japan. One of our crews reported that one of the objects followed their airplane halfway to Iwo Jima. I saw them on two missions. I don’t remember any reports of any hostile action by these objects and the reports of sightings stopped after a couple of months. The object of these reports was dismissed by some experts as the planet Venus. And, after these reports started coming in, some crews did mistake the rising full moon as one of these balls of fire. Some reports speculated that these balls of fire were exhausts from a Japanese development called a Baka Bomb, but exhaust flames can only be seen from the rear; and these objects appeared to have the same size and intensity in whatever direction they were traveling. I have never heard of any official assessment as to what these objects were. I had an occasion to ask General [LeMay](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_LeMay&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727884288&usg=AOvVaw3lFUFMfLjDwLwp90Kp93N3) about them several years after the war and he had no explanation.

December 5 — A training flight (Flight 19) of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers disappears while over the Atlantic Ocean. The squadron’s flight plan is scheduled to take them due east from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for

141 miles, north for 73 miles, and then back over a final 140-mile leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returns to base. A report by Navy investigators concludes that flight leader Lt. [Charles C. Taylor](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7071436/charles-carroll-taylor&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889727928896&usg=AOvVaw1xN4-zDqP7Ke9ghEFKzdKI) mistook small islands offshore for the Florida Keys after his compasses stopped working, resulting in the flight heading over open sea and away from land. The report is later amended by the Navy to read “cause unknown” to avoid blaming Taylor for the loss of five aircraft and 14 men. One of the search-and-rescue aircraft deployed to look for them,

a PBM Mariner with a 13-man crew, also disappears. The report attributes the loss of the PBM aircraft to an explosion in midair while searching for the flight. According to contemporaneous sources, the Mariner has a history of explosions due to vapor leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation. A tanker off the coast of Florida sees an explosion and a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather is becoming stormy by the end of the incident. None of the Avenger bombers have been found.

1946 — A farmer named Gunyon in Westerham, Kent, England, calls the British Technical Intelligence staff asking that the Air Ministry come and remove one of these “darned contraptions” which has fallen on his farm. The intelligence officers ask for directions and are told to drive from Croydon to Westerham, turning onto a lane when they reach a pub called The White Dog. Amid great security, two staff cars are dispatched, but fail to find the farm. They locate a pub called The White Hart and a farmer named Bunyan, who strenuously denies having made the call.

July 10 — A brilliantly glowing projectile trailing luminous smoke crashes into a beach near Norrvikssand, Sweden.

Airline pilot Torvald Linden and other witnesses find a shallow crater a little more than 3 feet in diameter. A mass of slag-like material, some of it reduced to powder (which burns the hands when touched) is found at the site and collected into bags. A journalist from Svenska Dagbladet on July 11 finds a “burnt-brown object with a hollow cylinder” with a diameter of about 1–2 inches. Military authorities take over the site. The debris is taken to Dr. B. Backlund at a laboratory in Kubikenborg, who finds it contains paper with microscopic black-and-white squares like a screen. Some porous, rust-colored fragments are also present. The same day, the beach is visited by Lt. Col.

October 10 — 4:00 a.m. Waltraut Anlauf, a telephone operator in Friedland Refugee Camp, Lower Saxony, Germany, sees small, elongated flashes at a great height in the sky. They look like cigars and are luminescent white in front and bluish-white in back. She sees about 10 objects pass per minute. Sometimes there is an interruption of about 10 minutes, and then new groups appear. The sighting lasts one hour. Possibly these are part of the Taurid meteor shower. (Clark III 529)

February 8 — A US Navy Privateer bomber flying over Sweden picks up signals that might be directing rockets. (Letter from US Naval Forces Europe, London, to Chief of Naval Operations; Jan Aldrich)

February 17 — Capt. J. B. Pearson Jr., US naval attaché in London, England, sends an intelligence report to the Chief of Naval Intelligence about his conversation with Col. Westergard, head of the Airplane Design Section for the Swedish Air Ministry. Westergard tells him some 40% of the 1,000 ghost rocket sightings are “reliable.” They seem to originate in Peenemünde, Germany, and fly toward Finland. The best observation is from an artillery officer who sees an object in his optical range finder and follows it for about 90 seconds. It is in level flight at 4.5 miles distance and is about 36 feet long and torpedo shaped. (Loren E.

Late April or early May — 12:05 p.m. Mrs. William Down and Mrs. H. G. Olavick of Tucson, Arizona, see an unusual, fleecy cloud in an otherwise cloudless sky. Moving around it in “yo-yo fashion” are a number of small discs with a dull-white finish. They move up and down and sideways, occasionally disappearing into or behind the cloud.

They watch the objects for 5–7 minutes, then all the discs disappear above the cloud, while a larger object emerges from the cloud and moves eastward. Behind it comes a V-formation of nine of the smaller discs, which then climbs at high speed toward the northeast and disappears in 2–3 seconds. The witnesses assume the objects are some new type of aircraft.

June 24 — 3:00 p.m. Boise, Idaho, businessman [Kenneth Arnold](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arnold&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728067404&usg=AOvVaw2JBW26pzCfYh5qB3IDCpKE), flying his CallAir Model A-2 from Chehalis to Yakima, Washington, sees a string of nine objects flying in an echelon formation past Mount Rainier, Washington. At first he assumes they are jets, but he can see no trails. They cover the 50-mile distance between Rainier and another peak in 1 minute 42 seconds. He estimates their speed to be at least 1,200 mph. The objects swerve in and out of the smaller peaks, flipping from side to side in unison, dipping, and presenting their lateral surfaces, which reflect the bright sunlight and cause the flashes he saw earlier. They are in view for about two and a half minutes and are last seen heading south over the last high peak of Mount Adams. Arnold tells the airport staff about it in Yakima at 4:00 p.m. and they call ahead to Pendleton, Oregon, to alert them of Arnold’s arrival at an air show and his story. A large crowd awaits him, and a discussion follows. The consensus is that Arnold has seen guided missiles. But no such technology exists at the time that can match the objects’ description and performance, and the late 1990s explanation that Arnold observed a flight of white pelicans is equally improbable.

The objects came in “very fast, slow down jerkily, then flutter to the ground like leaves.” Mrs. Johnson thinks the objects are about the size of a “five-room house.” When they reach a clearing in the timber, they appear to “settle Down” a few at a time.

July 4 — The United Press service rounds up theories about the flying discs.

Sneide from San Francisco, California, thinks they are “oblate spheroid space ships from other planets” with hidden bases on the dark side of the moon.

It seems to have a propellor attached to a red conical structure on its underside and is about 20–25 feet in diameter. (Bloecher, [p.

It is three-quarters of a mile long and 200–300 feet wide. A gouge starting at the northern end of it extends for 400–500 feet toward the other end. It looks as if something has touched down and skipped along. The largest piece of debris is recovered at the southern edge of the gouge. The debris is as thin as newsprint, but incredibly strong. There is foil that, when crumpled, unfolds itself without a sign of a wrinkle, I-beams that flex slightly and have some symbols on them, and material resembling Bakelite.

Marcel and Cavitt walk the perimeter of the field and then range out looking for more details or another crash site but find nothing else. Finally, they return and spend the remainder of the day collecting debris. They load the rear of Marcel’s car and then the jeep carryall driven by Cavitt. About dusk they begin the trip back to Roswell. (Don Schmitt and Kevin D. Randle, “The Roswell Material,” IUR 16, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1991): 10–11; Kevin D. Randle and Donald R.

Only a few packages are loaded onto the plane. One, a triangular package about two feet long, is wrapped in brown paper. The other three are about the size of shoe boxes. They are so light that it feels as if there is nothing in them. When it lands in Fort Worth, the enlisted soldiers on the plane are ordered to remain aboard until a guard is posted and Marcel gets off taking one of the packages that he has been carrying on his lap. According to Flight Engineer M/Sgt. [Robert Porter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/rw/w/robertporter.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728198229&usg=AOvVaw3RmfwP1iez9dP4Xh3KiVMf), the soldiers go to the mess hall once the guard is posted. The remaining debris is transferred to a B-25 that is flying to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. Marcel goes to Ramey’s office and puts the package on his desk. They both go to a map room, where Marcel shows him where the debris was found. When they return to Ramey’s office, Marcel sees that the package he brought has been substituted by a torn-up weather balloon. Ramey proposes a plan that possibly originates from his bosses at the Pentagon. Attention needs to be diverted from the more important impact site north of Roswell by acknowledging the Corona location. Too many civilians are involved, and the press is already alerted. (Kevin D.

They see a metallic object some 2 miles away to the east and some 1,500 feet below their aircraft. It approaches them at great speed before veering to the north.

July 9 — Shortly after 5:00 p.m. Electrician Raymond Edward Lane and his wife are picking huckleberries near Midland, Michigan, when they hear a kind of “puff” noise nearby. Looking up, they see a ball of white, sparkling fire, like a Fourth of July sparkler, about the size of a bushel basket, no more than 100 feet away. It is hovering several feet above a stretch of sand. After about 10 or 15 seconds, the light goes out and the object vanishes. The only thing that remains is a peculiar dark substance on the sand and some metallic fragments. Lane collects fragments of the material in a tin can and brings them the next morning to Robert S. Spencer, a senior researcher at the Dow Chemical Company materials research laboratory in Midland. Spencer goes to the site with Lane and Dow’s internal security chief Edward Fales. Spencer has the Dow spectroscopy laboratory analyze the fragments and reports that the shiny pellets are largely silver mixed with a bit of silicon. They conclude that it consists of fused sand. By the end of September, the lab has analyzed ashlike powder found at the site. It turns out to be thorite that is slightly radioactive, mixed with magnesium hydroxide and other trace minerals. The conclusion is that the sighting is the result of some kind of home-made fireworks experiment, although Dow chemist [John Josef Grebe](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/107960608/john-josef-grebe&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728230041&usg=AOvVaw0-csZ6Ko7N4ooYmVszhmOx) suspects it might have been a small missile.

July 10 — 5:30 p.m. Three civilian airline mechanics (John N. Mehrman Jr., Robert Leidy, and John E. Woodruff) at Ernest Harmon AFB \[now Stephenville International Airport\] are returning from a fishing trip and driving up a mountain road near Stephenville Crossing, Newfoundland. They see a bluish-black exhaust trail that has cut through some clouds leaving a “hole.” Woodruff sees a disc-shaped object the apparent size of a C-54 transport plane coming out of the clouds and traveling at a terrific rate of speed. The hole remains in the cloud for more than an hour. Leidy takes two Kodachrome photos of the exhaust trail. The sighting later impresses Project Sign personnel to the extent that they ask questions about UFO effects on clouds.

July 23 — José C. Higgens and some assistants are surveying a field in Campina do Amoral in the Colônia Goio-Bang, located between Luiziana and Mamboré, Paraná, Brazil. On hearing a sharp sound, they see a grayish-white disc- shaped object about 100 feet in diameter, which soon lands and rests on curved metal feet. His assistants flee, but Higgens goes up to examine it. He sees a small, glass window, then two odd-looking beings observing him curiously. A door opens in the craft, and three other hairless beings dressed in transparent overalls. They have large, round eyes with eyebrows and pronounced eyelashes. Their legs are disproportionately long and they are about 7 feet tall. One points a small tube at Higgens. They are speaking in an unknown, sonorous language. He walks toward the door and can see only a small cubicle, bordered by another door, and several portholes. Higgens by gestures asks where they are from and the leader draws a map in the dirt, indicating a seventh planet, presumably Uranus. He eludes them by pretending to look for his wife and goes into a hidden spot in the woods. After 30 minutes the beings climb into the object and take off.

July 25 — Day. Leonard Robertson is riding his motorcycle northeast of Dumas, Texas, when he sees a flash of light to his left. An oval object like a bubble is floating over a field about one mile away.

August — The Denver Post runs a story that claims the military is building a secret base consisting of huge caverns for atomic weapons defense purposes. The article says the new base is in the Manzano Mountains southeast of Sandia Base, New Mexico. The military responds by issuing a statement that operations and construction near Sandia Base are top secret. In fact, however, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project is building one of several bases around the country that will be used for nuclear weapons storage. The AFSWP code-names the base “Site Able.” (Wikipedia, “[Sandia Base](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandia_Base%23Manzano_Base&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728278680&usg=AOvVaw04P90X4MMyDswETd4qgVFD)”)

The definition of Confidential that he proposes goes beyond the Army and Manhattan Project rules: “CONFIDENTIAL: Documents, information or material, the unauthorized disclosure of which, while not endangering the National security, would be prejudicial to the interests or prestige of the Nation or any Governmental activity, or individual, or would cause administrative embarrassment, or be of advantage to a foreign nation shall be classified CONFIDENTIAL.” The Derry memo calls for review by a classification board assembled from the AEC’s regional sites. In September, this board assembles in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The available documentation does not show that Derry’s proposed rules go into effect, but it does show that the Classification Board blesses the illustrations of matter that “should be graded” Secret or Confidential. The former category includes “certain selected human administration experiments performed under MED \[Manhattan Engineer District\].” (US Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, “Final Report,” October 1995, [chapter 13](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/research/reports/ACHRE/chap13_3.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728292423&usg=AOvVaw18nhyseFT-iPWi5eGWsIUz))

August 13 — The San Francisco Examiner’s Washington Bureau hears a rumor from a US intelligence source that Soviet agents have been ordered to solve the mystery of flying saucers. It reports that the Kremlin believes that the discs are connected with Army experiments in anti-radar weaponry. (San Francisco (Calif.) Examiner, August 14, 1947, p. 1)

August 14 — The first Gallup poll on UFOs shows that 90% of Americans have heard of flying saucers; 33% don’t know what they are, 39% consider them hoaxes or misidentifications, 16% consider them US or Russian secret weapons. The ETH is not mentioned.

R. Johannis) is hiking along the left bank of the Torrente Chiarzò near Raveo, Udine, Italy, when he sees a vivid red, metallic, domed disc on the riverbank about 165 feet ahead. It is about 33 feet wide and embedded in a cleft in the rock about 20 feet above thqwe stream. Looking around, he sees two “boys” on the edge of a grove of trees. He shouts at them and points to the object, walking toward them, but notices they are actually odd-looking dwarfs who are approaching him stiffly. They are about 3 feet tall and wearing dark blue coveralls with red collars, cuffs, and belts. Their greenish heads are covered in tight-fitting, brownish caps. He looks at them in astonishment for 2–3 minutes, then waves his geologist’s pick at them and asks where they come from. One of the entities raises its right hand to its belt, which emits a puff of smoke that knocks Rapuzzi to the ground as if from an electric shock. As he is lying there, one of them grabs his pick and he notices its green hand has 8 claws. They climb up the rock and into the disc, which soon shoots straight out and into the air, hovering briefly at an angle, then vanishes.

Rapuzzi feels a blast of wind that blows him across the ground. His pick is missing.

The pilot then parachutes back to the ground, a chute opens on the rocket, and it is recovered for re-use. (New London (Conn.) Day, August 20, 1947; Jan Aldrich)

The letter lists common descriptions of the objects and recommends that USAF “issue a directive assigning a priority, security classification, and code name for a detailed study of the matter.” This will ultimately result in Project Sign. Henceforth all disc reports are to be sent to the Army and Navy Research and Development Board, the USAF Scientific Advisory Group, the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, Project RAND, and the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft project at Oak Ridge.

1948

1948 — David T. Keating, an employee of the USAF Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft group, is flying with the 166th Fighter Squadron of the Ohio National Guard out of Lockbourne AFB \[now Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base\] in Lockbourne, Ohio. While executing a flip of his P-51 at 18,000 feet, he sees a silvery disc zoom above his plane. He goes in pursuit of it at 325 mph and closes to within 240 feet of it. It seems to be 40 feet in diameter and 6 feet thick, with a vertical stabilizer rudder on the end. He keeps flying after it even when he loses sight of it. “About 10 miles south of the Ohio River,” he claims, “I spotted litter on a hillside and a path that had obviously been ripped up by a crashing plane.” Short on fuel, he returns to Lockbourne. He persuades his major to fly over the crash scene, and they send a truck to retrieve the remains. (Helen Knox, “Ridge Newcomer Tells of Game of Tag with ‘Saucer,’” The Oak Ridger, September 18, 1950; Clark III 325)

1948 — An airman stationed in Arizona is called out with a scientific team to examine a flying saucer that has crashed near Taos, New Mexico. When he arrives, the area is roped off and under military guard. The object is metallic with a flat circular airfoil. The cabin at the top center is too small for a normal-sized human. He is told by workers on the scene that bodies of “little men” have been removed from the craft. They discover that the ship is constructed of interlocking sections pinned together, but they cannot locate a power plant, except possibly some electromagnets below the cabin. (L.

January 7 — 2:50 p.m. Capt. [Thomas F. Mantell Jr.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14958603/thomas-francis-mantell&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728362168&usg=AOvVaw2DtXXulBVP6EDfB8uQ-EIO)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14958603/thomas-francis-mantell&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728362343&usg=AOvVaw1dj36VBE1ayk9fBLahKqZ8) a 25-year-old Kentucky Air National Guard pilot, and three others are flying F-51D fighters to Louisville, Kentucky. After Mantell reports his position to Standiford Field in Louisville, Tech/Sgt. [Quinton A. Blackwell](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/39533254/quinton-a_-blackwell&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728362568&usg=AOvVaw3_-vO4x61oolgYDhkQeqmT) at Godman Army Airfield at Fort Knox breaks in over the radio to request Mantell to intercept and identify the object. The object maintains a constant angular position as seen from Godman as it apparently moves away at about 240–300 mph at an altitude of 50,000–60,000 feet during most of Mantell’s pursuit. Flying at 300 mph and gradually climbing to about 22,000–23,000 feet, Mantell gradually overtakes the UFO from below, past Bowling Green, Kentucky, at about 3:10 p.m. In one of his last radio reports, Mantell says the UFO “appears to be a metallic object or possibly reflection of sun from a metallic object, and it is of tremendous size.” At 3:15 p.m., at 22,500 feet with oxygen running low, two other F-51Ds quit the chase.

Mantell continues to 25,000, blacks out, and crashes at 3:18 p.m. about 4 miles south-southwest of Franklin, Kentucky. The UFO disappears from view behind a cloud at Godman at 3:50 p.m. The Project Sign staff, still not yet formally organized, are under pressure to come up with some kind of answer, so they quickly float Venus (offhandedly suggested by Ohio State University astronomer [J. Allen Hynek](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728362941&usg=AOvVaw1r2-hdEYpNzXqvrunCCTXV)) as an explanation. This implausible explanation is not even believed by the Air Force, but it remains unchallenged for several years.

Lockbourne Control Tower at the same time radios a report of the object, which then maneuvers over to Commercial Point about 3–5 miles away to the west-southwest, then makes three full 360° circles over one spot in 30-40 seconds per turn over the runway, at a speed of more than 500 mph, leaving a luminous, amber- colored trail or exhaust about 5 times its length.

Just before departing, it hovers or “appeared to touch down” on the grass extension past the end of the Lockbourne AFB runway for 10 seconds then leaves at 120° (ESE) heading into the overcast. It is also sighted by the pilot of a C-45 at 5,000 feet off the right wing at 7:53 p.m. (NICAP, “[Object Circles Base at High Speed / Touches Down](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/480107lockbourne_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728370884&usg=AOvVaw1zIurEApKkQQINK_AYGno0)”; [Sparks](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nicap.org/bb/BB_Unknowns.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728371202&usg=AOvVaw32P9do1rmh0BzJv0ougX5f)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nicap.org/bb/BB_Unknowns.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728371456&usg=AOvVaw3EGNDUxBUnVbPs13ugUvZ2) p. 32)

When Air Force investigators and government scientists arrive on the scene, they crawl through a broken porthole and find the bodies of 16 small humanlike beings (3–3.5 feet tall) dressed in the “style of 1890.” Their skin is charred a chocolate color, apparently as a result of the rush of terrestrial air through the shattered window. After a thorough study, the scientists conclude that the “vehicle probably flew on magnetic lines of force.” Segments of the craft, as well as the bodies, are supposedly transported to Wright Field in Ohio. Dr. Gee, who claims to have been on the scene, said the UFO is likely from Venus, as Martians “would probably be three or four times as large as human beings.” Soon afterward, a crash occurs in Arizona and 16 bodies are taken from the wreckage.

April — Morning. US Weather Bureau meteorologist Walter A. Minozewski at the Richmond, Virginia, weather station and his staff catch sight of a bright metallic, elliptical disc while they are tracking a small ceiling balloon at 15,000 feet. He checks his observation through a theodolite telescope. The disc flies just below the balloon and remains in sight for 15 seconds, appearing much bigger than the balloon. It has a flat, level bottom and a dome on top. It remains on a westward heading at high speed, then vanishes off into the distance.

April 1 — 9:55 a.m. USAF 1stLt. Robert W. Meyers is leading a flight of four P-47s from the 67th Fighter Group about 9 miles southeast of Sorsogon City, Luzon, Philippines. At 1,500 feet, he notices an unusual silvery object about 3 miles to the east. Shaped like a flying wing or half-moon with a “turtle back,” it resembles no military craft in use at the time. The object flies below the squadron at 200 mph and an altitude of about 1,000 feet. Meyers estimates it is about 30 feet wide and 20 feet long. When he attempts to contact the other three P-47s, he realizes his radio is dead. As he makes a 270° left turn to get a closer look, the object makes a 90° left turn and moves away at tremendous speed. It is only visible for about 5 seconds.

two objects. One observer follows one object, and the others follow the second as they diverge. All are certain that the objects aren’t balloons. They are large, whitish, roundish, very high, faster than any aircraft, and perform rapid, erratic motions. One object is lost at a low altitude. The other goes up quickly and seems to just disappear. The observation lasts about 30 seconds. The case is deemed important enough to send [Alfred Loedding](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/209268646/alfred-christian-loedding&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728415929&usg=AOvVaw0ccXtu6itOe2DJM7f3yJFL) and one of [Clingerman](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113944251/william-r_-clingerman&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728416392&usg=AOvVaw1CEYePCLzR5jKS2uoFxp_0)’s assistants, Lt. Col. James C. Beam (the head of Project Sign), to New Mexico to interview Project Mogul scientist James W. Peoples and the other witnesses. Unfortunately, they are gone when Sign arrives. (They are later interviewed at the USAF Watson Laboratory complex in Red Bank, New Jersey.) The witnesses are very sure of themselves and the case is classed as “Unidentified.” While at Holloman, Loedding and Beam talk with Lt. Herbert G. Markley, who has worked with the Watson team. Markley remembers one of them speaking of unusual radar returns from their equipment, but later the Watson personnel say that these were probably just “angels” (spurious echoes due to atmospheric microstructures, insects, equipment malfunction, or other stimuli). Markley does report that UFOs are seen around Holloman often. He himself has seen a disc in late August 1947 and flat, round aeroforms on at least two further occasions.

May 15 — During the Zebra nuclear detonation at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, a manned aircraft accidentally flies through the mushroom cloud. Because the pilot and crew “suffered no ill effects,” the Air Force decides that piloted aircraft could collect samples. The Los Alamos, New Mexico, personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones have apparently carried out the same procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffer radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who carries out the procedure for Yoke is then also found to have burns on his hands and is also hospitalized but is discharged on May 28.

June 16 — Soviet test pilot Arkady Ivanovich Apraksin is flying at an altitude of 6.5 miles above a solid layer of clouds south of the Kapustin Yar site, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia. He sees an unconventional aircraft in the shape of a cucumber with cones of light radiating from it descending across his path. The base tells him it has tracked the object on radar and given it instructions to land, but it does not respond. Apraksin is ordered to intercept it and open fire if it refuses to land. When he closes to within 6 miles, the light beams open up like a fan and shine into his aircraft, blinding him. The plane’s electrical systems malfunction. He glides the plane to a safe landing after the UFO disappears. Apraksin is interrogated heavily.

Early in 1978, Stringfield describes the humanoid found at the crash site as “about 4 feet, 6 inches tall, completely hairless, with hands that had no thumbs.” That description seems to fit the body shown in two photographs that are mailed to Willard F. McIntyre in December 1978. The body depicted in the photos sent to McIntyre has come to be known as the “Tomato Man” due to its large, roundish head. Many UFO researchers, including [Ron Schaffner](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.unknownexplorers.com/ronschaffner.php&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728439302&usg=AOvVaw3TdYrR-RfNhtAHdI7vx621) and [Kevin Randle](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_D._Randle&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728439525&usg=AOvVaw3WTKGmGRCWnNVgtkooSb7n), believe the body is that of a human pilot who is badly disfigured by intense heat following a plane crash. They argue that one of the photos shows a pair of eyeglasses, such as a human pilot would wear, near the body. (William S. Steinman and Wendelle C.

July 17 — 4:50 p.m. Two Kirtland AFB sergeants on a fishing trip with their families five miles south of San Acacia Diversion Dam, New Mexico, see a group of 7 aluminum-like, spherical objects approach from the south at 20,000 feet pass overhead at 1,500 mph.

July 29 — 9:18 a.m. James Toney and Robert Huggins, both employees of an Indianapolis, Indiana, rug cleaning firm, are in a truck headed west when they see a shiny, propeller-shaped, aluminum object with 10–12 small cups protruding from either blade. It is 6–8 feet long and flying silently above the trees at 30 feet altitude some 300 feet away heading south. It approaches to about 100 feet at its closest. The object glides across the road at 25–30 mph in a slight descent then makes a 20° bank to the east and goes down in a wooded area. Toney and Huggins stop the truck and get out to look, but the object has disappeared behind trees. A later search finds no traces.

August 21 — A possible Russian rocket trail is seen over Katrineholm, Sweden, that remains visible for three hours “resembling a brilliant star surrounded by streamers of fire like the tentacles of an octopus.” However, there is no known record of a launch on this date of a V-2 or R-1 missile from the Russian base at Kapustin Yar, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

September 16 — Before dawn. Fred Scott, 63, is walking around Grassy Mountain, Malheur County, Oregon, when he looks up and sees two “flying persons” to the south. They are 150–250 feet up, one following the other at a distance of 8–10 feet. Their wings are narrow and rounded at the tip and do not flap. Their legs are unusually short. They remain visible while Scott walks for at least another mile.

September 23 — 9:40 a.m. At Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, a group of people are waiting for an airplane at the landing strip when one of them notices something glint in the sun. It is a flat, circular object, high in the northern sky. The appearance and relative size is the same as a dime held edgewise and slightly tipped, about 50 feet away.

September 26 — 2:00 p.m. P. L. Lewis sees a white object moving rapidly across the sky at Port Hope, Ontario, then disappear when it is nearly overhead. Other white objects follow at about 50 mph in a northeasterly direction, accompanied by strands of spider web. Lewis speculates that the objects are balls of spiders’ threads, held together by thistledown. (P. R. Bishop, “Cobwebs or Flying Saucers?” Weather 4 (1949): 121–122; Philip J.

September 30? — Project Sign officer Capt. [Robert R.

Using the Chiles-Whitted case as the core and collecting around it many cases from the summer of 1947 to September 1948, Sneider composes the document. The most recent case known to have been listed in the document is the September 23 Los Alamos National Laboratory sighting in New Mexico. Two prominent USAF intelligence officers ([Ruppelt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_J._Ruppelt&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728464018&usg=AOvVaw39dACzomej1vceqriRX5Ds) and [Dewey J.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8653239/dewey-j_-fournet&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728464244&usg=AOvVaw2hDfPS9EJcnzZTes4g1prn) [Fournet](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nicap.org/ufochop2.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728464424&usg=AOvVaw2nQKAlBcCLM2-Eji8chtah) Jr.) see the document in 1952. “It was a rather thick document with a black cover and it was printed on legal-sized paper. Stamped across the front were the words TOP SECRET.” Ruppelt says the Estimate concludes that the best evidence indicated an extraterrestrial origin for UFOs. Sneider is probably the primary author.

October 1 — 8:30 p.m. 2d Lieut. [George F. Gorman](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/711216/george-f-gorman&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728470535&usg=AOvVaw2vJIFd2NPxzrpvFbTfm-ws) of the North Dakota National Guard, flying an F-51 near Fargo, North Dakota, spots an object traveling east to west. He describes it as a light 6–8 inches in diameter displaying incredible movements. He repeatedly gives chase beginning at 9:07 p.m., but each time is outmaneuvered by the light, which moves up to 600 mph. On his first pass he gets as close as 500 feet from the light at about 5,000 feet altitude. Gorman climbs to 14,000 feet but stalled out, unable to intercept the light, which is at about 16,000 feet. The light makes evasive and aggressive maneuvers, such as seeming to try to ram the F-51. When it drops to 11,000 feet, Gorman attempts to dive at it, but the light pulls up, rises vertically, and disappears at high speed.

The light is also seen by airport control tower operators [Lloyd D. Jensen](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.johnsoncountychapel.com/obituary/Lloyd-Jensen&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728470899&usg=AOvVaw1dKikAYpvo5pviMtsfbHn0) and Manuel E.

Late 1948 — The search for a suitable US location for nuclear testing, codenamed “Project Nutmeg,” commences under the direction of expert meteorologist and Navy Captain Howard B. Hutchinson. The government is looking for a place where nuclear tests would have little impact on the American people or the American economy. Five primary sites are considered: Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Alamogordo–White Sands Guided Missile Range, New Mexico; an area in Nevada between Fallon and Eureka; the Tonopah–Las Vegas Bombing and Gunnery Range (the site finally chosen in 1950, now part of Nellis Air Force Base); and the Pamlico Sound area off the coast of North Carolina.

November 24 — Writer Sidney Shalett has asked for USAF cooperation in writing an article on UFOs for the Saturday Evening Post.

November 30 — An interim report by Project Sign, one that apparently takes seriously the possibility that UFOs represent interplanetary probes, is accidentally destroyed.

December 10 — The revised Project Sign report is issued, Air Intelligence Report Number 100-203-79, “Analysis of Fly- ing Object Incidents in the U.S.” (AIR 203) \[Some copies are confusingly dated April 28, 1949.\] This is the cul- mination of Sign’s work since early August, augmented by ONI collaboration over the past two months. UFOs are not extraterrestrial (the idea is hardly noticed). UFOs are probably real, but if so, there is a small chance that they are Soviet and therefore dangerous.

He writes that the object moved far too slowly to have been a meteor and left no “trail of sparks or dust cloud” as would be typical of meteors flying at low altitudes. Other anomalous characteristics were the intense lime-green color, low altitude of only 8–10 miles yet exhibiting no sound, flat rather than arced trajectory, and turning on and off like a light switch. The interest in green fireballs inspires the creation of an informal group, the Los Alamos Astrophysical Association, whose members, all scientists and engineers with security clearances, are permitted to examine some classified Project Sign reports. This is essentially the beginning of Project Twinkle.

1949 — 1:00 a.m. A group of soldiers of the 2nd Armored Division stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, are tasked with standing guard over a plateau in a remote, fenced-off part of the base. After a few weeks, they see bright lights in the sky. They approach the plateau and descend slowly and silently. Suddenly, part of the plateau opens up and they can see light coming from inside. The lights descend into the opening, which closes over them. (Michael D. Swords, “Timmermania: A Step Too Far into the Timmerman Files?” IUR 27, no. 4 (Winter 2002–2003): 9; Michael D.

The object, seen through binoculars, seems as long as two Pullman cars, with 7 lighted, square windows. It is throwing sparks and approximately 8–10 miles away. In the first sighting at 10:20 p.m., the object approaches from the south going north, moving from an altitude of 8,000 feet in a gradual descent until lost behind trees. In the second sighting at 11:20 p.m., the object is seen in the north, heading south and making a gradual turn to the west. It descends then climbs with a bouncing motion (up 4,000 feet, down 2,000 feet) at about 400–500 mph, resulting in an overall climb and loss to view at an altitude of around 40,000 feet.

It makes a slight climbing turn to the north, shifts to peach color as it makes a rapid sharp turning climb to the south, disappearing in cloudless sky by diminishing in size and brightness. At the same time, 100 guards at Sandia Base, New Mexico, including the officer of the guard, see a yellow-orange cigar-shaped object for seven minutes.

February or March — 4:30 p.m. A representative of the International Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey, is driving noth along the Pan-American Highway about 6 miles south of Lima, Peru, when he sees a metallic disc hovering low above the desert on his right. He walks over to it, and three mummy-like creatures about 5 feet tall emerge. They speak to him in both English and Spanish, explaining to him that they come from another star system, are concerned about our use of atomic energy, use solar power, no longer have sex, and reproduce by subdividing. They invite him inside the disc, which from the inside has transparent walls. He sees no instruments, only a padded ledge. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, pp. 122–148)

April 27 — 9:20 p.m. Two Army patrolmen southeast of Killeen Base, Texas, see a blinking violet light no more than 1.5 inches in diameter and only 10–12 feet from them, 6–7 feet above the ground. During the 60-second observation, the light passes through the branches of a tree. At 9:25 p.m., 2 miles away, four Army soldiers see a 4-inch light with a 2–4-inch metallic cone attached to the back. It silently approaches them in a level flight at 60–70 mph. It disappears to the southwest at a distance of 150 feet. At about 9:37 p.m., a 2-inch-wide white light appears 100 feet away to the northwest, flying in a zig-zag fashion in a level path 6 feet above the ground. It vanishes abruptly. A third light shows up at 9:39 p.m. in the west-southwest.

It summarizes the history of Project Sign up to its redesignation as Grudge and adds an appendix on “Unidentified Aerial Objects: Fact and Discussion,” which is basically a short version of the sanitized February 11 Sign report, with some green fireball information added. It recommends sending reports of unidentified “light phenomena” to the scientific community and reports of “atomic powered craft of unusual design” to the AEC. It concludes that “There are numerous reports from reliable and competent observers for which a conclusive explanation has not been made” and that some “involve configurations and described performance which might conceivably represent an advanced aerodynamical development. A few unexplained incidents surpass these limits of credulity. It is unlikely that a foreign power would expose a superior aerial weapon by a prolonged ineffectual penetration of the United States.” This essentially resurrects the ETH as a possibility, without clearly stating it.

May 4 — The US Fourth Army creates an operational plan for a green fireball observation and tracking network at Killeen Base in Camp Hood, Texas. Although it lacks cameras, it has four six-man observation posts equipped with instruments to obtain directional bearings. One of the posts serves as the plotting center to coordinate and triangulate UFO sightings. Each day, a roving patrol gets new orders.

May 5 — 10:00 a.m. The Fourth US Army has approached AFOSI in San Antonio to offer assistance in investigating green fireballs and the Killeen lights. They arrange a meeting with AFOSI, ONI, CIC, the FBI, and the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Camp Hood, Killeen, Texas, the first of several weekly meetings. Army and Navy officials agree that the fireballs remain unexplained. AFSWP personnel believe they are natural phenomena; AFOSI and FBI give no opinion. The Fourth Army urges AFOSI to create an observation system, even though it had just secretly created one of its own on May 4.

May 6 — Soviet test pilot Arkady Ivanovich Apraksin takes a new airplane for a flight at the Kapustin Yar site, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia. At its maximum ceiling of 9.3 miles, he encounters a cucumber-shaped object, similar to the one he encountered on June 16, 1948, that directs cones of light at his aircraft from a distance of 6–7 miles. The lights cause his communications equipment to fail and damage part of his plexiglass cockpit canopy that results in a loss of air pressure. He manages to land on the banks of the Volga River 30 miles from Saratov. He wakes up in a hospital in Saratov. He again undergoes intense interrogation, psychotherapy, and medical procedures.

June 22 — Three women (one a schoolteacher, another a biologist working at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and a third who is the wife of a member of the Security Division, AEC, Oak Ridge) observe an odd trio of “flying saucers” for about 15 minutes: “It was described as consisting of two identical rectangular-shaped objects which appeared to be coordinated in movement and which moved in wave-like motion. The third object was circular in shape and appeared to be in level flight between and above the two rectangular objects. The rectangular objects appeared to be bright metal on top but dark underneath, while the color of the circular object was the same as that of frosted glass. The ‘flying saucer,’ when last sighted, was in level flight and was flying in a northwesterly direction. The weather was clear with high cumulus clouds. The ‘flying saucer’ flew at speed of from 10 to 15 mph over an area just about the center of Oak Ridge.” (Loren E. Gross, [UFOs, a History: 1949, January–June](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sohp.us/collections/ufos-a-history/pdf/GROSS-1949-Jan-Jun.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728616285&usg=AOvVaw0SqQud9u4p13iMQGQ1W_xl), The Author, 1988, pp. 83–84)

June 29 — 6:30 p.m. A former US Air Force tech sergeant observes three separate flights of three V-shaped or triangular objects from his front porch in Baltimore, Maryland. The objects veer sharply into a cloud at 2,500 feet altitude and then fly around it repeatedly. They have the ability to reverse their course 180° instantaneously. Through binoculars, they look like black, open boomerangs. More objects join them until there are 15–20, and he watches them for two hours. The formation moves from southeast to northeast and disappears. Fifteen other witness also see the display. (Marler 126–128)

He announces it over the PA system to the crowd of 150–200 observers, including pilots, who watch a metallic disc cross to the southeast with a falling-leaf motion. Estimated altitude is 30,000 feet at 300 mph, with the approximate size of 100 feet. A second object is seen at 10:49 a.m. for 2 minutes. A third sighting takes place at 11:25 a.m. An object approaches from the west at about the same altitude, oscillating at 48 per minute, and disappears into the sun.

July 24 — 12:03 p.m. Henry Clark, manager of a flying service, is flying a Piper PA-16 Clipper at 19,000 feet 10 miles northwest of Mountain Home, Idaho, when he sees a tight formation of 7 delta-shaped objects, 35–55 feet in diameter near his plane. They make a perfect and unbanked right turn 1,500 feet ahead of his plane, then they turn right again, passing the aircraft at about 450–500 mph.

Based on 237 cases, Hynek finds that 32% can be explained astronomically. Others say 12% are balloons, 33% are other misidentifications, hoaxes, or insufficient information. That leaves 23% (55) classed as unknowns. Despite this, witnesses are mostly deluded, hysterical, lying, or crazy, and “further study along present lines would only confirm the findings presented herein.” The report concludes there is little evidence to prove UFOs are real and do not represent a security threat. It recommends that press releases be created to “aid in dispelling public apprehension.” On the other hand, it suggests that military and government agencies interested in “psychological warfare” be informed of the findings. Appendix D is written by USAF Scientific Advisory Board member [George E.

September 1 — Col. John W. Schweizer of AFOIN writes to the director of USAF Intelligence: “reports that fall in the ‘fireball’ category will no longer be included in HQ Air Materiel Command and Directorate of Intelligence, HQ USAF, investigative activity on unidentified aerial incidents.” AMC hands green fireball reports over to the USAF Cambridge Research Laboratory at Hanscom AFB in Bedford, Massachusetts. AFOIN rejects an Army request for further facilities to study the green fireballs from field locations. (Clark III 543)

September 14 — 9:30–10:00 p.m. Two residents of Lubbock, Texas, see 9 clusters of objects “similar to ducks flying in formation,” bright silver and roughly round in shape. There are as many as 50 objects in all the formations except one. They seem to be traveling at 5,000 feet altitude, going north to south. Each light is visible for about 10 seconds, but it takes 30 minutes for all the objects to pass overhead. One witness is convinced the objects are ducks. (Clark III 692–693)

As the objects move, they give off a dazzling brilliance. They maintain a level flight with two of the objects changing positions as they fly. The power of the illumination remains constant throughout the incident (no pulses or flashes). Once the objects reach a direction northwest of the observers, they make a smooth 90° turn straight upwards and climb rapidly out of sight. Dean Wolfe is a recent graduate of a two-year course in aeronautical design and thinks the objects look like domed discs when viewed face forward, but are more like stubby, wingless, tailless fuselages when seen from the side.

Fall — A radar-tracking UFO case takes place at a key atomic base (probably Los Alamos, New Mexico). The base radar scope covers 200 miles of sky up to 100,000 feet. A legitimate radar contact tracks five apparently metallic objects at a great height moving south and crossing the radar scope in less than 4 minutes (an average of about 4,500 mph). (H. B.

Sgt. Berger turns on the light and picks up a large object in the beam. At about 10:00 p.m., the searchlight picks up two distinct groups of five triangular objects that seem to emerge from the main disc. They descend on the beam then turn out of it. The same performance is repeated 30 minutes later. About 50 persons, including newspaper reporters observe the objects. Miller takes several photographs and asks Sgt. Leo Davidson of the Norwood police department to film the display. He uses three rolls, 25 feet each, and a Hugo-Meyer F-19- 3" camera with telephoto lens. Davidson also takes 10 still photographs of the large disc-shaped object that flies in

December 2–3 — The US government releases radioactive fission products at the Hanford Site plutonium production facility in eastern Washington in an operation called Green Run. The radioisotopes are supposed to be detected by US Air Force reconnaissance. Sources cite 5,500–12,000 curies of iodine-131 are released and an even greater amount of xenon-133. The radiation is distributed over 500,000 acres encompassing three small towns and causes the cessation of intentional radioactive releases at Hanford until 1962, when more experiments commence. There are some indications that many other tests are conducted in the 1940s prior to Green Run, although this is a particularly large test. Evidence suggests that filters to remove the iodine are disabled during the test.

He hears a voice telling him not to be afraid and asking if he wants to know what it’s all about. Two beings about 5 feet 5 inches emerge from the UFO wearing togas and helmets. Restier asks them if they believe in God, and they answer, “God is one.” Encouraged, he enters the craft where he is offered a trip, put in a tub filled with liquid, and taken on a trip to a city on another world. He is shown a screen that depicts human nature, ambitions, and violence. After about 6 hours, he is returned to the spot where he was abducted. Returning to his father’s house, he finds it is April 14, 1950, and has lost nearly four months of earth time. (Brazil 23–24)

January 12 — 11:25 p.m. A B-29 aircraft is flying over the Gulf of Mexico (southwest of Florida) on a course of 260° when three objects are noted on the radar scope orbiting the B-29 from all quadrants. The objects are noticed by the radar operator, aircraft commander, navigator, and bombardier. One object is first sighted on a bearing of 330° traveling south. The objects travel across the scope in approximately 15–20 seconds on the 100-mile range setting. In a few minutes this object is joined by two others, which disappear in a few minutes. At short ranges the object is large and well-defined on the radar scope. The object goes off for about 100 miles, turns and comes in as

if for an attack, passes through the center of the scope, and emerges on the other side. The estimated speed of the object is 2,500–3,000 mph. The one object remains on the radar scope for approximately 30 minutes, following the B-29 all the time. The radar operator switches ranges on the scope and picks up the object on the 20- and 50- mile settings. Twice the object comes to within 20 miles of the aircraft and then apparently has the ability to hover, because the movement on the radar scope ceases for 5–15 seconds.

January 22 — 2:40 a.m. Navy patrol pilot Lieut. Smith makes a routine security flight out of Naval Air Station Kodiak \[now Coast Guard Base Kodiak\], Alaska. He obtains a radar reading on an object 20 miles north. It quickly vanishes. At 2:48, he tracks a similar object 10 miles southeast. Kodiak radar reports no known aircraft in the vicinity, but they are seeing the same track. At 3:00 a.m., the tug [USS Tillamook](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Tillamook_(ATA-192)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728666781&usg=AOvVaw3nU4nayD01ozqH0eD-Ekzc) is south of Kodiak when one of the men on deck sees a “very fast-moving red glow light, which appeared to be of exhaust nature.” The object comes from the southeast, moves clockwise around Kodiak, and returns to the southeast. Another officer sees it for 30 seconds and describes it as a “large ball of orange fire.” At 4:40 a.m., Lieut. Smith picks up another blip moving so fast that it leaves a trail on his screen. His crew sees the UFO close a five-mile gap in 10 seconds, an apparent speed of 1,800 mph. Witnesses report two orange lights that rotate around a common center. The object makes a sharp turn and heads directly towards Smith’s plane. Smith considers this a threatening situation and turns off his lights; the UFO flies by and disappears. At least 35 copies of Smith’s report are sent to FBI, CIA, AFOSI, and the State Department. None are ever officially released or published.

January 24 —4:50 p.m. USAF Capt. G. B. Edwards and copilot Theron C. Fehrevach are flying a C-45 transport plane from Pope AFB \[now Pope Field\], Fayetteville, North Carolina, to Bolling AFB \[now Joint Base Anacostia- Bolling\], Washington, D.C. While at 5,000 feet near Blacksburg, Virginia, Fehrevach notices a dark, 200–250 foot in diameter, hemispherical parachute-shaped object above them about 5–10 miles away. A large black smoky region is below it, possibly obscuring the lower portion of a sphere. The UFO is darker than the 50% cloud cover and “easy to distinguish as not being cloud.” The object moves smoothly without any noticeable turn radius.

Edwards puts the C-45 into a climb to 7,000 feet so they are at the same altitude as the UFO and turns to head directly toward it. Army Courier Service passenger 1st Lt. [John H.

The CAA has already received about 20 other reports about it from Vandalia, Ohio. ATIC control tower operators at Wright- Patterson AFB pick it up visually and on radar (“a good, solid target”). Four F-51 interceptors are sent up. They see it as a huge, round, metallic object, but clouds move in. The object climbs vertically out of sight at high speed.

McCarthy, and Cpl. Melton observe an intermittent target on the height range indicator (HRI) scope of the CPS-4 radar at 47,000 feet altitude and higher. Further indications of what Parker describes as a well-defined, clear target like an aircraft are picked up with increasing regularity over the next 45–60 minutes. During this time, the target seems to stay in the area where the F-80s are flying, but 20,000 feet above them. The radar operators are monitoring two different systems—a CPS-5 radar operating on long-wave frequencies at 40,000 feet, and a CPS-4 radar operating on short-wave frequencies—and the target appears on both scopes simultaneously without fade. The speed varies from a hover in low-density air to nearly 1,500 mph, well in excess of the fastest operational jet at the time, and a climb rate of up to 7,000 feet per minute.

He drives through a wooded area between Morton and Mineral and decides to stop to take a break. On foot, he comes upon a large, globe-shaped craft hovering above a clearing. Naked children with dark tans and blond hair are playing on steps that lead from an open door to the side of the UFO. Several naked adults—humanoid, attractive, and also deeply tanned—then appear at the ship’s door. After realizing that Thompson means them no harm, they beckon him closer. The crew consists of 20 adults and 25 children, the latter from about 5–15 years of age. Thompson claims to have spent the next 40 hours with the humanoids. They are from Venus, he learns, and have stopped at Earth despite the fact that other Venusian saucers have been shot at by Earth-based military forces. The Venusians further claims that they are vegetarian and that they never grow ill. Thompson also claims the Venusians are naïve and childlike; they do not know who has built their flying saucers and seem to possess little to no curiosity. He goes back to get a camera and tries to take photos, but the object is too bright to appear on film. Thompson returns home on March 30.

May 15 — Afternoon. Architect Enrique Carotenuto Bossa is driving in an isolated region in Bahía Blanca Partido (possibly between Macachín and Estación Hidalgo Ferrocarril Sarmiento), La Pampa, Argentina, when he sees a metallic disc resting on the ground to the left of the highway. He stops the car to investigate, approaches it, and sees an open door in its side. He goes inside and sees a “curved divan with three seats, two of which were occupied by small beings covered from head to foot (except for an opening for the face (in a kind of tight-fitting overall of a brown color.” The bodies are about 4 feet tall, and their faces seem charred or burnt. In front of them is a screen with “rays playing on it,” and on top of the screen is a rotating globe. The engineer runs out and drives back to his hotel. He returns the next day with two companions and finds only an ash heap. But they look up and see three UFOs—one a cigar-shaped object and two discs, hovering above them at 1,800 feet. The discs merge

About 7 miles west of Mount Vernon, Virginia, Gates alerts Sperry to a bright blue or bluish light ahead of them and increasing in size. Sperry makes an evasive 45° turn to the right and the object passes from 11 o’clock to 7 o’clock position to the left at a slightly higher altitude. The light very briefly passes between the aircraft and the upper part of the moon, revealing an object with a long silhouette (somewhat reminiscent of a submarine) without visible wings or empennage. The blue light is on the front of the object. Sperry turns left back onto his original course to get the object back in view, but it apparently stays stationary for about 30 seconds. Gates then notices the object circling around to the right side. Sperry banks right again, while the object paces the airliner about 20–30 seconds before it climbs to the east at a 30° angle at “fantastic” speed and disappears.

May 29 — A shiny, bright object streaking across the sky is spotted by two cine-theodolite stations at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, just before firing a test missile. The object is tracked and photographed by both stations. After the films are developed, it turns out that the stations had photographed different objects. Analysts estimate that the objects were higher than 40,000 feet, traveling more than 2,000 mph, and over 300 feet in diameter.

June 17 — Oskar Linke and his 11-year-old daughter Gabriele are walking toward Haselbach, Thuringia, East Germany, in the twilight when she notices something about 420 feet away. It appears to be two men dressed in shiny metallic clothing who are stooped over and looking at something on the ground. Linke approaches to 30 feet away, looks over a small fence, and sees a large object about 40 feet in diameter that looks like a huge frying pan. It has two rows of holes in its periphery and a black conical tower about 9 feet high. The two men suddenly jump inside. The inside lights up, the object starts humming and rises slowly from the ground, rotating like a top. It rises from the ground with the aid of a central cylinder and is surrounded by flames, then takes off in the direction of Stockheim. Later he finds a circular depression in the ground at the spot. Linke resettles in West Berlin in 1951. He tells his story to a notary there on July 1, 1952, which is how it turns up in the Western press and explains a confusion in the date of the sighting.

July — Mid-day. Electronics engineer Cliff Booth is having lunch in his office at a private contractor’s building at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, when he gets a call that a UFO has been reported by one of the range stations. Booth and an Askania cinetheodolite operator are asked to drive to another range station with a manually operated Askania and look for the object. Through the finders on the theodolite the object presents a side view to the observers and appears to be cigar-shaped and metallic, with a straw-colored iridescent radiance or luster. It also has fins one-third of the way back from the front of the fuselage and a row of at least three oblong ports extending to the rear of the object and located above the center line of the fuselage. The ports are a dark smoky gray but not luminescent. The object hovers in an almost horizontal position, elevation 20°–25°, azimuth northeast. Shortly after the men focus the instrument on the object to take a film, it begins maneuvering. Turning toward the camera, the object moves in, and the men can see the front—a round shape with the fins extending out from the sides. It then drops abruptly, as though beginning to fall, but stops. It moves toward the camera, turns sideways, then drops as before, but this time it exposes the side view again. The operator leaves to report the coordinates to headquarters, and when he returns the object is gone. The men turn over their exposed film to the Data Reduction Division for development and analysis. A week or so later they are called in and questioned by a young first lieutenant unknown to them who asks them over and over again if they have taken pictures and to describe the object they had seen. Then they are asked if they can identify the film of the object they photographed. One of the men becomes angry about the questioning, telling the officer he had seen what he reported, had photographed the object, and is convinced it is some sort of a vehicle from outer space. He is shown a film of 14 frames on a Recordak projector. The black-and-white presentation shows a blurred ellipsoid with a dark center, but no

details. (Puzzled about the film, he later talks to a mathematician-analyst employed by Land-Air, Inc.; she conjectured the object had been oscillating in the air, preventing a stable image.) The men are then told by their superiors to forget the whole thing.

July — 1:45 p.m. A Civil Aviation Authority flight engineer observes a “wingless, fuselage-shaped” object maneuvering over Cincinnati, Ohio. The object climbs at a steep angle to 16,000–18,000 feet, hesitates, dives, and speeds away to the west.

July 2 — Dusk. While picnicking on the shore of Sawbill Bay on Marmion Lake, western Ontario, an anonymous employee of the Steep Rock Iron Mine claims to have seen a UFO resting on the water’s surface. A hatch opens and 10 figures, 3–4 feet tall, emerge, wearing shiny, metallic clothing. They seem to be drawing in lake water with a hose. The object soon rises and hovers, then swiftly takes off. The story appears in the mine’s house newsletter, then gets picked up by some Canadian newspapers and Fate magazine in its February/March 1952 issue. However, Robert Badgley, a Scarborough, Ontario, member of APRO, finds in 1974 that Steep Rock employee Gordon Edwards had written the fictitious tale to entertain readers of the newsletter and to satirize saucer stories.

He walks up to the grandstand and notices two fast-moving bright lights “like two new dimes in the sky.” He rushes to his car, parked 60 feet away, and gets his 16mm movie camera from the glove compartment. He films the objects passing behind a water tower, which provides a frame of reference for measuring distance, size, altitude, azimuth, and speed. In October he takes it to an Air Force officer for analysis. USAF notes that two jet interceptors were in the area and might be the objects on the film, but Mariana and Raunig had seen those too. Controversy soon arises when Mariana claims that the first 35 frames of his film—which he says most clearly show the UFOs as rotating disks—are missing. People in the Great Falls area who view Mariana’s film support him. They claim that the missing frames clearly show the UFOs as spinning, metallic disks with a “notch or band” along their outer edges. USAF personnel deny this accusation and insist that they have removed only a single frame of film that was damaged in the analysis. In 1952, Blue Book reviews the film; so does [Robert M. L.

August 30 — 10:45 a.m. During a Bell Aircraft MX-776 Shrike missile test (for the later Rascal air-to-ground strategic missile) a USAF M/Sgt and eight Bell Aircraft employees at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, see two glaringly bright circular or elliptical objects maintaining relative position to each other following the B-50 Superfortress launch aircraft from above on both the dry run and hot run prior to missile release. The objects give a “strong glare at all times” (not reflected sunlight), maneuver at high estimated speeds up to 10 times the B-50 (roughly 2,500 mph) for short distances, leave no vapor trails, hover, accelerate rapidly, and make abrupt “square” turns with apparent size changing to indicate ascent and descent.

August 31 — 10:00 a.m.–1:00 p.m. After V-2 missile launch no. 51 at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, Project Twinkle cinetheodolite crews track and film multiple objects sporadically several times from different directions at very high speeds over the course of 3 hours. Cinetheodolite station P-5 films an object using a one-frame-per-second 60 cm focal length camera with 35 mm color film. Frames 593 and 595 (2 seconds of nearly 10 minutes of film) show its elevation angle changing. An attempted interception by four F-86 jets from Kirtland AFB for one hour fails to locate the objects, which apparently return after the jets leave. Cinetheodolite observers note an object

September — 7:00 a.m. Three US Navy planes on a combat mission 100 miles south of the Yalu River in Korea are approached from below by two huge discs, at least 600–700 feet in diameter, traveling at 1,000–1,200 mph. The radar shows them as 1.5 miles away. Suddenly the objects halt, back up, and begin a jittering motion, keeping pace with them, circling above and below. When one pilot readies his guns, the aircraft radar goes haywire, apparently jammed. His radio transmitter is blocked by a buzzing noise. The discs are silvery and shaped like a “coolie’s hat, with oblong ports from which emanated a copper-green colored light which gradually shifted to pale pastel-colored lights.” A shimmering red ring circles the top portion of the disc. The objects soon speed away in the direction from which they had come.

September — The first US Army large-scale aerosol vulnerability test occurs in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, using two types of bacteria (Bacillus globigii and Serratia marcescens) and fluorescent particles. Six simulated attacks are conducted, with the conclusion that it is feasible to attack a seaport city with biological aerosol agents from a ship offshore. The first open-air tests with biological simulants are conducted in 1950 in various locales, one of which is off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia.

September 26 — 10:00 p.m. Policemen John Collins and Joseph Keenan are patrolling on Vare Avenue near 26th Street in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when they see something like a parachute drifting down ahead of them at treetop level. It is about 6 feet in diameter and settles in an open field. After summoning Sgt. Joseph Cook and Patrolman James Casper, they go into the field to investigate. When they turn their flashlights on it, it gives off a purplish glow, “almost a mist, that looked as though it contained crystals.” Collins touches it and it dissolves in his hand, leaving an odorless, sticky residue. It completely evaporates in 25 minutes. This event inspires producer [Jack H.

Weather Bureau observer Gene Fowler, [Winfield Henry](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/61621047/winfield-d-henry&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728834986&usg=AOvVaw1uZchkzKHs6c0KJwDTJZgN) of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, and Gordon Moore and Chet Fuqua, ground personnel at Western Airlines, go up to the roof of the airport administration building for a better look. Fowler is able to watch it through a theodolite used for weather balloons for 8 minutes. He says, “The azimuth reading changed from 147 degrees to 161 degrees during that period and went up seven degrees vertically.” The Rapid City weather bureau and Aberdeen CAA in South Dakota estimate the object is 40–50 miles northwest of Bismarck, North Dakota. The object reappears at 1:30 a.m. and is visible, sometimes hovering, until 3:00 a.m. when it disappears to the northwest. In Aberdeen, CAA aircraft communicator William B. Hiller sees a star-like object at 2:00 a.m. and watches it for 90 minutes. It changes colors, glowing white, green, and red alternately.

December 5 — Engineer Lt. Col. John R. Hood disperses radiation counters around the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, National Laboratory’s restricted area. The intent is to map the presence of any unusual radiation, in the wake of numerous UFO reports over the facility. He also sets up a source of radioactive material to see if its presence has an effect on the air above it. If the air is unusually ionized, it might be the source of the anomalous radar targets. He also mentions using a magnetometer array, but there is no documentation of the result of this effort. (Loren E.

December 27 — Sunset. A TWA flight, piloted by Capt. Art Shutts, is enroute from Chicago to Kansas City. Near Bradford, Illinois, Shutts notices a bright white light ahead of the plane, also flashing red and green occasionally. It begins to “wobble and swerve unsteadily,” then streaks back and forth in a north-south line through an arc of 10–30°, changing direction abruptly. He notices that the horizon near the UFO appears to vibrate as if light is distorted, especially after the object puts on a burst of speed. It dims to a pinpoint and begins to slowly move south. Suddenly it lurches, accelerates rapidly, zooms upward at a 45° angle, makes a nearly square turn, plunges downward, and disappears below the horizon to the north. It is visible for 25 minutes.

As they approach and fly under the balloon, they notice the object descend to the balloon’s level and grow larger in apparent size until about one-quarter to one-half the size of the 70-foot balloon.

It is about 400 feet in diameter and first seen moving above the surface of the ocean. As the plane approaches, the object changes colors, executes a sudden 180° turn and disappears over the horizon. Over time, several attempts to disguise the participants have resulted in confusion over the date.

February 19 — 7:20 a.m. Capt. Jack Bicknell and Radio Officer D. W. Merrifield are flying a Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar aircraft out of Nairobi, Kenya, when they see a bright object hanging motionless about 10,000 above Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanganyika \[now Tanzania\]. They watch it for 3 minutes, then tell the passengers about it. Bicknell observes it through binoculars and sees a “metallic, bullet-shaped object which must have been over 200 feet long.” It has a vertical fin at one end, and at regular intervals along the fuselage are vertical dark bands. It remains completely stationary for 17 minutes. Two passengers take photos of it. Then it begins rising and moving eastward, disappearing at 40,000 feet. It leaves no vapor trail.

He says the “Navy report is erroneous. It lulls people into a false sense of security.” He reminds the nation of the critical installations in New Mexico, including Los Alamos, and argues that they are a target of reconnaissance: “If they were launched by a foreign power, then they could lead to a worse Pearl Harbor than we have ever experienced.” He blasts the US government for a policy of “suicide by secrecy.” The FBI and Air Force mull prosecuting Mirarchi for violating AFR 205-1.

The article is based on Liddel’s study in ONR’s Research Reviews in March. He claims to have studied “hundreds” of sightings in detail (probably from Project Grudge). As for UFOs sighted by Skyhook scientists themselves, he discounts them because these technicians are not aware of mirages and internal reflections in optical devices.

It looks like a car headlight 5 feet off the ground, three times. Jeston Reid said his father had seen the light in the 1870s.

March 14 — A group of nine Bell Aircraft engineers are flying at 15,000 feet in a B-50 Superfortress near Holloman AFB, New Mexico, during a test of a secret Bell aircraft. They spot a group of unknown objects flying in a confusing “swirl” that breaks into a V-formation and back to a “swirl,” then a V again. The objects are slightly higher than the aircraft and seem to be moving at high velocity. The engineers insist the objects are not geese, which actually can fly this high. (This may be the same incident as the August 30, 1950, case at Holloman.) (Loren E.

March 15 — 10:20 a.m. George F. Floate, chief engineer of the Delhi Flying Club, and two assistants observe a swirly white cloud moving from north to south at about 4,000 feet altitude near the club’s hanger in New Delhi, India. The cloud is about 700 feet in length. At the end of it a bullet-shaped object appears, approximately 100 feet long and as big around as a C-47 fuselage. The witnesses shout out, and 17–20 people rush out of the hanger and see the object. It heads south for about 3 minutes where it makes an apparent loop, coming back over the field. At the top of the loop it is out of sight, but it is seen again in its dive. After recovering straight and level flight, the UFO proceeds to the southwest until it is lost to sight. Its speed is estimated at three times greater than the cruising speed of a British Vampire jet. The total duration is about 7 minutes.

the Director of Central Intelligence, or their designated representatives. The board’s first director is [Gordon Gray](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gray_(politician)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728877214&usg=AOvVaw2ayfFI9bMNuS1MCyki4w3C)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gray_(politician)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728877495&usg=AOvVaw3U5dFnOj8JLKztE6lQipqd) later National Security Advisor during the Eisenhower administration. The board is created in response to the growth of Office of Policy Coordination covert activities during the Korean War. The PSB is tasked with creating propaganda that will subconsciously turn people away from communism and toward democracy. It is abolished in 1953.

April 21 — Drones are again used in the series of thermonuclear tests designated Operation Greenhouse at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. During the Easy detonation, two T-33 drones are lost. One receives heavy damage from the shock wave, loses control, and crashes; the other refuses to respond to control signals and crashes on uninhabited Bogullua Island. The Air Force concludes that unmanned samplers are unreliable. (M/Sgt Leland B.

June 1 — 10:00 p.m. An ATIC official at Wright-Patterson AFB is driving west near Dayton, Ohio, when he sees a large, bluish-white light moving parallel to the car.

Its speed is “faster than an airplane, slower than a meteor.” (UFOEv, [p. 23](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id%3Dmdp.39015006091691%26view%3D1up%26seq%3D35%26skin%3D2021&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728888388&usg=AOvVaw1cvdLQGrcDpEgeafaF3_wU))

June 19 — Day. Mechanic Joseph Matiszewski hears a whistling sound as he is walking in Sønderborg, Denmark, and sees an object land in a nearby meadow. Approaching to within 150 feet of it, he finds himself paralyzed and notices that birds have stopped singing and cows seem frozen in place. Four men with brown skin and wearing black shiny suits and translucent helmets emerge from the object and send Matiszewski some telepathic messages. Eight smaller objects are ejected from the large one and float above it. Other figures inside the craft and on its deck appear to be making repairs. The objects ascend to about 300 feet and climb rapidly after that. The paralysis subsides.

July — The radiation-counter network set up at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, in December 1950 by Lt. Col. John R. Hood hits paydirt when a UFO appears, sighted both visually and on radar over the facility. He finds that the radiation counters have detected a significant rise in some kind of emission.

ATIC examines the photos and notes that the “two rows of spots behaved differently. One row only shows slight variation from a precise V formation throughout, whereas the other now appears to pass from above the first row, through it to a position below.” Biologist [James Cecil](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://swco-ir.tdl.org/handle/10605/7399&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728913554&usg=AOvVaw15vae6ZobcoJPmmpexT5Os) [Cross](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/105726781/james-cecil-cross&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728913891&usg=AOvVaw2JUHkLBg9iCTOOnksTGMW0) looks at the Lubbock photos under a microscope and rules out the bird explanation. See also Life, Apr. 7, 1952. While investigating the Lubbock Lights, [Ruppelt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_J._Ruppelt&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728914324&usg=AOvVaw2BLR0R_kHwBwwXMOq5qOiQ) also learns that several people in and around Lubbock claim to have seen a “flying wing” moving over the city. Among the witnesses is the wife of Dr. [Ducker](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://swco-ir.tdl.org/handle/10605/7356&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728914641&usg=AOvVaw2jhOEmiw6mjZDp4TcSIKoz)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://swco-ir.tdl.org/handle/10605/7356&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728914802&usg=AOvVaw2tu2QFQqwYGNrWPIHb7-to) who reports that in August 1951 she observed a “huge, soundless flying wing” pass over her house.

Ruppelt knows that USAF does possess a “flying wing” jet bomber, and he feels that at least some of the sightings are caused by the bomber, although he cannot explain why, according to the witnesses, the wing makes no sound as it flies overhead. Ruppelt says that in addition to Project Grudge investigators, another group of people who, “because of their association with the government, had complete access to our files” (scientists convinced of the ETH) were also looking into the Lubbock cases. In March 1955, Ducker sends Ruppelt a telegram indicating that he has figured out that the lights are a “natural phenomenon” and requests no further publicity in his book.

However, Texas Tech mathematics professor [Ralph Sylvester Underwood](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/183461956/ralph-sylvester-underwood&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728915309&usg=AOvVaw2osiXoWnhbdN7_7vN86CZg) has also observed three flights and estimates the objects are at 2,000 feet altitude and flying at 700 mph—much too fast for birds.

August 31 — 12:45 p.m. Mrs. Tom Tilson and one or two other women are driving north on Hwy 70 near Matador, Texas, when they see to the west a pear-shaped object the length of a B-29 fuselage (100 feet). It is aluminum or silver-yellow with a port or some type of aperture on the side, and it moves with its smaller end forward, drifting slowly at about 150 feet altitude. It then shoots up in a circular fashion and out of sight after a few seconds.

September — 9:00 p.m. Louise McDougall is sitting on the lawn outside her trailer park in Bloomington, California, when she has the feeling someone is watching her. She looks up and sees a flying saucer hovering some 20 feet up. It is lenticular, perhaps 100 feet in diameter, and dull silver metallic in appearance. There are tall, rectangular windows in its lower half, in which can be seen against an amber glow four men, in one-piece “jump suits,” with shoulder- length hair. She turns a spotlight on the saucer, whereupon it shoots off silently at incredible speed. About 15 minutes later it returns, hovering in the same spot, the figures still visible at the windows. After 6 or 7 minutes, it takes off again to the southeast. McDougall’s husband and three other people also see it.

September 6 — The Air Force issues JANAP 146(B), “Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings from Aircraft.” All UFO reports are to go to the Air Defense Command in the Pentagon (which presumably will send them to AMC at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio), the Secretary of Defense, and to the nearest US military command.

September 10 — 11:10 a.m. At the Army Signal Corps radar center at Fort Monmouth \[now closed\], New Jersey, a student operator demonstrating radar functions to a group of visiting officers picks up a target that is moving too fast to be tracked automatically. The object seems to be following the coastline. He follows it off and on for 3 minutes, after which it disappears to the northeast, flying at 700 mph. About 25 minutes later, a T-33 jet trainer piloted by Lt. [Wilbert S. Rogers](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/190765231/wilbert-s-rogers&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728920461&usg=AOvVaw17Rnns67dHUrYoVewt79QU)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/190765231/wilbert-s-rogers&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728920640&usg=AOvVaw39ODka8Yi3sU1A5Tv73nz1) with Maj. Edward Ballard as passenger, spots a “silver-colored object about the size of a fighter plane” flying at 900 mph at 5,000–8,000 feet over Sandy Hook.

September 18 — 10:20 p.m. USAF B-36 radar operator Maj. Paul E. Gerhart and navigator Maj. Charles J. Cheever are flying northwest at 239 mph over the Hudson Strait in northern Canada when they pick up radar interference coming from an unidentified aircraft moving away from them to the east about 32 miles away. The anti-jamming device on their radar is turned on at 11:20 p.m. but does not affect the jamming on the radar scope. At 11:35 p.m., a UFO is seen visually on the right side of the B-36, which is flying at 18,000 feet over southwest Baffin Island, Nunavut. The object has all-white “unconventional running lights” and two white flashing tail lights, travels about 35 mph faster than the B-36, crosses the front from right to left heading toward the north-northwest, and is in view about 20 minutes. While the object is still visible at 11:50 p.m., the B-36 autopilot and APQ-24 radar set

November 27 — Geophysicist Louis Elterman releases the final report on Project Twinkle. Basically, it admits that the low frequency of occurrence of the fireballs does not justify the $50,000 a year required for a useful monitoring facility. It speculates that “the earth may be passing through a region in space of high meteoric population.

1952

1952 — The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is established in Livermore, California, as an offshoot of the UC Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley. It is intended to spur innovation and provide competition to the nuclear weapon design laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

Delgado is reticent discussing his experiments on humans. He is more enthusiastic recalling research

on monkeys, chimpanzees, and gibbons, which he kept both at Yale and in open-air compounds in the Bahamas and New Mexico. He explores the effects of stimulation not only on individuals but also on groups. In one demonstration, he implants a stimoceiver (a tiny electrode able to receive and transmit signals over FM radio waves) in a macaque who terrorizes his cage-mates. Delgado installs a lever in the cage that, when pressed, activates the stimoceiver in the bully and pacify him. A female in the cage soon figures out the lever’s significance and yanks it often and with gusto.

1952? — An anonymous occupation soldier in Austria meets a diving suit–clad being who paralyzes him, pulls him inside a UFO, and flies him to an otherworldly place he takes to be Mars. He sees other humans who do not acknowledge him. Then he is returned to his base. (Prince George (B.C.) Citizen, December 11, 1957; Clark 2)

1952 — 6:30 a.m. A carpool of people on their way to work at United Airlines in San Mateo, California, observe five smaller objects merging with a much larger, diamond-shaped object. The big one is about 150–200 feet long, charcoal or gunmetal in color, and is hovering 50–75 feet above some salt flats. The UFOs are directly in front of them to the east, about 1,500–1,800 feet away. One of the witnesses, airplane mechanic [Leonard L. Musel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/106575158/leonard-l-musel&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889728964818&usg=AOvVaw3PttM_JKKioeKJLZ4NjsSL), said the smaller objects entered the large object through a “transparent tail or sleeve.” After they were aboard, the bigger UFO turned edgewise and zoomed off at a fantastic speed. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Satellite Objects: A Further Look,” IUR 29, no. 2 (Summer 2004): 7)

1952 — Night. USAF Pvt. Sinclair Taylor is on guard duty at Camp Okubo in Uji, on the southern outskirts of Kyoto, Japan, when he hears flapping sounds and sees what seems to be an enormous bird. As it gets closer to him, Taylor sees that it is a winged man well over 7 feet tall with a wingspread of 7 feet. Taylor fires at it repeatedly with his rifle and thinks he hit it, but he can’t find the body. (Clark III 778)

Soon, a man claiming to have an intelligence background becomes an active supporter and tries to lead the Lorenzens into “metaphysical areas of research.” Coral Lorenzen rebuffs these attempts. She discovers what seem to be the impressions of an intelligence report about her on one of his letters. In the summer, two suspicious men posing as building contractors seem to be lurking around her home as well as the homes of the APRO treasurer and secretary the same day.

January — Some 74% of the CIA’s money goes toward covert operations. It has already infiltrated many US labor, business, church, university, student, and cultural groups, usually channeling the money through foundations.

It passes north of their position, traveling horizontally and silently, and disappears in the west. They notice it has a long blue tail. It travels underneath low cloud cover at 4,700 feet at 1,400 mph.

January 21 — 9:50 a.m. A Navy pilot lieutenant commander in a TBM Avenger chases a white, dome-shaped object over Mitchel AFB \[now closed\] on Long Island, New York. It accelerates rapidly, makes a 180° turn, and heads out to sea. He estimates it is traveling at least at 300 mph. It looks like a parachute canopy and has a dark undersurface.

January 22 — 12:20 a.m. At a northern Alaska outpost, Murphy Dome Air Force Station, radar captures a UFO traveling 1,500 mph at 23,000 feet. When an F-94 is sent to intercept, the target stops, slows down, reverses course, and heads directly for the radar station. It comes within 30 miles, then disappears from the screen. The F-94 heads back to refuel, and a second fighter is scrambled. This pilot gets a strong radar return. At first, the object is almost stationary, but then it dives suddenly, at which point ground radar picks it up again. A third F-94 is sent up, also tracks the object on radar, and closes to within 900 feet. At this point, the pilot pulls away to avoid a collision, as the UFO is nearly immobile. Since none of the pilots obtained a visual sighting, the Air Force concludes that the radar returns are weather-related, although the pilots strongly dispute this.

At this meeting, Garland introduces a new intelligence policy that emphasizes the use of instrumentation for intelligence collection, including the detection and tracking of UFOs (the basis for terminating Project Blue Book as an intelligence function). As an interim last-chance measure to prove whether anecdotal sightings have any value, Garland approves Ruppelt’s publicity plan to draw in UFO reports from the public so that triangulations might be obtained. This leads to Garland secretly backing the Life magazine article. Apparently on the same day, Garland gives the welcoming address to the secret MIT Lincoln Laboratory (Ruppelt calls it the Beacon Hill group) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he tells the assembled scientists to study ways USAF intelligence methodology can be revolutionized through the use of technology.

March or April — 5:00 a.m. Two women cryptographers in the US Naval Reserve stationed at the US Naval Training Center at Port Deposit, Maryland, are out taking a walk outside the base on a dirt road. They notice a red light off to one side above the trees. It starts moving toward them and stops about 100 feet above the road in front of them, about 300 feet away. The object is a 250-foot black disc with two large red lights at each side, an illuminated

March 29 — Two fiery discs are sighted over the uranium mines in the southern part of the Belgian Congo near Elisabethville \[modern Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo\]. With a diameter of approximately 36– 45 feet, they travel in a precise and light manner, both vertically and horizontally. They emit hissing and buzzing sounds. Changes in elevation from 2,400 to 3,000 feet are accomplished in a few seconds. The discs often move down to within 60 feet of the treetops. A Commander Pierre of the Belgian Air Force sets out in pursuit in a fighter plane from the city airport. On his first approach he comes to within about 260 feet of one of the discs.

Suddenly they hover in one spot then takes off in a unique zigzag flight to the northeast at an estimated speed of 930 mph. Pierre gives up his pursuit after about 15 minutes.

March 29 — 10:45 p.m. Donald F. Stewart and George Tyler III are driving northbound on the Governor Ritchie Highway in Glen Burnie, Maryland. A 50-foot silvery domed disc with two portholes and an apparent hatch appears from the northeast and hovers above their car, causing the engine to fail, magnetizing the wiring, and cracking the paint. Stewart takes a sub-machine gun from the back of the car and debates whether to fire it at the object, which remains in view for 3 minutes before turning n its edge and speeding away to the southwest. Tyler changes his story later, denying he was involved. Possible hoax.

March 31 — Battelle begins its UFO study (referred to as P-47S and nicknamed Little Stork) under the supervision of William T.

April 25 — 11:00 a.m. A biochemist and a bacteriologist are driving to their office in San Jose, California, when they see a metallic-looking disc rotating around a vertical axis and wobbling. It is moving slowly over the office and is about 4–5 feet in diameter. It flies in a slow arc. Then they see a black object hovering at a high altitude under an overcast. This one is about 100 feet in diameter. Two identical objects come into view out of the clouds. The three objects “jittered about like boats in a stream.” Then the small disc stops spinning, hovers, then shoots upwards, followed by one of the black objects. The remaining two objects linger another minute or so, then take off separately. The episode lasts 15 minutes. The biochemist calls Moffett Field in Santa Clara County, but hangs up before reporting the sighting, which they describe as a “most disturbing experience.” The object “utilized some propulsion method not in the physics books.” (NICAP, “[Scientist Sighting / Extraordinary Propulsion Implied](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/520425sanjose_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889729039627&usg=AOvVaw1wkfOmY09bQshXVgNlB2T9)”; Richard H.

May — Army radar specialist Jay Nogle is stationed near Washington, D.C., when he picks up an unknown target on his M33 scope at an altitude of 18,000 feet about 130 miles from the capital (which would put it over eastern Pennsylvania). Two other Army units also detect the object, which remains stationary for 30 minutes before moving. By the time the object reaches the edge of the radar scope, it is traveling at 1,000 mph. The report goes all the way to the Pentagon, where orders are given to fire on it if it returns. Nogle says that radar targets are frequently seen in May or June, and units have their antiaircraft guns loaded after the first incident. When fighters are scrambled from McGuire AFB \[now part of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst\] in Burlington County, New Jersey, the targets move speedily out of range. (Swords 153)

May 1 — 1:45 p.m. Albuquerque Journal composing room employee Eugene Cline sees four silvery objects seemingly playing tag with a formation of 12 Air Force bombers—either B-29s or B-50s—flying west over Albuquerque, New Mexico. The round objects are keeping up with the planes at the same altitude, moving in a “tumbling or pitching manner.” One object shoots straight up and takes off in a southerly direction. About the same time, workmen (one of them Howard Burgess) erecting an antenna at nearby Sandia Base watch three UFOs pass directly overhead. One comes from the west and moves south; another comes from the north and moves south;

and a third, tan-colored rather than silver like the others, passes low overhead and looks like a “cylinder tumbling end over end.” Burgess and the others are debriefed and sworn to secrecy about what they have witnessed.

May 7 — 4:30 p.m. Magazine writer Ed Keffel, in the company of João Martins, takes five photographs of a UFO over Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the first, the UFO resembles an airplane coming directly toward them over a large group of trees. The second shows the object as disc-shaped. The third photo is taken as the object tilts slightly, showing both the top with a slight dome and the now obvious disc shape. More trees, including a very tall palm, can be seen in the photograph. The fourth picture, taken as the object tilts the other way, shows a raised ring on the bottom. The final picture is taken as the object is nearly vertical, seen over part of the ocean and some distant hills. The UFO disappears shortly afterward. NICAP does not see any negatives and is skeptical. The Colorado project finds a “glaring internal inconsistency” in the illumination and dismisses the photos as hoaxes. Today, the best evidence seems to suggest the case is a hoax, perpetrated by two magazine writers who wanted an interesting story.

May 12 — 8:45 p.m. A UFO is seen by Walker AFB T/Sgt. Raymond Bare in a car in downtown Roswell, New Mexico. The object is blue-green in color, and its estimated altitude above the terrain is 20,000–30,000 feet. It appears to be about 40–50 miles distant over some low mountains east of Ruidosa. The object travels three times over approximately the same south-to-north / east-to-west, swaying, triangular course.

After a while he begins to follow it, and after he crosses the Los Angeles River and turns onto Forest Lawn Drive, he gets to within 30 feet of it when it hovers. Just before it streaks away, two smaller green globes, 3 feet in diameter, shoot out of it and approach him. He hears a voice saying, “Don’t be afraid, Orfeo, we are friends.” This begins his contact with benevolent beings from other planets.

As radar at Fort Monmouth detects the objects, they put on a burst of speed and head southwest toward Washington, D.C., confirmed visually. At about 12:00 noon, a physics professor at George Washington University in D.C. sees a grayish UFO hovering and arcing back and forth across the sky for about 8 minutes.

July 2 — 11:10 a.m. As he is driving on a highway seven miles north of Tremonton, Utah, US Navy Chief Petty Officer Delbert C. Newhouse and his wife see a strange object in the sky. Newhouse pulls the car to the side of the road, gets out, and watches 12–14 UFOs at about 10,000 feet. Looking like “two pie pans, one inverted on top of the other,” they are clustered in a loose formation, “milling around.” He takes about 75 seconds worth of film through the telephoto lens of his 16mm movie camera, though the objects have receded a bit to shiny points of light. At one point a single object leaves the pack, heading east, and Newhouse holds the camera still so the UFO crosses the field of view. He repeats the procedure 3-4 times. Blue Book obtains the film and sends it to the USAF Photo- Reconnaissance Laboratory and the Navy’s Photo Interpretation Laboratory. Both analyses eliminate the possibility of aircraft or birds.

July 12 — 9:04 p.m. Two USAF F-86 Sabre jets with the 62nd Flight Squadron are flying at 22,000 feet on a routine training mission (or on a scramble mission) over Arlington Heights, Illinois. Capt. Robert W. Casey Jr., after coming out of a right turn, sees an oblong yellowish lighted object with an exhaust moving in a straight course about 15 miles away south of Elgin, Illinois, at 22,000 feet traveling at 800 mph. The F-86 pursues at maximum speed, but the object pulls away. Both pilots hear a strange radio transmission on their restricted communications channel during the pursuit saying the name of the pursuit pilot, Casey, in an ethereal “ghost-like” monotone.

The dots are streaking in their direction like tracer bullets. As they get closer, they resolve into reddish-orange circles, about 100 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick, with sharply defined edges. Nash says they are holding a “narrow echelon formation.” When they are nearly underneath the aircraft, “they flipped on edge, the sides to the left of us going up and the glowing surfaces facing right. While all were in the edgewise position, the last five slid over and past the leader so that the echelon was now tail foremost.” Then they all flip over again into a flat attitude. Two new, brighter UFOs join the formation, and the lights of all eight objects blink out then come on again. They all speed westward (Nash estimates 6,000–12,000 mph) and climb in a graceful 45° arc. The entire sighting lasts only 15 seconds. Possible corroboration comes from a sighting in Camden, New Jersey, although the date is uncertain.

They slow down and make a U turn, moving side by side until they revolve around each other at a high rate of speed in a tight circle 200–300 feet in diameter. A third UFO comes racing up from the direction of Virginia Beach and falls in several hundred feet below the other two, making a V formation. A fourth UFO comes in from up the James River and joins the group, which heads south at 500 mph. “Their ability to make tight circling turns was amazing.” Around 9:03 p.m., the four UFOs have moved out of sight to the south.

Carpenter, First Officer George Fell, and Flight Engineer Quilici watch several dull-red objects with a “yellowish tinge” speeding around in the air at an altitude of 25,000– 30,000 feet near Denver, Colorado, during a non-stop flight from Los Angeles to Chicago. A maximum of three objects are seen at one time over a 2-minute period. Carpenter says they seem to be about 100 miles away. The first object is moving south by southeast. One minute after it disappears, two more come into view going westward and another one eastward. “The two traveling westward disappeared about two seconds then reappeared traveling eastward.” (Loren E.

July 19 — 4:30 p.m. Agricultural engineer Pedro Bardi and others on a farm in the Madre de Dios region of Peru see a UFO flying at 325 feet shortly after their short-wave radio goes dead. Bardi says it is a bit smaller than a DC-3 and is making a buzzing sound. It shows up 4 minutes later at Puerto Maldonado, 75 miles away, and Customs Administrator Domingo Troncosco photographs it. The photo shows an elongated object trailing smoke, passing over the top of a tree and in front of a cumulus cloud.

July 19–20 — 11:40 p.m. Air traffic controller Edward Nugent at Washington National \[now Ronald Reagan National\] Airport’s Air Route Traffic Control (ARTC) in D.C. picks up a formation of seven objects on his long-range radar. They are southeast of Andrews AFB \[now Joint Base Andrews\] in Prince George’s County, Maryland, moving along at 100–130 mph. Two of the targets suddenly accelerate and vanish off the scope within seconds.

One apparently reaches a speed of 7,000 mph. A second, shorter-range radar in the airport control tower (operated by [Howard Cocklin](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68160004/howard-arthur-cocklin&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889729155140&usg=AOvVaw1Wnn0rjC1WF5_unnnjIbIB) and [Joseph Zacko Jr.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/158964070/joseph-charles-zacko&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889729155414&usg=AOvVaw17Qf5NJDLbzH95ME0HSRR-)) and another at Andrews AFB has also tracked the objects. For 6 hours, between 8 and 10 UFOs are tracked on radar. Senior Air Traffic Controller Harry G. Barnes says that “They followed no set course, were not in any formation, and we only seemed to be able to track them for about three miles at a time…. I can safely deduce that they performed gyrations which no known aircraft could perform.” Several Capitol Airlines pilots (one of them Capt. S. C. “Casey” Pierman) see the objects visually as white or orange lights in restricted air space over the White House and Capitol. Ground observers at Andrews (Capt.

Harold C. May, Staff/Sgt Charles Davenport) watch red or orange lights. Radar and visual sightings are also taking place at Bolling AFB \[now Joint Base Anaconda-Bolling\] in Washington, D.C. By 3:00 a.m., the UFOs are all gone, just as two F-94 interceptors arrive belatedly from New Castle AFB \[now New Castle Air National Guard Base\] in Delaware. The jets depart, and the UFOs return, observed by Capt. Howard Dermott, a Capitol Airlines pilot, and Sgt. Davenport at Andrews. Radar trackings continue, the last at 5:30 a.m. Civilian radio engineer E. W. Chambers sees five huge discs circling in a loose formation; they tilt upward and leave in a steep ascent. Blips appear on radar for at least another day, until the evening of July 20.

July 22–23 — 10:30 p.m. An air traffic control tower operator at MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida, watches for 30 minutes a red-greenish-blue object to the west-southwest at about 45° elevation with 2 other objects to the north of it, smaller and lower in elevation. He sights another object to the south-southeast about 30° elevation at 11:30 p.m. MacDill radar tracks an object at 12:03 a.m. 37 miles away at 41,200 feet altitude heading almost directly toward the base at 532 mph. It also tracks an object to the south-southeast at an altitude of 41,000 feet (reportedly Navy and CAA radars also track the object). At 12:08 a.m., the pilot and copilot of a B-29 bomber on landing approach are vectored by MacDill tower operator to investigate the UFO. They see a high-speed object at 40,000 feet heading towards MacDill and traveling faster than the B-29. The B-29 fire control radar locks onto the object and prepares to fire just as the UFO changes course and disappears at 4,600 mph. Four airmen at the MacDill radar site see an object as it passes nearly overhead. MacDill radar loses the object at about 12:15 a.m. Civilians in Tampa also see two yellowish-orange discs maneuvering around the air base.

July 22–23 — 10:50 p.m. Crews of several USAF F-94 jet interceptors from Dover AFB, Delaware, make 13 visual sightings and one radar tracking of blue-white lights around Trenton, New Jersey, continuing until 12:45 a.m. White, green, and blue lights are seen by ground observers and F-94 pilots moving in arcs and blinking out suddenly. One F-94 crew gets a radar lock-on from 30,000 feet away of an object the size of an F-94. At 9,000 feet distance, the object makes a sharp right turn, suddenly drops in height, and disappears.

July 25 (or April 25) — 3:00 a.m. Carlo Rossi is on his way to a fishing spot on the Serchio river near San Pietro a Vico, Lucca, Italy. He notices an odd light above the river and finds that it belongs to an enormous disc-shaped object with a transparent dome. It is about 82 feet in diameter and apparently taking up water through a long tube. The object is standing in the river on three legs and has a ladder reaching down next to the tube. Rossi thinks it is hovering by means of propellors. Suddenly a porthole opens, and a human figure looks out and notices him. Rossi begins to leave, but a green ray passes above his head and he feels an electric shock. The object takes off and disappears to the west. (“[Le Nostre Analisi: Precisazioni sul Caso di S.

July 26–27 — 8:15 p.m. Flying saucers return to the nation’s capital, only one week after a massive number of radar- visual UFO sightings above restricted air space in Washington, D.C. At 8:15 p.m., pilot Capt. Berkow and a stewardess of a National Airlines flight near Washington National Airport \[now Ronald Reagan National\] see several objects resembling the glow of a cigarette high above them. The lights move at around 100 mph. Soon, the airport and Andrews AFB in Maryland are tracking a dozen UFOs throughout much of the sky, all traveling 90– 100 mph. By midnight, two F-94s are scrambled from New Castle AFB in Delaware to intercept them. National Airport staff hustle newspaper reporters away from the air traffic control tower, saying that interceptions are classified (but Project Blue Book chief Capt. [Edward J. Ruppelt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_J._Ruppelt&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889729178842&usg=AOvVaw3e9ZSc0rgrdkq6MaKsk8O9) suspects that the Air Force does not want the press around when they finally get a good look at a saucer). The UFOs are seen on radar for 2 hours, but when the jets approach, the blips disappear. When the pilots return to base, they show up again. Reports are reaching Langley AFB about rotating objects that give off alternating colors over Newport News, Virginia. Another F-94 is scrambled, the pilot gets a radar lock, and the target speeds away. At National Airport, the objects reappear shortly before dawn, and two more F-94s are scrambled. The pilots obtain radar locks; again, the objects speed away. USAF press spokesman [Albert M. Chop](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sohp.us/interviews/bios/chop-albert.php&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889729179311&usg=AOvVaw34h8DLi85l3uyfQcPGkvO0) is in the airport radar tower and notes that everyone there believes the targets are “very probably caused by solid metallic objects.” One F-94 pilot, Lieut. William Patterson, says, “I saw several bright lights. I was at my maximum speed, but even then I had no closing speed.” A USAF air intelligence report later states that the radar crew is emphatic that the returns are solid and not temperature inversions. In 1969, however, Colorado project physicist [Gordon David Thayer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rr0.org/people/t/ThayerGordonD/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674889729179779&usg=AOvVaw3h2W1pBVa75vSN2WyuWkSJ) concludes that the radar events involved temperature inversions.
