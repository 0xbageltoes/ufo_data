It had a large white light on the bottom and a green and a blue flashing light, plus several brightly lit windows could be seen on its side. The object then shut off its lights and vanished. Later that night a woman had gone out in his yard to empty some cooking waste when she saw four little men wearing silvery outfits standing by a water faucet.
