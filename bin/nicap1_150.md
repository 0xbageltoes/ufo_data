Later (11:30 p.m.), an unidentified aerial object with domed top, flat bottom, and red and white flashing lights, descended abruptly in front of the witness's car, and hovered inches off the road. The driver slammed on the brakes, and the object took off. The object was so large that it overlapped the road. (NICAP report, investigation by John Fuller).

The start of a power failure, which affected about 2,500 homes in the area, was officially timed at 4:57 a.m. It was later attributed to a breakdown in the insulation of the wiring at a point very near the apartment building. Later that evening investigators detected some abnormal radiation on the window sill where the object had been seen. (Keyhoe & Lore, 1969b, pp. 45-47; Walter N. Webb investigation report; U.F.O.

4:15 p.m. PDT. A woman driving in Temple City saw a strange object approach from the southwest, hover and bob around. She stopped and observed the object at relatively close range, at treetop level across a wide highway. "It was the shape of two geranium pots put together with the bands in the center," she said. Although the object was clearly outlined, there was a slight haze surrounding it. The color was bright green. Flashes of sunlight reflected off the surface, giving it a metallic sheen. On the body were what appeared to be a row of louvers and an antenna-like projection. After several minutes the object climbed to the northeast, observed as it moved away by employees of a nearby restaurant who were alerted by the witness. (Los Angeles NICAP Subcommittee report.)

The two men now could see that it was a disc with dome on top, and it cast an oval reflection on the lake surface. Around the dome was a row of bright yellow lights, and blue-green lights were visible around the lower perimeter (body lights). After hovering briefly, the UFO took off at high speed and quickly disappeared. (U.F.O. Investigator, Vol. Ill, No. 9, Aug.-Sept. 1966, p. 5)

About 10 minutes later the same or a similar object appeared traveling from north to south, stopped and hovered in the northwest sky for about 30 minutes. The object then diminished in apparent size and was hidden by clouds near the horizon. When viewed through 10 x 60 binoculars, the object had a conical shape and was reflecting sunlight.

Julian Sandoval, a NASA contract flight engineer, also an experienced pilot and navigator, and two independent witnesses saw a glowing elongated object with ablunt end. lt had a series of four body lights varying from brilliant green to a bluish tinge, and was hovering at an estimated 12,000 feet.

When the object moved, its glow brightened and it appeared to be a powered craft (luminosity/motion correlation). The witness watched the object for an hour and a half, after which it climbed vertically, accelerated to a high velocity and disappeared to the northeast in about 12 seconds. In a report to NICAP, Sandoval estimated the departure speed at "Mach 6 or better." (Christian Science Monitor,
