At the age of nineteen, while serving as a maid for Mr. Moses Pitt's family, she suffered a sudden loss of consciousness, after which she exhibited unusual behavior. She claimed to have been abducted by six \"small people\" dressed in green, which caused her great fright and illness. During her sickness, she began to display healing abilities. Anne's healing powers became known when she successfully treated her employer's mother for a broken leg. Word spread, and people from various places came to Anne seeking her magical healing. She described her encounters with the small people and the circumstances of their visits, often occurring in groups of even numbers. However, Anne's reputation as a seer and faith healer attracted the attention of local authorities who questioned her interactions with supernatural beings. Despite her rational explanations, she was deemed deluded by the devil and arrested for her activities. After spending three months in jail, Anne was released and continued her healing work, living with various relatives and eventually marrying. Anne Jefferies' story is a remarkable account of a woman who claimed to have been in contact with otherworldly beings and acquired healing abilities after a mysterious experience, leading to her becoming a renowned faith healer in her time.",

As it reached a position over Hampstead, the object emitted fiery coruscations and transformed into a radiant cloud, emitting a unique and bright blue-tinted light on the surrounding houses. Another even more brilliant cloud appeared above, and after a brief period, small fiery balls dropped from the upper cloud into the lower one. This process repeated, with larger balls descending. Eventually, both clouds disappeared, seemingly absorbed into the heavens. The moon later emerged to the north, and the witnesses also observed zodiacal light lasting over an hour.",
