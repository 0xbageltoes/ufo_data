1905                        California's Imperial Valley. There were Witnesses observed a brilliant light in the sky, which revealed the form of a 
                            70-foot-long airship with wing-like propulsion. The sighting left observers awestruck, with some describing the craft 
                            as resembling a gigantic bird in flight. (Chapter 3, Refs 115,116)
110
1906                        South Dakota. A farm boy in South Dakota claimed to have witnessed a strange craft landing near his family's well. 
                            He stated that he was invited inside by normal-looking men who explained that the craft's outer shell contained 
                            helium gas. They mentioned using a lever to cut off earth's magnetism and collected water for producing 
                            electricity before departing. (Chapter 3, Ref 117)
111
Jul. 1908                   Bristol, Connecticut. A large airship was reportedly seen over Bristol, Connecticut. The craft had an elongated gas 
                            bag with a suspended framework and a propeller. Witnesses observed a single person aboard and speculated on its intentions, 
                            but the identity of the airship remained unknown as it changed course and disappeared over Wolcott Mountain. (Chapter 3, Ref 118)
112
Oct. 1908                   Bridgewater, Massachusetts. Two men observed an airship over Bridgewater, Massachusetts. They watched as it moved closer to 
                            the earth and noticed the outline of the large balloon. The airship exhibited unusual movements, rising and falling as if 
                            controlled by an individual, and then it moved steadily eastward, maintaining a straight line instead of dropping down. (Chapter 3, Ref 119)
113
Aug. 1909                   Near Middletown, New York. Residents near Middletown, New York reported seeing a mysterious airship that flew only at night. The 
                            airship was described as having a balloon-like shape with wings on each side and a cigar-shaped car underneath. Witnesses heard the 
                            sound of a motor as the airship flew at a high speed. (Chapter 3, Ref 120)
114
Dec. 16, 1909               In December 1909, there were sightings of mysterious airships in Massachusetts. Witnesses in Marlboro reported two sightings, 
                            one by ex-councilman B.W. Johnson who claimed to have seen the airship come down so low that he could hear a man talking from the 
                            craft. Another witness named Beauregard stated that the airship landed on the southern side of Lake Williams on the same night. (Chapter 3, Ref 121)
115
Dec. 23, 1909               Boston. On December 23, 1909, an aerial display captivated thousands of Christmas shoppers in Boston. Two strong searchlights were 
evening                     observed moving quickly over the city, initially mistaken for bright stars. The lights, which appeared to be on an aerial craft, exhibited 
                            distinct behaviors, including a reflective appearance resembling automobile headlights and a vague outline of the craft itself. The lights 
                            remained stationary at an altitude of about 600 feet for a short time before disappearing. (Chapter 3, Ref 122)
116
1908                        New England. During the New England mystery airship wave of 1908-1909, alongside sightings of dirigible-like objects, there were reports of 
                            airplane-type craft that were technologically ahead of their time.
117
Oct. 1908                   35 miles at sea near the British Isles. In October 1908, British fishermen encountered a "sausage-shaped" aircraft at sea and attempted 
                            communication by exchanging flares with the unidentified object before it flew away towards the open sea. (Chapter 3, Ref 123)
118
Mar. 1909                   London, Britain. A policeman witnessed a high-powered engine sound overhead and saw an oblong, dark body outlined against the stars, 
                            with a powerful light about 1,200 feet above the ground. The object, which he described as oblong and narrow, was traveling at high 
                            speed and eventually disappeared in the northwest. (Chapter 3, Ref 124)
119
Apr. 1909                   Norfolk Countryside. A farmhand observed a long, dark airship with a bright light flying low above the trees. The airship had a hanging 
                            platform with two men, and its searchlight illuminated the surroundings as it traveled swiftly against the wind before disappearing 
                            within a few minutes. (Chapter 3, Ref 125)
120
Apr. 1909                   Northhamptonshire. Three motorists in Northamptonshire heard a loud report in the air followed by the sound of a swiftly-running motor 
                            engine. Looking up, they saw a dark oblong airship with lights in front and behind, flying swiftly through the sky. The airship appeared 
                            to be about 500 or 600 feet up, at least 100 feet long, and they could see a torpedo shape and what appeared to be men on a platform below. (Chapter 3, Ref 126)
121
Apr. 1909                   London. In a London park, two witnesses had an extraordinary encounter with an unusual airship. The craft had a distinct appearance, 
                            resembling a series of large cigar boxes connected together. Estimated to be around 200 to 250 feet in length, the airship had 
                            landed close to where the witnesses were sitting. The witnesses described two occupants on the airship: the first, who looked like a 
                            clean-shaven Yankee, was situated in a steel wire cage with handles in front of him, while the second, resembling a German, was standing 
                            in the middle of the craft and smoking a calabash pipe. The airship's searchlight was suddenly turned on, blinding the witnesses, 
                            but it allowed them to see the details of the occupants. The German occupant requested tobacco from the witnesses, which they provided, 
                            and in exchange, he gave them a pipe. The German also had a map in front of him, marked with red discs resembling pins. The witnesses 
                            noted that parts of the airship were constructed from light-colored metal, possibly aluminum. The airship was not like a traditional 
                            balloon but rather had an aeroplane-like structure, with steel rods supporting it and keeping its propellers off the ground. The German 
                            occupant leaned over a wire railing to speak to the witnesses, and as they watched, the taller occupant pulled a lever down, switching 
                            off the searchlight. Within a mere 10 seconds, the airship vanished from sight, leaving the witnesses astounded by the rapid departure 
                            and its mysterious nature. (Chapter 3, Ref 127)
122
Apr. 1909                   On a mountaintop in Wales. A witness encountered an airship on a mountaintop in Wales. The craft was tube-shaped and had two men dressed 
                            in heavy fur coats and caps. The witness observed them engaged in some activity, and when they noticed the witness, they appeared alarmed 
                            and began speaking to each other in an unfamiliar language. The men quickly got into a small carriage suspended from the craft, which 
                            then rose into the air in a zigzag pattern, displaying lights akin to electric lamps. The craft eventually flew away in the direction of 
                            Cardiff. The witness noted the presence of wheels on the carriage's bottom and a fan at the tail end of the craft. (Chapter 3, Ref 128)
123
1909                        London. Amid speculation that foreign entities, particularly Germans, were behind the mystery airship sightings, an Englishman named 
                            Dr. M.B. Boyd came forward to claim responsibility. According to a contemporary London newspaper, Boyd stated that he had been working 
                            on airship inventions for eight years and revealed that his airship was responsible for several reported sightings. He described his 
                            airship as 120 feet long, powered by powerful gasoline engines, and capable of long flights. Despite his claims, Boyd never provided 
                            concrete evidence of his aircraft, and the mystery of the sightings persisted, with doubts raised about his assertions. The German 
                            theory was also questioned, as the German dirigibles of the time did not match the reported speeds and capabilities of the mystery airships. (Chapter 3, Ref 129)
124
1909                        Reval, Russia. Mysterious airship sightings were not limited to the British Isles but extended to continental Europe. In August, a 
                            British newspaper's Russian correspondent reported an incident in which an unidentified controllable airship circled over the city 
                            of Reval (now Tallinn) and then departed towards Finland, causing significant excitement in the area. (Chapter 3, Ref 130)
125                            
Sep. 1909                   Gothenburg and Osthammer, Sweden. A large elliptical-shaped aircraft with wings was observed flying over the Swedish cities of Gothenburg 
                            and Osthammer at an altitude of 300 feet. The aircraft was later seen heading westward, leaving observers intrigued by its presence. (Chapter 3, Ref 131)
126
Jul. 15, 1909               Australia and New Zealand. In 1909, New Zealand became a hotspot for mystery airship sightings, with many reports describing flying 
                            boat-like structures. Witnesses, including two workmen, observed a large boat-shaped object floating in the air that appeared to be 
                            approaching them, dipping and ascending in motion. The sightings occurred over a two-month period and sparked intrigue in the region. (Chapter 3, Ref 132)
127
Aug. 4, 1909                North Otago, New Zealand. During a multiple-witness sighting in New Zealand, a detailed description of the object emerged. Witnesses saw a 
12:00                       vessel resembling a black boat with supports on each side, a rapidly revolving wheel at the rear, and a box beneath the body. The object 
                            exhibited swift movement and sudden turns during the encounter. (Chapter 3, Ref 133)
128
1909                        New Zealand. Under bright moonlight, a single witness reported seeing a large, boat-shaped object with two individuals inside before 
                            it swiftly departed at a fast pace. (Chapter 3, Ref 134)
129
Aug. 6, 1909                Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. Two dredge operators near Gore spotted two figures aboard a boat-shaped airship with lights at both ends, 
                            which circled their location for a few minutes before rapidly departing, leaving a yellow glare in its wake. (Chapter 3, Ref 135)
130
Aug. 1909                   Waipawa, New Zealand. A man near Waipawa reported seeing a large, grey, torpedo-shaped airship passing overhead. He claimed to have 
                            heard three occupants aboard the airship, one of whom shouted in an unknown language. The airship eventually rose to a great height, 
                            displayed lights at its ends, circled around, and then disappeared behind a hill. (Chapter 3, Ref 136)
131
Aug. 2, 1909                Mount Bruce, New Zealand. A New Zealand fisherman encountered an airship near Marlborough Sound that dropped hissing "missiles" into the 
                            water, which fizzed upon impact and sank. Although he didn't witness occupants aboard the airship, he described a hostile encounter 
                            involving these mysterious objects. (Chapter 3, Ref 137)
132
Sep. 1909                   Port Molyneux, New Zealand. A local man had a friendly encounter with the occupants of an airship that landed at Port Molyneux. 
                            He described them as looking like Japanese and mentioned that they conversed with him in English. (Chapter 3, Ref 138)                                                                                   
133
Early Sep. 1909             Gore, New Zealand. The final airship sightings in New Zealand occurred in early September. Two prominent residents of Gore observed a 
                            cigar-shaped aircraft with an attached "car" drifting over nearby hills before disappearing from sight. Another sighting report 
                            described the airship appearing over the hills, moving back and forth at a rapid pace, and then disappearing towards the Gore racecourse. (Chapter 3, Ref 139)
134                            
Aug. 1909                   Glen Innes, Australia. Mystery airship sightings in Australia, spanning from August to October, included a sighting near Glen Innes 
                            where residents described an object shaped like an inverted top with a lighted lower portion that revolved, casting a flashlight-like 
                            beam on the land beneath it. (Chapter 3, Ref 140)
135
1909                        Onslow, Australia. A daylight sighting in Australia near Onslow described an object that appeared compact like a dirigible balloon but 
                            squarer and more like an aeroplane. The object reflected flashes of light from what seemed like revolving metalwork or reflective surfaces. (Chapter 3, Ref 141)
136
1900                        Wisconsin. During the first two decades of the 20th century, UFO reports continued to include a mix of both dirigible-like airships 
                            and more futuristic-looking "spaceships," resembling the diversity seen in the late 19th century. An example from 1900 in Wisconsin 
                            described a dirigible-shaped object displaying unusual characteristics, such as trees bending and a swishing sound as it passed 
                            low overhead, impacting a teenager and his horse. (Chapter 3, Ref 142)                            
137
1901                        Britain. In 1901, a British child had an interactive encounter with a box-shaped UFO in their garden. Two small entities resembling 
                            men emerged from the craft, wearing uniforms and caps with antennae. After a signal to move away, the entities reentered the craft, which 
                            then ascended with a bright flash and a loud noise. (Chapter 3, Ref 143)
138
1903                        Helmer, Indiana. In 1903, a farm family in Indiana observed a large, glowing object resembling a cucumber with tapered ends and rows of 
                            lighted windows. The object hovered before darting off in a zigzag pattern across the sky. (Chapter 3, Ref 144)                            
139
1904                        At sea between San Francisco and Hawaii. In 1904, crewmembers of an American ship reported encountering "remarkable meteors" while at sea 
                            between San Francisco and Hawaii. The meteors initially appeared near the horizon and below the clouds, flying directly toward the 
                            ship in a formation. The objects' shapes and colors were described in detail, with the largest meteor being egg-shaped with a jagged 
                            leading end and the others being round. (Chapter 3, Ref 145)
140
1905                        Romanian province of Bucovina. In 1905, a doctor in Romania witnessed a large, brilliantly-lit saucer-shaped aerial object in the province of 
                            Bucovina, causing him significant concern. The object was observed flying westward before disappearing from view. (Chapter 3, Ref 146)
141
1906                        In the North Atlantic between Greenland and Newfoundland. In 1906, the crew of a cargo ship in the North Atlantic reported encountering a 
                            large, saucer-shaped meteor that exhibited non-meteor-like characteristics. The object was seen falling in a zigzag manner with a rocking 
                            motion, leaving a red streak in its wake. The captain described it as a huge meteor weighing several tons and being 10-to-15 feet in diameter. (Chapter 3, Ref 147)
142
1909                        La Porte, Indiana. In 1906, the crew of a cargo ship encountered a large, saucer-shaped meteor exhibiting zigzag movements and non-meteor-like 
                            characteristics. Three years later in 1909, churchgoers in Indiana witnessed a strange craft resembling two bowls joined at the rims, with 
                            rows of lights in the middle. The craft emitted an eerie light that terrified both people and horses before disappearing suddenly. (Chapter 3, Ref 148)
143
Jun. 30, 1908               Tunguska, Russian Siberia. The Tunguska event of 1908 was a mysterious and powerful explosion that occurred in a remote area of Russian Siberia. 
                            On June 30th, a massive blast with the force of a nuclear explosion flattened over a thousand square miles of forest, creating seismic 
                            shockwaves felt hundreds of miles away. The explosion was accompanied by a blinding flash of light that turned night into day across vast 
                            distances and a mushroom-shaped cloud. Eyewitness accounts described a fiery ball in the sky, followed by a massive explosion that sent 
                            shockwaves through the region.\nVarious theories have been proposed to explain the event, including the impact of a comet, meteor, or 
                            asteroid. However, some researchers have suggested the possibility of an errant nuclear-powered spacecraft that exploded in the atmosphere. 
                            This theory is supported by evidence such as the absence of a typical impact crater, the presence of elevated radioactivity levels in the 
                            aftermath, and unique fused globules associated with nuclear explosions found in the area. Despite extensive research, the exact cause of the 
                            Tunguska event remains debated, leaving it one of the most intriguing and unexplained events in history. (Chapter 3, Ref 153)
144
Jun. 30, 1908               Tunguska, Russian Siberia. Some eyewitnesses reportedly observed a cylindrical-shaped object flying over the area and changing course several times
                            before finally exploding in the air. (Chapter 3, Ref 154)
