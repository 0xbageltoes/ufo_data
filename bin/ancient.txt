Apr. 34                                         China. A white, round object, accompanied by 10 small stars, flew overhead. The pattern suggests the stars might have been in formation with the main object, making it an unusual possible meteor event.

24
61                                              China. Han Emperor Mingti experienced a vision of a golden figure enveloped in a halo of light, which various sources described as either a dream or an apparition. This figure was interpreted as a flying Apsara (Buddhist angel) or possibly the Buddha himself. As a result of this vision, the Emperor sent envoys to India to understand Buddhism better. The account does not specify any physical aerial object associated with the vision.

25
May. 21, 70                                     Jerusalem. Historian Flavius Josephus documented a remarkable sighting where, before sunset, chariots and armored troops were observed in the sky, seemingly racing among the clouds and encircling cities. This extraordinary event, although sounding like a fable, was vouched for by multiple witnesses. The importance of subsequent events added weight to these accounts, indicating that they were not mere tales or exaggerations.

26
Winter, 80                                      Caledon Wood, Scotland. During the Roman Emperor Agricola's time in Scotland, there were reports of mysterious flames illuminating the skies over Caledon Wood for an entire winter night. On clear nights, a fast-moving ship-like object was observed in the sky. Additionally, there were accounts of unusual events in Athol, such as a rain of stones and frogs, and nighttime visions of fiery battles in the sky. These events, rich in anomalies, intertwine with tales from Geoffrey of Monmouth's rendition of the King Arthur legend, where Arthur famously defeated the Saxons at Caledon Wood.

27
187                                             Rome, Italy. During the reign of Commodus, there were peculiar daytime sightings of stars that appeared throughout the entire day. According to Herodian, some of these stars seemed to elongate and hover in the middle of the air. These sightings were interpreted as unignited clouds being driven together, for they appeared illuminated at night but vanished when viewed from a distance during daylight.

28
Jan. 195                                        Rome, Italy. Bright stars were observed surrounding the sun during Julianus' Sacrifices of Entrance in front of the senate-house. These anomalous stars were so vivid that soldiers continually gazed at them, speculating an impending doom for the emperor. Concurrently, three leaders, Severus, Niger, and Albinus, each commanding vast legions, sought control of the region, potentially symbolized by these three stars. The nature of these "bright stars" remains unclear, though they were not simply a result of refraction.

29
235                                             Weinan, China. The army of Emperor Hou Chu witnessed a red object with pointed rays fly over them on three separate occasions. Despite being documented in a compilation of "shooting stars and meteors," the idea of a regular meteor passing multiple times over the army is highly improbable.

30
240                                             Che-chiang Province, China. Wang Shuh, while gathering medicinal herbs on T'ien Tai Mountain, took a rest and saw a small blue boy, over a foot long, in a brook. This boy rode on a red carp and both disappeared into a cloud. After a subsequent thunderstorm, the boy and carp reappeared and returned to the brook. The sighting, possessing attributes commonly ascribed to "dragons" in Chinese literature, remains unexplained by ordinary phenomena.

31
Mar. 260                                        China. Amidst a political crisis, while "hostage children" played together, a mysterious child, less than four feet tall, joined them. The child, with light rays flashing from his eyes, identified himself as the star-god Yunghuo (Mars) and delivered a prophecy that "The Three Lords will return to Ssu-ma." After conveying his message, he ascended to the heavens, leaving behind a trail resembling flowing silk. This event remained unreported due to the political turmoil, and years later the prophecy came to fruition as Hsiu was overthrown and power shifted to Ssu-ma.

32
Jan. 314                                        China. The Sun appeared to descend to the ground while three additional suns simultaneously rose from the western horizon and moved together towards the East. This description suggests a rare and unordinary phenomenon, but with limited information provided, a complete interpretation would require access to the original text.

33
334                                             Antioch, Turkey. A star-like object appeared in the eastern sky during daylight hours, emitting a significant amount of smoke, similar to that from a furnace, from the third to the fifth hour. Given its extended duration, it cannot be classified as a comet, and it persisted longer than typical meteors.

34
350                                             Emesa, Syria. Eusebios experienced an unexpected urge to travel to a hill with an ancient temple of Athena near Emesa at midnight. There, he witnessed a fireball descend, accompanied by a lion that quickly vanished. Approaching the cooled globe, Eusebios found the baitylos, a sacred meteorite. When he questioned the stone about its deity, it claimed to belong to "Gennaios, the Noble One." The baitylos, described as a whitish, occasionally purple-hued globe, displayed letters painted in cinnabar, a bright red pigment esteemed in antiquity. This baitylos's characteristics challenge common understanding of meteorites.

35
May. 7, 351                                     Jerusalem. As Cyril took over the leadership of the church of Jerusalem, a radiant and concentrated cross appeared in the skies. Measuring about fifteen stadia from Calvary to the Mount of Olives, this luminous cross was notably brighter than the sun and remained visible for several days. Its remarkable appearance caused widespread fear among the observers, as documented by Hermias Sozomen in his Ecclesiastical History.

36
393                                             Rome, Italy. A new and distinctive star, initially observed at midnight towards the east, was reportedly brighter than most, rivaling the luminosity of Venus. Surrounding this star, smaller star-like points clustered like bees around their queen. Later, its shape morphed, resembling a double-bladed sword. The celestial object moved distinctively across the sky, eventually settling in the Big Dipper and fading away after a forty-day journey. While it resembles descriptions of a comet, no corroborative record of such a cometary observation exists for this period.

37
396                                             Constantinople (Istanbul), Turkey. At nightfall, a fiery cloud appeared from the East, initially small, but as it neared the city, it expanded and ominously loomed over Constantinople. The fearful populace sought refuge in the Church, and upon the cloud's eventual dispersal, rumors spread that the city would be destroyed the following Sabbath. This led to a mass evacuation, including the Emperor. With the city ultimately remaining unscathed, St. Augustine pondered whether this event was a manifestation of God's wrath or mercy.

38
438                                             Constantinople (Istanbul), Turkey. In the aftermath of a devastating earthquake, as pestilence and famine spread and the city's walls and towers lay in ruins, the residents gathered in the countryside praying for their city's salvation. Amidst these dire circumstances, a miraculous event took place: a child was abruptly lifted into the air, disappearing from sight. Upon returning, he recounted to Patriarch Proclus, the Emperor, and the masses that he had witnessed a celestial chorus of angels singing praises. This astonishing event was widely seen by the city's inhabitants and was later commemorated annually in ecclesiastical annals and Greek church readings.

39
497                                             British Isles. Possibly 473 AD. A massive and bright globe was observed in the sky. From this globe emanated a second fiery ball which projected two distinct rays. One ray stretched out towards Gaul, while the other aimed towards the Irish Sea, subsequently splitting into seven smaller beams. The exact date of this event remains contested, with some sources pointing to 473 and others, like Roger of Wendover, suggesting 497.

40
507                                             Poitiers, France. As King Clovis sought to overcome the Visigoths and claim their French territories, he embarked on a night march directed by a bright meteor, likened to the biblical column of fire that guided the Israelites. This fiery signal, possibly coordinated with the cathedral of Poitiers, illuminated his path, leading him to victory against the Visigoths, subsequently culminating in the death of their king, Alaric II. Following this triumph, Clovis relocated the Frankish capital to Paris.

41
540                                             Rome, Italy. A small spark was observed descending from the sky to Earth. Upon nearing the Earth, it expanded, resembling an orb akin to the Moon and took on a disc-like shape. This celestial event was perceived as an omen, predicting significant societal unrest and grave misfortunes.

42
540                                             Monte Cassino, Italy. At dawn, Saint Benedict of Nursia witnessed an intense light that evolved into a fiery globe, illuminating the night brighter than day. As he gazed upon this brilliance, he perceived the entire world condensing under a single sunbeam and saw the soul of Germanus, Bishop of Capua, ascend to heaven within a flaming sphere accompanied by angels. Calling upon Servandus the Deacon as a witness, only a waning remnant of the light was visible to the latter. Upon investigation, it was discovered that Bishop Germanus had passed away at the exact moment of Saint Benedict's vision, suggesting a potential connection between the event and the Bishop's departure.

43
Nov. 596                                        Nara prefecture, West Japan. An object resembling a canopy or lotus flower was observed descending and hovering above the Houryuji temple. While suspended, it underwent various color and shape transformations.

44
Jun. 9, 597                                     Ireland. During a nighttime fishing session, multiple witnesses, including the narrator Adomnan, observed the sky suddenly illuminating. An immense pillar of fire ascended from the east, brightening the entire heavens as if it were midday. This extraordinary luminous column was seen not only by the group of Adomnan but also by various other fishermen scattered along the river. The intense light was then followed by profound darkness, resembling sunset.

45
May. 655                                        Katuragi Mountain near Nara, W. Japan} A figure resembling a Chinese man was observed riding a dragon in the sky. The details surrounding this event are sparse and its credibility is uncertain. It's mentioned in hopes of encouraging further exploration of ancient Asian sources for more information on this peculiar sighting.

46
664                                             Kent, England. During the night, an unusual pillar of light illuminated the hall of King Ecgbert I's palace, startling many of his household. The brightness led to widespread astonishment and cries, prompting the king to rise from his bed. As he left the house, he observed a brilliantly burning globe of white flame, which seemed to have originated from the aforementioned luminous pillar.

47
Sep. 6, 670                                     Nara Prefecture, Western Japan. A mysterious cloud resembling an umbrella manifested in the sky, accompanied by an unusual noise. While meteors can produce sounds, they are not typically described as "umbrella-shaped clouds." Due to the limited information available, the event remains unidentified and requires further research for a more comprehensive understanding.

48
675                                             Berecingum Convent, near London, England. While nuns at Berecingum (Barking) convent were praying at the tombs after matins, a brilliant light, described as a "great sheet," suddenly descended upon them, causing great amazement. This luminosity, brighter than the midday sun, subsequently moved to the south side of the monastery, where it lingered for a while before ascending back to the heavens. The event's nature left the witnesses convinced that the light symbolized a heavenly signal related to the souls' eternal journey. The described behavior of the light does not align with typical meteor activity.

49
Nov. 21, 684                                    Japan. At dusk, observers reported witnessing seven stars that appeared to "drift together" towards the north-east before disappearing below the horizon. Due to the limited details provided, it's challenging to determine the exact nature or origin of these so-called "drifting stars."

50
May. 698                                        Ireland. Observers reported seeing three "shields" in the sky, moving from the east to the west on the night of the Ascension of the Lord. The shields displayed distinct colors: one snowy, the second fiery, and the third bloody. These celestial phenomena were interpreted as omens, thought to presage upcoming misfortunes. Later that year, herds of cows across Ireland and other parts of Europe faced near devastation.

51
Jun. 741                                        Constantinople (Istanbul), Turkey. During the reign of Constantine, Copronymus, three columns of fire were observed in the sky in June and then again in September. A similar phenomenon was noted in 735 AD, described as a half-moon-shaped object in the northern part of the sky. This object gradually moved to the southern quadrant before returning northward and eventually disappearing below the horizon.

52
749                                             Ulster, Ireland. Aerial ships accompanied by their crews were observed in the sky above Cluain Moccu, as documented in the 15th century Annals of Ulster.

53
760                                             France. During Pepin le Bref's reign, the skies over France reportedly exhibited numerous unusual phenomena, including human figures, ships with sails, and warring armies. Several individuals even claimed they were abducted by beings from the air. However, the original source of this information remains elusive and might have been influenced by the Comte De Gabalis written in 1670 by Abbe N. de Montfaucon de Villars.

54
776                                             Syburg Castle, Germany. During a rebellion against Charlemagne, the Saxons besieged Syburg Castle. As they were about to storm the castle, they reportedly witnessed two flaming, shield-like objects hovering above the church. This sight instilled panic among the Saxons, causing them to retreat in chaos. In their terrified state, many inadvertently harmed or killed their fellow soldiers while fleeing.

55
811                                             Near Aachen on Via Aquisgrana, Germany. Emperor Charlemagne witnessed a large flaming globe moving across the sky from east to west during a campaign against the Danes in Saxony. As he observed the unusual celestial event, he was thrown off his horse, which might have been startled by the spectacle. The emperor's fall was so forceful that his cloak buckle broke and his sword belt shattered. Additionally, a javelin he held was thrown about twenty feet away from where he landed.

56
813                                             Santiago de Compostela, Spain. A hermit named Pelayo heard music and witnessed a unique shining star above Mount Libredon, an ancient Celtic sacred site. This celestial sighting led to the naming of the location as "Campus Stellae," meaning "field of the star," which evolved into "Compostela." After an investigation initiated by Bishop Teodomiro, the tomb of the Apostle was discovered. King Alphonse II designated Saint James as the patron of his empire and constructed a chapel on the site, which eventually became the renowned Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, attracting numerous pilgrims.

57
814                                             China. A bright object ascended and illuminated the terrain below. Numerous smaller "stars" were observed emerging from this luminous entity.

58
815                                             Lyons, France. Saint Agobard, the Archbishop of Lyons, wrote extensively against the superstitions of his time. Among these was the popular belief in a region called "MAGONIA" from where ships would fly and sail upon clouds. These ships allegedly transported goods that had been damaged by storms or hail, after a transaction with 'Tempestaires'. In one notable event, four individuals, three men and a woman, were believed to have fallen from such a ship and were brought forth to be stoned. Saint Agobard intervened and saved their lives, expressing skepticism about the reality of these supposed ships and the beliefs associated with them.

59
817                                             China. A luminous globe was observed directly overhead, accompanied by a trailing tail. It moved at a slow pace towards the West, beneath the moon. Witnesses reported hearing sounds reminiscent of birds during the event. The sighting is notable due to the globe's unhurried movement, which is atypical for meteors, and the associated auditory phenomena.

60
827                                             Barcelona, Spain. Eginard reports "terrible things in the sky" emitting pale or red lights during the night, coinciding with Pepin's war campaign. The nature of these lights, distinct from meteors, adds to the challenge of interpretation.

61
840                                             China. Witness accounts describe the appearance of two "sacred lamps" during the early night. The first lamp, initially the size of a begging bowl, grew to that of a small house, atop a ridge east of the terrace across the valley. The crowd, deeply moved, chanted the name of His Holiness as the second lamp emerged, initially resembling a rain straw hat and gradually expanding. The two lights, shining ardently and spaced approximately 100 steps apart, faded and became invisible around midnight.

62
Nov. 879                                        China. An anomalous sighting records the energetic clash of two "suns" in the sky, reminiscent of a battle. On a separate day within the same month, two suns engaged in combat before eventually merging into one. This phenomenon bears resemblance to a similar event described in a Japanese account noted in case 69.

63
Apr. 25, 880                                    Montserrat-Santa Cova, Spain. Approximate date. Seven young children from Monistrol in Barcelona witness an enigmatic light descending from the sky and moving towards a small grotto on Montserrat mountain, accompanied by a soft melody. A week later, a group of priests led by the Bishop of Manresa also observes the phenomenon. For four consecutive Saturdays, the light reappears in the sky and descends towards the mountain grotto. Investigating further, seven men follow the light's indication to Santa Cova area, where they discover an image of a black virgin emitting a magical light and pleasant aroma. Attempts to relocate the sculpture to Manresa prove futile due to its increasing weight, leading to the establishment of a hermitage named after St. Mary at the original site.

64
Sep. 3, 881                                     Japan. Unusual celestial activity is documented as two stars manifest in the sky, engaging in peculiar maneuvers that involve merging and separating. This observation mirrors a similar pattern detailed in case 67 from China, suggesting a shared phenomenon across regions.

65
Mar. 900                                        China. The New Book of the Tang documents two significant celestial phenomena. In the year of Guang Hua, a large, yellow, star-like object, roughly 500 meters square, is observed flying southwest with a pointed head and cylindrical rear. Another account describes a "star-like object," five times larger than the previous one, flying northwest. As it descended to around thirty meters above the ground, witnesses noted red-orange flames emitted from its upper part. The object exhibited snake-like movements and was accompanied by sudden appearances and disappearances of numerous small stars.

66
905                                             China. A notable sighting involves the appearance of a sizable fiery globe in the sky's zenith, which proceeded to move towards the northwest. This globe halted about 100 feet away while numerous small stars circulated above it. The phenomenon left behind a greenish vapor, adding to the intrigue of the event.

67
919                                             Hungary. Witnesses report the sighting of luminous spherical objects resembling stars, accompanied by a bright torch-like presence. These bright spheres exhibit erratic movements, moving back and forth across the sky, captivating the attention of observers.

68
May. 12, 922                                    Bulgaria. During an ambassadorial mission led by Susan ar-Rassi in Almush's country, a peculiar sky phenomenon occurred. As described by the mission's secretary, Ahmad ibn-Fadlan, the sky's horizon turned red, accompanied by loud sounds and commotion during the usual prayer hour before sunset. A red cloud was observed, bearing figures resembling men and horses. These figures wielded weapons and engaged in combat with another group, also visible within the cloud. A black armed group appeared alongside the red one. The event continued for some time, and both ibn-Fadlan and ar-Rassi described the occurrence, noting two red clouds. Ambassador ar-Rassi's account added that the phenomenon started an hour before sunset, lasting until approximately 1:00 A.M. King Almush attributed the event to "Jinni," believed by his forefathers to be responsible for such sightings.

69
Mar. 927                                        Reims, France. An unusual sighting is documented in Reims, where an "army of fire" appeared in the sky on a Sunday morning in March. This sighting was followed by an outbreak of pestilence, as noted by Flodoard. The description lacks a clear correlation to known optical or atmospheric phenomena, contributing to the mystery of the event.

70
944                                             Trans-Rhenan Germany. Reports indicate the sighting of burning iron globes in the sky, with some causing damage to farms and houses as they flew. However, in certain areas, these iron globes were thwarted by countermeasures involving crucifixes, episcopal blessings, and holy water, successfully repelling the anomalous objects.

71
Sep. 9, 967                                     Japan. Witnesses observe a formation of numerous objects arranged in a triangular pattern, flying beneath rain clouds with an east-west trajectory. The distinct triangular formation and the presence of rain clouds challenge a meteoric interpretation of the event, if the description is considered reliable.

72
989                                             Constantinople (Istanbul), Turkey. A phenomenon resembling a "comet" is observed in the western sky after sunset. Unlike a typical comet, this object rises in the evening and exhibits erratic behavior, constantly changing its position and displaying sudden, rapid movements. The bright rays it emits are visible from a significant distance. The unsettling movements of this celestial anomaly evoke awe and fear among witnesses, leading them to interpret the event as an ominous sign. The occurrence coincides with a powerful earthquake that destroys the towers of Byzantium, aligning with the foreboding expectations associated with the phenomenon. While the description seems inconsistent with a typical comet, the possibility of confusion exists, as another comet was visible around the same time according to historical records.

73
Aug. 3, 989                                     Japan. A remarkable event unfolds as three bright objects in the sky undergo an extraordinary transformation, becoming luminous in an unusual manner. These three objects converge and meet at a singular point along their trajectories, creating a unique and intriguing celestial spectacle.

74
998                                             Budapest, Hungary. King Stephen (Istvan), the crowned King of Hungary from 997 to 1038, is reported to have experienced frequent aerial episodes. Documented by his biographer, Chartruiz, Bishop of Hungary, these events sometimes occurred spiritually and at other times physically. One instance, as recounted in Chartruis' Life of St. Stephen, describes the king being elevated into the air by the hands of angels while he was engaged in prayer within his tent.

75
999                                             Abbey of Saint-Leger, Cote d'Or, France. Rodulphus Glaber, a monk and chronicler, recounts a personal encounter with a disturbing apparition at the Abbey. During the night, before Matines, he witnessed a grotesque humanoid figure with peculiar features appear at the foot of his bed. The creature had a frail neck, black eyes, a wrinkled forehead, pointed ears, and other unsettling characteristics. The figure forcefully shook his bed and uttered the words, "You will not stay here any longer." Terrified, Glaber woke up and continued to see the figure, gnashing its teeth and repeating the same phrase. Disturbed by the encounter, he hurried to the monastery, confessing his sins and seeking solace at the altar of Saint Benedict.

76
Apr. 25, 1001                                   Foggia, Italy. The Count of Aviemore, seeking shelter in a rustic hut after a day of hunting, is roused from his sleep by frightened servants and friends. They report strange flashes and urge the hunters to flee, fearing a forest fire. Instead of joining them, the Count decides to investigate the phenomenon. Approaching the source of the flashes, he discovers a peculiar light and a luminous lady amidst the flashes, whom he identifies as the Virgin Mary. Witnessing the same vision, a farmer named Nicholas hears a request from the apparition for a place of worship to be established. The construction of a chapel at the site leads to the emergence of a pilgrimage center, eventually evolving into a monastery under the Verginiani and later the Cistercians. The basilica's recognition comes from Pope Paul VI on 31 May 1978.

77
1010                                            Ostium, Italy. Peter Damian, the Cardinal-Bishop of Ostium, documents an incident involving the abduction of a five-year-old nobleman's son. The child was taken from a monastery to a locked mill during the night, only to be found there the next morning. The boy recounted being carried by strangers to a grand feast and then placed into the mill through its roof. This early account highlights the theme of interactions between human witnesses and beings from another realm, which would later evolve into beliefs about fairies, elementals, and otherworldly creatures. The description of great feasts and abductees being offered food resonates with fairy folklore, while the act of being pulled through the roof finds parallels in modern UFO abduction accounts.

Jul. 7, 1015                                    Kyoto, Western Japan. The Director General of Saemonfu, part of the Royal Guard, recounts an event where he observed two stars converging at night. As they approached within approximately 10 meters of each other, small stars emerged from each of the larger stars and swiftly moved towards the opposite big star, only to return to their respective originating stars. Subsequently, the two primary stars swiftly departed, followed by the appearance of clouds that covered the sky. This extraordinary occurrence of celestial interaction, though noted in ancient times, had become a rarity, leaving a lasting impression on the witness due to its uncommon nature.

Fall, 1023                                      France. In the southern sky within the Sign of the Lion, a remarkable sight unfolds as two stars engage in a prolonged celestial ballet. Throughout the autumn season, the larger and more luminous star approaches from the east, while the smaller one approaches from the west. The smaller star exhibits furious and fearful movements, aggressively charging towards the larger star. However, the larger star's radiant mane serves as a defensive barrier, repelling the smaller star and forcing it to retreat far towards the east. This intricate and dynamic display of celestial interaction captivates observers during the autumn months.

1036                                            Taichang, China. In an intriguing event, a cloud reportedly descends from the sky, carrying a female entity identified as the goddess Zigu. The cloud enters the bedroom of Wang's daughter, and Zigu engages with the girl. The goddess possesses the ability to write and is described as remarkably attractive. Standing on a cloud that hovers beneath her feet, Zigu demonstrates effortless and swift movement. She offers the daughter an opportunity to travel with her, and when the girl agrees, clouds form in the courtyard to lift her. However, Zigu instructs the girl to remove her dusty shoes before ascending, and once done, the girl rises on the clouds, which carry her into the sky.

81
1045                                            England. During the reign of Emperor Henry III in Rome, an event is documented involving the abduction of a purported "witch" by a devil. The witch was reportedly drawn behind the devil on his horse with a frightful cry, then lifted into the air and carried away. The cries of the old woman were heard for several hours over a distance of nearly four miles in the country. This account aligns with a recurring theme of stories involving witches being transported through paranormal or non-human means, often associated with demonic entities.

82
1050                                            Vinland (Newfoundland). The Greenlanders Saga recounts an encounter involving Gudrid, who sat beside her son's cradle when a shadow fell across the doorway and a woman in a black dress entered. The woman had light-brown hair, large eyes, and introduced herself as Gudrid. As the two Gudrids conversed, a loud crack was heard, and the visiting woman vanished from sight. Simultaneously, a skirmish took place between a Skraling and a house carle of Karlsefne's, resulting in the Skraling's death. This incident, although debated as a possible ghost story rather than a UFO case, bears similarities to the contemporary motif of "Woman-in-black" encounters, aligning with narratives of modern alien visitations.

Apr. 14, 1054                                   Rome, Italy. On the day of Pope Leo IX's departure, a remarkable celestial event occurs around midday. Documented in the Tractatus de Ecclesia S. Petri Aldeburgensi, a bright and extraordinary circle appears in the sky, radiating brightness for about half an hour. This phenomenon is observed not only in Rome but also worldwide, symbolically believed to signify the Pope's worthiness of a heavenly crown. Although later suggested as a supernova, the Crab Nebula's recorded sighting by Chinese astronomers three months later brings into question the initial interpretation. The Flemish chronicler's description highlights the appearance of a bright disk-like shape, emphasizing the object's intense brightness and duration, while the document separates the observation from any specific belief system.

84
1059                                            Fanliang, China. In the midst of Emperor Jia You's reign, a remarkable sighting is documented by Chinese scholar Sheng Gua. A massive luminous pearl is observed under gloomy skies, making appearances over a ten-year period. This radiant object travels from the marshes of Tianchang district through Bishe Lake to eventually vanish into Xinkai Lake. The pearl's radiance is so intense that it illuminates the surroundings, and it even enlarges significantly at one point, emitting a white and silvery center that is almost blinding. The pearl's luminosity reaches faraway trees, casting shadows on the ground and lighting up the distant sky. Captivated by these appearances, the inhabitants construct a "Pearl Pavilion" in the town of Fanliang, where people from various places gather by boat, hoping for a glimpse of this enigmatic phenomenon.

1092                                            Drutsk and Polotsk, Ukraine. The year 1092 marked the first recorded instance of the Devil's Hunt phenomenon in folklore. In Drutsk, a massive sign resembling a large circle emerged in the sky, and shortly afterward, similar signs manifested in Polotsk. Mysterious sounds resembling the galloping of men on horseback were heard, causing fear and devastation. People in Polotsk were terrified by the nighttime noises of what were believed to be demons running through the streets, causing harm to anyone who ventured outside. Later, these entities appeared on horseback during the day, with only the hooves of their horses being visible. These events were associated with a period of dry weather, forest fires, and deaths, leading to the interpretation of demonic activity.

89
Jul. 1096                                       Japan.

1100                                            Germany. An account speaks of prodigious signs in the sun, the sky, and on the earth that ignited fervor for an upcoming Crusade. A priest named Suigger reported witnessing two knights engaged in an aerial battle, where one carried a large cross and ultimately triumphed. People in the fields claimed to have seen an airborne image of a city, with diverse troops converging on it from various directions. Many individuals displayed a divine imprint of the cross on their clothing, foreheads, or bodies, believing this marked their destined service to God.

92
Feb. 11, 1110                                   Pechorsky Monastery, Russia. A fiery omen took place at the Pechorsky monastery, where a pillar of fire reaching from the ground to the sky appeared. Lightning illuminated the earth, and thunder resounded in the first hour of the night. Initially, the fiery pillar hovered over the monastery dining room, obscuring the cross, and later moved to the church, then to Feodosiev's tomb. Eventually, it ascended to the top of the church, facing eastward, before vanishing. This phenomenon was believed to be an angelic apparition, consistent with angels often appearing as fiery columns or flames.

93
1130                                            Bohemia, Czechoslovakia. A recorded sighting describes a flying sign or "monster" resembling a flying serpent that appeared in the skies over Bohemia. This sighting is documented by two distinct historians. It's worth considering the possibility that this sighting could have been attributed to a natural phenomenon.

94
Aug. 12, 1133                                   Japan. A large silvery object reportedly descended close to the ground in a close encounter. However, due to the lack of an actual quote, the details of this case are uncertain and should be taken with reservations.

95
1142                                            Bohemia, Czechoslovakia. A sighting of a flying phenomenon resembling a "flying dragon" occurred over Bohemia, similar to a previous case from 1130. The nature of these reports suggests possible natural phenomena or misinterpretations.

1155                                            Rome, Italy. During the coronation of Federico Barbarossa by Pope Eugene III, three lights and a cross formed by stars were observed in the sky. This event took place during a significant historical moment and was marked by the appearance of these celestial phenomena.

97
1161                                            Thann, Alsace, France. In the village of Thann, three lights or luminous objects were witnessed in the sky by the Lord of Engelburg. This event occurred in conjunction with the theft of a relic from the body of Saint Ubald by a servant, who hid it in a walking stick planted next to a pine tree. The three aerial lights were observed hovering over the tree, and the next day, the servant found his stick immobilized. The phenomenon left a lasting impression, leading to the construction of a chapel to commemorate the event. To this day, the "cremation des trois sapins" celebration occurs annually in Thann, involving the burning of three fir-trees to honor the foundation legend.

98
Dec. 25, 1167                                   England. On Christmas Day, two "fiery stars" were observed in the western sky. According to Nicholas Trivetus' account in the Annales, one of the stars was large, and the other was small. Initially appearing as one unit, they later separated distinctly and remained visible for an extended period. The sighting, witnessed during the watch night (vigilia) of the Lord's Nativity, holds historical significance, although the exact location in England where this event took place remains uncertain.

99
1169                                            China. During a thunderstorm in the fifth year of the K'ien Tao era (now known as Qiandao), two dragons were witnessed engaged in a battle in the sky. As they departed, pearls resembling carriage wheels fell from the sky and landed on the ground. This event is recorded in the history of the Song Dynasty and highlights a remarkable celestial occurrence involving dragon-like creatures and the unusual appearance of pearls.

100
1171                                            Teruel, Aragon, Spain. During the Reconquest of Spain, King Alfonso II and his soldiers witnessed a perplexing event. While advancing towards Teruel, they observed a wandering bull accompanied by a luminous, star-like object in the sky. According to local tradition, this celestial phenomenon was interpreted as a sign, prompting the warriors to disregard the king's orders. Guided by their dreams and the enigmatic display, they established a new town by capturing the fortress of Teruel, an event that continues to be depicted on the town's emblem featuring a bull and a star. This blending of historical events and legendary symbolism underscores the significance of celestial occurrences in shaping historical narratives.

101
Jun. 18, 1178                                   Canterbury, England. Gervase of Canterbury documented a remarkable celestial event around an hour after sunset. Observers witnessed the upper horn of the bright new moon suddenly splitting into two, with a flaming torch erupting from the division point. The moon appeared to writhe and throb, emitting fire, hot coals, and sparks, a phenomenon that recurred multiple times and turned the moon blackish along its length. While some theories linked this event to the lunar crater Giordano Bruno's formation, later calculations challenged this explanation due to the potential catastrophic effects it would have had on Earth. The precise nature of the phenomenon witnessed by Gervase's contemporaries remains a mystery, raising questions about its true origin and implications.

102
Oct. 27, 1180                                   Kii Sanchi, Nara, Japan. Witnesses reported observing a luminous "earthenware vessel," potentially resembling a saucer, maneuvering in the sky between Kyushu's mountains. The object altered its trajectory, moving northeast towards Mount Fukuhara, then sharply changing course to the south before disappearing, leaving behind a glowing trail. The description hints at a possible unidentified flying object encounter during this historical event.

103
1182                                            Friesland, Holland.

1185                                            Mount Nyoigadake, Japan. Fishermen reported witnessing an unusual event where red beams appeared behind the mountain, followed by the sighting of a luminous wheel-like object flying across the sky and eventually entering the sea. This mysterious phenomenon caught the attention of the witnesses and remains an intriguing account of a pre-industrial anomalous sighting.

105
Aug. 9, 1189                                    Dunstaple, Bedfordshire, England. In the afternoon, numerous astonished observers witnessed a remarkable event as the sky seemed to "open up," revealing a large cross and the image of a crucified man, resembling church depictions of Christ. This awe-inspiring vision lingered in the clear atmosphere, captivating those who looked up. The cross eventually separated from the crucified figure, leaving a gap between them before vanishing entirely. Chronicler William of Newburgh documented this prodigious occurrence, alongside other accounts like those by writers Thomas Wykes, Wilhelmus Parvus, and Walther of Hermingford, in their historical and philosophical writings.

106
Jun. 7, 1193                                    London, England. On the 7th of June, around 6 o'clock, a dense black cloud emerged in the sky despite the clear sunshine. Within the heart of the cloud, an aperture formed, from which a brilliant white ball of light emerged. This luminous sphere remained suspended like a hovering orb beneath the dark cloud, positioned over the Thames River near the Bishop of Norwich's Palace.

107
Late Dec. 1200                                  Yorkshire, England. During the third year of King John's reign, an extraordinary phenomenon occurred in Yorkshire. Five moons were reported to have appeared in the sky, arranged in formation - one each in the East, West, North, and South, with the fifth moon positioned amidst the others. This central moon was surrounded by numerous blazing stars, and it encircled the other moons five or six times over the course of about an hour before disappearing shortly thereafter.

108
Sep. 14, 1224                                   Mount Alverne, Italy. Brother Leo's account describes a mystical event atop Mount Alverne. As St. Francis of Assisi engaged in conversation with an unseen entity, Brother Leo observed a suspended ball of light above him. During this interaction, voices exchanged questions and answers. St. Francis, in a humble manner, repeated inquiries about his identity and that of the divine. St. Francis extended his hand into his bosom thrice, reaching toward the light, which eventually vanished along with the conversation. This incident serves as a unique link between atmospheric lights, luminous ground-level orbs, and the concept of ethereal communication.

109
May. 3, 1232                                    Caravaca, Spain. Luminous occurrences accompanied the descent of a double-armed cross, believed to have been brought down by an entity resembling an angel. This event, steeped in religious significance, has endured as a legend, recounted by various authors. The 13th-century Franciscan Juan Gil (Egidio) de Zamora's account holds particular authority. He narrates that two angels conveyed the cross into the church. Presently, the fate of the original artifact is uncertain; the cross on display in Caravaca's sanctuary is a replica, as the original was likely stolen in 1934, potentially by a cult.

110
Oct. 2, 1235                                    Japan. At around 8 P.M. under clear skies, Suketoshi Abe, a fortune teller and advisor to Shogun Yoritsune Fujiwara, informed the palace of peculiar luminous phenomena observed in the southwest. These enigmatic lights were witnessed swaying and encircling in the sky throughout the night. In response, Yoritsune initiated an inquiry, engaging his astrology consultants skilled in astronomy. These experts dismissed the phenomenon as mere star movement caused by the wind, even suggesting that Abe should apologize. Yasutoki Houjo, a high-ranking government official, rejected this assertion.

1237                                            El Puig, Valencia. Over the course of four consecutive Saturdays, a sequence of seven unexplained lights manifested in the night sky. The lights appeared to descend from above, entering the earth at a specific location. As recounted in Tirso de Molina's Historia de la Orden de la Merced, these luminous stars descended atop the summit near the El Puig fortress. Guards stationed there reported the phenomenon to Pedro Nolasco and the mayor. Intrigued by the possible significance, they investigated the site and unearthed a hidden treasure: a bell and a sculpted image of the Virgin Mary. Grateful for these gifts, Nolasco later constructed an altar at the site, attributing the findings to angelic intervention or divine providence.

112
Jul. 24, 1239                                   France. During the evening twilight, in clear and serene skies, an extraordinary event unfolded. A large star-like object emerged, resembling a torch, ascending from the south. Alongside it, a substantial light emanated at a higher altitude. The object altered its course, shifting toward the north in the higher regions of the sky. The peculiar pattern of movement, distinct from natural occurrences, suggests that this phenomenon was not a conventional star but rather an anomalous sighting.

113
1252                                            Padua, Italy. Recorded in the Cronaca di Rolandino da Padova, an intriguing event is recounted by a witness. A massive star-like object, similar to a comet but without a tail, appeared as a remarkable and portentous phenomenon. Its size approached that of the moon, and it exhibited swifter movement than the moon, resembling the speed of falling stars. Lasting for an hour, the object disappeared after its observation. The description distinguishes it from comets or meteors, suggesting it was an exceptional and distinct occurrence.

114
Oct. 14, 1253                                   England. Nicholas of Findern relayed an extraordinary account to Burton Abbey. As vespers approached and the sky remained clear, a significant luminous star emerged from a dark cloud, accompanied by two smaller stars nearby. An intense celestial conflict unfolded, resembling a battle, with the smaller stars repeatedly engaging the larger one. This skirmish caused the prominent star to diminish in size, while sparks of fire emanated from the celestial combatants. This puzzling spectacle continued for a substantial duration, leaving onlookers both amazed and fearful. In their confusion and ignorance of its significance, the observers eventually fled the scene.

115
Sep. 12, 1271                                   Japan. At the stroke of midnight, Nichiren Shonin, one of Japan's prominent saints, was being led to the beach for execution. However, a momentous intervention occurred just before his impending fate. A radiant sphere, comparable in size to the moon, soared across the sky, illuminating the surroundings. The extraordinary sight struck fear into the hearts of the authorities, leading them to reconsider their decision to execute Shonin. Instead, they opted to exile him to Sado Island. Despite his exile, Shonin's teachings endured, and a branch of his doctrines, the Sokka-Gakkei, now boasts a substantial global following.

1273                                            Naples, Italy. During an illness that occurred around the year before his death, St. Thomas Aquinas returned to Naples for a brief stay. According to his biography, while he was there, two monks observed an unusual event. A substantial light, likened to a large star, entered the room through a window. This luminous entity briefly rested on the head of the ailing man before vanishing in the same manner it had appeared. While the connection with ufology is debated, researchers exploring abduction phenomena have shown heightened interest in such narratives.

117
Jun. 3, 1277                                    China. Liou Ying, a Yuan Dynasty poet, detailed an extraordinary dawn event in a poem titled "Event Seen at Dawn." The poet described witnessing a remarkably bright star crossing the Milky Way, followed by the appearance of three luminous objects in the southern sky. Two of these objects vanished, while the remaining one displayed five exceptional lights underneath and a dome-like structure above. The enigmatic object exhibited zigzag movement akin to a falling leaf, and a fiery object descended from the sky. As the sun rose, its radiance was obscured by the swift-moving luminous object heading north. A green cloud in the western sky was disturbed by another oval-shaped, flame-surrounded object that rapidly descended and ascended. Liou Ying documented this surreal occurrence, seeking explanation for the mesmerizing spectacle.

118
1284.                                           Saint Rufiino, Parma, Italy. The Chronicon Parmesan, authored by the Franciscan monk Salimbene de Adam, recounted a remarkable occurrence. On 6 August 1284, the naval battle of Meloria between Genoa and Pisa took place. However, in the town of Saint Rufiino, within Parma's diocese, some women engaged in washing linen at night observed an extraordinary event. Two sizable stars were seen approaching each other in the sky, then moving apart, only to collide again repeatedly, chasing one another. This celestial phenomenon appeared to foreshadow and announce the forthcoming battle and its tragic outcome between the Genoese and Pisan forces.

119
Aug. 3, 1294                                    Japan. Amidst a parade, an intriguing event unfolded. A red shining object emerged, seemingly originating from a shrine. Resembling the Moon, this object traversed the sky in a northerly direction. While the precise location remains unspecified, this sighting of a luminous and enigmatic object during a public event offers a glimpse into historical anomalous occurrences.

120
May. 1295                                       Hing, China. In the fifth month of the year yih-wei, an unusual event transpired. A phenomenon characterized by a powerful wind riding on the water occurred, reaching considerable heights. Subsequently, more than ten fireballs, resembling houses in size, descended from the sky. These fireballs were described as dragons. In response to their descent, two dragons swiftly ascended to the sky, driven away by sacred fire sent by Heaven, supposedly to prevent potential calamity. Cheu Mih, the 14th-century chronicler, noted another incident involving a dragonfall, during which a dragon fell and was subsequently burned by terrestrial fire, indicating the dragons' aversion to fire.

121
Sep. 8, 1296                                    Loreto, Italy. In the period before dawn, an extraordinary event unfolded in the skies over Loreto. Repeatedly, enigmatic globes of light manifested, displaying a peculiar behavior of descending, stopping, and suddenly vanishing. This phenomenon was observed by a hermit named Paul Selva, who later documented his experiences in a letter addressed to Charles II in June 1297. These luminous manifestations took on an elliptical shape. Mantovano, a writer who sourced information from records dating back to 1300, described the phenomenon as a brilliantly bright comet-like object, measuring twelve feet in length and six in width. However, the object's characteristics clearly distinguished it from a conventional comet.

122
Dec. 24, 1299                                   Tier (Treves), Germany. The Chronicle of the Archbishops of Trier, known as the Gesta Trevirensium Archiepiscoporum, documents an intriguing celestial occurrence. Employing the term "cometa," which could signify various luminous sky objects rather than solely a comet as defined today, the chronicle describes an unusual phenomenon. Just past midnight, during misty and frosty conditions, a comet-like object emerged in the sky, resembling the size of the moon and radiating a fiery red hue. This object persisted for an hour before vanishing. Subsequently, two more comets manifested in quick succession, positioned near each other and resembling the earlier one in size and color. These too swiftly disappeared. A third appearance followed after a brief interval, mirroring its predecessors in size and color, and similarly vanished promptly. The peculiar behavior of these objects deviates from conventional celestial patterns.

123
1320                                            Saint Leonard, Durham, England. Following the passing of the Abbott of Saint Gregory monastery, a remarkable occurrence unfolded. An unidentified object, described as "a great light," illuminated the sky above his burial site in Saint Leonard. This luminous phenomenon initially hovered at a higher altitude before descending, moving away, and ultimately vanishing. The event's symbolic significance and interpretation leave room for debate regarding its potential connection to ufology or other mysterious phenomena.

124
Nov. 4, 1322                                    Uxbridge, England. During the first hour of the night, a remarkable celestial event occurred over Uxbridge. A pillar of fire, resembling a small boat in size, appeared in the sky with a pale and livid hue. This column of light ascended from the south, traversed the heavens with deliberate and solemn movement, and proceeded northward. A fervent red flame emerged from the front of the pillar, accompanied by intense beams of light. The object's speed increased as it flew through the air, leading to reported collisions and the sounds of impactful crashes in the distance. The object's slow and deliberate motion contradicts characteristics of comets or meteors, raising questions about its nature.

125
1347                                            Florence, Italy. Approximate date. During the period of the Black Plague between 1347 and 1350, strange cigar-shaped objects are reported to have been observed crossing the sky at a leisurely pace, sometimes flying at low altitudes and emitting a disconcerting mist. Writer Gianfranco degli Esposti suggests a connection between these objects and the outbreak of the Black Plague, noting that the epidemic emerged soon after these unusual sightings. In Florence, a vast mass of vapors emerged from the northern sky, subsequently spreading across the land. Additionally, many animals reportedly fell from the sky in the East during the same year, releasing decaying carcasses that contributed to foul air and the rapid spread of the deadly disease. The Black Plague claimed a significant number of lives, particularly in Florence where it caused the death of 60,000 people.

Jul. 20, 1349.                                  Japan. In an unspecified location, two luminous objects materialized in the sky, emerging respectively from the southeast and northwest. These objects engaged in a dramatic and forceful collision, seemingly performing intricate maneuvers, including acrobatic movements, while emitting flashes of light. The nature of this unusual event, characterized by the appearance and interaction of these shining objects, remains enigmatic and intriguing.

127
Feb. 5, 1355                                    Suzhou (Pingjiang), Jiangsu province, China. A puzzling event occurred, marked by a significant noise originating from the sky. This phenomenon was accompanied by the sighting of a large, black cloud illuminated by flames and lights. The cloud was peculiarly laden with what appeared to be troops. This anomalous occurrence also resulted in substantial physical destruction. The enigmatic nature of these events raises questions about their origin and purpose.

Summer, 1360                                    England and France. During this season, in desolate regions of both England and France, a peculiar phenomenon unfolded. Two towers suddenly materialized in the sky, visible to many. From these towers emerged two distinct armies. One of these armies bore a warlike emblem on their headgear, while the other was clad in black. A subsequent encounter saw the warrior forces triumphing over the black-clad contingent, before returning to their respective tower. The entire spectacle then disappeared, leaving behind a baffling and unexplained event of armies and towers in the sky.

129
1361                                            Yamaguchi Prefecture, Western Japan. An intriguing account describes an incident where a drum-shaped object, measuring around six meters in diameter, emerged from the sea. This enigmatic object took flight, passing overhead in a westerly direction. While an exact reference to this event has not been identified, its widespread mention across databases and websites has contributed to its inclusion within anomalous sighting records. The peculiar nature of a drum-like object emerging from the sea and taking flight raises questions about the event's origin and meaning.

Feb. 1382                                       Paris, France. In the lead-up to the Maillets uprising, an extraordinary event unfolded. Over a span of eight days, a fiery and flashing globe of light was observed. This luminous phenomenon exhibited a unique behavior, moving from door to door above the city of Paris. Notably, this roaming globe did not coincide with any wind agitation, lightning, or thunderous noise. Despite its dazzling presence, the weather remained consistently calm and serene throughout this remarkable occurrence.

131
1384                                            Caravaca, Spain. In 1384, an unusual occurrence involving aerial lights took place. As the Caravaca cross was being transported from the village of Caravaca in Murcia to Lorca y Totan, two lights in the sky were observed accompanying the cross-bearers throughout the journey. These lights persisted until the cross was in its intended location, suggesting a connection between the lights and the holy relic. The Caravaca cross itself was surrounded by various legends and stories of miraculous events, including teleportation and instances of attracting luminous phenomena.

132
Jul. 15, 1385                                   London and Dover, England. A remarkable event occurred simultaneously in both London and Dover. Following sunset, a peculiar phenomenon manifested in the southern skies, resembling a head-shaped fire. This fiery shape extended towards the northern part of the heavens and then proceeded to divide itself into three distinct parts. These segments of light exhibited movement akin to a bird in flight. Eventually, the three parts merged back into one, and the entire spectacle vanished suddenly. The nature and behavior of these lights remain mysterious and unexplained.

133
Oct. 14, 1387                                   Leicester and Derbyshire, England. A remarkable phenomenon akin to fire was observed in multiple locations across the kingdom of England. This appearance displayed varying forms, shifting from one to another, over the course of several months, particularly in November and December. The diverse forms included a burning revolving wheel, a round barrel emitting flames from above, and a long fiery beam. This phenomenon persisted through a substantial part of the winter, with heightened activity notably observed in the counties of Leicester and Northants. The true nature of this event, marked by its fire-like shapes, remains enigmatic.

134
1390                                            Bologna, Italy. A peculiar incident is reported involving an observer of the Asinelli Tower. The guardian of the tower reportedly witnessed a rotating "ball of fire" hovering above the roofs. Intriguingly, within this fiery object, the faces of some devils were discerned, seemingly attempting to peer outside. The nature and origin of this phenomenon, characterized by the presence of unknown creatures and a fiery vehicle, remain shrouded in mystery, offering a glimpse into the enigmatic anomalies witnessed during that time.

135
Jan. 26, 1390                                   Messina, Sicily, Italy. An intriguing event occurred in Messina during the night hours. An unusual sight was witnessed as a light descended from the sky above the Cross, positioned atop the dome of the Monastery of the Fathers of St. Salvadore. This phenomenon left the monks in astonishment, though the exact duration of the sighting was uncertain. The light, observed for around half an hour, eventually ascended back into the heavens. Given the prolonged duration and distinct behavior, this event stands out as uncommon and distinct from typical meteor phenomena.

136
Winter, 1394                                    England. Historical accounts, including Raphael Holinshed's chronicle, report a strange phenomenon in various parts of England. During the night, a fiery apparition resembling a wheel or barrel of fire was seen by many. This enigmatic object exhibited peculiar behavior, often accompanying individuals and remaining stationary when they did. The descriptions vary, depicting the object as a turning wheel, a round barrel emitting flames at its head, or even a long burning lance. The nature of this phenomenon, with its persistent presence and distinctive attributes, contrasts with typical meteoric occurrences.

137
Sep. 2, 1394                                    Forli, Italy. During the second hour of the night, observers in Forli witnessed an immense celestial object, referred to as an "asub," moving slowly across the sky. The event lasted for approximately the time it would take to say two "Paternoster" prayers. Witnesses reported a distinct smell resembling burning wood, and some accounts even mentioned the object remaining stationary in the sky for a period of time. The unusual characteristics of the sighting and its duration make it unlikely to be a conventional astronomical or meteorological occurrence.

138
1395                                            Languedoc, France. Witnesses reported a peculiar aerial event where a large star and five smaller ones were observed in the sky. The smaller stars appeared to engage in a sort of combat with the larger one, chasing it for about half an hour. An audible voice was also heard from the sky. During the event, a figure resembling a man made of copper was seen, wielding a spear and emitting fire. This figure apparently grabbed the large star, struck it, and following this interaction, the phenomenon ceased. The strange and detailed nature of the account makes it unlikely to be a typical astronomical occurrence.

139
Sep. 16, 1408                                   Rome, Italy. Three "stars" were observed flying over Rome in a formation. Antonio Di Pietro, a Vatican canon, documented the incident in his Diarium Romanum (Diary of Rome), noting that the event occurred after sunset. One large, beautiful star appeared to originate from the sky of Tarrione, moving towards Castel Sant' Angel, accompanied by two smaller, bright stars. The spectacle left observers greatly surprised. While the phenomenon could be interpreted as an unconventional meteor train, the simultaneous appearance of multiple bright objects flying in formation adds an unusual element to the account.

140
Jul. 1420                                       Castle Godego, Treviso, Italy. Hungarian merchant Peter Tagliamento was leading cattle to Bassano del Grappa when he lost his way in a dense area near Castel di Godego. Amid shadows and silence, he prayed for help and was suddenly greeted by a brilliant light. In this light, he saw a beautiful young woman who guided him to the road and requested the construction of a chapel at the site. She left a cross in the ground as evidence of her visit. Though met with skepticism at first, the cross's discovery convinced the community of Godego to build the chapel, becoming a focal point for solemn processions.

141
Mar. 3, 1428                                    Forli, Italy. Around 1:30 A.M., a fiery lamp resembling a tower-shaped flame was observed in the sky for approximately two hours. The city archives also document the sighting of a very high flame resembling a column of fire ascending into the air.

Jan. 5, 1433                                    Nice, France. A luminous globe appeared in the sky and remained visible for several hours. This phenomenon was reported by Abbe Joseph Bonifacy, who noted the presence of the luminous globe in the air on that specific date.

143
Jun. 1444                                       Bibbiena, Arezzo, Italy. Witnesses reported sightings of unexplained golden globes of light over a period of three months. These lights were observed both inside and outside a church. Don Massimo, a Benedictine monk, documented the sightings and described the globes as thick as a printing press. Lorenzo Piovano of Bibbiena also witnessed the lights, which emitted a remarkable sweetness. While some individuals did not see the lights, they did notice the distinctive scent described by witnesses.

144
May. 29, 1453                                   Constantinople. During the siege by the Turks, a phenomenon of descending fire from the sky was witnessed every night over the city. Initially interpreted as a sign of God's wrath and impending destruction, the Christians later perceived it as a sign of divine support due to their early success against the Turks. The phenomenon's behavior changed on the night before the Turks were planning to lift the siege – the heavenly sign appeared to be far away, scattered quickly, and then vanished, leading the sultan and his court to experience joy.

145
Late Dec. 1456                                  Piacenza, Italy. The Annali Piacentini by Antonio da Ripalta records the appearance of four remarkable stars that moved from east to west in a configuration almost resembling a cross.

146

Between Saint Remy's day (October 1st) and All Saints' Day (November 1st), numerous large and marvelous firebrands were observed in the air, lasting for about 7.5 minutes each time and seen twice. Some witnesses also reported seeing what appeared to be a battle with accompanying noise. While the meteor showers Draconids and Orionids could have caused the visual phenomenon, the reported noise and uproar suggest a more complex event.

148
Nov. 1, 1461                                    Arras, France. On All Saints Day, an unusual object resembling burning steel was witnessed in the sky. It was as large as half the moon and remained stationary for fifteen minutes before starting to spiral upwards, then rolling and spinning like a loose watch spring. The object eventually disappeared into the sky.

149

An accompanying engraving in Lycosthenes' edition depicts the scene, although it's uncertain whether the image was specifically created for the book or reused from other sources.

153
1479                                            Arabia. A pointed object resembling a "comet" is observed in the sky. An engraving accompanies the account, but there are doubts about its authenticity and origin, as it looks similar to drawings of multi-stage rockets developed around the same period. The illustration's source and accuracy remain uncertain.

154
Oct. 18, 1482                                   Albisola, Savona Province, Italy. During a territorial dispute between the villages of Albisola and Stella, a dazzling white cloud appeared in a clear sky. The cloud emitted intense light, seemingly collecting all sunlight, and a clear, sweet voice repeated the word "peace" three times. This sudden phenomenon halted the ongoing battle as fighters were stunned and astonished by the event, leading them to abandon their weapons.

155
Aug. 1487                                       Forli, Italy. Early in the morning, a large star-like object appeared in the sky, resembling a flying butterfly. Witnesses, including peasants with loaded carts heading to Forli, observed this phenomenon as it moved from the mountains towards Ravenna. The object was also described as resembling a floating cartwheel. The event lasted only a short time, intriguing those who saw it and sparking discussions among the witnesses about its nature.

156
1491                                            Vladimir, Russia. A remarkable event occurred in the city of Vladimir, where witnesses reported seeing a frightful and awe-inspiring apparition in the sky. The event involved the appearance of a figure resembling the Saint Grand Prince Alexander Nevsky rising in the air above a stone church and the abbot's residence. This figure was seen on a white horse, surrounded by a bright, white cloud or thin smoke. The spectacle left the observers frightened, prompting the ringing of bells throughout the city. The event was interpreted as a sign of divine wrath, urging people towards repentance.

157
Aug. 13, 1491                                   Milan, Italy. Philosopher Facius Cardan had an encounter with seven enigmatic figures in his study. According to his son Jerome, who recorded the event, these beings appeared dressed in silken garments similar to Greek togas, with radiant breastplates and unique undergarments of crimson color. Two of them, seemingly of higher status, were dressed distinctively. These figures claimed to be composed of air and subject to birth and death, though their lifespans exceeded those of humans, potentially reaching three hundred years. During their interaction, they discussed various philosophical topics, including the nature of the universe and the mortality of the soul. The encounter lasted for more than three hours and left Cardan with profound insights and intriguing perspectives.

158
Oct. 11, 1492                                   Guanahany, Bahamas. Christopher Columbus and a crew member observed a small light two hours before midnight. Columbus initially saw the light on the quarter-deck, but it appeared so diminutive that he hesitated to confirm it as land. He called upon Pero Gutierrez and Rodrigo Sanchez of Segovia to witness the light, but only Gutierrez could see it from his vantage point. The light seemed to move like a flickering candle, prompting speculation that it might indicate the presence of land. Columbus was convinced that land was nearby and urged his crew to keep a vigilant watch for it. He offered a reward, including a silken jacket, to the first person who spotted land, in addition to the King and Queen's promised annuity.

159
1494                                            Apulia, Italy. During the arrival of King Charles VIII in Naples, three suns were reportedly observed in the night sky amidst a cloud-covered backdrop.

During Pedro Alvares Cabral's expedition, a luminous object was observed in the southern sky for 8 minutes as they sailed around Africa. The object's appearance was followed by a hurricane that caused significant damage to the expedition. While six ships were lost, the remaining seven continued their journey to the Americas, eventually bringing back valuable spices and news of the discovery of Brazil and Madagascar.

162
1501                                            Between Urbino and Gubbio, central Italy. In 1501, a phenomenon described as a "horrible appearance in the stormy sky" was witnessed between Urbino and Gubbio. This event was reported by the Florentine physician Antonio Benivieni, who noted that it caused many abortions. The description of this event as a "monstrous" occurrence is reminiscent of historical UFO sightings, suggesting a possible connection to unidentified flying objects.

163
Sep. 29, 1504                                   Tirano, Val Poschiavo, Italy. Mario Omodei experienced a remarkable event in his garden at dawn. He was surrounded by a bright light, heard a voice calling his name, and was lifted from the ground. He found himself transported to a location owned by Alojsio Quadrio, where he encountered an even more dazzling vision that he interpreted as the Virgin Mary. This luminous apparition, resembling a 14-year old girl, instructed him to build a temple dedicated to her. The temple was eventually completed in 1513 and consecrated in 1528, following this extraordinary encounter.

164
Mar. 19, 1509                                   Villefranche-du-Rouergue. A man named Collongis encountered an extraordinary event while attempting to free a stuck cart in a river. After praying, he witnessed a being surrounded by blinding light, accompanied by twelve other figures that he interpreted as the Virgin Mary and the Apostles. These figures walked on thirteen stones used for crossing the river and then disappeared to the West. Miraculously, as they vanished, Collongis found that his cart had been freed from the mud. This event led to the establishment of the Chapel of the Thirteen Stones on July 1, 1510, following an investigation by the bishop of Rodez.

165
1513                                            Rome, Italy. The renowned sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti reported sighting a triangular light with three distinct tails of varying colors. This remarkable event, witnessed on a calm night, led Michelangelo to paint an image of the phenomenon. Unfortunately, the painting has not survived over time. According to the account in Benedictine chronicler Benedetto Lushino's book "Vulnera Diligentis," the triangular sign resembled a star with a silvery tail, a red tail, and a fiery and bifurcated third tail.

166
Nov. 8, 1517                                    Moldavia, Romania. A significant event occurred when a prominent blue sign resembling a human face appeared in the sky. The 17th-century Moldavian chronicler Grigore Ureche documented this occurrence, describing the face-like object shining brightly in the sky. After a period of remaining motionless, the object eventually concealed itself once more within the sky.

167
Apr. 1518                                       Yucatan, Mexico. Spanish conquistador Juan de Grijalva reported a remarkable event where a star-like object appeared above their ship in the evening. The object exhibited movement and emitted continuous rays of light as it moved toward a nearby town or village, leaving a visible trail in the air that endured for three hours. This extraordinary sighting, accompanied by other clear signs, led the crew to interpret it as a divine message, signaling the divine will for them to settle in the village of Coatzalcoalco.

168
1520                                            Hereford, England. An anomalous event involving thermal effects occurred in which a massive beam of fire was witnessed in the sky. As it descended towards the Earth, its intense heat caused damage to various objects. Subsequently, the fiery beam ascended back into the sky, transforming its appearance into that of a circular ring of fire. This unusual sighting, documented by Lycosthenes in his Prodigiorum ac Ostentorum Chronicon, left an impression of both wonder and mystery.

169
1521                                            Cuenca, Spain. Dr. Eugenio Torralba had a remarkable encounter with an entity named "Zekiel" who imparted secrets and knowledge to him. This being allegedly flew Torralba to Rome, leading to his fame and medical success. Cervantes even mentioned Torralba in Don Quijote for his extraordinary journey. However, Torralba's association with Zekiel attracted the attention of the Inquisition, which accused him of heretical practices. Torralba was arrested in 1528, subjected to torture, and imprisoned. Despite his release and the condition to avoid contact with Zekiel, the episode remained a mixture of blessing and curse in his life.

170
1523                                            Changsu, Jiangsu Province, China. A fascinating account is documented in the Chinese book "Stories in a Summerhouse of Flowers" by Qiu Fuzuo. The story tells of a teacher named Lii Yu who witnessed two large ships flying over the clouds during incessant rain. These ships carried two tall men, each twelve feet tall, dressed in multicolored clothes and holding poles. The men's actions left observers speechless, and they even turned the scholars' mouths black with a gesture. A figure resembling an old scholar emerged on one of the ships, escorted by a bonze, and the ships eventually departed, leaving a lasting impression on those who witnessed the event.

171
1526                                            Rome, Italy. Inquisitor Paulus Grillandus recounted a tale of demonic transportation involving a countryman in Rome. The man's wife participated in a witch gathering and later transported him through two he-goats. At the gathering, he witnessed famous individuals pledging allegiance to the Devil, engaging in dances and banquets. When he accidentally uttered the word "God" and requested salt, everything vanished. He found himself naked near Benevento, far from Rome, and eventually returned home. This account illustrates the complex beliefs surrounding supernatural experiences and the differing perspectives of medieval demonologists, from skeptics attributing such events to mental illusions to "true believers" embracing the supernatural. Some contemporary researchers speculate that similar phenomena might occur in altered states of consciousness rather than the physical world.

172
1528                                            Utrecht, Netherlands. A yellow object with a cross-like appearance was observed in the sky during the siege of Utrecht. This phenomenon created panic among the town's inhabitants while the attackers interpreted it as a positive omen for their impending success. The sky sign, resembling a cross of a yellowish color, had a terrible aspect and was associated with the symbol of Burgundy. This event illustrates how celestial occurrences could influence the emotions and beliefs of people during historical conflicts, shaping their perceptions and expectations.

173
Oct. 9, 1528                                    Westrie, Northern Germany. A terrifying and unusual sighting was recorded by Pierre Boaistuau in his Histoires Prodigieuses. Ambroise Paré described a blood-red 'comet' that emerged from the east and was visible for about an hour and fifteen minutes, disappearing towards midday. This object caused panic and illness among the populace, leading to deaths due to fear. The 'comet' had a distinctive appearance with an arm holding a great sword pointing downwards, accompanied by stars and a multitude of axes, blades, and repulsive human faces.

174
Aug. 1533                                       Peru. Garcilaso de la Vega, the Incan, documented the sighting of an unusual greenish-black 'comet' in his work Historic General del Peru. This comet had distinctive features, being narrower than a man's body and longer than a pike, and was observed by many witnesses on multiple occasions at night. The sight of this mysterious object intensified Tupac Huallpa's fear of his own death, as a similar phenomenon had been seen before his father's death. Despite being accustomed to heavenly phenomena, Huallpa found this 'comet' to be different from the ordinary kind. Tragically, Tupac Huallpa was executed on 29 August 1533.

175
May. 31, 1536                                   Monte Stella, Brescia, Lombardy, Italy. Antonio de' Antoni, a deaf-mute shepherd from Gardone Val Trompia, was reciting the rosary when he witnessed an intense light. Within this light, the Virgin Mary appeared, holding Jesus in her arms. She appeared dressed simply and conveyed a message to the shepherds that they should build a temple at that location. Antonio shared the experience with others, and upon his return, the site was illuminated by the beams of an overhead star. Pope Paul III granted the location a consecrated status, and a temple was constructed there by 1539.

Procession of lights: In the midst of the inquisition's attention, Juan Munoz, a tailor from Santander, testified about an anomalous sighting in Bayarcal. Around Christmas time at midnight in 1667, he observed a cross followed by a banner, and four wick-like lights that flickered on and off. Initially assuming it to be the Viaticum carried by a priest, the lights appeared exceptionally bright. Munoz walked closer as the lights moved, eventually reaching a point fifteen steps away. Anxious about what he saw, he went home, only to witness the lights passing by the church as he closed the door. Despite his initial reluctance, he shared the experience with neighbors who revealed similar sightings in the past, often interpreted as signs commemorating local martyrs' lives. The event was considered significant due to Munoz's unfamiliarity with the phenomenon upon his arrival, indicating its existence beyond imagination, and similar light processions were reported across Spain and Europe, varying in size and location.

285
Apr. 1670                                       Countryside near London, England.

Unknown planetoid orbiting Venus: Giovanni Domenico Cassini, the renowned astronomer and director of the Paris Observatory, noted an enigmatic finding on this date. He observed what appeared to be a potential satellite orbiting Venus, but he refrained from publicizing this discovery until its confirmation in 1686 upon seeing the object again. The mysterious satellite was subsequently identified as "Neith," marking a significant observation in the history of planetary exploration.

288
Feb. 8, 1672                                    Off Cherbourg, France. Triple sky ships: Captain Isaac Guiton recounted an extraordinary sighting at sea. A "star" descended and divided into two distinct "ships," with a third vessel emerging later. The description details how the star initially appeared overhead, then descended towards the north, leaving a trail of smoke that transformed into two ships, each featuring lights and furled sails. These ships sailed southward, spaced around four feet apart, and eventually a third ship emerged between them, appearing larger and entirely black. This middle ship, without sails but with masts and ropes, assumed a northward orientation as if at anchor. The entire spectacle lasted over half an hour before the ships vanished without a trace, leaving the witnesses in awe.

289

Witnesses observed a swift-moving, elongated "dark cloud" traveling in a direction from the north to the southeast, akin to an arrow's trajectory. The description provided distinguishes this sighting from typical meteors, which are luminous and often described as "fiery," suggesting that this particular occurrence did not conform to the characteristics of a meteor.

291
May. 23, 1676                                   London, England. Spiritual writer Jane Lead recorded a peculiar experience in her diary, recounting the presence of three enigmatic figures in her bedroom. The first figure, appearing as a youthful presence, startled her, rendering her speechless. A second, more mature and masculine figure, sought familiarity but remained silent before vanishing. Lastly, a comely and attractive figure emerged, though her spiritual constraints prevented interaction. Though some might interpret this as a manifestation of schizophrenia, today's perspective could liken it to a classic "bedroom visitation" by extraterrestrial beings found in contemporary abduction literature.

292
Jul. 16, 1676                                   London, England. Spiritual writer Jane Lead observed a remarkable celestial event, describing it as an azure blue firmament with an extraordinary eye at its center, radiating flaming streams. She found it challenging to depict the exact form, but conveyed an image of a flaming eye within a circular rainbow, accompanied by countless stars in the sky. Although her language is reminiscent of 17th-century mysticism, her account appears to detail a luminous, eye-shaped object with radiant streams that traversed the London sky on a sunny day. Her drawing suggests an oval or eye-like object emitting fiery light, encircled by a substantial "Globe of Light," possibly distinct from a simple ring or rainbow.

293
Sep. 20, 1676                                   Uffington Fields, England. An extraordinary event unfolded as witnesses in Northamptonshire observed a peculiar fiery meteor resembling a dart. The meteor exhibited an unusual wavy and vibrating movement as it traveled across the sky, with its stem initially appearing to be around a foot and a half in length and emitting a slender stream of light, akin to a cord. The sighting, reported around 7 P.M., lasted approximately one minute. Mr. Gibbon, an observer from Peterborough, detailed the meteor's distinctive behavior and appearance, noting its motion towards Uffington Fields after he spotted it at the zenith.

294
Mar. 22, 1677                                   London, England. Spiritual writer Jane Lead recounted a nocturnal experience in which she felt transported into a wilderness during a magical sleep. Initially surrounded by tranquil nature, the serenity was disrupted by the presence of three entities, including a fierce female who pricked her skin akin to a sharp needle. Seeking celestial aid, Lead managed to ward off these beings and the encounter concluded. She later learned through the vision that there was no need for concern, as such an event would not recur.

295
Dec. 30, 1677                                   At sea West of Granada, Spain. Pierre Boutard, an officer on the ship La Maligne, documented an extraordinary sighting in the ship's logbook. Around 4 in the morning, a brilliant "star" appeared in the northwest, moving to the southeast, emanating intense light that deceived the crew into thinking there was a widespread fire. The celestial object was accompanied by over 200 rays, intensifying the dazzling effect and causing distress among the crew. The ship eventually anchored in Grenada's small bay between 9 and 10 in the morning.

296
Feb. 9, 1678                                    London, England. Jane Lead's diary entry describes an anomalous sighting where she awoke in a disoriented state and found herself surrounded by unfamiliar figures in a silent place. She experienced a sense of detachment from her corporeal body and observed a gold-colored craft resembling a large ship with four golden wings descending swiftly. Although Lead questioned the figures about what she saw, they claimed not to see it. The ship landed, and Lead felt herself leaping and dancing with joy. Eventually, the ship ascended and disappeared, after which Lead returned to her physical senses. This account bears similarities to modern UFO abduction experiences, challenging the notion that such stories are confined to contemporary times.

This sighting occurred while Venus was situated as a morning "star," positioned at a heliocentric longitude of 59° and an elongation of 38°. The enigmatic object, later named "Neith," appeared to be roughly 1/10th the diameter of Venus and displayed a similar phase. This marked Cassini's second sighting of the object, sparking intrigue in the scientific community.

301
Jun. 1688                                       Yunan Province, China. Approximate date. an anomalous sighting occurred involving a sizable yellow "umbrella-like" entity. This object ascended from a ridge, emitting numerous lights, and subsequently descended again. According to an account from that time, during the 27th year of Emperor Kangxi's reign in the Qing dynasty, a person named Bixilin observed this phenomenon while in the mountains near Kunmin. Regularly around noon, under clear weather conditions, the object, resembling a brilliant yellow canopy, gradually rose above the ridge, emitting dazzling lights. Due to its radiance, direct viewing was challenging. The object would rise and then vanish into the clouds, only to reappear later, repeating its ascent and descent. Interestingly, the object's luminosity diminished after sunset, eventually fading away completely in the darkened sky.

The globes, with one in the center and two flanking, appeared to hover at different heights. As the priest observed in awe, two additional lights emerged, slightly higher in the sky, and ultimately combined with the central globe before disappearing, prompting the priest to express gratitude for the remarkable marvel he had witnessed.

312
Aug. 1700                                       Sahalahti, Eastern Finland. In a peculiar incident, an elderly blacksmith named Tiittu allegedly vanished following the appearance of a flying disk over the village. Tiittu's son embarked on a search and encountered a being resembling a "bear," who informed him that his father had flown away. Subsequently, the villagers observed a large hovering disk above the village, which stirred fears of an impending apocalypse. For two days, the villagers engaged in religious practices, expressing their anxieties. Later, Tiittu's son encountered the "bear" again, who reassured him that his father had been taken to a superior world by the sky ship. The event sparked community discussions, yet a new priest dismissed it as a product of drunken imaginations and urged the villagers to forget the incident.

313

317
Dec. 18, 1707                                   Southern coast of England. A massive cylindrical object accompanied by an unusual cloud was observed moving alongside nocturnal lights near the low horizon. According to the account of "the Worshipful Charles Kirkham, Esq.," the phenomenon appeared as a horizontally oriented, dark cylindrical cloud that divided the sky's brightness into roughly equal halves. Despite brisk winds, the cloud remained relatively stationary until a sudden brightening occurred within it, culminating in the emergence of pale-colored flames. The flames subsided within half a minute, leaving the cloud's original position unchanged, creating a profoundly eerie and astonishing spectacle.

318

An extraordinary event unfolded during the evening hours near Tallinn, where two large dark clouds were observed engaging in a unique form of combat. Numerous smaller swift clouds were also present. The incident, documented in official records and ship logbooks, occurred on the second day of Easter around 9:00 P.M. The sky featured a dense black cloud with a broad base and pointed top that ascended rapidly, creating an angle of elevation of almost half a right angle in less than three minutes. Concurrently, a brilliant comet emerged towards the west-northwest at an angle of about 12 degrees above the horizon. Another dark cloud emerged from the north and converged with the first cloud, generating a luminous column between them. This column remained stationary for several minutes before the second cloud swiftly traversed through it, resulting in a collision that produced fiery smoke lasting around fifteen minutes. The phenomenon concluded with the emergence of numerous bright arrows reaching an altitude of 80 degrees above the horizon.

320
Mar. 6, 1717                                    Southwest of Martinique (at sea). An intriguing incident occurred where a solid object resembling a ship's mast was observed hovering approximately two feet above the water's surface. Captain Chevalier de Ricouart, commanding the frigate La Valeur, recorded the event in his log. The sighting took place around 2:00 in the morning as the ship was heading southeast. The object's presence, resembling a mast, was notable for its unusual behavior as it moved alongside the ship at a low elevation above the water.

321
Mar. 19, 1719                                   Oxford, England. A perplexing sight unfolded in the night sky, as a remarkably bright object with whitish and blue hues was observed moving from the west in a straight path at 8:15 P.M. The object's motion, slower than that of a typical meteor, caught the attention of multiple witnesses across England. Notably, physicist Sir H. Sloane, the Vice-President of the Royal Society, reported seeing the object traverse more than 20 degrees of the sky in "less than half a minute." Despite its classification as a meteor, the object's unusually leisurely speed adds an intriguing dimension to the phenomenon.

322
Jan. 16, 1721                                   Bern, Switzerland. At night, a towering Pillar of Fire was observed above the nearby mountains to the west of the city. Gradually approaching the city, the pillar eventually burst with minimal noise. Subsequently, three distinct Fire Globes emerged from the burst, each choosing a unique path before vanishing.

323
Oct. 29, 1726                                   Vilvoorde, Brabant, Belgium. At around nine o'clock in the evening, a series of alarming and peculiar meteors were witnessed in the sky. These meteors, resembling lightning, emerged from the clouds and swiftly vanished. Their appearance evoked a strong sense of terror. While the possibility of an aurora borealis cannot be ruled out due to limited details, the nature of the sighting remains enigmatic.

324

The incident presents a peculiar narrative of strangers arriving from the sky, adding to the realm of unexplained phenomena.

325
Oct. 1, 1729                                    Noes, Uppland, Sweden. Approximately two hours before sunrise, M. Suen-Hof witnessed red vapors in the sky forming expansive bands from north to south. Subsequently, these vapors coalesced into a fiery globe measuring around two feet in diameter. Emitting sun-like brightness and sparks, the globe followed the path of the earlier red vapors. Covering a quarter of the sky, the globe vanished suddenly, accompanied by dense black smoke and a cannon-like sound. The incident stands as a remarkable account of an anomalous fiery phenomenon.

326
Nov. 2, 1730                                    Salamanca, Spain. Witnessed by Torres, an astonishing event occurred at 11:30 P.M. An enormous building-sized Globe of fire manifested, accompanied by two luminous beams on either side. These beams exhibited dynamic movements, growing brighter as they fluctuated, and transitioned in color from green to red. The phenomenon's radiant light illuminated the vicinity, and by 2:00 A.M., the columns converged. Despite debates categorizing the event as a UFO, it is often attributed to an aurora borealis due to its similarities. The incident remains an intriguing blend of natural wonder and unexplained occurrence.

Dec. 9, 1731                                    Florence, Italy. An unexplained luminous cloud attracted attention as it moved with noticeable force from east to west, eventually vanishing beyond the horizon. Bianchini, a contemporary writer, further described the incident, noting the presence of peculiar luminous spheres emitting a whirring sound. This event, marked by its mysterious characteristics, adds to the historical record of inexplicable phenomena in the skies above Florence.

328
Mar. 17, 1735                                   London, England. Dr. John Bevis witnessed an unexplained stationary light in the sky, which persisted for an hour.

329
Dec. 5, 1737                                    Sheffield, England. Astronomer Thomas Short reported a distinctive event around 5 P.M. A dark red cloud emerged with a luminous body beneath it, emitting intense beams of light that moved slowly before halting. The phenomenon's heat became so intense that Short had to remove his shirt despite being outdoors. This occurrence differed from aurora borealis due to the nature of the luminous beams and the subsequent rise in temperature.

330
Dec. 6, 1737                                    Bucharest, Romania. During the afternoon, a blood-red "Symbolic form" appeared in the sky from the west. This enigmatic object persisted for two hours before dividing into two segments, which soon reconnected and retreated westward.

331
Feb. 23, 1740                                   Toulon, France. During the night, a rising purple globe resembling fire was observed. The orb ascended slowly, descending into the sea with a rebound effect. Upon reaching a specific altitude, it detonated, emitting multiple fireballs over the sea and mountains. The explosion produced a sound akin to a powerful thunderclap or a bomb blast. The occurrence was reported to the Marquis de Caumont by witnesses.

332
Oct. 23, 1740                                   England. Renowned astronomer James Short, celebrated for crafting telescopes, documented an intriguing sight. He believed to have witnessed an unidentified planetoid he initially considered a Venusian satellite. This celestial body, eventually dubbed "Neith" by Hozeau, was observed during Venus' heliocentric longitude of 68° and an elongation of 46°.

333
Dec. 16, 1743                                   London, England. An observer from the Royal Society documents an uncommon sighting of a slow-moving, waving light resembling a rocket. At 8:40 PM, while in St. James Park, the observer witnessed a light emerging from the southern horizon behind trees and houses. The light ascended to around 20 degrees, exhibiting a wavering motion parallel to the horizon, before proceeding towards the northern point over houses. The observer described the light as resembling a flame with a bright, charcoal-like core encased in an opaque, iron-banded structure. A tail of light flame trailed from the object. The observer's detailed account and the object's unusual characteristics challenge the notion of a regular meteor, leaving it difficult to classify the phenomenon, especially considering the lack of satellite re-entry in 1743.

334
Jun. 23, 1744                                   Knott, Scotland. A group of twenty-six witnesses, including a judge, reported an astonishing occurrence where they observed a troop of armed men in the sky above a hill. At around 7 o'clock in the evening, D. Stricket, a servant to Mr. Lancaster, spotted a procession of horse-mounted figures moving leisurely along Souter Fell in Cumberland. After alerting his master, Mr. Lancaster, the aerial figures became visible near a location known as Knott. The inexplicable spectacle continued for a duration of two hours, during which all twenty-six individuals, residing within a mile's radius, had the chance to witness the phenomenon.

335
Jul. 14, 1745                                   London, England. Reverend George Costard witnessed an anomalous event where he observed a trumpet-shaped object flying over Stanlake Broad at approximately 8:00 PM.

336
Aug. 5, 1748                                    Aberdeen, Scotland. Eleven witnesses reported seeing three globes of light along with the appearance of twelve tall men and armies in the sky at 2 P.M. in a valley located west of the city. Initially believed to be meteorological phenomena, the intensity of the lights increased, revealing the figures and armies dressed in bright clothing. The entities seemed to re-enact the battle of Culloden, which had occurred near Inverness on 16 April 1746. Notably, the sighting's timing during the early afternoon ruled out the possibility of an aurora being responsible for the anomalous occurrence.

337
1752                                            Kazan, Russia. A man named "Yashka" claimed to have encountered a person dressed in white who transported him to a flying cauldron. Yashka described his experience as a journey to another world before ultimately returning to Earth.

338
Apr. 15, 1752                                   Stavanger, Norway. An octagonal luminosity was observed in the sky, emitting fireballs from its corners.

342
May. 20, 1759                                   Unexplained satellite of Venus. Astronomer Andreas Mayer reported observing a planetoid object in orbit around Venus, although the specific location of the observation remains unknown.

343
Sep. 16, 1759                                   Lonmora, Sweden. Man abducted for four days. On the evening of September 16, 1759, Jacob Jacobsson, a 22-year-old crofter from Lonmora, Sweden, crossed Lake Vastra Kiolsjon to deliver a food packet. Upon returning, he encountered an inexplicable phenomenon. A road appeared before him, leading him to a large red mansion where he found himself in the company of short-statured people, including a chubby man with a red cap and a taller maiden. They offered him food and drink, which he declined, expressing his desire to return home. The man with the red cap ordered his removal due to Jacob's refusal, and suddenly, he was back by the lake shore. Four days had passed, leaving Jacob without food or sleep, though he perceived it as only a brief absence. The incident left an uneasy feeling in him, and he recounted the experience to others, known for his simple, pious nature.

344
May. 7, 1761                                    France. Prominent astronomer J. L. Lagrange spotted a planetoid in apparent orbit around Venus. The object's orbital plane, as described by Lagrange, appeared to be perpendicular to the ecliptic. This observation occurred while Venus was positioned as an evening "star" at 207° heliocentric longitude and 34° elongation from Earth.

345
Jun. 6, 1761                                    Unknown observation location. Astronomer Scheuten observed a planetoid alongside Venus as he tracked Venus during its transit across the Sun's disk. The planet was accompanied by a smaller dark spot on one side, which moved in tandem with Venus during the transit.

346
Dec. 26, 1761                                   Weyloe, Denmark. During a stormy night, an observer in Weyloe noticed a sudden light resembling lightning around 2:04 AM. As the storm intensified, at around 4:00 AM, a distinct horizontal ray of light emanating from the moon became visible, roughly nine feet in length and as thick as a man's arm, emitting rays on each side. Following this, a pale ball of fire, initially resembling a cloud-covered sun, moved slowly from south to north, gradually turning redder and smaller. The phenomenon concluded after approximately two minutes without any noise or smoke. Despite the storm's intensity, the weather's unusual behavior and the presence of multiple beams make the possibility of globular lightning less likely.

347
Feb. 1762                                       Nuremberg, Germany. Mr. Staudacher observed an unfamiliar astronomical occurrence, describing it as a "black round spot" moving across the Sun. The following day, the object was no longer visible, leading him to speculate whether it might be a new planet.

348
Aug. 9, 1762                                    Basel and Solothurn, Switzerland. Two witnesses, Monsieur de Rostan in Basel and Croste in Solothurn, observed a spindle-shaped object resembling a cigar slowly flying in front of the Sun. Monsieur de Rostan, an astronomer from Basel, traced its outline with a camera obscura and sent the image to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris. The object appeared for almost a month and moved gradually from the eastern to the western limb of the Sun. This mysterious phenomenon was observed by multiple astronomers but remained unexplained, as it didn't resemble a typical solar spot, planet, or comet.

349
Nov. 19, 1762                                   Location unknown. An anomalous sighting of a planet-like object passing in front of the Sun was reported. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg observed a greenish round spot, roughly one twelfth the diameter of the Sun, moving across a 70° chord in a span of 3 hours. The exact location of this observation remains unspecified.

350
Mar. 4, 1764                                    Unknown location. A mysterious satellite attributed to the planet Venus was observed once more while Venus was visible in the evening sky. Positioned at a heliocentric longitude of 59° with an elongation of 30°, this enigmatic object garnered a total of eight observations throughout the year 1764. The exact location of these observations remains undisclosed.

351
Mar. 28, 1764                                   Unknown location. A mystery satellite was sighted near planet Venus. The object, resembling a planetoid, was observed orbiting Venus with a heliocentric longitude of 98° and an elongation of 35°. This sighting adds to the collection of reliable observations of such phenomena during the pre-industrial era.

352
May. 1764                                       Near Gotha, Germany. Mr. Hoffmann reported an anomalous sighting of a large round object, roughly 1/15th the size of the Sun, moving slowly from north to south across the sun's path. The incident involved a single unidentified object passing in front of the sun, casting a distinct spot on the solar surface.

353
Jun. 13, 1765                                   Mount Prospect, Inishannon, Ireland. A remarkable phenomenon dubbed the "Sky throne" was observed by numerous individuals around 8 to 9 PM. The spectacle, visible for approximately 30 minutes, featured a majestic throne situated in the Northern Sphere. Enclosed by a broad golden circle, the throne was adorned with a lion at its forefront, seemingly guarding it. The incident took place against a serene evening backdrop, with the sky appearing dark everywhere else, and its authenticity was confirmed by trustworthy witnesses.

354
Sep. 8, 1767                                    Perthshire, Scotland. A peculiar event unfolded near Cupor Angus on the water of Isla. Preceded by a dense dark smoke, a substantial luminous entity resembling a blazing house emerged. It swiftly transformed into a pyramid-like shape and surged forward, traversing towards the water of Erick with remarkable speed before vanishing near Blairgowrie. The effects were astonishing: it displaced a large cart across a grassy field, unseated a man from his horse rendering him unconscious, demolished half of a house, and undermined an arch of a newly constructed bridge at Blairgowrie before its disappearance.

355
Jan. 4, 1768                                    Copenhagen, Denmark. Astronomer Christian Horrebow documented an unusual sighting of a "small light, that was not a star," seemingly orbiting Venus. Referred to as "Neith" by M. Hozeau of the Brussels observatory, this object remained enigmatic and was never definitively identified. It was confirmed that Neith was not a natural satellite of Venus.

356
Oct. 24, 1769                                   Oxford, England. An unusual incident involved the sighting of an object resembling a blazing house in the sky, lasting for about an hour. This object exhibited vertical movement, resembling hovering as it moved up and down. Notably, it emitted jets of gas and produced rumbling sounds during its presence.

357
May. 8, 1775                                    Waltham Abbey, Hertfordshire, England. Around 8:30 PM, a gentleman in Waltham Abbey witnessed an extraordinary event. A meteor, taking on the appearance of a hazy star, emerged slightly above the moon's position. It moved unhurriedly towards the east, maintaining a parallel trajectory with the ecliptic, covering an arc of approximately 5 to 6 degrees before fading away. The meteor's size was about 6 or 7 minutes of arc, boasting a brightness and hue akin to that of the moon.
20:30
358
Jun. 17, 1777                                   France. During a lunar eclipse, astronomer Charles Messier witnessed a peculiar event involving unidentified objects moving in parallel paths. He likened these objects to a combination of ships and bells due to their size and swift movement. Messier speculated that these anomalies might have been airborne hailstones or seeds, but he leaned toward the possibility of them being small meteorites.

359
Feb. 5, 1780                                    Bussieres, France. Around 6 P.M. - A flaming "dragon" appeared in the sky, emitting light that illuminated the area and lasted for approximately 15 minutes, captivating those below.

This star emerged suddenly in the southeast, displaying scintillating characteristics. It underwent a repeated pattern of rising and descending three times. Another star replicated this peculiar motion, and reportedly, the latter star descended and impacted a village.

362
Sep. 11, 1787                                   Edinburgh, Scotland. Around 8:30 P.M. - Observers witnessed a remarkable event involving a fiery globe exceeding the size of the sun. This celestial object moved from north to east at an elevation of 15 to 20 degrees, later descending to the horizon. The globe then ascended once more, exhibiting short waves in its path, and ultimately shifted westward before disappearing behind a cloud, where it seemed to detonate.
20:30
363
Jun. 12, 1788                                   Zamora, Spain. Between 4 and 5 A.M., two large globes of fire, roughly the size of a Bristol barrel, were observed flying horizontally in the southeastern sky. The globes approached each other and collided before being separated by a centrifugal force, after which they took divergent paths—one moving East Southeast and the other West by North. The event, witnessed by numerous individuals, lasted around twenty minutes. The globe in the southeast eventually burst with a loud crack audible up to ten miles away, while the other descended slowly until disappearing from view.
04:00
364
Nov. 12, 1791                                   Gottingen, Germany. Astronomer Lichtenberg reports a solitary sighting of an object passing in front of the Sun, observed from his location.

19:30
367
Aug. 20, 1794                                   Balasore, India. At 7:45 P.M., a group of observers witnessed an unusually large meteor, outshining even the planets in brightness. As it descended, it periodically halted, becoming even more brilliant during these pauses. The meteor disappeared momentarily behind hills but reappeared after around two minutes, ascending above the hills and swaying horizontally between North and South directions. This pattern of rising and falling occurred two more times before the object eventually vanished, leaving the surroundings in darkness.
19:45
368
Jan. 27, 1795                                   Quangxi Province, Linggui area, China. In the Southeastern sky, a sizable luminous object resembling a star was observed rising and falling three times. Subsequently, another similar object descended and crashed into a village.

369
Oct. 12, 1796                                   New Minas, Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia. Fifteen airborne "ships" moving eastward, each featuring ports on their sides, were observed in the sky. On one of the ships, a man was seen extending his hand. The event was documented by Simeon Perkins in his five-volume diary. A girl at Mr. Ratchford's residence in New Minas reported the sighting around sunrise, prompting two men to verify the phenomenon. Despite skepticism, some individuals believed the account, while Perkins speculated that the sighting might have been a product of imagination, potentially due to clouds at sunrise.

370
Jan. 18, 1798                                   Tarbes, France. Astronomer D'Angos witnessed an astronomical anomaly, describing a distinct elliptical spot moving across the Sun's surface. The anomaly, positioned midway between the Sun's center and its edge, was observed for approximately 25 minutes before disappearing from view.

371
Sep. 10, 1798                                   Alnwick, Northumberland, England. Schoolteacher Alexander Campbell and a companion reported a remarkable UFO sighting. Initially appearing as a small star in the southwestern sky, the object transformed as it approached, eventually resembling an apothecary's pestle. It shifted shapes multiple times, becoming a hammer or cross, and then forming into two back-to-back half moons with a luminous stream between them. The object grew increasingly bright with each transformation, outshining surrounding stars. The sighting lasted about five minutes before the UFO vanished from view.

372
Jul. 1799                                       Bruges, Belgium. An anomalous event occurred involving an object initially perceived as a meteor. This object, however, exhibited extraordinary behavior, deviating from typical meteoric paths. It moved from south to north, then unexpectedly shifted course at a 45-degree angle to the northwest. The unconventional maneuvering of the object ruled out the possibility of it being a natural celestial body like a meteor, raising questions about its true nature and origin.

373
Nov. 13, 1799                                   Gerona, Catalonia, Spain. Numerous brilliant "shooting stars" cluster and then separate in an anomalous display of maneuvering stars.

The object covered 2 minutes of arc in 3 minutes of time and disappeared after a cloudy interval of 4 hours.

378
Aug. 15, 1803                                   Ormans near Evilliers, France. Pierre Mille and his three daughters, accompanied by a local craftsman, witness two luminous globes emitting sun-like rays hovering over an oak tree. This event takes place while the family is en route to church for the Feast of the Assumption. Upon investigation, a small statue of the Virgin Mary is found within the oak tree. Notably, the youngest daughter had previously observed the Virgin Mary accompanied by two floating lights at the same location during Easter, along the path between Maizieres and Ornans.

379
Jun. 27, 1806                                   Geneva, New York, USA. Astronomer W. R. Brooks, using a two-inch telescope at 1:00 A.M., observes a long, dark object crossing the lunar disk from west to east. The object's swift passage, taking 3 to 4 seconds, rules out the possibility of it being a bird. Despite its relatively small apparent size, approximately one third that of the moon, the nature of the object remains unidentified.

380
Jul. 1806                                       Maine. Reverend Abraham Cummings, a scholar with a Master's degree from Brown University, investigates a ghostly apparition after initial skepticism. He describes witnessing a white rock-like object in the evening, later transforming into a two-foot-diameter globe with a reddish tint. As he approached, the object quickly transformed into a female figure in attire, growing in size based on his thoughts. This entity, representing a deceased woman, appeared radiant with a sun-like depiction on her head, and Cummings documents over thirty witness affidavits affirming similar encounters. The apparition consistently emerged from a small luminous cloud, taking on the woman's form before departing in a similar manner.

381
Aug. 7, 1806                                    Rutherford, North Carolina. Patsey Reaves, residing near the Appalachian Mountain, reports a remarkable sighting involving her daughter Elizabeth and son Morgan. Elizabeth initially sees a man on Chimney Mountain, followed by Morgan observing a multitude of flying things in the air. More witnesses, including Polly and a Negro woman, join in, and Mrs. Reaves herself sees a vast crowd of white-clad beings resembling humans of various sizes. These beings rise off the mountain, moving towards Chimney Rock in a northern direction. The spectacle continues for about an hour, witnessed by many, including Mr. Robert Siercy, who initially doubts the strangeness but later perceives the radiant entities moving in groups and forming a semi-circular pattern before gradually disappearing from sight, leaving an indelible impression.

382
Jul. 22, 1808                                   Maine, USA. School teacher Cynthia Everett's diary entry records an unusual sighting of light originating from the East. Initially mistaken for a meteor due to its motion, the light's behavior distinguishes it from such phenomena. It swiftly darts through the atmosphere, transitioning between ascending and descending while maintaining a consistent distance from the ground. The light moves in a circular pattern across the visible horizon and eventually retraces its path. Dr. Ranlett, a historian, highlights the significance that despite Cynthia Everett's education and familiarity with celestial occurrences, she refrains from attributing this sighting to a natural phenomenon, suggesting its exceptional nature.

383
Sep. 1, 1808                                    Moscow, Russia. A radiant "plate" was observed flying over the Kremlin by Alexander Afanasyev, a member of the Russian State History Museum. The event took place at 8:07 after noon in a clear, star-studded sky. The phenomenon, characterized by its exceptional beauty, radiance, and immense size, soared in an arch from 55 to almost 90 degrees on the horizon. The object, resembling a long, flat plate around 6.35 meters in length and 0.35 meters thick, displayed an oval flame on its front edge, emitting a phosphorescent-like radiance. The flame dissipated, leaving a brightly illuminated plate that ascended vertically among the stars, remaining visible for about two minutes before becoming invisible due to its extreme altitude.

384
Aug. 10, 1809                                   Hatton Garden, London, England. John Staveley recounts observing a remarkable event where he witnessed a mesmerizing display of luminous lights within a black cloud resembling an aerial ballet. The lights, resembling sparkling specks, danced around the cloud's edge, with one light even expanding to the size and brilliance of Venus. This light moved rapidly along the cloud before fading away. Staveley continued to watch for over three hours, during which the lights multiplied and descended in various sizes, all while no lightning was associated with the active cloud.

385
Aug. 1810                                       Meklong, Thailand. Dr. Jacob Hazlitt, a missionary and physician, reported an anomalous sighting of a silver-clad humanoid along a road near Meklong. The entity, described as having gleaming skin and a single eye, caught his attention. Writer Ahmad Jamaludin further discussed abduction cases in Malaysia and Indonesia involving beings from a coexisting world. Abductees claimed to be transported to a reality beyond ours, experiencing side effects akin to UFO abductees, including amnesia, thirst, fatigue, and emotional distress. These beings, referred to as the Bunian People, dressed similarly to locals, though the origin of the term "Bunian" remains unclear.

Sep. 1810                                       Thailand. A woman reported an unsettling experience where she was awoken by an unknown force in the middle of the night. Strangely, the usual sounds of animals were absent. Peering out her window, she witnessed a peculiar humanoid figure in her backyard. The entity, characterized by its singular eye and metallic suit-like appearance, caught her attention. The incident culminated with the woman asserting that she had been abducted to a place she referred to as a "palace of lights."

Sep. 19, 1810                                   Brezeau, Holland. A strange event unfolded in the Dutch village of Brezeau. According to the 36th volume of the Philosophical Magazine, witnesses observed a luminous meteor to the south between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM. The meteor seemed to gather and consolidate for about a quarter of an hour, eventually transforming into a significant fireball that moved northward. This phenomenon caused fear among the villagers, who feared their houses would catch fire. The meteor was accompanied by dense fog and notably absorbed water while crossing a river, later releasing the water as rain. The duration of the event, lasting forty-five minutes before becoming a column of fire and ascending into the sky, adds to its mysterious nature.

Mar. 20, 1812                                   Near Manosque, France. A group of seven travelers on the road from Villeneuve to Manosque witnessed an anomalous event. They observed a luminous ball hovering near their coach, which then divided into four distinct lights. These lights contained human-like figures and resembled lanterns. The travelers, frightened by this encounter, decided to halt their journey at the inn of Quatre Tours instead of continuing to Manosque.

389
Apr. 8, 1813                                    Atlantic Ocean. The crew of the ship "Niagara," situated at approximately latitude 43 north and longitude 65 west, encountered a peculiar phenomenon. Initially appearing as an overturned ship, the crew soon realized the object was in motion. As they approached, it became evident that the object was a massive creature resembling a fish, with dimensions estimated at around 200 feet in length, 30 feet in width, and 17 to 18 feet in height. The creature's body was covered in a shell, featuring a notable hole or archway with an occasional fin. Despite intending to investigate further, the crew decided against it due to the intimidating nature of the creature.

Jul. 25, 1813                                   Portsmouth, Virginia, USA. Carpenter Edward Hansford penned a letter to Thomas Jefferson on July 31, 1813, detailing an extraordinary sighting. Alongside Baltimore resident John L. Clark, Hansford witnessed a luminous object resembling a ball of fire, comparable in size to the midday sun. This object emitted periodic smoke from its own body, all the while maintaining its radiant and distinct form, though with noticeable agitation. The object then transformed into the likeness of a turtle, displaying similar restlessness and being occasionally concealed by smoke. It descended diagonally towards the West and subsequently ascended vertically to its original position at around 75 degrees. Edward Hansford had previously been involved in Revolutionary War efforts and held positions related to harbor management in the Norfolk and Portsmouth regions.

391
Sep. 5, 1814                                    Near Agen, France. At 11 A.M., amidst clear skies and a strong breeze, an unusual event occurred. A slowly moving, circular white object with a grayish center appeared in the northwest sky. Initially thought to be a "cloud," it defied the wind by becoming stationary until noon. Unexpectedly, the object then sped southward while rotating, accompanied by rumbling sounds that crescendoed into an explosion. This explosion led to the release of a shower of stones. Following this, the "cloud" resumed a halt, gradually diminishing until it disappeared. The explosion's impact and the ensuing panic reverberated throughout the region, causing distress among the local population.

393
Jan. 6, 1818                                    Ipswich, England. Mr. Capel Lofft and Mr. Acton, English writers, observed an anomalous event where a small, uniformly opaque, subelliptical spot was sighted near the sun for three and a half hours. The object's rapid movement over the sun, faster than Venus during transit, caught their attention. By sunset, the object, seemingly of cometary or planetary nature, vanished. This well-documented sighting raises intrigue due to its unusual characteristics.

394
Aug. 3, 1818                                    Worthing, England. At 11:15 P.M., Mr. Thomas Young observed a remarkable event, describing a bright meteor near Cassiopeia. The object's trajectory began at a point 19 degrees from the pole at 65 degrees in right ascension, shifting to 17 degrees from the pole and 80 degrees in right ascension. Strangely, the object remained stationary for a full minute after its movement. This sighting of a motionless light in the sky adds an enigmatic aspect to the phenomenon.

395
Jun. 26, 1819                                   Buchholz, Germany. Astronomer J.W. Pastorff witnessed an intriguing event initially thought to be a "comet" in proximity to the Sun. However, Olbers raised doubts about its comet classification. On the same day, Gruithuisen, observing from Holland, reported the presence of three unidentified objects traversing the Sun's disk. These included one near the Sun's center and two smaller objects lacking nebulosity near the western limb. Notably, this observation, once documented in Reverend Webb's prominent astronomy handbooks, has been omitted from more recent editions, adding a layer of mystery to the account.

396
Oct. 9, 1819                                    Augsburg, Germany. An anomalous sighting occurred as an immense celestial body transited the Sun. Mr. Stark, a canon from Augsburg, documented this event, later referenced by Le Verrier in February 1877's Monthly Notices of the R.A.S. The observation depicted a distinct circular anomaly, roughly akin in size to Mercury, though it vanished by the subsequent evening.

397
1820                                            Hopkinton, New Hampshire, USA. At dusk, a young man in the vicinity of "The Lookout" near Putney Hill (Gould Hill) was trailed for nearly two miles by multiple luminous spheres. The spheres mimicked his movements, halting when he turned to observe them, and then recommencing their motion when he continued walking. Despite this, they maintained a distance of around 50 feet and never approached any closer. Comparable radiant orbs had been observed in the area since 1750, drifting slowly through the air, suggesting a plausible natural origin. The specified date is an approximate approximation.

398
Feb. 12, 1820                                   Augsburg, Germany. A distinct round area with an orange-gold hue, which was not witnessed again that night, was reported by two separate witnesses, Stark and Steinhubel. The spot traversed the sun over a span of approximately 5 hours, signifying a peculiar inter-solar journey.

399
May. 27, 1820                                   Spello (Perugia), Umbria, Italy. During a sermon by Saint Caspar (San Gaspare Del Bufalo) in the town square, an extraordinary event unfolded. Roughly thirty minutes before sunset, observers witnessed the appearance of three stars forming a cross in the eastern sky. These stars moved in unison, creating a triangle with one light positioned above and the other two at lower levels. The celestial display occurred directly over the head of Saint Caspar, leaving the crowd and even Bishop Monsignor Lucchesi in a state of astonishment. However, skepticism surrounds the event as it fails to appear in Gaspar's published correspondence, despite existing letters from various dates in May 1820, including the 27th and 28th. This intriguing phenomenon remains subject to uncertainties about its authenticity.

400
Sep. 7, 1820                                    Embrun, France. Astronomer François Arago, director of the Paris observatory, documents an anomalous sighting during a lunar eclipse. Witnesses in Embrun observed peculiar objects exhibiting precise military-like formation. These objects, noted for their equidistant spacing and ability to maintain formation even while changing directions, moved along straight trajectories. The event raises questions about unexplained aerial phenomena during the eclipse.

401
Feb. 13, 1821                                   Paris, France. After departing a theater, individuals witnessed a luminous globe suspended in the sky, remaining visible until dawn. The account, originating from a French source, highlights the persistence of superstitious beliefs within a seemingly enlightened society, according to a skeptical translator's note. The event underscores the prevalence of unexplained occurrences and their influence on public perceptions even in the face of enlightenment.

402
Oct. 23, 1822                                   Buchholz, Germany. Astronomer Pastorff observes two round spots moving across the Sun in a sighting that deviates from the norm of the pre-industrial era.

403
Dec. 5, 1822                                    Aberdeen, Scotland. A peculiar meteorological event unfolds as an unusual luminous object resembling a large moon-sized ball is sighted descending towards the horizon. Transforming into a fiery pillar and then reverting to its initial spherical shape, the object displays an anomalous behavior before ultimately disappearing from view.

404
May. 22, 1823                                   Hereford, England. Reverend T.W. Webb, a respected astronomer known for his work "Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes," reports the sighting of a luminous unidentified object in close proximity to Venus. This unexplained bright object garners attention due to its juxtaposition with the planet, intriguing both amateur and professional stargazers.

405
Aug. 12, 1825                                   At sea near Hawaii, Pacific. English naturalist Andrew Bloxam and fellow observers witness a remarkable event where a large red luminous object emerges from the sea, casting a wide-reaching illumination. The object rises and falls twice, exhibiting a behavior that captivates the onboard middle watch crew. Its fiery red hue and intense brightness, akin to a red-hot cannonball, not only astonish the observers but also provide substantial lighting, allowing small details like a pin to be discerned on the deck.

406
Apr. 1, 1826                                    Saarbrücken, Germany. A grayish object, estimated to be larger than 1 meter, descended swiftly toward the ground emitting a thunderous sound and then expanded, resembling a spreading sheet.

407
1827                                            Tietjerk, Friesland, Holland. Lieuwe Klaasens and a pastor witnessed a fireball descending and transforming into a fiery human figure upon landing, which subsequently flew back up into the sky.

408
Mar. 1828                                       Mount Wingen, Australia. An enigmatic flying object described as "cigar-shaped with a peculiar silver hue" landed on Mount Wingen, accompanied by a loud banging noise. The impact ignited vegetation and resulted in the death of cattle. Concurrently, tall unidentified individuals emerged in the town, gesturing towards their needs without speaking. The event led to speculations among the locals, linking it to unexplained disappearances of both people and domesticated animals. This unsettling occurrence remained ingrained in local memory, passed down through generations.

409
Jul. 17, 1829                                   Kensington, Pennsylvania, USA. Between 11 P.M. and midnight, an extraordinary event unfolded as a bright red object, akin to a meteor but with distinctive characteristics, emerged from the vicinity of the Schuylkill. Its journey spanned over Kensington and the Delaware River before vanishing behind Jersey's woods. Initially accompanied by a luminous trail, the object exhibited rapid, irregular, and wavering motions, reminiscent of a kite or an air balloon swaying. Radiating a deep red and remarkably brilliant hue, roughly half the size of the moon, it ascended until crossing the Delaware. Afterward, it diminished to a small speck, then suddenly expanded, emitting sparkles before dimming and ultimately disappearing behind the trees. This perplexing spectacle persisted for an estimated fifteen to twenty minutes.

Jul. 23, 1830                                   Whinny Park, near Cupar, Fife, Scotland. Reverend Alexander Espline, traveling from Auchtermuchty to Letham, encountered an unusual sight above Whinny Park, owned by James Millie. Initially observing one peculiar light, he discovered two lights with varying brightness levels. The smaller light emitted a beam before both lights began to flash, prompting Espline to flee in fear. Surprisingly, two days later, the body of James Millie was found near the same location. The incident's connection to his murder wasn't initially considered; a report noted that the discovery might not have happened without an accidental circumstance. Such flickering lights, reminiscent of the ignis fatuus phenomenon, often held significance in medieval tales, indicating burial or other important sites.

411
Nov. 14, 1832                                   Tyrol, Germany. A ball of bright light, accompanied by "falling stars," remained suspended in the sky for approximately 15 minutes. Although the incident coincided with the usual timing of the Leonids meteor shower, the unusual presence of a glowing orb in the sky for an extended period distinguishes this event. The report is based on a letter received from Bruneck, Tyrol, Germany, prompting further attention due to its unique nature.

412
Mar. 16, 1833                                   North Carolina. During twilight at 6:35 P.M., an observer witnessed an exceptionally slow and bright object, initially positioned slightly to the right of Venus. The object, initially moving northward, defied expectations by altering its trajectory and gliding parallel to the horizon. It transformed into a serpentine shape, remaining stationary for around two minutes and spanning a span of 12 to 15 degrees. The object gradually diminished in luminosity, eventually resembling a thin whitish cloud before completely vanishing by 6:40 P.M., rendering a total visibility duration of just 5 minutes.

413
Nov. 13, 1833                                   Niagara Falls, N.Y.} USA - A large luminous square object observed in the sky for an hour, remained stationary, then departed slowly.

414
1834                                            Cologne (Koln), Germany. Bright object flying NE-N parallel to the horizon, reappeared and split in two.

415
May. 11, 1835                                   Sicily, Italy. Astronomer Cacciatore reported an unknown luminous object, observed on four consecutive days. Initially mistaken for an eighth magnitude star, its position shifted relative to another star by May 14, 1835. Cacciatore considered it a comet or planet beyond Uranus, but subsequent cloudy skies prevented further observations, and the object was lost by June 2, 1835.

416
Oct. 6, 1835                                    Cosenza, Italy. A pyramid-shaped meteor was observed flying west of Cosenza. It changed shape, leaving a vaporous trail, and moved slowly southward, following a parabolic curve. The meteor eventually disappeared towards Fiumefreddo harbor after heading off towards a mountain, leaving a "gloomy tail."

417
Jan. 12, 1836                                   Cherbourg, France. A "luminous body" about two-thirds the size of the moon was observed at 6:30 P.M. It exhibited a dark cavity in its center and appeared to be rotating on its axis while traveling at approximately half a mile per second and an altitude of around 1000 feet. As it passed, it cast shadows on the ground and emitted a whistling sound.

418
Jul. 1, 1836                                    Szeged, Hungary. Haunted house phenomena reported, including globular lights, poltergeist effects, and apparitions of a "lady in white" and a dwarf-sized Franciscan monk. Objects were observed being thrown by unseen hands. Similar manifestations have been noted in ufological literature and have been linked by some researchers to the abduction phenomenon.

419
Jul. 8, 1836                                    Saratov Province, Russia. At 10 P.M., a globe-shaped whitish mass, roughly the size of the moon, appeared on the northern horizon. It hovered briefly before descending slowly to the ground, leaving a zigzag trail, and ultimately disappearing.

Nov. 1, 1836                                    Buchholz, Germany. Astronomer Pastorff reported two unexplained objects crossing the sun's face. The objects, of differing sizes, exhibited changing positions relative to each other.

421
1837                                            Scarborough, England. Chief officer Mr. White witnessed frightening lights the size of oranges with undulating motion about five to six feet from the ground, accompanied by hissing noises. Additional luminous appearances shot across the road and sky emitting rocket-like hissing sounds. Another man named Trotter, stationed on a cliff, was so frightened by these phenomena that he hid.

422
Feb. 16, 1837                                   Buchholz, Germany. Astronomer Pastorff reported another unexplained object crossing the sun's face.

423
Aug. 29, 1837                                   Tirgu-Neamt, Romania. A luminous sphere was observed by locals during the night. At dawn, the sphere descended closer to the ground, casting an intense reddish glow that illuminated the fields.

424
1838                                            India. G. Pettitt reported a flying disk with a hook-shaped appendage, roughly the apparent size of the moon but brighter. The sighting lasted around 20 minutes.

425
Oct. 2, 1839                                    Rome, Italy. Astronomer De Cuppis of the Royal College reported an unknown body resembling a planet passing in front of the sun. This observation was used by Le Verrier to calculate the orbit of Vulcan. The object appeared as a well-defined, perfectly round spot, moving at a speed that would make it cross the sun in approximately 6 hours.

426
Apr. 9, 1843                                    Greenville, Tennessee, USA. Around 8 o'clock in the evening, a luminous ball approximately two feet in circumference was observed in the southwestern sky. The ball emitted small meteors and surpassed the brightness of the sun. Initially stationary, it then displayed rapid vertical motions, rising about thirty feet, falling to its starting point, and repeating this pattern around fifteen times. It subsequently moved horizontally for a similar distance and time. After assuming its original position, it rose vertically about twelve feet, gradually diminishing in size over an hour and fifteen minutes before vanishing entirely.

427
Oct. 1843                                       Warwick, Ontario, Canada. In the afternoon of October third, Charles Cooper, a farmer, witnessed an unusual event in the sky. After a light rain and the passing of a rainbow, Cooper heard distant thunder-like sounds. He noticed a distinct cloud approaching from the west, underneath which he saw three white men flying through the air in a single-file formation. The figures appeared motionless, with outstretched arms, emitting mournful moans that resembled the distant roars he had initially heard. The men, seemingly sailing just above the treetops, continued their passage until disappearing from view. Despite Cooper's claims, others in the area did not report seeing the flying men.

428
Oct. 4, 1844                                    Astronomer Glaisher reported an unidentified luminous object, shining as brightly as Jupiter. The object emitted rapid, flickering waves of light. The specific location where this event occurred is unknown.

429
Mar. 29, 1845                                   London, England. At 11 P.M., Mr. Goddart witnessed an orange-colored object in the sky within the Canes Venatici constellation. He described it as a faint light, about magnitude 4, with a yellow hue. Using a telescope, he observed the object resembling a cluster of four stars, with a central area emitting an orange glow. The object moved gradually from Canes Venatici towards Coma Berenices, increasing in brightness. After approximately two minutes, the object faded and disappeared.

430
May. 11, 1845                                   Capodimonte Observatory, Naples, Italy. Astronomer Schumacher communicated to Gauss that astronomer Ernesto Capocci had observed objects passing in front of the sun between 11 to 13 May. Capocci's report about these occurrences was conveyed to Schumacher. The exact nature of these passing objects and their characteristics are not specified in the provided information.

431
Jun. 18, 1845                                   Between Malta and Turkey. On the brig Victoria, en route from Newcastle to Malta, an anomalous event occurred. Around 9:30 P.M., the ship was becalmed, and its top-gallant and royal masts were suddenly lost as if in a squall. Following two hours of strong eastward winds and the crew reefing topsails, an abrupt calm ensued accompanied by intense heat and a sulfuric smell. Three luminous objects emerged from the sea about half a mile away from the vessel, remaining visible for about ten minutes. Subsequently, strong winds resumed and the ship encountered a cold, fresh air current. The reported coordinates would place the ship approximately 900 miles from Antalya, Turkey.
21:30                                           
432
Jun. 18, 1845                                   Ainab Mountain, Lebanon. Half an hour after sunset, an extraordinary and captivating yet unsettling sight unfolded in the sky. Observers at Ainab, Mount Lebanon, witnessed two large celestial bodies, each estimated to be around five times larger than the moon. These objects were connected by streamers or appendages, resembling billowing flags caught in a gentle breeze. Emitting a painful brightness that seemed to be reflected from the main bodies, these entities appeared in the west, endured for an hour, followed an eastward trajectory, and gradually vanished. This event might have been linked to the earlier sighting on the same date.
21:00
433
Jun. 7, 1846                                    Darmstadt, Germany. A reported instance of an object descending from the sky was determined to be "only slag" upon examination. Although the residue's composition was found to be "nothing but slag," this observation is noteworthy due to its physical implications, especially in light of similar instances where unidentified flying objects dropped molten metal. While not a significant sighting itself, its potential relevance prompts its inclusion for consideration.

434
Aug. 25, 1846                                   Saint-Apre, France. Dr. Moreau experienced an unusual event around 2:30 A.M. during his journey back from a patient's house. He encountered a luminous globe that appeared to unfold, releasing numerous star-like objects. This phenomenon persisted for about three to four minutes before gradually diminishing, eventually leading to the disappearance of the globe. The occurrence took place under warm and calm weather conditions.

435
Sep. 19, 1846                                   La Salette, France. Two cowherds, an eleven-year-old boy named Maximin and a fourteen-year-old girl named Melanie Calvat, witnessed a brilliant light and an apparition. Melanie recounted seeing a radiant light even brighter than the sun while observing grazing cows. She and Maximin both observed a static light that opened up to reveal a more brilliant moving light, within which appeared a beautiful lady dressed in white and gold with a rose-adorned cap. The lady was surrounded by light and tears, expressing concern about Sunday desecration and blasphemous behavior. The parish priest identified the figure as the Blessed Virgin. The Bishop of Grenoble approved the apparitions, leading to pilgrimages, while Melanie became a nun and continued receiving revelations, whereas Maximin's aspiration to become a priest was unsuccessful.

436
Nov. 1846                                       Rangoon River, China. During a dark night around 7:30 P.M., a ship's owner's wife, the captain, and a 4-year-old child witnessed the sudden appearance of a bright light emitting extreme heat. The light, resembling a compact flame, swiftly moved in front of the ship. Unlike lightning, the light's appearance alarmed the witnesses, while others nearby also sensed a rapid rise in temperature, despite being unable to see the light themselves.

437
Mar. 19, 1847                                   Holloway, London, England. In the evening, witnesses observed an unknown object resembling a fire-balloon ascending slowly in the west, accompanied by intense brilliance. As it reached a position over Hampstead, the object emitted fiery coruscations and transformed into a radiant cloud, emitting a unique and bright blue-tinted light on the surrounding houses. Another even more brilliant cloud appeared above, and after a brief period, small fiery balls dropped from the upper cloud into the lower one. This process repeated, with larger balls descending. Eventually, both clouds disappeared, seemingly absorbed into the heavens. The moon later emerged to the north, and the witnesses also observed zodiacal light lasting over an hour.

438
Oct. 11, 1847                                   Bonn, Germany. Astronomer Schmidt reported a swift-moving small black spot crossing the sun's disk. The object's rapid motion was distinct from that of a bird or an insect passing before the telescope.

439
Nov. 19, 1847                                   Oxford, Wytham Park, England. Mr. Symonds reported a sizable object in the sky that made two stationary stops during its seven-minute trajectory.

440
1848                                            Arabian Sea, Arabia. A ship at sea encountered two fiery wheels resembling rolling haystacks on fire. As they approached, the wheels exploded with a crashing sound, causing two masts on the ship to rupture violently accompanied by a strong sulfur odor. Sir W. S. Harris reported this incident.

442
Sep. 4, 1848                                    Nottingham, England. At 8:59 P.M., Mr. Lowe observed a slow-moving unidentified object from Highfield Observatory. Resembling a bright star, the object traveled from Eta of Antinoiis to Pi of Sagittarius, taking 45 seconds to cover the distance. Its gradual speed ruled out meteoric activity, and its brightness was estimated to be six times that of Jupiter.

The light exhibited a swinging motion around its base aligned with the horizon. The object flickered, appeared on the brink of vanishing, rekindled, and eventually vanished. Subsequent small flashes were observed moving south.

450
Feb. 5, 1850                                    Sandwich, Kent, England. At 6:50 P.M., Mr. W. H. Weekes reported a small luminous object initially stationary near Orion. It moved gradually along a straight path, increasing in apparent size to about one third the moon's diameter. The object transformed from a speck of light to a "red-hot iron ball," lingered for approximately three minutes, and then vanished in a fiery display. The object had been motionless for 1 minute and 45 seconds before moving horizontally for 45 seconds.
18:50
451
Feb. 18, 1850                                   Athens, Greece. Astronomer Schmidt observed and reported an unidentified object passing in front of the Sun.

452
Mar. 13, 1850                                   Paris, France. Mr. Goulvier-Gravier, founder of a meteoritics observatory, witnessed a magnitude 3 "shooting star" originating from the southeast. The object altered its course and reversed direction at 4:45 A.M.

453
Oct. 3, 1850                                    Talcot Mt., near Hartford, CT, USA} Observer Graylord Wells reported a bright orange-hued meteor about a foot in diameter, accompanied by a fan-shaped train approximately 15 to 16 feet in length. The meteor ascended from east to west, passing near the moon, before altering its direction towards the southeast. The phenomenon descended gradually and disappeared on the southeastern horizon. The entire event, including the movement of its train, lasted for at least three minutes, and its visibility likely extended for an hour and a half, according to the observer's account presented by Professor Brocklesby.

454
Oct. 10, 1852                                   Reims, France. M. Coultier-Gravier, compiling shooting star statistics, observed a distinctive "meteor" at 8 P.M. The third-degree object initially appeared near "nu" of Capricorn and followed a 30-degree path across the sky. Notably, the meteor altered its course from northwest to southwest, making a 90-degree turn.

455
1853                                            Paris, France. Amede Guillemin, residing on Rue Arnelot, witnessed a slow-moving object above Pere-Lachaise cemetery. The object, described as a "pale red disk," moved horizontally at an exceptionally leisurely pace.

456
May. 22, 1854                                   Unknown Location. A correspondent named R. P. Greg relayed that their friend witnessed a series of unidentified objects. The first object, comparable in size to Mercury, appeared near the planet. Following it was an elongated object, and behind that, a smaller round object.

457
Jan. 21, 1855                                   New Haven, Connecticut. Around 10 P.M., an observer spotted a bright red sphere, roughly two minutes in diameter. The object initially appeared beneath the guards in Ursa Minor and exhibited apparent stillness. After approximately fifteen seconds, it gradually moved eastward, almost horizontally, with a slight undulating motion. The object passed near the star Benetuash in Ursa Major and vanished in the distance close to Denebola in Leo constellation. The observation extended for ten minutes, and there were no observed explosions or scintillations.

458
Jun. 11, 1855                                   Bonn, Germany. Astronomers Ritter and Schmidt reported a dark unknown body crossing the sun's disk.

459
Aug. 11, 1855                                   Tillington, Sussex, England. Around 11:30 P.M., Mrs. Ayling and several other witnesses observed a red wheel-shaped object with spokes. The object emerged from behind hills and remained visible in the sky for an hour and a half.

460
Dec. 10, 1855                                   Copenhagen, Denmark. An unexplained object, ranging in size from the sun's apparent diameter to that of a star, appeared in the southwestern sky for approximately 10 to 12 minutes. The object's configuration underwent multiple changes, transitioning from a single mass to two or three masses alternately. The phenomenon illuminated a significant portion of the heavens around it.

461
1858                                            Jay, Ohio, USA. Witnesses, including Mr. Henry Wallace, observed a large, uniquely designed vessel approximately 100 yards above the ground. The craft was manned by several very tall individuals. Speculation arose that the vessel hailed from Venus, Mercury, or Mars, potentially for exploration or leisure. Mr. Wallace described the vessel's intricate mechanical workings as advanced and precise, capable of a steady pace of about six miles per hour, with the potential for much higher speeds. Despite subsequent research efforts, the veracity of this account remains unverifiable due to lack of definitive historical evidence.

462
Mar. 26, 1859                                   Orgeres, France. Amateur astronomer Mr. Lescarbault reported observing a planetary-sized body crossing the sun's disk. His letter led to a meeting with Le Verrier, who aimed to validate the observation for the purpose of calculating an orbit for Vulcan, an intra-mercurial planet hypothesized by Le Verrier. Lescarbault's account included a detailed duration of the passage and an expectation that a circular, small black dot might be seen again in front of the sun, potentially representing the hypothesized planet. The interaction between Lescarbault and Le Verrier was significant in the context of their collaboration on this astronomical phenomenon.

463
Jan. 29, 1860                                   London, England. Mr. Russell and three additional observers reported an unidentified object of planetary dimensions.

464
Mar. 1, 1860                                    Moscow, Russia. At 9:45 P.M., a star southwest of the Great Bear suddenly expanded in size and turned reddish, resembling iron at a high temperature. This anomaly persisted until 11:30 P.M., reaching half the moon's size, after which it faded. By midnight, the object vanished, replaced by a black speck among the stars. The event's author speculated about the possibility of the object's destruction, suggesting that astronomers and poets might explore its significance.

465
Jul. 17, 1860                                   Dharamsala, India. Following the day when a notable meteor fell in the region, an observer witnessed a sequence of lights in the evening sky around 7 P.M. The lights displayed patterns, each enduring for at least a minute, located over areas devoid of structures or roads. Some lights resembled fire balloons, while others appeared in the distance towards lower hills, and a few were closer to the observer's location. The observer ruled out common explanations like lanterns or bonfires and concluded these were genuine lights in the sky. Despite inquiries among the local population, the cause of these lights remained elusive.

466
Sep. 24, 1860                                   Nebraska City, USA. After sunset, witnesses Joel Draper and Mr. Beebout observed three bright objects in apparent formation. The first object resembled a quarter of the sun's edge in size, color, brightness, and shape. Positioned to the right and slightly higher, the second object was about one-third the size of the first. A third object, also about one-third the size, appeared directly above the first. These objects moved rapidly southwards while maintaining their initial arrangement. The sky was clear with no clouds or vapors, ruling out the possibility of sun dogs or mock suns. The illumination caused by the objects made the surroundings as bright as ten to fifteen minutes before sunset.

467
Nov. 10, 1860                                   Washington, D.C., USA} Just before sunset, multiple witnesses observed three unidentified objects flying over the capital. Described as "the size of a balloon," one object moved swiftly in a southwesterly direction. Despite the strong daylight, the object had its own distinct and brilliant illumination. Witnesses learned that two similar objects had been sighted earlier. The object in question changed its course from southwest to a direct westward path, gradually and quickly fading from sight as it moved away from the observers.

468
1861                                            North Atlantic Ocean. During a squall, three luminous bodies emerged from the North Atlantic Ocean and remained visible for at least ten minutes.

469
Oct. 4, 1861                                    New York, USA. Around 6 P.M., an enigmatic balloon carrying two men flew over the city at a significant altitude, traveling from west to east. Speculations arose among witnesses, suggesting that the balloon might be associated with traitors or a creation of Professor Lowe. However, both explanations were deemed impossible.

470
Aug. 12, 1863                                   Madrid, Spain. A luminous object resembling a comet was seen on the eastern horizon. It exhibited a reddish color and a blazing crown-like appendix on its upper part. Initially stationary, the object eventually started maneuvering rapidly in various directions, including horizontal movement, ascent, and descent. The idea that it was a comet was not a viable explanation for this phenomenon.

471
Nov. 1, 1864                                    Florence, Italy. A white fiery globe, significantly larger than the full moon, appeared nearly stationary in the air. The globe displayed shifting hues of orange and blue across its surface. After about a minute, it abruptly vanished on the spot. A smaller fiery orange ball was observed just below it right before its disappearance, sharing the same hue at that moment.

472
Dec. 1867                                       Chatham, England. On the afternoon of Monday, the 4th, between 3 and 4 PM, a remarkable event occurred. Witnesses, including James E. Beveridge, observed numerous black disks in groups and scattered formations moving swiftly through the sky. The miller who first noticed it compared the disks to balloons. The disks, resembling large cannon shots when passing in front of the sun, persisted for over 20 minutes. As they flew overhead, they emitted grayish-brown vapor reminiscent of smoke before disappearing.

473
Jun. 8, 1868                                    Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford, England. Astronomers documented an unidentified luminous object at 9:50 P.M. The object displayed rapid movement across the sky, then halted and altered its course westward. Afterward, it changed direction again to the south, where it remained stationary for four minutes before proceeding northward.

474
Jul. 25, 1868                                   Parramatta, NSW, Australia. Mr. Frederick William Birmingham, an engineer, reported a sighting of a flying "Ark" resembling a vessel for air travel. While observing, he heard a voice confirming it was a machine for aerial travel. The machine performed maneuvers, including a curved descent. Birmingham described the machine's bottom, side, and front, noting its steel-blue color with fish-scale-like patterns. He experienced contact with a spirit who invited him aboard the machine. He entered a compartment with a table and was given papers with formulas. Subsequently, he encountered paranormal events like sky faces, poltergeist occurrences, and strange clouds.

475
Jun. 8, 1869                                    Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA. Around 2:30 A.M., a large object emitting bright red light and resembling a circle of fire was observed in the western sky for approximately 30 minutes. The object periodically emitted rays resembling broom straws, with sparks akin to a Roman candle. This display alternated with a central ball of fire. Two witnesses, including the doorman of Pike's Opera House, observed the phenomenon descending behind Mount Davidson, with continuous blazing and sporadic fire jets until disappearing.

476
Aug. 7, 1869                                    Adamstown, Pennsylvania. Around noon, a luminous object described as square descended from the sky and transformed into a 3 to 4 feet tall, 2 feet thick column. The object had a reflective quality, resembling burnished silver, and landed in a dry, swampless area 200 yards north of the village. After 10 minutes, the object vanished. Despite witnesses gathering at the landing spot, no traces of the object's landing were found.

477
Aug. 7, 1869                                    Ottumwa, Iowa. Approximately 25 minutes before a solar eclipse's totality, Professor Zentmayer, an astronomer, observed bright objects moving across the solar crescent from one cusp to the other. Each object took two seconds for the crossing, with clear, well-defined points indicating distance from the telescope. Similar objects were also reported by Professor Swift in Mattoon, Illinois, and by individuals in Shelbyville, Kentucky, observed by Alvan Clark Jr., George W. Dean, and Professor Winlock. The coordinated sightings across different locations ruled out the possibility of local insects or wind-carried seeds as explanations.

478
Spring, 1870                                    Alen, Norway. A flying object was observed in the sky by Lars Lillevold's grandmother. An occupant on the object gestured to her, beckoning for her attention.

479
Mar. 22, 1870                                   Atlantic Ocean. At 6:30 P.M., Captain Frederick William Banner and his crew on the American bark "Lady of the Lake" spotted an object while halfway between Senegal and Natal, Brazil. The object, observed in the south-southeast, appeared as a light gray circular cloud with a semicircle at the center and four arm-like extensions reaching from the center to the circle's edge. Additionally, a distinct fifth ray extended from the center beyond the circle. Moving to the northeast below the cloud cover, the object remained visible until 7:20 P.M., positioned about 30 degrees above the horizon.
18:30
480
Aug. 15, 1870                                   Dunbar, Scotland. At around 8:45 P.M., a bright sparkling ball of light with a blue tinge appeared approximately 45 degrees above the northern horizon. The ball emitted a tail of the same bright color, extending towards the north-east. The object initially appeared motionless but later exhibited a second tail branching off at a 45-degree angle, creating a forked appearance. This secondary tail intermittently disappeared and reappeared. Lasting about 20 minutes, the phenomenon eventually moved slowly in a south-westerly direction. Despite its striking display, no noise or explosion accompanied its passage, drawing significant attention and excitement from nearby villagers.
20:45
481
Sep. 26, 1870                                   Berlin, Germany. At 12:15 AM, an observer using a 4.5-inch achromatic telescope with a power of 46 noticed a luminous object with a comet-like tail moving slowly across the field of view. The object seemed to originate from Vega and move towards Epsilon Lyrae. The transit took around 30 seconds, and just before reaching the edge of the observer's view, the object vanished suddenly. While the observer initially considered it a falling star, the prolonged visibility in the telescope suggested otherwise.
12:15
482
Aug. 2, 1871                                    Marseille, France. Camille Flammarion reports an observation by Mr. Coggia, who discovered a comet. At 10:43 P.M., Mr. Coggia witnessed a long-lasting "bolide" that differed from traditional meteors due to its slow progression across the sky. Described as a "magnificent red object," it moved eastward for an extensive nine-minute duration. After a pause, it changed direction, moving north, and became stationary at 10:59. Resuming its eastward course, the object eventually disappeared from sight at 11:03 P.M.
22:43
483
Aug. 31, 1872                                   Rome, Italy. Camille Flammarion, a French astronomer and author, records an observation of a slow-moving object in the sky. The object's trajectory was distinct from that of a meteor, indicating that it was not a typical meteoric event.

484
Jun. 2, 1873                                    Paris, France. Astronomers from the Paris Observatory witnessed three round objects in the sky. These objects were seen moving slowly at an estimated altitude of 80 kilometers, and they left no visible trails behind them.

485
Aug. 30, 1873                                   Brussels and Ste-Gudule, Belgium. Approximate date. At 8 P.M., an object resembling a star emerged above the horizon in a clear sky. The object exhibited a starlike appearance and gradually ascended for two minutes before abruptly vanishing.
20:00
486
Nov. 30, 1873                                   Poissy, France. Multiple observers witnessed a maneuvering object with a red color akin to Mars. The object's presence persisted for about 10 minutes. Initially sighted in the North above the Big Dipper, it then approached the star 'gamma' without making contact, followed by a series of curved movements before disappearing in the western sky. Camille Flammarion and Mr. Vinot, the editor of Journal du Ciel, conducted inquiries that corroborated the reported sighting.

487
Apr. 24, 1874                                   Prague, Czechoslovakia. Professor Schafarik observed a dazzling white object in front of the three-quarter moon around 3:30 in the afternoon. Using a 4-inch achromatic telescope with a power of 66, he noticed the object while the sun was shining brightly. The object appeared as a bright white star on the moon's disc and moved slowly from E.S.E. to W.N.W. Once it left the moon's bright disc, it continued to shine in the deep blue sky, resembling prominent stars like Sirius or Vega during daylight. The object had a sharp appearance without a noticeable diameter. Professor Schafarik expressed uncertainty about the nature of the object.

488
Feb.17, 1875                                    Pwllhi, Caernarvonshire, Wales. Eight lights were observed moving erratically with variations in color and brightness. Witnesses reported the lights changing from light blue to bright carriage lamp-like light and even resembling electric lights. The lights moved in horizontal, perpendicular, and zigzag patterns at an estimated distance of 8 miles. The lights intermittently dimmed and reappeared over a short span of time.

489
Jan. 12, 1876                                   Sheridan, Pennsylvania. A man riding home on horseback encountered a bright light on a creek bank, initially intense but diminishing as it seemed to move away. The witness urged his horse forward and saw the light again in a field, accompanied by a white-clothed human-like figure gliding along the ground. When the figure approached within 100 yards, the horse bolted forward, nearly unseating the witness.

490
Apr. 4, 1876                                    Peckleloh, Germany. Mr. Weber from Berlin reported observing a potential intra-mercurial planetoid around 4:25 AM Berlin Mean Time. The sighting was communicated to astronomer Le Verrier by Astronomer Wolf in August 1876.

491
Mar. 17, 1877                                   Gunnersbury, England. A sizeable red "star" was observed around 8:55 PM in the Serpens constellation. Its brightness exceeded that of Arcturus. Over a span of at least 10 minutes, the object alternated between increasing and diminishing in magnitude, appearing to flash, before ultimately vanishing.

492
Mar. 23, 1877                                   Vence, France. Dazzlingly bright balls of fire, described as luminous, emerged from a cloud-like formation with a diameter of about one degree. These lights moved at a relatively slow pace and remained visible for over an hour as they moved northward.

493
Sep. 7, 1877                                    Bloomington, Indiana, USA. Mr. John Graham observed a sequence of five stationary luminous objects in the sky. The first object, located between the constellations Aquila and Anser et Vulpecula, increased in brightness before disappearing slightly to the east of its initial position. Following this, three more objects appeared and vanished at the same spot, except for one that disappeared west of the radiant. After a short interval, a fifth similar meteor appeared in the same location. These meteors resembled first-magnitude stars. An explanation for this observation could be an improbable succession of identical meteorites falling directly towards the observer's direction over several minutes.

494
Jan. 22, 1878                                   Dallas, Texas, USA. Mr. John Martin, a farmer, spotted a dark object in the northern sky while hunting. The object, initially the size of an orange, rapidly grew larger as it approached with remarkable speed. Passing directly overhead, Martin likened its appearance to a large saucer. This early use of the term "saucer" for unidentified flying objects has sparked debates among researchers. Notably, the term likely referred to the object's size, similar to how "saucer" was used by Kenneth Arnold in 1947 to describe the motion of crescent-shaped objects. The possibility that Martin observed a balloon also warrants consideration.

495
Feb. 1, 1878                                    Osceola Township, Iowa, USA. A newspaper reported a peculiar incident where a young man observed a large, intensely bright light moving along a road. The light approached him rapidly and stopped when it reached a point opposite him. After a brief pause, the light ascended and then descended back toward the observer. Perplexed by the sight, the man returned to a nearby house for safety. The light followed him to the house, and when he shared his experience with two men there, they ventured out, but the light vanished. It reappeared suddenly, seen by all three, and this time it moved in different directions at varying distances. Others in the neighborhood also witnessed the unexplainable phenomenon.

496
Jul. 29, 1878                                   Rawlins, Wyoming, USA. During a total eclipse, Professor Watson observed a shining object located a significant distance from the sun. Professor Swift of Denver, Colorado, also confirmed this observation. Astronomer Lockyer remarked that the discovery strongly suggested the identification of an intra-Mercurial planet by Professor Watson.

497
Jul. 30, 1878                                   Edwardsville, Kansas, USA. Mr. Timmons, a reliable farmer, recounts a remarkable incident involving section men from the K. P. railroad. Anticipating a storm, they sped towards Edwardsville on a hand-car when they spotted what seemed to be an approaching locomotive. Realizing it wasn't, they quickly removed the car from the track. The mysterious object emitted dense smoke with occasional flashes resembling a headlight within the smoke. It traveled about three-fourths of a mile along the track, circled a pile of cordwood, and then veered off in a southwesterly direction through dense woods. The duration of the phenomenon, although unusual, could possibly be attributed to globular lightning guided by the train tracks.

498
Aug. 11, 1878                                   McKeesport, Pennsylvania, USA. Amateur astronomers Mr. Gemill and Mr. Wampler, using a 5-inch telescope, observed an unusual dark spherical object on the eastern edge of Jupiter's disc. Moving westward above the northern belt and parallel to the planet's equator, it exited the disc at 1:24 AM on 12 August, completing the crossing in 3 hours and 19 minutes. The object, larger than any of Jupiter's known satellites, displayed a sharp and intense black appearance. Notably, it couldn't have been one of the four known satellites or their shadows, as those were all visible throughout the observation period.

499
Apr. 12, 1879                                   Manhattanville, New York, USA. Mr. Henry Harrison, while searching for Brorsen's comet, spotted a swiftly moving object that didn't match the characteristics of a comet. Confirming the observation with his friend Mr. J. Spencer Devoe, they both noticed the object's rapid motion. The object remained visible until 2 AM. Mr. Harrison emphasized technical details and disclaimed any sensationalism in reporting the phenomenon.

Oct. 10, 1879                                   Dubuque, Iowa, USA. Early morning observers were surprised by the sight of a large balloon-like object passing over the city, visible for an hour. Multiple people in different parts of the city witnessed the phenomenon. The object moved in a southwesterly direction and eventually disappeared on the horizon. Notably, Thomas Lloyd, an employee of the Times, observed the balloon from the southeast as it slowly rose and fell while heading south. Although a real balloon ("Pathfinder") had recently taken off from Missouri, it had already crashed into Lake Michigan, making it unlikely to be the cause of this sighting. This event marked one of the last in a series of U.S. sightings, culminating with the unexplained sighting of an "airship" hovering slowly over the city.
