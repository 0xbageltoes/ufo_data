1987

1987 — Abduction researcher and folklorist [Thomas E. Bullard](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ancientalienpedia.com/contributors/b/thomas-e-bullard-ph-d/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890169830513&usg=AOvVaw2OIBX6pq1W4bVCWACzS0zc) publishes UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery, a two-volume comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abduction cases up through 1985, 103 of which offer both extensive information and reliable investigation. Bullard’s study summarizes key episodes and descriptive elements of the abduction narrative and attaches percentages to each to indicate how often a given feature occurs. He finds that the classic abduction story consists of eight possible episodes—capture, examination, conference, tour of the ship, journey or otherworldly journey, theophany, return, and aftermath. Few reports contain every episode; only capture and return are universal. He also examines features of the entities’ behavior and appearance, the UFO involved in the abduction, and the methods of mental and physical control. Bullard examines the literalist and reductionist hypotheses for abduction events, critiquing each. (Thomas E. Bullard, UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery, Fund for UFO Research, 1987; Thomas E.

January 9 — 2:30 a.m. A road-maintenance engineer is on a routine checking tour between Hajdúböszörmény and Debrecen, Hungary, at the same point where his colleague had seen a “trailer” in December. He sees a “farmhouse” with the windows lit up, but knowing there is no farmhouse in that location, he stops the truck. The object is sitting near the overhead power lines between two stacks of straw. It is about 50 feet in diameter, disc- shaped, and rounded off at the rim. Through the center line runs a row of 8–10 portholes with warm, yellow light emanating from them. Between each window is a grayish-white streak of light. He can see an open door about 5– 6 feet high under the row of windows, through which he can see light and a floor with transverse ribs. Then he notices two entities wearing dark coveralls standing outside the object, while another appears in the door opening. Yellowish flashes erupt every 2–4 seconds from the top of the object. The witness flees the scene. (Karoli Hargitai, “The UFO Phenomenon in Hungary,” IUR 14, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1989): 15–16)

January 15–16 — 8:00 p.m. Police officer Glen Kazmar and Jeff Furseth watch a triangular configuration of red, white, and blue blinking lights that remain stationary in the southwestern sky over Belleville, Wisconsin. At 2:50 a.m., they are driving along Quarry Road west of town and see a “close-knit cluster of red, blue, and white lights.” After 15 minutes, they alert the Dane County Sheriff and are soon joined by a deputy from Verona and two Green County sheriff’s deputies, all of whom leave after debating what to do about reporting the lights. At 3:20 a.m., Kazmar and Furseth see the object move to the southwest. They call the FAA Center in Aurora, Illinois, which admits it has a slow-moving target in the area that won’t respond. Other witnesses near Monroe, New Glarus, and Verona also see lights.

February 6 — 7:30 p.m. Jeff Zweifel is walking home from work near Belleville, Wisconsin. He sees an object nearby with a bright white directional light aimed at a right angle to him. A red light is also visible, then a blue light. As he continues to walk, the object approaches him. When it is directly in front, a white light comes on. From left to right, red, white, and blue lights flash. A short gray trail of smoke is coming out the back. The object continues moving slowly and silently east at the same altitude.

They open the window and go out on the roof for an unobstructed view and spend the next 4–5 minutes watching it. At its closest point, about 500 feet away, it hovers in one position for about 2 minutes, wobbling with an even, slow oscillation. Its bottom seems to transform from silver to pitch black and back to silver again. Then it flies away at a faster but uniform speed.

March — 3:00 a.m. A British Army communications officer is sleeping alone on the moors near Bishop Monkton, North Yorkshire, England, during a military exercise. He sees a strange red light in the sky circling slowly and silently around him. He watches it for 20 minutes as it makes three circuits that are precisely the same. Two F-4 Phantom II jets appear and give chase to the light, which plays cat and mouse with them. This continues for 5 minutes, then the light shoots away at great speed. The jets remain a few more minutes before returning.

They take a side road to get a better look and stop alongside an open field. The main cigar-shaped object is silhouetted against the sunset, standing vertically above three smaller sections. The objects are all about a quarter mile away at low altitude. As they watch, the top object moves away from the smaller ones toward their right. It looks like an airplane fuselage without any markings, wings, or tail. It has a flashing light on top and two red glowing areas on the back, followed by a short vapor trail. Funseth estimates it is about 2,000 feet altitude. It picks up speed and streaks away

to the northeast. The remaining smaller objects are now obscured by a mist. Witnesses in other parts of town also see a similar display. (Don Schmitt, “The Belleville Sightings, Part One,” IUR 12, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1987): 7–8)

March 7 — A family of three in Pingwu county, Sichuan, China, is awakened by a loud, high-pitched hum. They go outside and are blinded by a beam of light coming from a huge reddish object shaped like a straw hat that is hovering above them. They pass out and wake up later to find themselves strapped to steel tables in a circular room occupied by humanoid entities with 3 eyes and standing 3 feet tall. The aliens take blood samples from them and probe them with needles, also making an incision on the child’s thigh. The next thing they know, they are walking down a road 7 miles from their home.

March 12 — 9:15 p.m. Cmdr. Alvaro de Camargo is flying a Transbrasil Boeing 737-300 from Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil, to Manaus, Amazonas, when his radar detects an object directly in front of him. The Rio Branco tower says it has nothing on its radar. Suddenly the blip disappears from the screen, just as three orange lights appear on the left side of the airplane’s wing. Some passengers now can see the lights, flying parallel to each other and to the plane for about 20 minutes. (Clark III 201; Brazil 542)

March 20 — 1:00 p.m. Police in Verona, Wisconsin, view a triangular pattern of red, white, and blue flashing lights from the police station. The on-duty officer takes a squad car to investigate as the object moves behind a hill and hovers above a field. Within a minute, the lights move to the southwest and soon are out of sight.

March 23 — Evening. A woman hears a crash outside her home in Concord, North Carolina, and goes outside to investigate. She sees a domed disk in her backyard about 75 feet away, partially obscured by a tree. The dome is about 6 feet in diameter on top of an object about 25 feet high. The dome is projecting an intensely bright orange light that creates shooting pains in her eyes and lights up the entire yard. The lower part of the object is blue-silver and an 18–20 foot wide ramp extends down from it. Her eyes still hurt, so she does not see the UFO leave. No ground markings are found the next day, although two days later she discovers that a metal post on her dog lot has been magnetized. (Michael D.

June 19 — 11:00 p.m. Brazilian Air Force Capt. Faria de Sousa is landing his aircraft at Anápolis Air Base ALA 2, Goiás, Brazil, when the control tower asks him to investigate “strange traffic” nearby. When he arrives at the location, his onboard radar registers the presence of another aircraft close by and his cockpit lights up. He sees a huge ball of light about 10 feet in diameter above his plane, but the light does not register on his radar. After 3 minutes he lands because he is running out of fuel.

July 27 — 12:00 midnight. Witnesses in Accra and the Volta Region of Ghana see a large and apparently silent object over the Gulf of Guinea. Some people report the sound of explosions associated with it. A Ghana Air Force pilot views the missile-shaped object from the ground near Accra, traveling south over the ocean. It displays a yellow light at its trailing end, similar to a rocket. It appears to be at least twice as large as a Boeing 747. It stops descending and begins to climb, gaining altitude. Eight smaller, bluish lights appear in circular formation, seemingly the result of the object’s propulsive power. (Dolan II 413–414)

Late July — 9:00 p.m.–5:00 a.m. A married couple and their daughter are riding in a horse cart, returning to their home near Będzienica, Poland. They notice two huge red spheres, apparently attached to each other, descending toward the northeast a few miles away and disappearing behind the horizon. After arriving home a few minutes later, the area outside their house becomes flooded in white light. The family rushes outside and sees two groups of three white lights silently floating low above a field less than one mile away to the northeast. The man alerts his neighbor and they return to the road to watch the lights for several minutes. Soon they notice a large red triangular light moving up and down in the northeast less than 2 miles away. After 6 minutes they hear a high-pitched sound like a car horn and the red light disappears. They continue watching the white lights, but soon notice that another neighbor’s barn about 1,000 feet away seems to be on fire. The man goes home to get his motorcycle and two daughters, but when they get to the barn there is no fire and the light is coming from another set of white spheres to the south. By this time it is after 10:00 p.m., and they ride the motorcycle to a nearby hill to watch the lights.

Soon one of the daughters sees a large object like a vertical white TV screen 10 feet high approaching from the east about 60–100 feet above the ground. Two humanoids with angular heads and in green coveralls are visible against the screen, one large and one smaller. The man restarts the motorcycle with difficulty and returns home. Some 300 feet from their farmhouse, they see another object, a fireball with a tail descending in the area where they had seen the red triangle. Tired, the daughters and his wife go to sleep around 11:00 p.m., but the man stays up to watch the UFO activity. Around 4:00 a.m. the original two sets of white objects rearrange into a complex

group of 7 lights and remain that way for another hour. The next day, the man feels sick with heart problems and is taken to a hospital for a short stay.

Early August — A Soviet soldier serving with the military contingent in Leningrad \[now St. Petersburg\] is dispatched with four others to northern Karelia, where they join up with another unit. Their job is to guard a UFO that soldiers had recently discovered near Vyborg. A military plane had taken it to Monchegorsk, Murmansk Oblast, and deposited it in a former fuel depot. The guards get a close look at the object, which is more than 50 feet long, 16 feet wide, and 9 feet high, grayish-tan in color, smooth, and seamless. It is tube-shaped, with fins extending from the mid-section all the way to the rear. At the tip of its nose are outward-pointing triangles in a triangular formation. One week later, senior officers show up and attempt to enter the craft unsuccessfully. The craft is moved to a hangar and all but one of the soldiers are sent back to Leningrad. In September, a successful entry is made, according to the remaining officer. Inside, they discover two armchairs, two steering wheels, and a featureless control panel. The cockpit is so small that two adults can hardly fit inside. Investigators who collect “rod-like items” from inside experience mild burns on their hands (though gloved).

August 4 — 10:00 p.m. Gordon Baker and two others watch two cross-shaped objects pass slowly and silently over his home from northeast to southwest in Exmouth, Devon, England. Describing it like a “flying fairground” at 38,000 feet, he watches a jet aircraft fly underneath it. They watch it for 15 minutes until it disappears on the horizon.

Observers in Lympstone and Budleigh Salterton also see the object. Two huge, delta-shaped objects are seen making successive passes over Plymouth, Devon, between 10:30 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. Observations were also made in Bude, Cornwall, and Exeter, Devon, where they were apparently tracked on radar.

August 11 — A witness in Osbornville, New Jersey, sees a shiny, oval object that hovers, becomes brighter, and takes off like a shot, leaving a white trail. It then stops abruptly, maneuvers, flashes more lights, and shoots straight up out of sight. (UFOEv II 30)

August 11 — Several people see a triangular object with three lights over Sevastopol, Crimea, Russia. A yellow light surriounds the perimeter, and a bright white light is seen inside. The object hovers and maneuvers for 3 hours with a trajectory that changes unpredictably. It disappears, reappears, and smaller objects separate rom it and take off at great speed. It finally takes off quickly away from the shoe. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, p. 136)

August 23 — 2:00–3:00 a.m. A witness sees a circular, white object west of Hajdúböszörmény, Hungary, flying slowly to the north. A thin, orange-colored light beam sweeps from it several times from west to east. Suddenly it “jumps” with tremendous speed from one place to another and remains stationary, still sweeping its light beam for at least 30 minutes. Then it suddenly disappears.

Steinman calls Walker, saying he is inquiring about “meetings that you attended at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in/around 1949–1950, concerning the military recovery of flying saucers, and bodies of occupants.” Walker replies: “Yes, I attended meetings concerning that subject matter.” Walker agrees they are talking about recovered aliens and seems nonchalant about the subject. Walker adds: “Yes, I know of MJ-12. I have known of them for 40 years… You are delving into an area that you can do absolutely nothing about… Forget about it!” Walker tells Steinman that he would consult his notes on the topic and hints he might cooperate further. Steinman writes Walker on August 31, sending him the MJ-12 briefing document and asking about Project Aquarius. Three weeks later, Walker replies, saying, “Some things you have right and some things you have very wrong.” He admits a machine was recovered and is still stored near “Wright Field.” Four normal looking males were found at the site, very much alive. “They learned the English language within a few hours and it was our decision not to make public spectacles of them, but to allow them to be absorbed into American culture.” Each of the four, Walker alleges, became highly successful in technology, sports, and finance.

August 31 — 10:55 p.m. A dark, domed, disc-shaped UFO with a mast or antenna on top comes down quickly over the high-security Naval Submarine Base Bangor \[now Naval Base Kitsap\] on the Kitsap Peninsula, Washington,

which houses the Trident nuclear ballistic submarine fleet. It hovers over a playground. Randy Springsteen, 8, and Dennis Mauer, 10, sons of military personnel, are sitting on the swings and see an entity with a big head, big pointed “cat” ears, wrinkled skin, and a greenish complexion in an open hatch. It has a thin, spindly body, long webbed fingers and toes, and tabs or suction cups on the ends of its fingers and toes. It also has a wrinkled mouth “like an old grandma’s.” The boys estimate the being is about 6 feet tall. It points a device that directs a beam of energy at the two boys on the swings, causing the levitation of the metal swings. The boys flee quickly into the Springsteen home and get Charlene Springsteen, who sees a row of lights in the sky as the UFO takes off and flies away. Charlene then has the boys draw separate sketches of both the UFO and the alien, which are remarkably similar. (Donald A.

Suddenly a dark shape appears passing from in back of them from the north over the roof of the house and blotting out the stars in a precise boomerang shape. The perimeter of the shape is covered with 12–20 individual lights. All sounds from insects, tree frogs, and distant dogs stops. The campfire flame rises straight up, frozen. The aspen tree in the front yard stops “quaking” and the children gasp. The soundless object is low, and it extends beyond the 72-foot length of the house. After one minute, the light configuration wobbles, the lights change from amber to red, and the object splits into three sections, spreads out, and dissipates.

September — Three witnesses in Taunton, Somerset, England, observe a triangular object with bright white lights at each point and red lights underneath, rotating to the left. Its size is estimated to be comparable to three C-130 aircraft. (Marler 139)

September 11 — 8:15 p.m. Lydia B. Lövendal-Papae and her husband are walking between Herăstrău Park \[now King Michael I Park\] and Aviators Square in Bucharest, Romania, when they see a large, reddish-orange star hovering above the nearby Arcul de Triumf. After a minute, it moves to right above them and stops for a couple minutes before it sways back and forth. Suddenly it makes large zigzag movements toward the Romanian National Television building and disappears to the northeast. After 5 minutes, her husband sees a white beam shooting briefly from the direction it has gone. (Romania 45–46)

September 13 — A radioactive contamination accident takes place in Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil, after a forgotten radiotherapy source is taken from an abandoned hospital site in the city. It is subsequently handled by many people, resulting in four deaths. About 112,000 people are examined for radioactive contamination and 249 of them are found to be contaminated. In the cleanup operation, topsoil has to be removed from several sites, and several hundred houses are demolished. All the objects from within those houses, including personal possessions, are seized and incinerated.

September 14 — 6:05 p.m. A man and his daughter are walking in Debrecen, Hungary, when she sees a “flying log.” The man looks up and sees a cylindrical object flying very slowly to the north. After 3 minutes it disappears without a trace. (Karoli Hargitai, “The UFO Phenomenon in Hungary,” IUR 14, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1989): 16)

September 22 — 9:00 p.m. A young couple is sitting outside in Bossier City, Louisiana, when they see a large, conical or triangular object pass silently in the sky. It has sparsely distributed lighting on its base and seems metallic and solid. They estimate it is several football fields in length. On October 6, the man sees the object again, moving in the same direction toward Barksdale Air Force Base. (Michael D. Swords, “Timmerman’s Triangles,” IUR 29, no. 2 (Summer 2004): 16)

Mid-October — 6:00 p.m. A man is driving up Candlewood Lake Road, near Brookfield, Connecticut, when he sees a low-flying aerial object that passes over the trees to the left. After making a turn, he notices four cars stopped with no lights on off the side of the road. He flashes his headlights and his car’s radio and electrical power dies. All the other drivers—three men and a woman—are out of their cars. They tell him that their vehicles stopped as a large, bright aircraft flew over and passed silently over a hill in the west. It had all white and amber lights and was triangular in shape. Two other cars drive by at that time and their engines sputter but they do not stop. He notices a glow in the woods. He wants to investigate it, but no one will accompany him. Grabbing a flashlight, he walks into the woods for about a quarter of a mile, watching the glow get brighter. As he climbs a hill, the glow turns deep red and then off-white. As he reaches the top of the hill, he sees a lighted object, but trees block his view. He climbs down the hill to a clearing and sees an object like a dark triangle hovering silently in (not above) the trees. He hears a noise and sees a figure wearing a helmet and a dark suit with glowing metallic stripes around the arms

and waist approaching the object. It reaches the UFO and looks in the witness’s direction. He hears thoughts in his head saying that he shouldn’t come closer. As he watches, the figure raises its hand as if to say goodbye and vanishes in a flash of red light. The object then blinks out as if someone has just turned it off. (NightSiege 201– 203)

November 11 — 5:00 p.m. Edward Walters, president of a construction company in Gulf Breeze, Florida, has his first alleged encounter with a UFO. He sees a glowing, top-shaped craft with a row of portholes across the midsection and a luminous ring on the bottom. He rushes in and grabs a Polaroid camera and snaps a photo just as the UFO is moving from behind a tree. He takes three more photos as the object, 150 feet away, drifts in a northeasterly direction. As he is taking more photos, the object moves above him, and Walters is hit by a blue beam that paralyzes him and lifts him several feet off the ground. After hearing a computerlike voice and a female voice, he sees images of dogs. Then he falls hard on the pavement and the UFO is gone. Over the next few months, Walters (initially concealing his identity as “Mr. X”) and his family claim a bewildering variety of close encounters, including abduction incidents, and Walters continues to produce more photos of the UFOs plaguing him. The veracity of his claims causes a rift in ufology, with MUFON championing the case and CUFOS very skeptical.

California ufologist and songwriter [Zan Overall](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.zanoverallsongs.com/bio/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890169892878&usg=AOvVaw3dIYW6E48leI_uYRfO2sgn) produces evidence that Walters knew how to double-expose photos well before his UFO pictures. In June 1990, a model UFO, seemingly a prototype for a fake UFO in his photos, is found in the wall of the house formerly occupied by Walters.

Mid-November — 7:00 p.m. Jim Dawes is one of the witnesses of an object in the shape of the supersonic airplane Concorde at Wolverhampton, England. When it reaches overhead, he sees it is composed of many different lights in a triangle shape. (“Mystery of ‘Concorde shape UFO,’” Wolverhampton (UK) Express-Star, December 2, 1987; Marler 120)

November 23 — 8:25 p.m. Rick Devine goes out the back door of his home in Shreve, Ohio, to round up the family dogs and cats. He glances up and sees four blobs of cool-white light maneuvering in a cloverleaf pattern (elliptical orbits with a common center of flight, meeting at the center) in an area of sky a few hundred feet in diameter. The objects move slower at the outer edges of the orbit and faster as they near the center. Devine shoos the animals

inside (no reaction to the display) and calls to his wife Janet. She joins him and they continue to watch the objects. She describes the lights as rectangular. They cross the street into a schoolyard to get closer to the lights, which move away as if in response. At no time does the brightness or color or altitude of the lights change. Seemingly, the display covers an area equivalent to a baseball diamond. It moves back across the road, and the Devines follow. As they watch, the four blobs of light come together in the center, move outward and continue onward, disappearing 90° from each other. The sighting lasts 35 minutes.

November 28 — 9:10 p.m.–12:00 midnight. 33 unknown objects fly at low altitude over the coast of Primorsky Krai, Far Eastern district, Russia, on the Sea of Japan. Witnesses describe various shapes—cylinders, cigars, globes—all moving silently. Thirteen UFOs are seen above Dalnegorsk. The objects cause a 2-minute disruption of electrical circuits, including TVs and computers. More than 100 witnesses are questioned by the Far Eastern Commission.

Winter — Night. Air Force Security Policeman Joseph C. Pscolka is awakened by the night shift flight security controller at the Malmstrom AFB N-01 missile alert facility northwest of Grassrange, Montana, who tells him that an alarm response team responded to a security alert at the N-06 launch site and had not been heard from for nearly an hour. Pscolka assembles a security response team and joins them to drive to the site. The security lights are out and the alarm team’s vehicle parked 50 feet from the wide-open gate with its lights out and engine off. Pscolka drives up to the vehicle when his own Peacekeeper APC loses power. At that moment, the alert team bursts from its vehicle and runs to the APC, begging to be let in. Their vehicle had shut down entirely, even the flashlights.

The entire launch facility, up to 20 feet outside the gate, is devoid of snow, even though the snow outside is knee- deep. Pscolka goes up to the facility alone after posting guards. When he gets to the snow-free zone, he notes the temperature is warmer, even hot. Everything within the facility is warm to the touch, including the soil. But there are no intruders. A few more APCs approach down the access road, and suddenly all the facility and vehicle lights come on again. After the incident, the teams are debriefed and ordered not to tell anyone about it.

He cites the disparity between the briefing document’s extensive discussion of the Roswell crash and the mere 7 lines of text on the 1950 Texas crash.

December — John Grace founds the Leading Edge International research group after receiving the “Dulce Papers,” a set of documents allegedly disclosing unethical experiments on humans—such as breeding techniques, DNA manipulation, and genetic modification—at an underground base in Dulce, New Mexico. The papers inspired and are included in The Matrix series of six books published from 1988 to 2007 by Grace under the pseudonym Valdamar Valerian. These huge compilations of supposed documents and insider information discuss the alien visitors and treaties with earthly governments, harvests of human body parts, friendly and unfriendly alien species, the creation of humans and culture by aliens, acquisition of alien technology, and the dangers of an alien takeover.

December 1 — 7:15 a.m. A former London policeman (pseudonym Philip Spencer) is walking across Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire, England, to visit his father-in-law in East Morton. He was walking up a small hill when he notices an odd-looking figure in the trail ahead of him. It is dark green and about 4 feet tall with an oversized head and long, thin arms. The creature makes a gesture at Spencer, which he takes to be a warning telling him to stay away, but he takes out his camera and snaps a picture. The creature then runs away and Spencer follows it. He loses the creature in the fog but then sees an object rise from the moor and disappear into the sky. It is a whitish color and consists of two saucer-shaped parts on top of each other. He hears a loud hum. He fails to take a photo of the object. Rather than continue with his planned route, Spencer heads to another town that was about 30 minutes away. When he arrives, he finds that it is about two hours later than he expects it to be. Additionally, the compass he has taken with him is pointed in the opposite direction than it should be. While the photo is getting examined by experts, Spencer has strange dreams. Following ufologist Peter Hough’s advice, he attends a session of regressive hypnotherapy carried out by Jim Singleton on March 16, 1988. Under hypnosis, Spencer’s original account of the incident changes. Singleton calls it a genuine recall. Spencer now remembers that when he saw the

creature on the hill he was instantly paralyzed, lifted up a few feet, and pulled into the craft. When he enters, a voice tells him to be calm. A group of green aliens then performs medical experiments on him, inserting items into his nose and mouth. He is given a tour of the craft and shown a film with apocalyptic imagery, including nuclear explosions, famines, and floods. He is then shown a second film, but he never reveals the contents of this film, saying that the aliens who abducted him do not want humanity to know. Following this, Spencer is returned to Ilkley Moor, where he then takes his photograph. He claims that the alien is actually waving goodbye to him, not telling him to stay away, as in his original account.

December 9 — Night. Oddly moving lights in the sky appear over Nottingham, England, traveling quickly and emitting a deep hum. A triangular object about 250 feet long covered in 150 red and white lights is observed over a farm near Hull around the same date. Similar UFOs are seen in Staffordshire and Long Eaton, Derbyshire.

December 14 — 9:30 p.m. A gray, oval-shaped object lands on the road ahead of a Mercedes car near Launceston, Tasmania. The engine and lights fail instantly, and the driver brakes to a stop. Intense light comes from the base of the object that is painful to the driver’s eyes. He leaves the car and gets sick, hiding behind a tree from where he watches his car being dragged about 33 feet, as if attracted by a magnet, and leaving tire marks on the road. A Land Cruiser approaches the scene and its lights fail, but the diesel engine continues to operate. The object takes off with a whirring sound. The car is covered with melted specks of asphalt, and serious electrical problems must be fixed after the incident. (Herbert S.

Having learned hypnotic regression techniques from her therapist, she regresses her husband, whereupon he remembers several childhood experiences with gray aliens. Several nights later, Karla awakens to sounds of clicks and bumps in the house, followed by disembodied voices in her bedroom. She later remembers a nightmare from her childhood in which an insect-like being holds her hand and tells her it is her mother. Soon she and her husband undergo regression by an Oklahoma UFO researcher, which produces accounts of repeated abductions since childhood and evidence that her whole family was involved. After one session, Karla, her husband, and a third person see a lighted, disc- shaped craft hovering above them. Two weeks later, she again hears voices in the night and loud knocking sounds. She wakes to find small punctures on her inner wrist and three white circles on her abdomen. Into 1989, more body marks appear, including a solid red triangle on her arm, puncture wounds, scratches, and bruises.

Poltergeist phenomena occur. The Turners begin to notice a white car parked near their house, and unmarked

helicopters seem to follow them. They begin to suspect the US military is monitoring them.

January — A family in the vicinity of Pasadena, California, notices a large, perfectly circular brown spot, 13 feet in diameter, in their backyard in the midst of their lush, well-cared for St. Augustine grass. It seems to have appeared the morning after the wife awakens to see a small, gray-skinned entity standing beside her and probing her torso with medical instruments. She had seen a strange light beam one month earlier. The brown area slowly fills in with Bermuda grass after 6 months. The Los Angeles County agricultural pathologist who examines a soil sample finds four southern chinch bugs (Blissus insularis) that he says can cause similar damage, although the progression is much slower and requires many more insects than four.

January 5 (or 15) — 5:00 a.m. Cristian Tuţă is doing mandatory military service in a unit at Roşu, Romania, on the shore of Lacul Morii. While on guard duty, he notices an oval light positioned vertically 30 feet above the bridge to the only island on the lake. He estimates it is 45 feet high and 15 feet wide. Inside are four much brighter lights in the shape of a cross. At first it remains motionless, but begins quickly moving up and down along the bridge like a sine wave for 30 minutes. It stops abruptly and moves slowly to the southwest at an altitude of 60 feet. When it comes to a clump of trees, it changes its shape to two discs put together. In a split second it zooms away to the west. (Romania 46–48)

January 12 — Ed Walters produces his most famous photo—a brightly lit structured craft hovering above a road near his home in Gulf Breeze, Florida.

January 19 — 5:00 p.m. A father and daughter are driving to pick the mother up from work in Benton, Louisiana. When they pull into the mall parking lot, the daughter notices a streak of light in the sky that suddenly moves right in front of them about 150 feet away and 50 feet above the ground. It is a dull silver disc with “turbines” or openings around its perimeter that are spinning like a slowly moving fan. From the top of the object emerges a sheath with rotary blades, although the blades do not rotate. The disc is about the size of an automobile, around 5 feet tall, and completely silent. For 90 seconds, all the noise of the mall seems muted. Then the device begins to move and zips away quickly. (Michael D. Swords, “Unusual Experiences from the Timmerman Files,” IUR 27, no. 2 (Summer 2002): 21)

January 20 — 4:10 a.m. Faye Knowles and her three sons Patrick, Sean, and Wayne are en route along the Eyre Highway from Perth, Western Australia, to Melbourne, Victoria, by car, when they observe a bright, egg-shaped object ahead of them on the road near Mundrabilla, Western Australia. Sean is driving and has to swerve to miss the object. The egg-shaped object then begins to follow their station wagon. At some point, Sean does a U-turn to approach the object, but soon goes back to driving eastward. The family becomes disoriented, and the sequence of events is difficult to reconstruct. They roll down the windows and a “grayish-black mist” enters into the car. Faye reaches out the window to touch the roof and feels something warm, soft, and rubbery that covers her hand in black dust. They hear a thud on the roof and come to believe that the object has lifted their car off the road. They are let down suddenly and the right rear tire blows out. A truck driver named Graham Henley is driving ahead of the Knowles’s car; he sees a bright light in his rearview mirror for about 5 minutes. Shortly after Henley pulls into Mundrabilla, the Knowles family arrives in a state of disorientation. He inspects the damaged tire, sees dents in the roof, and smells something burnt. Henley and another trucker drive back to the scene and find skid marks and footprints. In the afternoon, the family report to police in Ceduna, South Australia, who note their distress and the dents in the roof. Samples of the black dust are collected for forensic analysis. The police tests are never done, but at least half of the material is obtained by ufologists [Keith Basterfield](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.auforn.com/Kbintro.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890169930702&usg=AOvVaw2OQWeSWPPBGJe7F21bUAm-) and [Ray Brooke](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ufos-scientificresearch.blogspot.com/2018/09/ray-brooke-passing-of-australian-uap.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890169931241&usg=AOvVaw2VIqpQ5PEchEmdx4nOkLAR), who take it to a laboratory. The analysis reveals ordinary materials: sodium chloride, sodium, aluminum, magnesium, sulfur, potassium, silicon, chlorine, clay particles, and calcium. The Seven Network pays the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories to test the vehicle for radioactivity, but there is none above background. AMDEL states that the car tire has failed due to being underinflated, and the dust, smell, and smoke is due to the blowout. Another set of samples is taken from the car by the Victorian UFO Research Society and sent to two different labs, again with commonplace results. However, one analysis by [Richard Haines](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/bio-haines.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890169931681&usg=AOvVaw3JTSkm4Cr7mu6wqMSFr8bZ) in the US concludes that the interior dust is different from the exterior dust, which contains a possible trace of astatine, a radioactive chemical element. Faye’s hand became red and swollen in the days after the event.

January 21 — 8:00 p.m. Ex-Navy Lt. Dan McIndoe and his family are at their home 5 miles north of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, when they see a white light with red and blue flashes. They watch it maneuvering for 2 hours. (Donald A. Johnson, “UFOs in Washington Skies,” IUR 13, no. 2 (March/April 1988): 4–6)

February 4 — 8:10 p.m. A woman is driving between Bacup, Lancashire, and Todmorden, Yorkshire, England, when she sees an intense orange, egg-shaped light to the south-southeast above Tooler Hill when she is crossing the border between the two counties. Its interior is like a “swirling liquid (or fire embers) with constantly changing patterns.” She stops to watch it as it hovers for another 2–3 minutes. As she drives away it starts to move, so she pulls over again and watches it (now dimmer) move away to the southwest. It speeds up as it descends below the level of the hillside.

February 9 — 8:00 a.m. A man looking for farm work near Oswestry, Shropshire, England, sees a dog run from a parked car he is passing. The dog crosses the road and runs barking straight int a swirling, yellowish, glowing mist about 45 feet in diameter that straddles a hedgerow. The mist is making a noise like rushing air. The dog owner gets out of the car, and the witness follows her toward the glow and tries to calm her down. As they approach, their hair stands on end, their skin begins tingling, and they smell sulfur as an eerie stillness envelops them. Moments later, the glow disappears as if it is melting away. The dog is lying on the ground looking ill. Its eyes are red and its coat is soaking wet, yet the moisture is evaporating rapidly with steam visibly rising. The man carries the dog back to the car and the woman drives off with it. He later finds out that the dog recovered after an hour or so but died a few weeks later.

February 10 — 7:45–8:30 p.m. Numerous independent observers on the border of Cambria and Somerset counties near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, see a 60-foot object with several rows of lights that make it look like a “cruise ship in the sky.” The object passes over cars and trees at an altitude of 50–100 feet. It emits a slight humming sound and projects multiple beams of light toward the ground.

March 3 — 8:30 p.m. The brothers Farisano are returning home from a soccer championship near General Belgrano, Buenos Aires, Argentina, when they notice some strange lights above a nearby bridge. As they approach the lights, their vehicle engine suddenly stalls. They try to restart it but cannot, so they remain in their truck watching the lights. They now see that the lights are on a spherical object with a large red light on the top and several white lights in a row on the bottom section. The object hovers close to the ground. Inside the transparent midsection the witnesses can see a shadow-like figure moving about. The object suddenly moves slowly out of sight, after which the truck engine restarts and they drive home.

March 4 — 8:35 p.m. Sheila and Henry Baker and their three children are driving home to Eastlake, Ohio, after going to dinner. As they near the waterfront, Sheila notices something hovering above Lake Erie, so they drive down to the beach to investigate. A huge, metallic-gray, football-shaped object like a blimp is silently rocking back and forth, blinding white light emanating from both ends. It begins circling, moving overhead at about 1,300 feet. Somehow it causes the lake ice to rumble and crack. The Bakers get nervous and drive home, where they can still see the UFO with red and blue blinking lights along the bottom edge. 5–6 bright triangular lights detach from the side, hovering at first, then darting and zigzagging around at high speeds. Each is smaller than a Cessna and cross 50- mile stretches low over the ice “in the snap of a finger.” They make several passes toward the Perry Nuclear Power Plant about 20 miles away. The Bakers alert the Coast Guard, and Seaman James Powers and Petty Officer John Knaub drive to the beach, where the triangular objects approach them. They give a blow-by-blow radio report to the Coast Guard base in Detroit. Other witnesses in different locations also see the triangles. Suddenly the smaller objects return to the large one, which seems to be landing on the ice. They reenter it, the ellipse flashes a series of red, blue, and yellow lights, and the light at the end turns from white to red. Suddenly the lights go out and the ice booming stops. The witnesses assume the object has gone beneath the surface. The Coast Guard report the next day suggests that the lights were Venus and Jupiter.

May 16 — 9:30–10:00 p.m. Eileen Ballard and four friends are outside in Stafford, England, when they notice two spotlights in the sky.

The center is divided by a glass-like, amber-colored window, and lights can be seen flashing inside. The object emits a mist toward the ground.

September 25 —10:30 p.m. A man is driving along State Highway 113 in Lorain County, Ohio, when his car stalls. He sees two other stalled cars on the side of the road, so he gets out and talks to the four people from the other cars for a few minutes. They realize there are lights nearby in the woods that come from a silvery triangular object with a rim and rounded base. The treetops above it seem to be moving, although it is a calm night. After 15–20 minutes the object rises at an angle and moves away slowly and silently, passing overhead. It seems wider than the road.

The 1988 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty allows the Soviets to test-fire IRBMs into the sea, rather than breaking them up. Moving into position to collect telemetry information from the launch, Hopkins observes a “translucent, milky white wall moving from the left, over the USSR, to the right, over the Northern Pacific Ocean. It covered the entire sky from ground level to as far up as we could see looking out the front windows of the airplane.” The wall of light passes at an estimated 6,200 mph, disappearing eastward and leaving darkness behind it. Some analysts at the USAF Foreign Technology Division think it is caused by something in the first-stage fuel of the RSD-10; others suggest it is produced deliberately to dazzle US observation satellites. Some speculate that Russia has a secret Dome of Light weapon that has been observed several times since and that might involve a plasma that can temporarily disrupt electronics and blind a satellite.

November 11–12 — 5:00 p.m. A truck driver returning from Utah to Baker, California, goes through a series of bizarre and inexplicable experiences, some of them ufological, that leave him convinced that his truck is possessed and “they” have been in control of him all along. The experiences end shortly after midnight before he returns to Baker and leave him terrified. During the drive he has been drinking copious amounts of coffee, which may have contributed to his hallucinatory excitement. (Ann Druffel, “The Caffeine Zone,” IUR 13, no. 3 (May/June 1988): 18–22)

Behind a big black curtain are three flying saucers hovering above the floor. The small saucer is about 24 feet in diameter. The next

biggest one is 60 feet in diameter at the base, and another one is 130 feet. They are referred to as Alien Reproduction Vehicles. A videotape shows the smallest of the three vehicles making three little, quick, hopping motions; then it accelerates straight up and out of sight, completely disappearing from view in just a couple of seconds. There is a cut-away illustration that shows oxygen tanks and a robotic arm that can extend out from the side of the vehicle for collecting samples in space.

November 22 — The Northrup Grumman B-2 stealth bomber is first publicly displayed at United States Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, where it is assembled. This viewing is heavily restricted, and guests are not allowed to see the rear of the B-2. However, Aviation Week editors find that there are no airspace restrictions above the presentation area and take aerial photographs of the aircraft’s then-secret rear section with its suppressed engine exhausts.

Lazar makes contact, and later receives a call from EG&G, a high-tech company with contracts at Groom Lake, Nevada. (Dolan II 475)

November 30 — An arranged meeting takes place in Washington, D.C., between AFOSI and FBI agents, who request information about the MJ-12 documents. The Air Force tells the FBI the documents are completely bogus and the FBI should cease its inquiry. (Kremlin 182–183)

December 1— [Robert Lazar](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890169993136&usg=AOvVaw0jjOg4vNP4c5LDwUxjETQe) allegedly interviews at EG&G, but is informed that he is overqualified for the position in question (Dolan II 475)

December 1 — 11:00 p.m. A captain of the Brazilian Air Force flying a Mirage fighter jet is returning from a mission and is over Jaboãtoa dos Guararapes, Pernambuco, Brazil, when his radar indicates traffic about one mile from his position. He requests permission to intercept and goes after the brilliant disk-like object that has a dull glow like copper. The CINDACTA III radar still finds nothing. The UFO begins to approach the jet and suddenly his instruments begin to fail. A red light in the center begins to grow stronger and the pilot arms his missiles; but the missiles do not respond to his command and the UFO flies off in mere seconds. But the chase continues another 10 minutes, during which time the UFO plays with its pursuer. After landing, the pilot is told that another aircraft has seen a strange object about 15 minutes earlier in the state of São Paulo more than 1,242 miles away. (Clark III 207; Brazil 556–557)

December 4 — 5:25 a.m. A police officer en route to his station in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, notices a brilliant glow in the sky ahead of him. It is so bright he can hardly see as he drives down a four-lane road, and he swerves and blocks two lanes. About 150 feet in the air is a 75-foot-long, highly polished silver object shaped like an ellipse. It is emitting a humming sound and casting light into and all around his car. It moves left and right, then shoots straight up into the sky, stopping again briefly before departing. The officer’s eyes hurt badly from the brightness and he feels ill. There is a sunburn-like rash on his face, and he has severe eye irritation, headache, and neck pain after the incident. He notes that the paint on his car has been dulled and an unusual powder-like substance is found on the exterior.

There he meets with a security officer named Dennis Mariani, who escorts him on a flight to Area 51 at Groom Lake, where Lazar signs a secrecy agreement that requires intensive monitoring of his activities. He and Mariani board a bus with blacked-out windows and ride for 30 minutes down a dirt and gravel road. They arrive at a base near Papoose Dry Lake known as S-4. Lazar’s ID is prepared, he is given a physical and treated for allergic reactions to unknown substances, then he begins work at S-4. Lazar claims he only visits S-4 on six or seven occasions between December 1988 and April 1989 to learn about Project Galileo, which deals with gravity and propulsion, and training on an “antimatter reactor.” He also reads about a second project, Looking Glass, concerned with seeing back in time.

December 28 — 7:45 p.m. Many people in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, see a huge, bright-yellow triangular object in the sky. Mañuel Marcado watches as two F-14 Tomcats (probably from an aircraft carrier) approach the object from either side then cross in front of it. The light stops in mid-air and absorbs both planes, according to Marcado. The object moves over Lago Samán, then divides itself into two triangles, one of which shoots off to the east and the other to the north. Allegedly, the triangular objects were tracked on US Navy radars.

January 28 — Evening. A triangular UFO is seen over Tiptree, Essex, England. Its color changes from bright to dull white before it shoots to the southwest. Other triangular UFOs are observed in southeast Essex in January. (Marler 124)

February — Numerous witnesses in Gloucestershire, England, report a noiseless triangular UFO “ablaze with lights.” One report describes a series of light beams emanating toward the ground that give it a “tripod effect.” (Wilts & Gloucester Standard of Cirencester, February 24, 1989; Marler 124–125)

February 8 — 3:40 a.m. A man in Gulf Breeze, Florida, wakes to the sound of dogs barking outside. He sees a small object descending low over a nearby lot. It appears to be two connected discs, one on top of the other, not more than 3 feet in diameter. A white light is on top, and many other lights are blinking in shades of red, orange, and green. He approaches it, but it disappears in a flash of light. The duration is about 12 minutes.

February 10 — 8:42 p.m. A woman in Grove Oak, Alabama, tells the Fyffe, Alabama, police department that she has been watching a curved object for more than an hour with a pair of binoculars. It has a red light on each end and a white light in between, with the top of the curve outlined in green light.

It begins moving away as they approach. The officers drive after the object, following it for 12 miles when it suddenly reverses direction and flies over their patrol car at 300–400 mph. It is soon seen by law enforcement officers to the south in Crossville, Geraldine, and Collinsville, Alabama. The DeKalb County Sheriff’s Office receives more than 50 calls from citizens in surrounding communities, including Dawson and Dog Town, Alabama, and Lick Skillet, Tennessee, regarding a “silent thing streaking through the dark.” (“[Friday Night UFO Remains a](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%2520States/UFO%2520Newsclipping%2520Service/UFO%2520Newsclipping%2520Service%2520-%25201989%252003%2520-%2520no%2520236.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170005268&usg=AOvVaw2mfN79MF7QhkGbyu4mjHbO) [Mystery,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%2520States/UFO%2520Newsclipping%2520Service/UFO%2520Newsclipping%2520Service%2520-%25201989%252003%2520-%2520no%2520236.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170006012&usg=AOvVaw1cRnKBgMNEXXhuH2pTeql1)” Fort Payne (Ala.)

March — [Robert Lazar](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170010390&usg=AOvVaw3iwUFzl3_1FYkGLG6fwkK8) allegedly sees a disc on his third visit to S-4 at Groom Lake, Nevada. It is a classic-looking flying saucer, resting on three legs in a hangar. It is about 35–40 feet in diameter, 15 feet tall, and the color of pewter.

During his stay at S-4, he sees a total of 9 flying saucers, each distinctive in design and size. His assignment, however, involves just one craft he nicknames the “sport model,” which he is allowed to examine on his fourth visit to S-4. The disc has three levels, and he is cleared for the lower two. Lazar crawls underneath the craft and sees three “gravity amplifiers” that focus a “Gravity A” wave from the “total annihilation” reactor in the center

level of the craft. In this level, he sees a control panel and very small chairs—too small for human pilots. He discovers that part of the skin of the craft can become transparent, allowing one to look through it like a window. According to Lazar, the fuel for the craft is Element 115 \[later synthesized in 2003 and named moscovium in 2016, but this is much different than what Lazar describes\], housed in the reactor where it undergoes bombardment and spontaneous fission, producing antimatter particles that are converted to electricity with 100% efficiency. This power operates the amplifier, distorts the surrounding gravitational field, causes the craft to be invisible, and shortens the distance to a charted destination. Speed-of-light limitations are irrelevant. But Element 115 cannot be manufactured on Earth. The aliens have left only 500 pounds of it, but just 223 grams (half a pound) can fuel a craft for a long time. On another occasion, Lazar witnesses a demonstration of the craft, which lifts off the ground, moves left and right, and sits back down. He has access to and reads more than 100 documents dealing with the craft, its propulsion, and alien technology, as well as photos of gray alien bodies. The aliens are allegedly from the Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2 star system. The Reticulans claim to have genetically corrected human evolution up to 65 times over the past 10,000 years using viruses. They have given humans religion to prevent them from self-destructing and claim to be able to exert mind control on people when they are relaxed or sleeping. Lazar allegedly catches a glimpse of a small, gray alien standing between two men in white coats in a small room inside the secret S-4 facility. The documents also mention an exchange of information and hardware between the US government and the Reticulans until 1979, when some kind of conflict occurred. This is when the aliens leave and the military begins reverse-engineering what alien tech they have acquired. Then in May 1987, some scientists take an antimatter reactor to an underground Nevada test facility, where they are killed when attempting to cut the reactor open. Lazar claims he was hired as a substitute for one of these men.

Late March — 9:20 p.m. After a training exercise at Mihai Kogălniceanu Air Force Base \[now Mihai Kogălniceanu International Airport\] in southeast Romania, 18–20 aircraft pilots of Regiment 57 are inside a building at the base planning future exercises; outside, Col. Aurelian Dobre notices multiple lights appear above some nearby trees. He alerts the oher pilots to come out, and they see a triangular formation of objects at an equal distance from each other, all bathed in a silver light, moving south to north at a height of 4 miles. Dobre hears a noise like the rustle of a flight of birds; unlike his colleagues, he thinks the lights are on a single object the size of a football stadium. Col. Dan Aloanei is flying a MiG-29 and sees them as a V-formation of neon lights that disappear to the northeast. The next day, all the witnesses are required to submit written reports.

If this Phobos Mystery Object is at the same distance as the moonlet itself, it would be roughly 1.2 miles wide and 15 miles long. Its surface brightness is the same as Phobos.

Its sides are parallel and both of the ends are rounded. The end toward Phobos narrows slightly; the other end has a short protrusion. This is the last image taken by the probe. On March 27 it fails to reestablish communications with Earth due to an onboard computer malfunction and goes into a spin.

May 2 — Pilot Manoel Luiz Christóvão, flying a small plane about 6 miles west of Arapongas, Paraná, Brazil, sees a huge circular light in the sky as he is preparing to land. Another plane flying nearby cannot see the light. Christovào continues to land, but the light positions itself in front of the plane, forcing him to make a sudden maneuver. The object moves in front of him again, forcing him to maneuver again. The pilot decides to head directly toward the light, after which the UFO accelerates abruptly and disappears.

He says the S-4 facility is adjacent to Papoose Lake, which is located south of the main Area 51 facility at Groom Lake. He claims the site consists of concealed aircraft hangars built into a mountainside. Lazar says that his job was to help with reverse engineering the antigravity propulsion system of one of nine flying saucers, which he alleges are extraterrestrial in origin. Lazar claims one of the flying saucers, the one he terms the “sport model,” is manufactured out of a metallic substance similar in appearance and touch to stainless steel.

He claims there have been at least 16 downed alien craft, 65 bodies, and one live alien retrieved between 1947 and 1952, with at least 10 more crash/retrievals during the Eisenhower years. Cooper says aliens from a dying planet orbiting Betelgeuse landed at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, in 1954 and reached an agreement with the government. A second meeting took place with President [Eisenhower](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170037036&usg=AOvVaw3y_NucHikvUMnidi7fDNWJ) at Edwards AFB, California, and signed a formal treaty with an alien ambassador, His Omnipotent Highness Krill. But, he claims, the aliens broke the treaty, abducting humans, conspiring with the Soviets, and manipulating society through secret organizations. Cooper also claims that Eisenhower had created a scientific advisory group in 1960 called the Jason Group to “discover the truth of the alien question.” Much more spurious and outlandish tales develop.

(1) There are too many close encounters to explain them as a physical survey of the earth. (2) The humanoid body structure is unlikely to have originated elsewhere and is not biologically adapted to space travel. (3) The behavior of alien abductors contradicts the idea that advanced aliens are conducting genetic or scientific experiments. (4) UFOs have been recorded throughout human history. (5) The apparent ability of UFOs to manipulate space and time suggests different and richer alternatives to the ETH. Vallée cites the earthlight theory, the control system hypothesis, and travel via wormholes as viable explanations.

He says that by mid-1982 Bennewitz had put together the story that contained all the elements later circulated by [Lear](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.exopaedia.org/Lear%252C%252BJohn&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170045629&usg=AOvVaw3zNjQod8lYZT6Jr_zrBhBw) and [Cooper](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_William_Cooper&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170046160&usg=AOvVaw2SJ-JnTq6UwcbsKwKs5R27)[.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_William_Cooper&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170046522&usg=AOvVaw2S6BgGR9_96GREhJXJ6-3T) Moore decided to go along with the disinformation game in order to keep in good graces with people who knew something about UFOs and national security. He withheld and blacked out certain portions of UFO-related government documents. He says he stopped cooperating in 1984 because he realized the documents he was receiving from AFOSI were faked, much of the scenario similar to the alien-contact mythos later spun by Lear and Cooper. All of it originated in the disinformation directed at Paul Bennewitz. He gives the names of others who “were the subject of intelligence community interest between 1980 and 1984”: [Leonard H.

July 4 — Twilight. Two women are walking with a 6-year-old girl along the Dnieper River in a park near Kyiv, Ukraine, when they see a “boat” with three beings on board. The entities have absolutely identical faces—extremely pale, long blond hair, large eyes, and collarless silver shirts that look like nightgowns. They tell the women they are from another planet and want to show them their spaceship. The women walk with them but experience odd physical sensations and beg to be let go. They see a ship behind some trees, and the little girl gets frightened. The beings relent and board the craft by a ladder that then retracts. The door closes silently, and the craft departs. (V.

July 4 — Night. Members of the Iskuskovs family are on vacation in the Podgortsy section of southern Kyiv, Ukraine.

They watch silver-suited beings emerge from a landed UFO. (V. D. Musinsky, “Letter: Soviet Ufology,” IUR 15, no. 1 (Jan./Feb. 1990): 21)

July 6 — 7:00 p.m. Yasuhiko Hamazaki takes an 8mm videotape recording of a brightly luminous object that passes nearly overhead in Hakui, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. At one point he uses a zoom lens to get a clearer image. The object has a central ring like the planet Saturn, except that it is squarish and dome-shaped. About one minute of the video captures the object descending rapidly at a shallow angle, then suddenly changing direction and rising at a steep angle at very high speed.

July 26 — 2:40 p.m. R. H. Stepanian, air traffic controller at Sochi International Airport, Krasnodar Krai, Russia, receives information from a Tupolev Tu-154 airliner crew flying from Simferopol, Crimea, that they have seen UFOs from a distance of 20–30 miles. According to the pilots, first one, then two “strange objects” pace them on their left.

One is almost exactly square, while the other is the shape of an elongated rhombus. At the time of the radio transmission, the two objects are swiftly moving away and beginning to separate. Apparently two other flights report multiple UFOs to the airport.

July 28–29 — 11:20 p.m. A domed disc-shaped object is seen over the rocket weapons depot at Kapustin Yar, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia. The object is flashing an intensely bright light from its underside. It hovers above the site at a height of 65 feet. Roughly 13–17 feet in diameter, its hull is illuminated with a dim green, phosphorus-like color. It circles two or three times and moves toward a railway station, still flashing its light, then returns to the weapons depot at a height of 200–230 feet. Soviet soldiers Levin and Klimenko say the object performed acrobatic maneuvers, at one point dividing into three shining points and taking the shape of a triangle. A fighter jet is scrambled, but the object evades it. Two other objects appear at low altitudes of 980–1,300 feet. The last one to appear, a cigar-shaped object, gives off flashes of red light at constant intervals, then lights of all colors. At around 1:30 a.m., it flies to the southwest and disappears.

August — Day. A man is walking his dog in a nature preserve between Wolverhampton and Dudley, England, when he sees a tennis-ball-sized “soap bubble” that has a white, feathery mass inside floating slowly about 12 feet above the ground. It floats into a field where there are several horses, which do not seem concerned about it. Suddenly the object changes direction and moves into a strong wind, coming straight toward him. In moments it is just inches away from him, seemingly surveying him. At close quarters he could see that the object has an oily look. At the instant he thinks about popping the bubble, it speeds off to the east, covering about 30 feet in one second, and disappears.

September 13 — A woman is returning home from the grocery store in Protvino, Moscow Oblast, Russia, when two tall women in tight, silvery suits jump out from behind some boulders and paralyze her. The women have light blonde hair, gray-green skin, and hats with antennae. They take her to a small, disc-shaped craft by the side of the road and invite their captive for a ride, which they insist will not last long. She hesitantly accepts. Inside are three chairs, one of them occupied by a man. The woman offers them some of the bread she has just purchased, but the

women decline, offering her some of their own bread. Without thinking, she reflexively pops a piece into her mouth and swallows. She later describes the taste as a lightly sweet rye bread. The craft ascends and flies over Protvino before dropping the woman off at her apartment. The space people tell her they will meet again.

September 16 — Night. A female employee at a meat packing plant in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, steps outside for a quick break when a beam of light strikes her from above. Looking up, she sees a hovering disc-shaped craft about 130–260 feet in diameter. She feels no fear and has a euphoric feeling as she begins rising up into the air toward the object. She also hears a voice extolling her to “fly with them.” Other workers come to the scene and begin yelling and running toward the woman. The beam disappears, and the UFO flies away. (Jacques Vallée, UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union: A Cosmic Samizdat, Ballantine, 1992, [p. 36](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/ufochroniclesofs00vall/page/36/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170074700&usg=AOvVaw1_SyKdNcrgIdrl8tgcTb32))

September 27 — 6:30 p.m. Several children playing at a park in Voronezh, Russia, see a pinkish aerial glow approaching them. As it passes overhead, they see that it is a deep red, ball-shaped object. The object flies around in circles for a few minutes and then leaves. When it returns, it hovers briefly, and then descends close to the ground. A hatch opens and a heavy-set figure emerges. The being moves very slowly and looks around. It has a small head resembling that of a doorknob, set in between the shoulders. It has three luminous eyes, the middle one moving around like “radar.” On its chest is a shield-like object. The being then closes the hatch and the object lands gently on four legs. The hatch opens again and three huge humanoids with small knob-like heads step out. They wear silvery coveralls and bronze-colored boots. A strange robot-like creature accompanies the giants. All four walk around the object several times. A beam of light comes out of the chest of one of the beings and strikes the ground, creating several luminous triangles that later fade away. At one point the craft and beings become briefly invisible but then reappear. One of the boys screams in fear. Then one of the beings looks at the boy and points a tube at him. A luminous beam comes from the tube and hits the boy, which makes him disappear. The boy later reappears after the beings and the objects have gone. Subsequent information reveals that on the craft’s hull and on the landing prop of another craft is the letter or symbol “zhe,” reported as similar to the “Ummo” insignia reported in Western Europe in the 1970s. In a work published by Socialist Industry slightly after the incident, a self-proclaimed UFO specialist asserts the marks left by the supposed landing were simply scorch marks from a burnt hay-bale.

Although UFOs are observed on the southern coast of Long Island, the crash/retrieval seems to be an exaggerated fantasy. Ford is convinced the nearby Brookhaven National Laboratory is part of a UFO coverup and is developing ET-related weaponry.

October — Night. Hundreds of residents of Omsk, southwestern Siberia, Russia, report seeing a UFO. Major V. Loginov sees an object about 1.5 the size of the full moon passing overhead at an altitude of several kilometers. It projects

four bright lights, some downward, others parallel to the horizon. Loginov watches it for 5 minutes hovering above the civil airport before descending. The lights turn off, and a whirling plume trail appears around the sphere. Pilots taking off from the airport can see the object, but it is not visible on radar screens.

October 9 — 2:50 p.m. A couple and their child are getting into their car at a wildlife sanctuary in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

They see a white “boomerang-shaped” object hanging silently and motionless in the east over the city. The mother puts the child in the back seat for safety. The man continues to watch as the object tilts and moves, revealing a bulge on its underside. It moves away, and the object goes home.

October 11 — A 16-year-old girl in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria, Russia, sees a “net” fall from the sky, apparently surrounding her, in the center of which is a bright point. She tries to push it away but gets a shock. She screams, but her voice sounds distorted. Her family rushes out of the house and sees a flying disc hovering less than 50 feet away. It soon vanishes. The girl remains paralyzed a while, the tips of her fingers burned and enlarged, and she is taken to a hospital.

October 11 — 7:30 p.m. Brad Schmidt, 13, Todd Weinheimer, 13, Paul Goddard, 12, Kevin Still, and one other boy are skateboarding outside the town pool in Centennial Park, Langenburg, Saskatchewan, when they see an object with multicolored lights approaching them from the east. They wave their skateboards at it, and the lights hover silently 400 feet away at 100–200 feet in the air. They duck down in the tall grass. The object moves away over nearby Parkside School, pauses for a moment, then takes off to the west. The boys alert two teachers in the school, Bob Markham and Mark MacMurchy, and they go out to all watch the object for another 10–15 minutes. One of the teachers says the object has a bright flashing light on top and a red light on the bottom. It is more than half a mile away and only 650 feet in the air. The top light flashes every 15–20 seconds. Soon it moves away to the west.

November 4 — 5:30 p.m. A couple and their two children are sitting in front of a large living room window in Hall Beach, Nunavut, watching television. The family dog begins barking, and soon the man’s attention is drawn to a strange object in the sky. The family watches the UFO, which looks like an upside-down cup and saucer. The bottom portion has a red light in the center, and three windows emitting white light are across the middle. After only a couple of seconds, the object departs, seemingly straight up, and disappears. A local employee of the Department of Public Works also sees the object.

November 18 — Early evening. A large, black, boomerang-shaped object glides over downtown Lancaster, California. Low-intensity lights, similar to stars, outline its frame. Witness Robert Puskas estimates its size as 800–900 feet wide. Off its left tip he sees a silvery metallic disc about 30–40 feet in diameter, reflecting the streetlights. (MUFON UFO Journal, November 1990)

November 20 — 5:30 a.m. A couple in the rural town of Marieville, Quebec, wakes up to the sight of a strange blue light shining through the curtains. They hear a noise like an electric generator and feel a vibration. But looking outside they can see nothing. About 900 feet down the road, a neighbor is also awakened by the bright light and observes four blue objects over the other couple’s house. He also feels a vibration and describes the lights as intermittent, blinking out and reappearing in a different spot. At one point, the streetlights along Route 112 weaken when one of the objects gets too close. He thinks the lights are about 30 feet off the ground. Two other witnesses also see the lights interact with power lines. One reports that her power goes out for 10 minutes. On November 22, a strange pattern is discovered about 150 feet from the first couple’s residence—a perfectly round circle, 65 feet in diameter, of flattened (not burned) grass. The RCMP visits the circle on November 23 and 28, noting a striking difference in color of the flattened grass within the circle and the straight grass outside it.

November 22 — The USAF SR-71 Blackbird program is officially terminated. The odd thing is that there is no dissension in the military about this.

November 29 — 5:15 p.m. While patrolling on the road between Eupen, Belgium, and the German border, two federal policemen, Heinrich Nicoll and Hubert von Montigny, see an intense light in a nearby field. Above the field is a triangular object with three spotlights shining down and a red flashing light in the center. Without making a

sound, it moves slowly toward the German border for 2 minutes and then suddenly turns back toward Eupen. Nicoll and von Montigny follow it.

November 29 — 5:24 p.m. About 250 witnesses, in 143 separate observations, watch the same or similar triangular or delta-winged craft maneuvering overhead at Eupen, Belgium. Two police officers in a patrol car are illuminated by a brilliant light beam from a dark triangular object hovering at 600–900 feet and making a faint humming noise. The light is so dazzling that “we could read a newspaper under it.” The UFO moves slowly away to the southwest, where it hovers near the Lac de la Gileppe dam for 45 minutes. Policemen Heinrich Nicoll and Hubert von Montigny watch it repeatedly emit two red beams with a red ball at the spearhead of both beams; the beams soon disappear, leaving the red balls, which return to the object. Then around 7:23 p.m., it moves further to the southwest and is seen over Spa for 30 minutes before it disappears.

November 29 — 6:45 p.m. A man is driving alone in his car on the Rue Mathieu de Lexhy at the intersection with the Rue Hector Denis near Grâce-Berleur, Belgium, when he sees to his left an immense stationary object at about 325 feet altitude and 1,600 feet away. He slows down, lowers his window, and hears a soft sound like an electric motor. The object is larger than a Boeing 707. It has flashing red, green, and white lights and a light beam directed toward the ground. He drives away while the UFO is still visible.

November 29 — 7:20 p.m. Two federal policemen, Dieter Plummans and Peter Nicoll, see a triangular UFO near a monastery \[Kloster Garnstock?\] north of Eupen, Belgium. The object has three very strong spotlights and a flashing red central light. It is at an altitude of about 250 feet and about 300 feet away. It is immobile and silent, but it suddenly emits a hissing sound and its lights fade a bit. Simultaneously, a red ball comes out of the center and heads straight downward, but soon veers horizontal and disappears behind some trees.

November 30 — 3:15 a.m. New York City resident Linda Napolitano (pseudonym “Linda Cortile”) is allegedly abducted by aliens from her 12th-story apartment on the lower east side of Manhattan. Five aliens come into her bedroom while she is still awake. They paralyze her and move her into the living room. Linda and three of the five aliens are floated out through her living room window, directly through the window, to a large hovering UFO. Three independent witnesses to the abduction are two security intelligence agents (“Richard” and “Dan”), who see the UFO and abductees from a car near the Brooklyn Bridge, and a VIP political dignitary later identified as UN Secretary General [Javier Pérez de Cuéllar](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_P%25C3%25A9rez_de_Cu%25C3%25A9llar&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170105020&usg=AOvVaw2MaToN0X0cZ3InJFKJLG5m), who does not confirm any involvement.

December 1 — Weather forecaster Francesco Valenzano and his young daughter are walking in the Square Nicolaï in Ans, Liège, Belgium, when they see a large, slow-moving craft approaching at low altitude. The object silently makes a tour of the square; when it passes over their heads, they notice it has a delta shape with three lights in a triangular position and a red rotating light in the middle and positioned lower than the belly of the object.

December 11 — 6:45 p.m. Lt. Col. André Amond of the Belgian Army and his wife spot a strange aerial object while they are driving on the deserted Rue de Sart Ernage between Ernage and Gembloux, Belgium. It looks like a series of 3–4 panels of light traveling north to south at an altitude of 650–980 feet. Beneath the series of panels, and close to the center, is a rotating red lamp. Amond stops where the road dead ends and watches the UFO pass for 2–4 minutes. Then the object abruptly changes course and silently heads in his direction. Only an enormous spot of white light is visible now, “much bigger than the spotlight of a big air carrier.” They both are frightened, so Amond starts the car again. The big light disappears, and three smaller white spotlights become visible, which form a more or less equilateral triangle. The rotating red light is still there, now seen in profile. The object then performs a turn of 180° to the left. The distance between the white luminous points is estimated at approximately 33 feet. They cannot distinguish any solid object around this triangle of three lights. The maneuver is majestic and slow. Next, the luminous points disappear. Only the red rotating light is still visible, and it takes off in a south- southwesterly direction. The duration of the sighting is about 5–8 minutes.

December 12 — 2:15 a.m. A man in Jupille-sur-Meuse, Belgium, wakes up to a dull throbbing noise coming from outside. He sees an enormous oval object seemingly jammed between two fir trees. On its circumference, small lights are changing color from blue to red and back. The object is metallic, with an oar or paddle at its rear. In the front is a window or cockpit. On the front part is a logo consisting of several ellipses crossing themselves. After a few minutes, the object rises slightly, the sound it emits changing slightly. It moves toward a neighbor’s meadow, shining down three beams of lights. Some moments later, it emits an intense and well-defined shaft of light into the sky. The witness goes back to bed. The next morning, he reports his sighting to the Gendarmérie, which investigates and finds a gigantic circular trace in the meadow. At the center, the grass has been cut off, but the cuttings are nowhere to be seen, and the grass within the circle is yellow.

December 24 or 25 — 3:00 p.m. Pilot Vladimir Kuzmin sees a dark gray, cigar-shaped object hovering southwest of Chelyabinsk, Russia, while he is flying a two-seat Aero L-29 Delfin. He estimates its altitude at 4.6 miles. The sighting lasts more than 8 minutes with the object in direct view for over 4 minutes. Within hours, Kuzmin experiences a strange, crustlike skin rash on the exposed portion of his face that lasts for more than 11 days.

1990

1990 —The NORAD Unknown Track Reporting database includes 7,000 incidents since 1971, averaging about 350 a year, representing objects still unidentified after jet interception, but before ATC analysis and NORAD/FTC intelligence whittles down the numbers further to about 10%.

Early January — 10:30 a.m. Two women are driving southwest near Thimister-Clermont, Belgium, when they see a bizarre object on their right, moving at an altitude of 980–1,300 feet. Dark and massive, it resembles an iron seen from underneath. After a few seconds, it disappears behind a farmhouse.

January 20 — 1:15–1:20 a.m. A silvery dome-shaped object with two rows of lights flies just ahead of a car for two to three miles on Highway 446 at Boyle, Mississippi. The engine and lights fail until the object departs. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 16)

January 22 — 10:00 a.m. UFOs approach the Santa Cruz Air Force Base, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Air traffic controllers spot them on their radars but cannot identify them because they do not make movements like an airplane or helicopter. Interceptors approach, but the objects move away and disappear. They return about 40 minutes after the interceptors land. Two other fighters are assigned to chase the objects, which are at an altitude of 4,800 feet. The case is investigated by an internal commission of the Brazilian Air Force, which can find no explanation. (Clark III 205–206; Brazil 553)

February 21 — 9:07 p.m. A woman, her mother, and son are driving through Koblenz-Karthause, Germany, when they notice two lights beaming down at them at a 45° angle. The woman pulls to the side of the road at an angle to watch. The object bearing the lights stops almost directly overhead. She sees a large triangular object, stationary and noiseless, at rooftop height. The sides of the triangle measure about 65 feet. Three milky, yellowish-white lights are at each of the corners. In the center is a larger, primarily gray-blue light, although its colors change as something rotates on the UFO. The object itself has a metallic appearance. It has some structures that look like riveted plates. The object remains for 2–3 minutes then departs suddenly to the southwest behind the roofs of nearby houses. The woman succeeds in locating two other witnesses at nearly the same time. (Auguste Meessen, “The Belgian Sightings,” IUR 16, no. 3 (May/June 1991): 10–11)

March — Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine breaks the news that the term “Aurora” has inadvertently been included in the 1985 US budget, as an allocation of $455 million for “black aircraft production” in FY 1987.

According to Aviation Week, Project Aurora refers to a group of exotic aircraft and not to one particular airframe. Funding of the project allegedly reaches $2.3 billion in fiscal 1987, according to a 1986 procurement document obtained by Aviation Week.

March — A classified US Department of Defense document, Joint Staff Information Report #5049, “Belgium and the UFO Issue,” states that “Numerous UFO sightings have been made in Belgium since Nov 89. The credibility of some individuals making the reports is good… Investigation by BAF \[Belgian Air Force\] continues.” It notes that Belgian General Wilfried De Brouwer asked whether the objects were American B-2 or F-117 military aircraft, stating that he made the inquiry despite knowing that “the alleged observations did not correspond in any way to the observable characteristics of either US aircraft.” The US Air Force does confirm to the Belgian Air Force and Ministry of Defense that no US stealth aircraft were operating in the Ardennes area at the time.” (Nick Redfern, “[Belgium and the UFO Issue,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2016/02/belgium-and-the-ufo-issue/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170141839&usg=AOvVaw3tDEgn5k3d5gMsyOQRPRjb)” Mysterious Universe, February 11, 2016)

Nicknamed “Misty,” little is known about it other than it has visual and radar stealth characteristics, making it difficult to detect. The satellite is seen and tracked later in 1990 and in the mid-1990s by amateur observers.

March 12 — Night. Large, shining discs appear in the sky along the Yaroslavskoye Shosse outside Moscow, Russia. Their place is taken by three groups of objects, some like pineapples (with platelets) but about 18 feet long.

March 21 — 8:00 p.m.–12:00 midnight. UFOs are seen over a wide area of Russia encompassing Novoselye, Sergiyev Posad, Yakovlevo, Dubki, Kablukovo, Fryazino, Khabarovsk, and Kirzhach. Radar stations and aircraft are put on alert. At 9:38 p.m., a UFO is seen at 6,500 feet altitude over Pereslavl-Zalessky, Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia. Lt. Col.

A. A. Semenchenko is sent up in an interceptor to find it. At 10:05 p.m., he sees the object ahead and to the right. He tracks it on the in-flight radar as it flashes two white lights and changes speed and altitude. It does not respond to a radio challenge to identify itself. The pilot turns steeply and flies 1,600–1,900 feet above the UFO, but he can see only a vague shape. Between 8:00 p.m. and midnight, UFOs are also seen over a wide area. Witnesses in Khabarovsk watch bright red spheres flying in complete silence and darting above the icebound Amur River, and a black cigar-shaped object 160 feet long with a ruby-red exhaust is seen traveling low above the ground. Radars do not register it.

Throughout this time, in reports after the event, some people claim that the phenomenon is visible from the ground, describing the whole formation as maintaining relative positions while moving slowly across the sky. Over the next hour, the two scrambled F-16s attempt 9 separate interceptions. On three occasions, they manage to obtain a radar lock for a few seconds, but these are later shown to be radar-locks on each other. The pilots never see any of the claimed visual sightings or the claimed maneuvers, and they never get a lock on any objects apart from the other F-16. Investigator Wim van Utrecht suspects that the lights in the sky that triggered these scrambles were misperceptions of bright stars and planets. The other contacts are all the result of a well-known atmospheric interference called Bragg scattering, in which an aircraft’s own radars interfere with each other. After 12:30 a.m., radar contact becomes much more sporadic and the final confirmed lock takes place at 12:40 a.m. Following several further unconfirmed contacts, the F-16s eventually return to base shortly after 1:00 a.m. Members of the Wavre gendarmerie sent to confirm the original report describe four lights as arranged in a square formation, all making short jerky movements, before gradually losing their luminosity and disappearing in four separate directions at around 1:30 a.m. They also hear a low engine noise and that it seems to have a stick coming out one end with a turbine on it, which many claim shows it was a helicopter.

Ferryn estimates its altitude is only 1,000 feet with a diameter six times that of the full moon. As a control, he photographs an ordinary airplane several minutes later in the same spot, using all the same camera settings. The spotlights on the UFO, which seemed very bright to the observers, are barely discernible on the photos. The triangular shape, clearly visible to the naked eye, is also lost on the film. At the same time, the airplane lights come out brighter than those on the UFO, appearing just the way it looked from the ground, even though the UFO was much closer to the observers than the airplane.

Early April — Many observers, including a journalist with Sovetskaya Estoniya, see UFOs hovering above power lines along the Tallinn Highway, Estonia, on several occasions. Maj. V. Stroynetskiy and several hundred other witnesses repeatedly observe UFOs over the Yaroslavl Highway in Russia, many of which look like large “triangular milk cartons.” The objects are flying at altitudes of 1,600–2,600 feet. At times, the entire body of an object “scintillates,” while at other times it becomes iridescent with “lights of various colors.” The objects fly at great speeds, make sudden stops in mid-air, and suddenly break off in lateral directions from the line of flight, “at which time they emitted rays.” (Central Intelligence Agency, “[USSR: UFO Sightings No. 2—General Maltsev](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rhun.co.nz/files/cia/cia1/44_cia_ciaall2.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170161272&usg=AOvVaw17W9ecZbvllefm1GLp8V-s) [Comments,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rhun.co.nz/files/cia/cia1/44_cia_ciaall2.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170161859&usg=AOvVaw3lkpB9W4_VYas9LDOHUHpn)” Foreign Broadcast Information Service PROD Group, May 24, 1990)

April 4 — Patrick Maréchal, a young worker at Petit-Rechain, Belgium, takes a photo of a delta-shaped object on which three lights are visible at each corner. Maréchal admits the photo is a hoax in an interview for RTL on July 26, 2011. He and some friends take a sheet of Styrofoam, cut it into a triangle, paint it black, embed a flashlight in each corner, then hang it from a string.

April 5 — 8:15 p.m. A motorist driving near the shore at Gulf Breeze, Florida, sees what looks like a jet fighter about to crash. Two military jets approach from the north, and the original object immediately shoots laterally southward, halting 1–2 miles away. The man gets out of his car to watch. The object appears to be a white disc with red and green lights spaced evenly around the side and an unlit dome on top. Slowly, it begins to rise. He calls a friend and the sheriff’s office. Two deputies arrive on the scene, and for the next 2 hours all three witnesses watch a bright light continue to ascend slowly. (MUFON UFO Journal, May 1990)

April 10 — A couple driving north on the Pensacola Bay Bridge in Florida see an object that looks like a long isosceles triangle with a centered red light on the bottom and pairs of white lights at the three apexes.

He sees, in a field about 325 feet away from him, a pyramidal or conical illuminated object topped by a “bright white mushroom cone” floating about 1 foot off the ground. He approaches to about 165 feet and watches the object change color from white to orange as its upper part rises. He calls his wife to watch the UFO too. She sees two small antennas on top. They leave to get their son, but when they return the object is gone. The next day, he finds four circular holes about 3 feet in diameter with a thin layer of yellowish powder sprayed on the grass.

Summer — The crew of a Russia ship harbored in the Anadyr’ River off Ust-Belaya, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia, sees a perfectly circular opening in the cumulus clouds above the village. Groups of objects enter the circle and fly away. Watch officer Aleksandr Polorotov begins taking photos of them until his camera malfunctions. When the film is developed, a luminous cigar-shaped object can be seen on some of the photos, but the open circle of sky is not on any of them. Some crew members experience severe headaches after the episode. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, pp. 109–110)

July 6 — Day. Anna Dmitrievna Yerygina is herding goats on a lonesome road near Zvarykino, Belgorod Oblast, Russia, when a woman appears, seemingly out of thin air. Dressed in a light-gray, loose-fitting outfit with a hood, she seems somewhat tall and lean. The woman greets her and asks whether goats’ milk is tasty. Yerygina says it is, but she prefers cows’ milk. The woman then abruptly invites her on a brief excursion that will last no longer than three hours, touching her on the shoulder and saying, “Do not be afraid.” She takes Yerygina to a large oval craft in a nearby field, A man awaits them and helps them aboard. Yerygina sits in the dimly lit interior, then suddenly finds herself in another room with others dressed in the same gray coveralls. She feels as if she has been transported to another world. The entities radiate spiritual warmth and hospitality. One of them offers her some tasty bread and a strange liquid. After she finishes the meal, her memory goes blank and she finds herself back in the field with her goats, the strange woman by her side. The woman says goodbye with a smile, promising to meet her again. (Priyma Alexey, [XX vek.

July 9 — 4:00 a.m. A witness is traveling toward Germany and makes a stop east of Brzózka near the bridge over the Bóbr River southwest of Krosno, Poland. He goes for a short walk in the woods when he hears an odd sound and sees a landed object like an overturned bowl. He estimates it is nearly 17 feet across and 80 feet tall, and has a nauseating odor like burned chocolate. About 15 entities resembling mummies are in front of the UFO, poking plants with a prod and hopping about like kangaroos. They are about 4.5 feet tall and wear deep-green uniforms and headgear like welding masks. Their fingers resemble claws. At some point the witness coughs and loses consciousness, waking up an hour later.

July 11 — Belgian Air Force Col. Wilfred De Brouwer gives a public talk on UFOs at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. He states that the March 30–31 sightings were highly unusual, witnessed by gendarmes and others, and necessitated the scrambling of two F-16 fighters. He says the target was detected on radar and conformed to ground visual observations. The objects remain unidentified. (Swords 457)

July 19 — Shortly after 12:00 midnight. The base perimeter at Fort Allen Training Center in Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico, is suddenly illuminated by a powerful white light. An officer orders that all personnel must remain in the barracks or other base facilities and not come out under any circumstances. From a window, the officer can see a brightly lit, circular, metallic object over the base. It has windows around a central rim, with yellowish-white lights revolving in them. On the underside there is a round, turbine-like protrusion with many colored lights around it. A bright beam of pinkish-white light is coming from the underside, as if searching for something—this is the light illuminating the perimeter. Two F/A-18 Hornets (probably scrambled from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station) fly at high speed over the base toward the UFO, which departs at high speed to the west with the jets in pursuit. The officer later tells UFO investigators that Fort Allen personnel have been briefed on UFOs with training films that show crashed UFOs, and it is just the most recent of several briefings since the 1988 Cabo Rojo incident.

July 26 — 10:35 p.m. A married couple is driving south through Grâce-Hollogne, Belgium, when they see a triangular object hovering in the sky. It seems to measure about 39 feet on each side. A belt of white light like a large neon tube runs along two sides. The witnesses see three spotlights beaming down, apparently detached from the object but connected to each other by a support “bracket.” Two flashing lights, one red and one green, are on the underside. The man flashes his car lights twice, and two white lights at the base of the triangle rotate, tilt toward the car, and flash on and off three times. Keeping these lights pointed at the moving car, the object moves with its base forward and positions itself 330 feet away at a height of 200–300 feet, It makes a banking turn and paces the car, moving with the terrain and maintaining a constant height above the sloping ground at the same speed as the car (around 40 mph). When they approach the bridge at Seraing, the object crosses the Meuse River right next to them, ascending silently and moving back toward Grâce-Hollogne.

Early August — Many witnesses in Rostock, Greifswald, and the islands of Rügen and Usedom, Germany, see groups of luminous spheres that accelerate rapidly and abruptly. One witness, Gerald Schwab, watches the lights stand still for 3 minutes before they accelerate rapidly forward.

August 4 — Day. Two hikers near the A9 near Calvine, Perthshire, Scotland, see a diamond-shaped object that appears to be shadowed by an RAF Harrier jet. The object is visible for about 10 minutes. One of the hikers takes color photographs of the incident. Desk officers from DI55 suspect the image might show a US Air Force black project aircraft. The prints are sent to the Glasgow Daily Record newspaper, which forwards them to the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre at RAF Brampton \[now closed\] for scrutiny. The prints subsequently disappear and the MoD claims there is no surviving record of the conclusions reached about the investigation.

However, in October 2020 the Ministry of Defence blocks release of the photos from their scheduled declassification on January 1, 2021, until 2072 without any explanation.

Compared to elements in the landscape, the object appears to be about 98 feet in diameter.

August 24 — 8:35 p.m. Many witnesses in northern Germany see a formation of seven luminous objects over the Baltic Sea. They hover for nearly 30 minutes near Peenemünde (on Usedom) and the Soviet-built nuclear power plant at Lubmin \[shut down soon afterward\]. Five people, including nuclear physicist Ludmilla Ivanova, videotape the event from Greifswald, enabling researchers to triangulate the lights and reconstruct their positions.

They conclude that two groups of luminous spheres hovered nearly motionless for about 30 minutes over the sea. The brighter and closer group forms a circle of 6 spheres. The second group is in the shape of a “Y,” with some spheres performing individual movements.

Some of them move back and forth between the two groups. They are able to move extremely fast, estimated by one witness as “supersonic velocity,” then come to an abrupt stop when reaching the formation.

September 13 — Shortly after 12:00 midnight. A Soviet radar unit in Samara, Russia, tracks an approaching object that apparently causes the equipment to malfunction and go blank. Going outside, the operators see a flying black triangle giving off three bright rays pass directly overhead at no more then 30 feet. It lands nearby and gives off more bursts of energy for 90 minutes. Cpl. S. Dudnik sees it knock out a radar aerial with a light beam. Two sentries, A. Blazhis and A.

October 1 — William Scott writes an article in Aviation Week on 45 sightings of strange aircraft over the southwestern part of the United States. Some of the objects move as slowly as 20 mph, then accelerate to supersonic speed. He concludes that there are at least two types of vehicles beyond the F-117A and B-2. One is a “triangular-shaped, quiet aircraft seen with a flight of F-117A stealth fighters several times since the summer of 1989.” Another is a “high-speed aircraft characterized by a very deep rumbling roar.” A third is a high-altitude, high-speed aircraft, typically observed as a bright, pulsating light, moving much faster than other aircraft, giving no engine noise or sonic boom. He also writes about some “exotic” propulsion systems used in new aircraft and comes very close to stating that these might be antigravity devices.

October 8 — 11:00 a.m. Near Grozny, Chechnya, Russia, an unidentified target appears on ground radar screens.

Commander S. Prokoshin orders an interceptor jet scrambled and pilot Maj. P. Riabishev takes off in pursuit. Something makes him turn his head and he sees to his right rear two large, cigar-shaped objects. The length of the first is about 6,500 feet and the second about 1,300 feet. They are too distant to make out details. When he starts closing on them, both disappear from his field of vision, although ground radar continues to track them.

October 14 — 7:00 p.m. Frau Wengere and her husband are driving from Lostorf to Zürich, Switzerland, when she sees two motionless, bright white lights ahead of them to the left over a range of mountains. Her husband can’t stop because there is no place to pull over. The lights of an approaching aircraft are much smaller and paler. They lose sight of the lights while driving through a village, but they see them again a little higher in the sky to the right of the road. A third light is now visible a bit to the left of the others and they watch it moving closer to the other two lights, which move from a 45° angle to horizontal, keeping the same space between them. The witnesses see two chains of red and green lights joining the two. They drive on and lose sight of the lights. (Auguste Meessen, “The Belgian Sightings,” IUR 16, no. 3 (May/June 1991): 11, 22)

October 21 — 10:05 p.m. Mme. Henquinet and her 15-year-old son Stephane are at the intersection of NB47 and N30 near Rachamps, Belgium, when two lights suddenly drop toward them. But the lights disappear, and as they turn

south on the N30, another light appears behind a hedge bordering the right-hand side of the road, about a dozen yards from the car. The light paces the car at the same speed, slowing down when she does. When they reach the end of the hedge, Mme. Henquinet brakes, and Stephane runs out of the car to look. They see a dark mass, more than 50 feet across, rise up rapidly and silently into the sky. On the lower part of the object is a circle of 7–8 lights. (Patrick Vidal and Michel Rozencwajg, “The Belgian Wave,” IUR 16, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1991): 5)

October 23 — 5:30 a.m. A young woman in Athus, Belgium, wakes up, looks out the window, and sees a light 1,300 feet away on or just above a nearby hill. It consists of two bright headlights directed at her. A smaller blue light is between the two white ones. About 10 minutes later, the lights rise together and move in toward her. The ground below lights up as they pass. A few moments later, the object passes silently over her house. She notices a small red light on its underside. The object then veers left in the direction of Luxembourg and disappears in the distance. (Patrick Vidal and Michel Rozencwajg, “The Belgian Wave,” IUR 16, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1991): 5)

October 23 — 9:25 p.m. Four witnesses, ages 15–17, see an unusual object with very bright lights in Pepinster, Belgium.

The have the impression that the object is taking off at a low altitude about 1,640 feet away. The object moves silently to the northeast, displaying on its lower part three bright white lights in the form of a triangle. At the center of the triangle is a steady red light. The object is shaped like a pyramid with the apex pointing forward. The sighting lasts for about 30 seconds. (Patrick Vidal and Michel Rozencwajg, “The Belgian Wave,” IUR 16, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1991): 5)

Late 1990 — A US Army captain is stationed in the Iraqi desert with his unit during Operation Desert Shield. He is informed by a superior officer that his unit is not to fire on any objects that might appear within a specific, rather restricted, area of the sky. A few nights later, he and his men see several bright objects maneuvering in an extraordinary fashion. “We could not have shot them down if we had tried,” he said. He does not know what they are, although UFOs are primary suspects. (Dolan II 555)

November 3 — The Center for UFO Studies and the Santa Barbara Centre for Humanistic Studies cosponsor a conference on “The UFO Phenomenon in the 1990s” at the Lobero Theater, Santa Barbara, California. (“The UFO Phenomenon in the 1990s,” IUR 15, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1990): 18)

November 5 — Around 6:00 p.m. The pilot and copilot of a British Airways flight from Rome to Gatwick Airport notice a large, silver-shaped object over the North Sea. They bring two crew members into the cockpit to observe it with them. Ground radar sees nothing unusual.

November 5 — 6:00 p.m. Two RAF Tornados over the North Sea encounter two large round objects, each with five blue lights and several white lights around the rim. As the jets close to investigate, one of the UFOs heads for one of the jets, which is forced to take evasive action. The two objects then head north and disappear. Nothing shows up on the jets’ radar. Commercial aircraft also report odd lights over the North Sea. Other high-speed contacts take place along the border of Germany and southern Belgium.

November 5 — 7:00 p.m. French pilot Jean-Gabriel Greslé is standing outside a gym in Gretz-Armainvilliers, Seine-et- Marne, France, with six of his martial arts students when a massive UFO comes into view. His first impression is of a huge crane with many lights. It is about 2,600 feet away at an altitude of 985 feet, moving downward.

Another witness sees it level off and turn. It is projecting two very long, divergent beams of solid light that do not quite touch the ground. The object itself is at least 1,000 feet long and 200–250 feet thick with triangular substructures and many lights. Its rear section is trapezoidal. When it flies above them at no more than 100 mph, t somehow tunes out all surrounding noise as if carrying a “zone of silence.” As Greslé moves around a tree to view it better, it dims and moves away, disappearing into a cloud.

November 7 — 7:15 p.m. An American woman tourist is swimming in the rooftop pool of the International Hilton Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Montreal, Quebec, when she sees a yellowish, oval object hovering directly overhead. Other hotel guests come to view it, as well as the pool lifeguard, who describes it as “a lighted object

with six lights on the perimeter of a large circle with a ray of light emitted from each one.” Municipal police and the RCMP are called and they also view the UFO. Around 9:00 p.m., Marcel Laroche, a journalist from La Presse, takes some photos. The object disappears around 10:10 p.m. due to increasing cloud cover.

While walking back through the woods, she is struck by a beam. Suddenly, she is enveloped by a beam of light that seems to be trying to trap her, but she escapes back to her house. She goes to sleep but is surprised by an intruder in her house, a small figure in a watery-green cosmonaut suit who points to a screen showing the interior of a spaceship. The screen and figure dissolve. The next day, near a bus stop, she sees a strange figure wearing a cape who scowls at her terrifyingly.

February 22 — 12:45 a.m. Three youths driving home from a school reunion at Maids Moreton, Buckingham, England, see a white, cigar-shaped object glowing with numerous lights. It comes closer with an unsteady, jerky motion. They park the car in a field to watch the object, which approaches to within 100 feet. As they try to leave, their engine and headlights fail to respond. A brilliant beam of light envelops the car and they hear a faint humming sound. The light beam and sound disappear suddenly, along with the UFO, and they restart the car and drive away. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 19)

March 6 — 7:58 a.m. A glowing turquoise, cigar-shaped object on an easterly course crosses the path of Air Charter Flight 866 near Kingston, Ontario, stops ahead of the airliner, then proceeds to the north. (UFOEv II, 127)

March 12 — On two occasions an object is seen over the Tihange Nuclear Power Station, Belgium. One witness reports a UFO directly above the red lights on one of the plant’s huge chimneys, where it hovers about 1 minute, beaming one of its lights on the outside structure while another light points directly down one of the chimneys. After its

inspection, it flies straight through the enormous white plume of steam before disappearing in the dark. (Kean, [p.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307716842/page/32/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170237472&usg=AOvVaw3S8UVkhK9ogNVkYMTdPPOF) [32](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307716842/page/32/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170237922&usg=AOvVaw2ZoXkHhTZu1WogRzT2BJ5F))

March 15 — Night. An electronic engineer in Auderghem, Belgium, wakes up and hears a barely audible, high-frequency, whistling tone. He looks outside and sees a large rectangular object at a low altitude with irregular structures on the bottom. He walks upstairs to an upper-level terrace and watches the dark-gray object drift overhead slowly without lights. The whistling noise has stopped. (Kean, [pp. 31–32](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307716842/page/30/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170238536&usg=AOvVaw14r9RkkZVzJ_vk82aL3JPe))

March 18 — Captain Zho, the pilot of a regional airliner over Kunshan, Jiangsu, China, sees a ring-shaped object, two rectangular objects moving back and forth, and a red blaze of light coming from the ring. (UFOEv II, 127)

March 31 — For two nights in a row a couple in Palmarejo, Puerto Rico, hears their two Dobermans howling as if frightened, apparently upset by a peculiar sound like a phonograph record played at the wrong speed. It seems to move around the house, but the sound source cannot be located. Suddenly one of the dogs shrieks, and the husband runs outside to find two strange beings on his patio. They are 3–4 feet tall, gray, with big heads, big black eyes, and a slit for a mouth. The beings flee. The female Doberman is unharmed, but the male is found killed, with empty eye sockets and internal organs missing. (Clark III 139)

April 11 — 7:00–9:00 p.m. A bright, oval-shaped object that changes color from blue to red flies over the Complexo Penitenciário da Papuda, a federal prison in São Sebastião in the Federal District of Brasilia, Brazil. The object is seen by dozens of residents of the Lago Sul area and by more than 20 police officers on duty that night. The first to see the UFO is Lt. Damasceno of the Independent Company of the Military Police. He calls colleagues and is greeted with jokes. But he persuades them to go outside and see the UFO. He says the object is blue when vertical but turns red when it changes position. It appears to be no more than 1,650 feet above the prison. It flies up and down and horizontally without leaving a trace, and the intensity of its lights and colors vary. Carloads of people descend upon Papuda and dozens of people observe the UFO. After 100 minutes, a strange haze begins to engage the UFO, which disappears about 20 minutes later. Damasceno informs Sgt. Petronius, a CINDACTA flight controller, that he is seeing a “strong blue light that changed to red in the direction of three hours to the right.” Petronius is following the object on radar; it seems to be rectangular and moving at about 435 mph. CINDACTA confirms that the object has been tracked over much of the Lago Sul area and close to the Brasilia airport. Later, it identifies the object as a meteorological balloon, deemed an inadequate explanation by witnesses. (Clark III 874– 875; Brazil 336–338)

April 19? — Afternoon. Two militiamen on patrol in Almaty, Kazakhstan, notice a flare at the top of Kok Tobe Mountain.

They watch flames go up and down and then see an array of red light beams. They drive to within 650 feet of a hovering UFO. At that point, a few rays sweep across the car and it stops dead. The object then dims its lights and disappears. The men return to the police station but cannot recall how they did so.

April 21 — 8:00 p.m. Captain Achille Zaghetti and his copilot are flying a McDonnell Douglas MD-80 Alitalia airliner with 57 passengers. They are over the English Channel just off the coast of Romney, Kent, England, and preparing to land at Heathrow Airport, London, when they see a round object or missile, about 10 feet long, approaching from their left. It is less than 100 feet away. The control tower confirms a radar target, which is now behind them. The British Army denies firing any missiles. The British Civil Aviation Authority concludes that “extensive enquiries have failed to provide any indication of what the sighting may have been.” [Nick Redfern](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Redfern&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170241927&usg=AOvVaw2C8b1cofTV2RvBIfLuSFHf) notes that the description of the UFO is consistent with a pilotless drone of the type used for defense practice.

April 26 — A different security camera at Birchwood Shopping Mall near Warrington, Cheshire, England, records a similar object to the one detected in February in a location several hundred yards away. The camera records it for 20 minutes as it moves across the ground, passes by a road sign, climbs onto the roof of the mall, and vanishes in the sky above the M6 motorway. The camera operator lets the object enter the camera’s infrared spot beam, then switches the beam off; the light vanishes, then returns when the beam is turned back on. Investigators suspect that the light was caused by an insect interacting with the beam. (Jenny Randles, “UFOs in Focus,” IUR 18, no. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1993): 16–17)

May 12 — 7:00 p.m. Farmer Moisés Campelo is walking home from his brother’s house in Campo Redondo, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, when a bright light approaches and stops right above his head, spinning slowly. His eyes begin to burn and he feels paralyzed, as if he is being sucked into the light. He remains suspended under the light for about 5 minutes, after which he is dropped to the ground. Campelo starts crawling home, but the light returns and levitates him again. This time he is suspended for 15 minutes before being dropped. He remains traumatized and sustains an eye injury.

May 17 — 1:30 a.m. A nurse in Braine l’Alleud, Belgium, hears an intense hum and looks out her window to see a large triangular object moving slowly overhead. At the front of the triangle, there is a group of lights located symmetrically along the edges. They are grouped toward the front point of the triangle. At least four of these lights are white and flickering quickly, with approximately two lights on the left and on the right flickering each second, but never reproducing the same sequence. She thinks there is also a steady red light. Slightly back from the central axis, she sees a ray of light, inclined on 45°, coming from an opening that is larger than the diameter of the flickering lights. This beam projects to the ground onto the street, and traced a brief series of figure 8s.

Suddenly, after 5 seconds the UFO instantly reappears far away, its blinking lights (but not the ray) still visible.

May 22 — A husband and wife in Nottingham, England, see an array of lights in an “elongated triangle” formation. The same object is seen 15 minutes later by another man in the area.

June 1 — 2:38 p.m. A Britannia Airways Boeing 737 is descending for a landing at 8,000 feet near Heathrow Airport, London, England, when the pilots see an unknown object for 1–2 seconds through the windshield. It disappears rapidly on the left. The missile has a yellow-orange cylindrical body with a “wrinkled” appearance and is about 10 feet long.

June 8 — 6:00 p.m. Pilot Cesar Escobar and Copilot Angel David Farina are flying two passengers to Asunción, Paraguay, in his Cessna 210. While monitoring airport frequencies near Concepción, he overhears a conversation between the control tower and a Líneas Aéreas Paraguayas airliner, with the pilot reporting a brightly lit object approaching on a convergent course. The object is also showing on airport radar. He hears the pilot exclaim as the UFO speeds past. A few minutes later, Escobar sees a bright, blue-white light approaching on his right side. Just then radar control radios to ask if he has traffic on his right, and he replies affirmatively. The object paces his plane for 25 minutes within about 1,300 feet. Its intense light tends to conceal its exact shape, but it appears to be oval. Several times it moves in closer, as if playing a game, and Escobar becomes frightened. When it approaches, his instruments go crazy, including his automatic direction finder, which drifts around aimlessly. As he begins descending into Asunción Airport at 7:22 p.m., the object stops following and hovers. Anibal Gavigan, the air traffic control specialist on duty, is called by radar control and informed that a strange object has followed the Cessna 210 into the airport. He is asked if he can see it, and he can see the luminous object. After the Cessna lands, the airport lights are turned off to better identify the glowing object, which remains motionless over the field. At one point a luminous, yellow ray briefly shoots from the object to the western horizon. When it departs, the object accelerates so rapidly that it disappears after one sweep of the radar scope.

June 16 — 1:30 a.m. A businessman stops by the side of the road to relieve himself near The Bridestones, Cheshire, England, a Neolithic site with standing stones. He sees a golden beam of light above the stones from which emerges a shower of sparks. He returns to the car, but the engine will not start. He begins to run away when a

large, glowing ball heads from the sparks straight toward him. It is so bright that it causes pain in his eyes and he feels rooted to the spot. He blacks out and regains his senses several hundred yards away from his car. He is naked above the waist and his shoes are missing. As he tries to get up, he brushes down his trousers and finds that they are charged with static electricity, causing sparks to jump from his body. After staggering around, he finds his car with the keys still in the ignition. Next to the door are his shoes and shirt, folded on the ground and warm to the touch. The car starts without trouble and he drives away, realizing that it is now 3:05 a.m. (Jenny Randles, “Much More Than Marsh Gas,” Fortean Times 311 (March 2014): 27)

July 11 — 12:21 p.m. While many people in Mexico City, Mexico, are looking to the sky to see the last total solar eclipse of the 20th century, they also notice a bright object hovering in the sky. Videos are recorded as far south as Puebla and Oaxaca. Skeptics claim the object is the planet Venus, but the full eclipse lasts just under 7 minutes, and the object is seen for more than 30 minutes—before, during, and after the event. Guillermo Arragin, a reporter, videotapes the object, and [Jaime Maussan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Maussan&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170263289&usg=AOvVaw1De1UgikFuWefdiCZc88tB), host of the Mexican version of the CBS TV show 60 Minutes, shows the Arragin footage a week later. He asks his viewers to share any sightings they had during the eclipse. Fifteen videotapes are submitted, each taken by a witness in a different location. Maussan enlists the help of the station’s video experts for digital enhancement and enlargement. The videos show solid, metallic-looking objects that reflect light. Maussan looks into balloons, helicopters, and other conventional objects, but comes up empty. The enhancements reveal a “hockey puck” shape, and many of the recorded objects pass in front of clouds.

August 4 — Night. Seven hikers near Lacul Bucura in the Retezat Mountains in west central Romania see a bright red light approaching them from behind. Thinking it might be a lost tourist, they wave their flashlights at it, but it starts zigzagging and increasing its speed. Soon they see other lights of varying colors, shapes, and configurations, all moving in the Valea Rea. Through binoculars they take on the shape of discs with luminous portholes. (Romania 55–57)

The medical examiner rules the death a suicide. His death becomes controversial because his notes suggest he is in Martinsburg to meet a source about a story he calls “the Octopus.” This centers on a sprawling collaboration involving an international cabal, primarily featuring a number of stories familiar to journalists who worked in and around Washington, D.C., in the 1980s—the Inslaw case, about a software manufacturer whose owner accused the Justice Department of stealing its work product; the October Surprise theory that during the Iran hostage crisis, Iran deliberately held back American hostages to help [Ronald Reagan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170267319&usg=AOvVaw25VVaAnEei6WWqmIZiR0UM) win the 1980 presidential election, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Iran–Contra. Casolaro’s family argues that he has been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he told his brother that he frequently received harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him in Martinsburg, it will not be an accident. They also cite his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and state they find it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times. A number of law-enforcement officials also argue that his death deserves further scrutiny, and his notes are passed by his family to ABC News and Time magazine, both of which investigate the case, but find no evidence of murder.

September — 10:45 p.m. Security policeman T/Sgt Anthony W. Keel is working as an alert response team leader at the Ellsworth AFB Oscar Flight area 30 miles west of Opal, South Dakota, when he is dispatched to a missile launch site with multiple alarms. They arrive, clear the site, and reset the alarms. Then he gets another call for a different site with the same alarm pattern, which they then reset. On the way back to the Oscar Launch Control Facility, he gets another call, and the team can see a blue, pulsating light above the site experiencing the alarm. The light moves away as they pull in to secure the site. The light is the size of a small helicopter, semicircular and oblong, and completely silent. (Nukes 468–469)

However, physicist Jack Kasher and Mark Carlotto dispute that explanation, arguing that there are two groups of correlated object motions involving at least a dozen distinct events. Kasher’s analysis reveals that the objects behaved oddly for any type of particle, ice or otherwise, and Carlotto indicates that no thruster was fired in that timeframe.

The uncertainty of the object’s origin and its small size (16–39 feet), combined with rapid variation in the object’s brightness in images obtained during its close passage with Earth in early December 1991, leads to some speculation that 1991 VG might be a spent rocket fuel tank from a space mission, or even an alien artificial object.

March or April — 4:30 a.m. S/Sgt Joseph M. Brown is posted to a security team at the Malmstrom AFB A-3 flight launch facility outside Sluice Box Canyon near Monarch, Montana. Due to an alarm-system malfunction, two men are staked out in a security camper. Just after arriving at the site, Brown sees a bright white light moving erratically through the sky with sudden direction changes and abrupt stops and starts. He watches it for 15–20 minutes, then the light moves closer to the facility. He wakes up his partner, who also watches the light. Another security team at A-10 about 10 miles away can also see the light, which is less than a mile away. They continue to watch the light until about 6:30 a.m. when it shoots up into the sky and stops. With more daylight, they see a black area around the light. (Nukes 457–461, 466–468)

March 3 — 7:50 p.m. Roger Cross is driving on Highway 3A in Concord, New Hampshire, when he hears an unusual drumming sound. He pulls to the side of the road and sees an immense triangular object with pulsating lights flying 400–500 feet above the road. (Marler 217)

March 4–5 — UFO sightings at the Benito Juárez International Airport in Mexico City, Mexico, are confirmed by radar. (Don Berliner, with Marie Galbreath and Antonio Huneeus, UFO Briefing Document: The Best Available Evidence, Dell, 2000, [p. 146](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/ufobriefingdocum0000berl/page/146/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170290467&usg=AOvVaw0IS5RFj2Xz4kfa9B0yu2dQ))

March 5 — 6:30 p.m. Military Policeman Luis Ribeiro and a colleague are hunting in the interior of Ceará state, Brazil, when a domed disc lands nearby. Five 4.5-foot tall humanoids emerge and take Ribeiro inside the craft. The beings communicate with him in Portuguese and tell him they are from “Catandório.” After a 5-hour abduction experience, he is returned to the encounter site. (Brazil 342–344)

March 20 — 3:51 a.m. Patrolman Luis Delgado has just checked the doors on a local business at Haines City, Florida, and turns onto 30th Street. He sees a green light in his rear-view mirror. The light seems to come from a small plane that is about to crash. Just seconds later, the interior of his patrol car is illuminated with a green glow. The object begins to pace his car which is traveling about 40 mph. The object moves from the right side to the front of the vehicle several times. When it has moved to the front for the third time, Delgado slows his car and pulls off the roadway, fearing he might collide with the object. It is a color of green he had never seen before that seems to flow over the surface. It is 15 feet long with a 3-foot-thick center. The object hovers approximately 10 feet off the ground. The engine, lights, and radio on his patrol car cease to function. The object hovers in front of his car and then shines a bright white light into the interior. He exits and begins to walk backwards away from the object. He tries to radio Haines City dispatch on his radio, but it does not function. The air around him has chilled to the point that he can see his breath. The object is hovering about 20 feet northeast of his car, then it speeds away after

approximately 2–3 seconds. It departs the area in a northeasterly direction at 10 feet altitude. Delgado loses sight of the object in only seconds. (UFOEv II 193–194; Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 15)

March 23 — Near Amarillo, Texas, radio hobbyist Steven Douglass photographs a “donuts on a rope” contrail and links this to distinctive sounds. He describes the engine noise as “strange, loud pulsating roar... unique... a deep pulsating rumble that vibrated the house and made the windows shake... similar to rocket engine noise, but deeper, with evenly timed pulses.” In addition to providing the first photographs of the distinctive contrail reported by others, Douglass also reports intercepts of radio transmissions: “Air-to-air communications... were between an AWACS aircraft with the call sign Dragnet 51 from Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and two unknown aircraft using the call signs Darkstar November and Darkstar Mike. Messages consisted of phonetically transmitted alphanumerics. It is not known whether this radio traffic had any association with the ‘pulser’ that had just flown over Amarillo.” (Wikipedia, “[Aurora (aircraft)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(aircraft)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170291736&usg=AOvVaw2mK3FbuWTDzsuKi--QMb4D)”)

March 31 — The Spanish Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen.

May — The Roper Organization releases the results of its “Unusual Personal Experiences” survey of nearly 6,000 US adults devised by [Budd Hopkins](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Hopkins&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170293320&usg=AOvVaw0MBpXAwpc0FVU1OPiq9M9H), [David Jacobs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Jacobs&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170293682&usg=AOvVaw3Ubp9V6MZ9p2-rHCi8Ku43), and [Ron Westrum](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Westrum&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170294079&usg=AOvVaw3gE06FAEtPNm7a4hjMx6ES), and conducted in 1991. Its intent is to determine how widespread the abduction phenomenon might be. Five indicator questions in the survey assess the respondents’ sleep paralysis, dreams of flying, missing time, observations of unusual lights inside a room, and puzzling body scars. The poll, financed by the Bigelow Holding Corporation, suggests that 2% of adult Americans (more than 3.7 million) think they have been abducted by aliens.

May 1 — University of Connecticut psychologist [Kenneth Ring](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Ring&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170295968&usg=AOvVaw0-wYyqfyfKXtmOejf6843_) publishes The Omega Project, in which he argues that ostensible aliens, angels, and otherworldly entities exist in an imaginal realm, a “third kingdom” between reality and fantasy that is accessible through certain altered states of consciousness that undermine ordinary perception and conceptual thinking. Through extensive psychological testing, Ring finds that abductees and those who have near-death experiences are emotionally indistinguishable, with childhoods that typically involve episodes of abuse, trauma, and serious illness. One consequence is the development of a dissociative state as a means of coping with stress; it is the key to experiencing the imaginal realm, a shamanic journey through which symbolic language and images are expressed.

Summer — An unnamed family from Albuquerque is hiking and prospecting about 12 miles from Horse Springs, New Mexico, in the general area of the Plains of San Agustin, when they discover an odd piece of metal. They unsuccessfully try to cut it, burn it, and bend it. The discovery remains unconfirmed. (Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt, “The Hatch Enigma,” IUR 18, no. 2 (March/April 1993): 18)

Summer — Héctor and Jaime Feliciano watch a gigantic silent triangle pass over Salinas, Puerto Rico, heading toward the MATES Camp Santiago military base. It is a metallic dark gray with a rough undersurface containing multiple small colored lights and two large white lights. White beams shine down from the object at three points.

Representative non-US research is also contributed (Brazil, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia). Even skeptics are represented and speak. The conference marks the cracking apart of the public unity of American researchers into at least two major schools of opinion, which deeply disagree to this day. Both continue to believe that the phenomenon is extraterrestrial. Hopkins, Jacobs, and others are present to elaborate what some have come to refer to as the “Dark Marauders” view of abductions. But conference co- organizer and Harvard psychologist John Mack presents an entirely different spin: These experiences are extraterrestrially caused but are positively transformational for the human spirit. Despite the severe disagreements that follow, this gives researchers like Joseph Nyman a foundation stone authority figure around whom to rally.

The so-called pessimist and optimist schools take shape right before the attendees’ eyes. A third major position exists within the US research community, the “probably extraterrestrial but I don’t know the details” viewpoint, represented at the conference in the persons of [Mark Rodeghier](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cufos.org/mark_rodeghier.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170302912&usg=AOvVaw3e1vFpR8pjkRiQNEhdGRGU), [Stuart Appelle](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Appelle&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170303492&usg=AOvVaw303wOxjlL4umvO0T44pp0Y), and [David Gotlib](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.psychiatry.utoronto.ca/faculty/dr-david-gotlib&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170304133&usg=AOvVaw131l65zUm0frxW_lRjCeo3).

July 9 — A 450-foot “Snail” pictogram appears in a wheatfield at Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England. (Chris Talarski, “Going around in Circles,” IUR 17, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1992): 4–9)

July 17–19 — The First International Conference of the Center for Crop Circle Studies is held at King Alfred’s College in Winchester, Hampshire, England. (Chris Talarski, “Going around in Circles,” IUR 17, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1992): 4– 9)

July 23 — 7:30 a.m. An abduction event takes place in a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, involving a rare case of physical evidence. Businessman Peter Khoury had at least one previous abduction experience in 1988 that left him so disturbed that in 1993 he forms a support group to help others like him. The details of his 1992 abduction slowly emerge through extended conversations with Australian ufologist [Bill Chalker](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Chalker&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170308129&usg=AOvVaw388c825rvDsiFMZRD_tHBJ). Khoury wakes up suddenly and finds two nude females seated on his bed, one blonde and the other dark-haired with some Asian features. They are human-like but have some odd physical characteristics: narrow heads and large eyes. Khoury says that what happens next feels weird and dreamlike, “like looking through binoculars, but through the back of my own head.” The blonde reaches out and forces him towards her. Before he knows what he is doing, he takes a small bite out of her and swallows it. There is no blood or screaming. The two beings look at each other in a puzzled way, then vanish. Khoury has a coughing fit and goes to the bathroom where he discovers a blonde hair wrapped around a body part. He turns the hair over to Bill Chalker for mitochondrial DNA analysis in 1999 (by [Horace R. Drew](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wiki.naturalphilosophy.org/index.php?title%3DHorace_R_Drew&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170308609&usg=AOvVaw060M2ZbmEtF8uQqtfZUiq1) of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The results are startling: DNA from the shaft of the hair reveals very rare and unusual Asian signatures common to the isolated Lahu people of China and Thailand, but DNA from the root shows sequences indicating rare Basque/Gaelic and Asian results—suggesting advanced cloning techniques and possible hybrid characteristics.

August — Crop circles appear in wheatfields near Ipswich and Strathclair, Manitoba. (Chris Rutkowski, “‘A Looney a Look’: Crop Circles in Western Manitoba,” IUR 17, no. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1992): 9–12)

August 5 — 1:45 p.m. Pilots of United Airlines Flight 934 are flying at 23,000 feet some 50 miles northeast of George AFB \[now Southern California Logistics Airport\], Victorville, California, when an unusual aircraft comes directly toward them and passes underneath at an estimated distance of 500–1,000 feet. It resembles the forward fuselage of a Lockheed S-71, without wings but with a sort of tail. The size is about 50 feet long and its speed is supersonic.

August 19 — 1:00 a.m. A witness is driving near Tucson, Arizona, when he notices a strange light in the distance. As it approaches from the northeast, it descends rapidly, moves across a field, and hovers. A cone of light emerges from the bottom that completely bathes the area, illuminating the ground. At this point the witness is about 600– 900 feet away and is able to see that it is a solid object that looks like a manta ray with a dull-black matte finish. He pulls over and can hear no sound coming from it. The object moves directly overhead, and the witness gets back in the car and speeds away. He sees the object again as it stops 15 feet above a nearby farmhouse. Again a bright light comes from its base, engulfing the entire house for 20 seconds.

October 15 — 6:00 p.m. Witnesses in Lubbock, Texas, see a gray cigar-shaped object that becomes visible for about 20 minutes after a cloud disappears. It moves close enough to them so that they can see windows on the object. The cloud reappears and the object is no longer visible. (Herbert S.

October 27 — Just before 12:00 midnight. A1C Michael R. Reager and A1C Jason H. Barrier are approaching the operations hanger of the 44th Field Maintenance Missile Squadron at Ellsworth AFB, Rapid City, South Dakota. A group of bright white lights suddenly appears in the air, moving rapidly in rigid formation. Witnesses assume the lights are attached to a large, dark aircraft. It hovers briefly above the hangar at 300–500 feet then moves away. (Nukes 470–472)

November — Night. A man in Brighton, England, calls the RAF to report a brightly lit UFO shaped like a “squashed rugby ball” hovering above his house. Through windows in its side, he can see two men wearing beige uniforms standing in front of machinery. When one of the crew members appears to notice him, the object’s lights go out and the UFO zooms away over the English Channel.

November — After 10:00 p.m. Three Romanian military helicopters are flying at an altitude of 328 feet at a speed of 93 mph on a night exercise near Buzău, Romania. Col. Marcel Smoleanu notices a silent, bright-red sphere about 60 feet in diameter to his left that begius to fly parallel to the helicopters. The other pilots confirm the sighting. After a minute or so, the object accelerates sharply, makes a 90° turn, and cuts across their flight path. The helicopters slow to a hover and the object disappears suddenly. The flight exercise is scrapped and the helicopters return to the military airfield at Buzău. One of the pilots, Lt. Col. Doru Drăgoi, is called into the radar room where operators show him more than 10 unidentified targets on the screen making odd movements northeast of Buzău, including sharp 180° turns near Săpoca. Drăgoi also sees bright objects crossing overhead from east to west at an amazing speed. (Romania 110–113)

December 16 — Night. Werner Noeske observes a large, brightly illuminated disc with a large triangular window in the base over Leipzig, Germany. Additional witnesses come forward, but an investigation reveals that two unrelated incidents contributed to the sightings: a “sky tracker” searchlight common in European discos, and a cargo plane that makes routine flights at the same hour. A photograph confirms the latter interpretation.

1993 — The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility begins construction north of Gakona, Alaska, just west of Wrangell–Saint Elias National Park, funded by the Air Force, Navy, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and DARPA. Its original purpose is to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. As a university- owned facility, HAARP is a high-power, high-frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere. The most prominent instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. The IRI is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the ionosphere. Other instruments, such as a VHF and a UHF radar, a fluxgate magnetometer, a digisonde

(an ionospheric sounding device), and an induction magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.

January 1 — 1:30 a.m. A taxi driver has just dropped off revelers at a remote house in Hethersgill, Cumbria, England. She heads home down a remote track toward the main road when suddenly her CB radio begins to crackle then fades entirely. Moments later her car engine and lights fail, and she coasts to a stop. She gets out, hoping to walk back to the house, when she sees a ball of light low over the road heading towards her. It swoops over her car and shoots into the sky, causing her skin to tingle. The headlights come back on, the car lurches forward, and she hears her sister talking on the CB asking where she has been for the past 30 minutes.

January 14 — 7:00 p.m. Residents of Jerzmanowice, Kraków County, Poland, see a flash of light just before limestone debris falls around them, breaking window panes and plunging through roofs. A local rock formation, Babia Skała, has been shattered by an apparent lightning strike, although some in the village have seen one or two bluish objects colliding with the rock face. Although the blast is seen in Kraków, registered on seismic equipment, and observed by the fight controller in Balice, the Polish Army refuses to disclose any further details.

January or February — Night. T/Sgt John W. Mills III is driving back to Malmstrom AFB near Great Falls, Montana, with another tech sergeant. Near Monarch, Montana, they watch a bright light in the sky for about 5 minutes. Suddenly

it makes a sharp banking maneuver. Thinking it is a helicopter, they drive on toward Belt, Montana, where they encounter a roadblock with cars backed up for miles. The base dispatcher asks if they saw anything on their drive. When they answer yes, he tells them to proceed to the Alpha-01 missile launch facility not far away. They are redirected to Malmstrom, where they find that many “anomalies” have been reported zooming over missile sites that night. The “anomaly” they had seen apparently came down and landed near the highway west of Belt.

Another light reportedly flew in and out of the open doors of the base vehicle barn; at least 4 witnesses say it was the size of a softball and flew at a height of about 10 feet. At least six balls of light maneuver around the flight line of the base at high speed and different altitudes. (Nukes 462–466)

February 1 — 9:00 p.m. A witness is driving in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, when he sees a large, black, triangular UFO hovering above a water tank. The object has 9 lights, including a row of lights on one side. Two police officers had seen bright beams of lights in the vicinity earlier. (Marler 218)

February 4 — 6:35 p.m. Kevin Crump and his grandmother, Betty Barnick, spot an object in the sky near Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, that spits out a blue glowing ball from its tail end, which hangs in the sky over an old school. Crump gets out and sees the UFO almost directly overhead. The moonlight reflects off its black metallic surface. It has the shape of an “oblong triangle” with a light at each point—a red light and a blue light at the front and a white light in the back. The UFO eventually moves away but returns with another bright blue light below it. (Marler 218–219)

March 16 — A couple who are viewing aerial activity from a hill adjacent to Area 51 in Nevada see strange lights that seem to transform themselves into an automotive vehicle. After the encounter, the witnesses sense that 30 minutes are unaccounted for. They undergo hypnosis and recall an abduction by gray-skinned aliens. The man is taken into a craft, while the woman is taken into a white van. Inside the van are two men dressed in black with black baseball caps. They administer intrusive procedures in her eyes, ears, and elsewhere. She remembers seeing electronic instruments and automatic rifles inside the van. (William F.

March 31 — 1:10–1:15 a.m. Dozens of people across Devon, Cornwall, South Wales, Shropshire, and central Ireland see triangular UFOs speeding across the sky. An MoD police patrol sees the lights from RAF Cosford in Shropshire, England. The UFO passes over the base “at great velocity ... at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet.” It looks like two white lights with a faint red glow at the rear, with no engine noise. The RAF police report also contains details on other civilian UFO sightings that they had learned about in the course of making enquiries with other military bases, civil airports, and local police. The police call ahead to alert the meteorological officer at nearby RAF Shawbury that the UFO is coming his way. The officer at Shawbury sees the object moving slowly across the countryside toward the base at a speed of no more than 30–40 mph. He sees the UFO fire a narrow beam of light (like a laser) at the ground and watches the light sweeping backwards and forwards across the field beyond the perimeter fence, as if it is looking for something. He hears and feels the vibrations from an unpleasant low- frequency humming sound coming from the craft. He estimates its size as midway between a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and a Boeing 747. The light beam retracts in an unnatural way, then the object accelerates to the horizon many times faster than a military aircraft.

He says that he used the word “Ummo” because it suggests the Spanish word humo (smoke) and randomly chose Wolf 424 as the home star for the imaginary planet. “I wrote the reports on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and I took advantage of my trips to France, England, Mozambique, etc., or those of friends, to send letters from there.” However, other hoaxers begin copying his style, and after he receives an invitation to an Ummo conference in Cuba, he decides to admit the hoax he had started 25 years earlier.

April 28 — 11:50 p.m. Jefferson County Air Unit police officers Kenny Graham and Kenny Downs are on helicopter patrol over General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky, when Graham sees something like a small fire off to his left. Downs shines his spotlight on the light, which begins to drift back and forth as the spot washes over it. Then it gradually floats up to the helicopter’s altitude at 500 feet, where it hovers for a few seconds before moves away at high speed, making two counterclockwise loops and doubling back to the rear of the helicopter.

Graham pushes his speed up to 100 mph. The object passes them and climbs hundreds of feet into the air before descending again toward the helicopter. Graham tries to close the gap, but it eludes him. As it approaches again on a parallel course, the object releases three fireballs. Fearing a collision, Graham banks away. When his move is complete, the light has vanished. Two officers in their squad cars, Mike Smith and Joe Smolenski, also see the light and the fireballs. Smolenski tries to follow the light for a full minute before it disappears.

It seems to have people in it, but it quickly shoots off to the left and disappears. They continue driving, and about one kilometer ahead they encounter another bright light. Her husband continues driving, and they do not recall anything else until they get home. They agree they saw a UFO but can’t agree on whether they had missing time or saw people. They both can smell vomit and feel stomach pains. Kelly notices a triangular mark below her navel, which is bleeding a bit. Kelly has a strange dream immediately after the encounter, and two subsequent dreams in September, October 23, and January 1994—all involving entities and a “strange physical dimension.” A few weeks later, both of them start remembering that the UFO has landed in an adjacent field and that they get out of the car to look at it. An abduction scenario ensues involving tall black beings. They also recall that there is another car stopped by the road with at least two people in it. By November 17, Phenomena Research Australia has located the couple in the other car and a woman who was with them. They have also undergone an abduction experience and have missing time. These witnesses, unknown to the Cahills, confirm the UFO landing site, and their drawings of the UFOs and entities closely coincide with Kelly’s. The second group also recalls seeing a third car with one male who is gazing fixedly toward the encounter site. Unfortunately, Kelly’s account of the incident is the only one that has come to light.

August 12 — 12:30 a.m. Two friends are watching the Perseid meteor shower in a dark school yard in North Lethbridge, Alberta, when they see a dark, gray-black, triangular object pass quickly and silently overhead for 4–5 seconds. Each point of the triangle has a red light on it. As it disappears to the south, it flips upward at a 45° angle. Another witness in a different location watches a similar object around the same time. Local radar does not show any unusual traffic. (David Thacker, “Flight of the Triangle,” IUR 19, no. 3 (May/June 1994): 4–8, 23)

August 13 — Night. Costin and Mariana Popa are driving with their daughter Diana in a rural area a few miles south of Telega, Romania, when their car engine stops unexpectedly and the headlights go out. Examining the engine, they

are suddenly hit by a “wall of air” and see a fog-like rectangular screen on the right side of the road floating 18 inches above the grass. It is pulsating every 2–3 seconds with a yellowish-white light. They hear no noise and feel no heat. After about 20 minutes the screen begins to move across the road and stops in front of them, having become a narrow band of light 90 feet long and 3 feet wide. Soon it becomes brighter and shoots into the sky and disappears. The car starts normally again. (Romania 58–59)

August 14 — 1:56 a.m. Four UFOs with red and green flashing lights are seen flying at low altitude above Henri Coandă International Airport at Otopeni, Romania. They first turn up on radar, then are seen visually and observed through binoculars. (Romania 75)

September 2 —6:00 a.m. A black-and-white security camera at a private company in West Manchester, England, captures a pulsing ball of white light that appears in the northwest, moving toward the north, for several minutes.

The EP’s committee on industry, external trade, research, and energy, chaired by physicist [Tullio Regge](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Regge&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170365203&usg=AOvVaw3DbvBRFwhOrvdr5PPaSoLy)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Regge&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170365474&usg=AOvVaw39rnkxN_TB-nNuZGmttp6N) holds several meetings on the proposal in consultation with SEPRA’s [Jean-Jacques Velasco](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Velasco&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170365775&usg=AOvVaw0PVer0Fl18KS150WCQF-5M)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Velasco&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170366016&usg=AOvVaw1RhAgsw1pRl90LLEa2c6YY) and approves the motion for a resolution. However, the Parliament does not have the necessary votes to implement and fund the resolution, the agency is never created, and SEPRA has its own funding problems. (George M.

She is disturbed to find that at least 10 people close to her seem to have a pattern of alien intrusions and disturbances. The women describe a variety of alien types: grays, insectoids, humanoids, blue humanoids, and dwarves. Several of the women describe not only hybrid nursery rooms, but also cloning rooms in which living but inert humans are suspended in liquid-filled cylinders. There are accounts of aliens apparently taking human souls and placing them into a box. One alien group appears to harvest “negative emotional energy.” Not all experiences are harmful or exploitative; some women claim to have had miraculous healings by aliens. Still, Turner suggests that this does not make the aliens humanity’s benefactors. If they cared for humans, it could be the way in which a farmer cares for cattle. Four of the women describe being abducted by human military personnel and taken to underground military facilities. Human and alien workers are sometimes described as being there. The abductees remember being questioned by military types who ask “What do you know about the alien agenda? What have they told you? What implants have you received? What procedures have they carried out on you?” A number of medical problems develop, apparently related to the abductions: cancer, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction, and suicide. One thing that perplexes Turner is why military groups would need to interrogate abductees about alien intrusions.

They do, and the radar operator gives a live report, recorded by the police, of the returns he is tracking.

Angela Hind writes, “It was the first time in Harvard’s history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation.” Upon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack’s defense, 10 months into the process), questions arise from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law [Alan Dershowitz](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170389718&usg=AOvVaw1COVQc-6OzF6CiKi67i0A2)) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who is not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct.

The results show that 45% of the abductees manifest PTSD symptoms and 70% manifest dissociative symptomatology. A content analysis of the narratives suggests that sexual abuse could be at the root of some of the stories.

May 21 — 11:00 p.m. A witness in Plauen, Germany, is watching TV when she notices a light outside. She sees a disk with several rings of lights illuminating a tree and causing it to whip around violently. It is about 30 feet in diameter, and its top and bottom halves are rotating in opposite directions. After it hovers silently for a minute, it stops shaking the tree and moves behind a building and shoots away, leaving a hole in the clouds above. Two other witnesses see the disc from a different perspective and feel a strong wind. (Illobrand von Ludwiger, Best UFO Cases: Europe, National Institute for Discovery Science, 1998)

June — The TNS Emnid Institut in Bielefeld, Germany, conducts a one-question survey on UFO beliefs among 1,069 Germans. Although the question is ambiguous, 22% respond yes and 78% no, in both the former West and East Germanies. The belief is much stronger in younger populations. (Mark Rodeghier, “Do Germans Believe in UFOs and Extraterrestrials?” IUR 21, no. 2 (Summer 1996): 25, 30)

June — Day. An object like a balloon suddenly appears in the sky above US Highway 22 and East Kemper Road in Symmes Township, Ohio, outside Cincinnati. It remains perfectly stationary until after dark. One witness takes at least three photos of it. At one point it ascends to a higher altitude. The object is approached and circled three times by local air traffic. (Patrick Gross, “[The Symmes Township Orb, USA, June 1994](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/symmes94.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170393026&usg=AOvVaw0GZtMcQW7mDkiDwUa11Cyi)”)

Early June — A tree farmer named Meng Zhaoguo is at Red Flag logging camp near Wuchang, Heilongjiang, China, with two other workers when they see a strange light in the sky. Thinking it is either a downed satellite or helicopter, Meng goes to retrieve the wreckage. However, at some point he is hit in the forehead by a shining light and knocked unconscious. He wakes up at home some time later, with no recollection of how he got there. A few nights later, he wakes up in his bed to find that a 10-foot-tall female alien with six fingers and braided leg fur is in his room. He and the alien have sex for 40 minutes before it disappears, leaving a 2-inch scar on his thigh. He also claims that on July 17, he levitates through a wall and meets with a group of three-eyed aliens on their ship. He asks to see the female alien again but is rebuffed. The aliens show him images of Mars (or Jupiter), which they claim is their home world, and tell him that “on a distant planet the son of a Chinese peasant will be born in 60 years.” His story is examined by the UFO Enthusiasts Club at Wuhan University throughout 1997. They conclude that while the initial contact may have occurred, the subsequent reported events are almost certainly untrue.

However, other UFO groups in China think that his ongoing story is true. In September 2003, Zhang Jingping and the state-sponsored Chinese UFO Association give Meng a medical exam, a lie detector test, and a hypnotic regression session to prove his claims. The results supposedly confirm his story.

June 24 — 2:40 a.m. Three gendarmes at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, Seine-et-Marne, France, notice a bright set of lights in the sky. They drive closer and find that the source is a stationary object with three yellow-white lights. Its underside is triangular with a central pyramidal spire that points downward. They stop their patrol car, and the object moves slowly toward them until it stops directly above the vehicle. There is no noise, smoke, or odor. As soon as they start the car again, the object moves west at high speed and becomes a speck on the horizon within a second. The total duration is 10 minutes. The police radios stop functioning, and the car becomes hot even though the windows are open.

July 2 — 1:30–1:45 p.m. A resident of Limelette, Belgium, is at home in the Petit-Ry neighborhood when he looks out a window and sees a group of 10 white vertical structures with rounded edges moving back and forth about 180 feet above a vacant lot. They are all about 15–26 feet high and somewhat translucent, moving in an erratic pattern. The dry grass below has risen up into the air, forming a tornado shape and spinning anticlockwise. He watches it for 2–3 minutes, and the phenomenon moves slowly to the north and disappears. Possibly a wind devil.

Strobe lights emerge from the object at both its top and bottom, shining continuous beams of light on the object both while it is hovering and in flight. It disappears behind some buildings to the south. (Marler 175)

September 13 — 5:30 p.m. As Larry Gardea is hunting for bear near Luna Canyon in Mora County, New Mexico, he sees a cow lying dead some 30 feet away. In the place where its rectum should be is a large, cylindrical hole. Ten feet beyond that cow is another one, apparently alive, sitting on its knees. At that moment a dozen cattle stampede in the opposite direction, and Gardea hears a loud humming noise coming from the nearby woods. A third cow is suddenly propelled through the air nearby at near ground level, as if carried by an invisible beam. Gardea fires two shots and the humming stops. (Clark III 138)

September 26 — An aircraft crash at RAF Boscombe Down in Wiltshire, England, appears closely linked to US black missions, according to a report in Air Forces Monthly. Further investigation is hampered by USAF aircraft flooding into the base. Special Air Service personnel arrive in plainclothes and in an Agusta 109 helicopter.

December 29 — 9:45 p.m. A mother and her six children are driving northwest on Zaring Cutoff Road west of Dusty, Washington. To the east she sees three bright yellow lights that appear to be sitting in a snow-covered field. She

stops the car to look and realizes that the lights are attached to triangular objects, each with stubby wings and a bright light on the nose. They move slowly and pass in front of the car to a field on the left. Suddenly they pivot 90° and move parallel with the road toward the southeast, maintaining the same configuration. Each has a window on the bottom that emits a bluish light and a buzzing sound. (Marler 225–226)

1995 — Astronomer [Carl Sagan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170424279&usg=AOvVaw2GrcXdF-gS8Rj3_xPqPSis) publishes The Demon-Haunted World, in which he aims to explain the scientific method to laypeople and encourage them to learn critical and skeptical thinking. He explains methods to help

distinguish between ideas that are considered valid science and those that can be considered pseudoscience. Sagan states that when new ideas are offered for consideration, they should be tested by means of skeptical thinking and should stand up to rigorous questioning. He argues that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small. However, he does think it plausible that Cold War concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about UFOs, and writes that “some UFO reports and analyses, and perhaps voluminous files, have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills ... It’s time for the files to be declassified and made generally available.” He cautions against jumping to conclusions about suppressed UFO data and stresses that there is no strong evidence that aliens are visiting the Earth either in the past or present. He worries that fake news and conspiracy theories will become the reality of the future, predicting: “I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.” (Carl Sagan, [The Demon-Haunted World: Science As a Candle in the Dark](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/demonhauntedworl0000saga&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170425612&usg=AOvVaw2RmiI4DBgmmWMqj87_JMXn)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/demonhauntedworl0000saga&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170426031&usg=AOvVaw0OiUzA0L1suVWNReJ7JYvj) Random House, 1995; Wikipedia, “[The Demon-Haunted World](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170426554&usg=AOvVaw2tUBCpZHp2EEdBZqdBzyKr)”)

January 6 — 6:48 p.m. Capt. Roger Wills and First Officer Mark Stuart are piloting a British Airways Boeing 737 aircraft with 60 passengers when they are buzzed by a bright wedge-shaped object as they are preparing to land at Manchester Airport, England. The object appears only yards in front of the airliner as it flies at 4,000 feet. It is so close that Stuart instinctively reacts by ducking down inside the cockpit. It has small lights, makes no attempt to change course, and makes no discernable sound or turbulence. The object does not appear on radar. Possibly a fireball meteor.

that, in the past, unexplained aeroplane losses have been caused by instinctive maneuvering to avoid a conflicting UFO… The commercial sensibilities of the airlines should now be set aside along with the media’s inability to give serious treatment to the subject.

March 8 — A military radar installation near Luzern, Switzerland, detects a series of anomalous radar targets that, taken together, appear to make up the straight-line trajectory of an unidentified object traveling at a speed near Mach 3. The consistency in velocity and direction of the three track segments strongly suggests that it is a single object traveling about 150 miles in just over 4 minutes, which corresponds to an average velocity of about 2,147 mph. Another track going in the same direction was picked up 70 seconds after the first one dropped off the radar, separated by a few miles. This time the system recorded six consecutive returns, each registering a radial speed component of about 2,088 mph. Again the system dropped the track. A minute later the Luzern radar records hits on yet another object, loses it again, and detects it three more times over 40 seconds before it is dropped for the final time.

April 18 — 9:00 p.m. A woman in Prospect, Chebucto Peninsula, Nova Scotia, sees a large, brilliant, white light hovering in the sky to the northwest. She can see its reflection on the surface of the still water. She calls her husband, who gets binoculars and determines there are two lights side by side. After several minutes or so, his mother on the floor above says she can see the light too. As soon as they switch the deck lights off for a better view, the two lights start moving directly toward their house, and he watches it slowly fly about 100 feet above the house. It seems to be a rectangular object about 200 feet long by 100 feet wide. It disappears behind the tree line. (Don Ledger, “The Flying Triangle Phenomenon,” IUR 27, no. 3 (Fall 2002): 7)

May 5 — 4:15 a.m. A senior master sergeant and an airman are patrolling the perimeter of the Ghedi Air Force Base near Brescia, Italy. Suddenly they notice an unusual yellow light zigzagging and maneuvering in the sky, much bigger than a star and heading toward the northern part of the airfield. After several minutes it increases in size and becomes a round, orange object as big as the full moon, moving at least 186 mph before hovering a while and zooming away. It returns and leaves twice more, the last time descending to 65 feet above their patrol vehicle.

They think this time it will land, but it ascends and zooms away again. They prefer not to report the incident. (2Pinotti 150–151)

May 25 — 10:30 p.m. An America West B-757 airliner is cruising at 39,000 feet near Bovina, Texas. To their right and somewhat below their altitude, Capt. Gene Tollefson and First Officer John J. Waller see a row of bright white lights that sequence on and off from left to right. Waller contacts the Albuquerque FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center while the sighting is in progress and checks with military installations in the area, but no explanation can be found. As the airliner proceeds to the west and the object begins dropping behind, the crew sees it against a background of thunderclouds. When the background clouds pulse with lightning, the UFO appears as a dark, wingless, elongated cigar-like object around the strobing lights. Though they do not know the exact distance, Tollefson and Waller estimate the object to be 300–400 feet long. One of the air traffic controllers at Albuquerque contacts NORAD, which confirms an unidentified radar target in the vicinity.

It glides to the northeast over the mountains near Întorsura Buzăului and disappears. The next day the unit is rounded up and told never to speak about the sighting. (Romania 94–95)

July — USAF Headquarters publishes, through the Government Printing Office, The Roswell Report: Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert, by Col. Richard L. Weaver and Lt. James McAndrew, blaming the Roswell debris on a top-secret Project Mogul balloon array sent aloft to detect signs of Soviet nuclear explosions. The first part of the 1,000+-page document is an introductory summary, supported by 31 attachments, by Weaver that was released in September 1994. The second part is a synopsis of Project Mogul balloon research findings by McAndrew, with additional attachments and appendices. A photo section includes photos of various Air Force personnel and Mogul scientists. The report claims Mogul flight number 4, launched on June 4, 1947, was responsible for the Roswell debris. The attachments and appendices are mostly memos dealing with the Air Force requests of its departments for Roswell records; statements and interviews with persons connected with Project Mogul; and New York University progress reports on the Constant Level Balloon project (a study to determine how balloons and their payloads could be maintained at high altitudes for long periods of time). About 95% of the report is padding. (Robert A. Galganski, “The Roswell Debris: A Quantitative Evaluation of the Project Mogul Hypothesis,” IUR 20, no. 2 (March/April 1995): 3–6, 23–24; Charles B.

July 1 — Dusk. As a Varig Airlines flight is descending about 37 miles from Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, the commander sees a very bright disc-like object spinning in the sky in a curious way. The UFO is about 215 feet in diameter and emits a bright white light. As they approach the landing, the light speeds up and crosses in front of them. (Clark III 201; Brazil 543–544)

July 15 — 2:45 p.m. Two witnesses (an emergency room nurse and her husband) are driving home (probably along State Highway 8, adjacent to the Naugatuck River) after a fishing trip to Harwinton, Connecticut. A shadow crosses the road as they are driving north, and they look up to see a large metallic disc about 500 feet in diameter at an

altitude of about 200 feet, over trees about a half mile away. The object is traveling 65–70 mph and its surface is metallic gray with a band of apparent panes of dark glass and facets on its upper portion. It passes behind trees to the right in about 10–15 seconds. A group of independent witnesses at another location does not observe the object.

July 28 — The US General Accounting Office releases Results of a Search for Records Concerning the 1947 Crash near Roswell, New Mexico, which says that all administrative records from Roswell Army Air Field in New Mexico from March 1945 to December 1949 have been destroyed, as well as outgoing messages from October 1946 to December 1949. This is perhaps not unusual for the time, as record retention and disposition procedures were unclear; however, [Nick Redfern](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Redfern&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170450498&usg=AOvVaw1EL9XdQtkgRPLEzUy7yCrP) suggests the possibility that the records were destroyed or removed to hide evidence of unethical radiation and other experiments on unwilling human subjects.

July 29 — 12:15 a.m. Five witnesses in Low Bradfield, South Yorkshire, England, watch a triangular object, “bigger than a commercial airliner, “ flying flat side forward. A low humming sound is heard. (Marler 143–144)

July 31 — 6:10 p.m. Aereolíneas Argentinas Flight 734, a Boeing 727 with three crew and 102 passengers, is in the landing pattern for San Carlos de Bariloche Airport, Rio Negro, Argentina. Capt. Jorge Polanco suddenly sees a white light bearing down on the aircraft before halting only 300 feet away. The object then makes a turn and flies parallel to the 727. It looks like an inverted flying saucer as large as the airliner, has two green lights at each end and a flashing orange light in the center, and very powerfully illuminated, according to the captain. As Polanco begins to land, the runway and airport lights go out, so he is forced to climb back to 9,800 feet, accompanied by the UFO. Airport chief Maj. Jorge Orviedo reports that the airport’s radio support is cut off, and there is a blackout in many parts of the city. When the ground lights come back on, the UFO shoots away at tremendous speed. The object is also observed by a Gendarmeria Piper PA-31-310 that is flying 1,900 feet above the 727.

August 8 — Two airliners, one from TAM and the other from Rio Sul Serviços Aéreos Regionais, watch a UFO over Macapá, Amapá, Brazil. TAM Cmdr. Marcos Aurélio de Castro reports that he and his copilot see a metallic glow ahead of them to the right. The air traffic center cannot see anything but notes that the Rio Sul flight has reported something similar 5 minutes earlier. Suddenly the silvery object approaches the TAM aircraft. The sighting lasts about 10 minutes. (Clark III 201–203; Brazil 544–545)

August 14 — 11:55 p.m. An enormous, roughly triangular object is seen by three family members near the Brighton Racecourse, Sussex, England. (Marler 144)

August 27 — 9:30 a.m. Tim Edwards shoots a video of a disc-shaped object hovering then darting about the sky over Salida, Colorado. A series of ripples or moving lights are seen to rotate from left to right on the object, which stays just above the sun while Edwards, his daughter, and four construction workers also watch.

October 1 — 11:00 p.m. Fernando Beserra and Wilson da Silva Oliveira are fishing off the Ilha do Major, a mangrove area near the Rio Piaçabuçu adjacent to São Vicente, São Paulo, Brazil, when a bright yellow object approaches swiftly and silently, landing on a nearby islet. Their boat engine fails as the UFO passes over, but they restart it and flee the area.

December 12 — 2:30 p.m. Farmer Egon Kratz and his son-in-law, Adilson Marcílio, are working on their Bela Vista Farm off Highway 227 about 5 miles from Ituporanga, Santa Catarina, Brazil, when a bright, silent, disc-shaped object appears low above some nearby trees, moves swiftly about 30 feet from the ground, and disappears into a valley. On December 15, Marcílio and some friends return to look for traces and find much of the vegetation scorched.

Technicians from the Federal University of Santa Catarina arrive on December 20 to collect soil samples and rocks. Kratz notes in January that much of the foliage and vegetation where the UFO has passed is dead or defoliated. (Brazil 350–353)

January 13 — Oralina Augusta de Freitas is watching TV in her home near Varginha, Minas Gerais, Brazil, when she sees a UFO hovering over the cattle, which are agitated. She calls her husband, Eurico Rodrigues, and they watch the object, which is the size of a microbus and the shape of a submarine. For 40 minutes the object flies less than 20 feet above the ground, heading toward town. The object has a hole in its structure through which white smoke is billowing. Pieces of its fuselage sway in the wind.

January 13 — 4:00 a.m. Businessman and pilot Carlos de Souza is driving from Très Coracões to Varginha, Minas Gerais, Brazil, along Highway 491. About 3 miles from Varginha, he hears a sound like an engine rumbling, so he stops by the side of the road and gets out of his vehicle. He sees a cylindrical airship 33–40 feet long and 13–16 feet in diameter flying about 395 feet above him toward Varginha. It is metallic, polished, and reflects the morning sunlight. He notices a hole in the right side of the ship and white smoke pouring out. After it crosses the highway, de Souza gets into his car and starts chasing it. When it crashes into the woods, he finds a dirt road that leads him to the scene, which is covered with debris that looks like tinfoil. He picks up a larger piece that is thin and light.

When he kneads it, he is amazed to see that it returns to its original state. Further away, he sees an Army helicopter, two tarpaulins, an ambulance, and three cars. He smells a powerful ammonia odor and is startled by a military police officer who approaches him and shouts, “Go away, you saw nothing.” Two more soldiers appear and force him to leave, so he returns to his car, drives away, and stops at a restaurant. A man approaches him and asks if he is Carlos de Souza, He replies yes, and the man calls him over and says, “What you saw, I saw too. You should not talk to anyone about it.” The man then relates details about de Souza’s private life.

January 20 — Afternoon. According to testimony by an ex-soldier, uniformed military men open fire while they are sweeping the small forest near Varginha, Brazil, where the creature had been found earlier. A soldier becomes frightened when he sees a creature apparently helping a wounded comrade. Two shots strike its belly and one its chest. A fourth shot hits its shoulder. These two creatures differ from the earlier one and have black hair.

Immediately afterward, soldiers come out of the woods carrying the creatures in two black sacks. Something is moving in one of them. (Clark III 1223)

February 11 — Chereze is admitted to Hospital Bom Pastor in Varginha, Brazil. ()

February 12 — Chereze is transferred to the emergency room of the Hospital Regional do Sul de Minas, Brazil, suffering from intense pain in the lower back and fever. ()

February 15 — Chereze wakes up very tired and in a state or torpor, with signs of cyanosis. He is transferred to intensive care, where his condition deteriorates rapidly. Chereze dies at 11:00 a.m. An autopsy confirms septicemia caused by a urinary infection, but the cause of death is unclear, according to Dr. Cesário Lincoln Furtado, who says it is highly unusual for a young man to quickly acquire an immunodeficiency followed by an attack of three kinds of virulent bacteria. Doctors order his body to be cremated immediately, but his family will not allow it. The death certificate gives the cause of death as acute respiratory failure, sepsis, and pneumonia. The family begins a legal challenge to have the records released. (A. J.

He insists to journalists that nothing unusual has happened in the city. When asked what the ESA military was doing on January 20, he replies that the military was “working for the sake of the Army and the nation.” In 1999, the story is amplified when a Major Calza says a “dwarf, disfigured and mentally retarded,” was behind some of the creature reports in Varginha. (Clark III 1225, 1226)

May 17 — 8:00 p.m. Hildo Lúcio Gardino, 20, is traveling from Très Coracões to Varginha, Brazil, when she sees a strange creature on the side of the road. She dims her headlights and speeds past as the creature places its hands over its eyes and flees into the woods. (Clark III 1225)

May 22 — 3:30 p.m. A motorist on the West Tamar Highway near Bradys Lookout State Reserve in Tasmania, notices an upright, vapor-like trail to the north. The trail changes into an upright, bronze-colored cigar shape that disappears in front of their eyes.

June 17 — 10:30 p.m. A witness is driving east on East Kingsfield Road in the northern part of Pensacola, Florida, when he sees a large, black triangular object. He pulls to the side of the road to watch, as does a truck in front of him. The object has a single white light at each corner and hovers directly above the road. A red blinking light is at the center.

June 24 — Day. Spasso Maximovitch notices an unusual object in the western sky over Rosh HaAyin in central Israel. He grabs his video camera to film it, just as a glowing white oval-shaped object appears some 20° west of the object and streaks toward it at high speed. Within 3 seconds it strikes the stationary orb, causing a huge explosion in the sky that seemingly destroys both objects. Stunned, Maximovitch stops filming immediately after capturing the explosion.

July — Day. A private pilot is flying his Piper Cherokee PA-28-140 from Waterville, Nova Scotia, to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, at 3,500 feet. While over Cape Blomidon, Nova Scotia, the pilot’s father-in-law (next to him in the right seat) spots a chrome-colored sphere 60 feet in diameter about 2 miles away and traveling at the same speed as the aircraft but about 500 feet lower. The pilot banks gently in its direction, and the sphere speedily darts toward Springhill, Nova Scotia, 20 miles away, and hovers there as a bright dot, then disappears. The pilot is distressed about the encounter and is distracted for the rest of the flight.

July 9 — 12:30 a.m. Police Sgt. Marian Mancu and volunteer guard Maricel Rusu are patrolling on the main road through Cerțești, Romania. Rusu sees a lighted object descending silently, causing nearby neon lights to vary in their intensity. Mancu hears a whistling sound and sees an object with flashing blue and red lights hovering 2 feet above the pavement. Three small people with elongated heads, white faces, big eyes, and scaly bodies are moving around inside it. The object is top-shaped, 15–20 feet across and 8 feet tall, and has a girdle of lights around the edge like a rainbow. After 2 minutes it rises vertically, its lights become brighter, and nearby streetlights go out. It turns northwest and departs with tremendous speed. Other residents of the town witness unusual light phenomena. (Romania 135–146)

July 17 — Dusk. A woman near Langruth, Manitoba, is startled to see a disc-shaped object moving quietly and slowly through her farmyard. The object, 9–12 feet in diameter and 2.5 feet thick, has slitlike lights along its edge. The next morning, she finds three circular patches of deep green growth in the area where the object had been. She thinks her well water has been affected by the incident.

August 17 — A couple camping in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, see a strange blue light dancing behind a hill. When they investigate, they find an object moving along the ground, occasionally emitting fames from its base. After a short while, it zips into the sky, then returns and hovers near them. It then shines a beam of light around the ground, illuminating them at one point. (Mark Rodeghier, “UFOs in Canada—1996,” IUR 22, no. 2 (Summer 1997): 32)

Mercury News, with one long article and one or two shorter articles appearing each day. It claims that “For the better part of a decade, a San Francisco Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles and funneled millions in drug profits to a Latin American guerrilla army run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.” This drug ring “opened the first pipeline between Colombia’s cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles” and, as a result, “The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America.” The Mercury News continues to pursue the story, publishing follow-ups to the original series for the next three months. Other papers are slow to pick up the story, but African Americans quickly take note, especially in South Central Los Angeles where the dealers discussed in the series are active. They respond with outrage to the series’ charges. By the end of September, three federal investigations are announced: an investigation into the CIA

After his resignation from The Mercury News, Webb expands the “Dark Alliance” series into a book that responds to the criticism of the series and describes his experiences writing the story and dealing with the controversy. A revised version is published in 1999 that incorporates Webb’s response to the CIA and Justice Department reports. The February 2000 report by the House Intelligence Committee in turn considers the book’s claims as well as the series’ claims. Webb’s reporting in “Dark Alliance” remains controversial. Many writers discussing the series point to errors in it. The claim that the drug ring of Meneses- Blandón-Ross sparked the “crack explosion” has been perhaps the most criticized part of the series. Webb commits suicide in 2004.

August 29 — 8:00 p.m. A mechanic notices a white mass of light at Port Arthur, Tasmania. His car acts up a bit, but the light vanishes, and it returns to normal. At 9:30 p.m., on the return trip, the white mass returns and paces the car for several kilometers. The engine misses and the headlights go out. He can now see a cigar-shaped object about 650 feet away, so he gets out, checks the engine, and finds nothing wrong. The UFO moves off and the car starts again. (Herbert S.

September 10 — The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. It opens for signature in New York on September 24 and is signed by 71 states, including five of the eight then- nuclear states. The treaty will enter into force 180 days after the 44 states listed in Annex 2 of the treaty have ratified it. These “Annex 2 states” are states that participated in the CTBT’s negotiations between 1994 and 1996 and possessed nuclear power reactors or research reactors at that time. As of 2016, eight Annex 2 states have not ratified the treaty: China, Egypt, Iran, Israel, and the United States have signed but not ratified the treaty;

India, North Korea, and Pakistan have not signed it. (Wikipedia, “[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170509548&usg=AOvVaw1j3lAV0iSMnJq70APGG8WF)”)

September 16 — Day. A witness is repairing a fence on his property near Valley, Ohio, when his dog starts barking loudly. Going over to his dog, he looks up to see a low-flying space-capsule-shaped UFO hovering and moving slowly over one of his cow pastures. He takes six photos of the object. Black to dark green in the photos, the cone-shaped object, when enlarged, shows a black Teflon-like covered bottom and a flange or rim that goes around near the top. In each photo the UFO is shown at a slightly different position and altitude, making it more difficult to hoax.

October 5 — 10:00 a.m. Businessman-pilot Haroldo Westendorff is flying a single-engine EMB-712 Tupi (Piper PA-28 Cherokee) over Ilha da Sarangonha, near São José do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, when he sees a gigantic object about the size of a football stadium. It is pyramidal in shape with 8 sides, on each of which are 3 protruding domes. Westendorff follows it for 2 minutes. The UFO is revolving slowly on its own axis and moving toward the ocean. A hatch opens on top of the object and three disks emerge and fly away quickly. When Westendorff tries to get closer, the UFO emits reddish rays, causing him to maneuver about 650 feet away.

October 15 — 11:00 p.m. A couple is driving near Trois Rivières, Quebec, when they see three strange triangular objects flying in the northern sky. One object, shaped like a “topper” and much larger than an airplane, aims an intense white light at their car for 20 minutes. They feel like “time was stopped.” Dozens of other people in the region see UFOs that same night. (Mark Rodeghier, “UFOs in Canada—1996,” IUR 22, no. 2 (Summer 1997): 32)

October 16 — 8:30–9:00 p.m. Many people over a wide area of south-central Ohio and northern Kentucky phone police to report strange lights in the sky. A husband and wife watch a fiery orange object near Ripley, Ohio, for 20 minutes. Charles Fite and Bill Adams in Aberdeen, Ohio, see several lights to the north in a “T” formation. A man in Tollesboro, Kentucky, reports 8–10 objects in a group that blink out and reappear in three-minute intervals. An airport operator in Jackson, Ohio, receives two calls describing a group of red lights moving erratically in the northwestern sky. Terry Howard, between Waverly and Chillicothe, Ohio, videotapes a group of glowing objects at about the same angle of altitude as the moon. Ohio UFO investigators suspect that the sightings are a result of military maneuvers by the Ohio Air National Guard.

October 25 — 2:00 a.m. A family sees a bowl-shaped disc with five rectangular windows in Gypsumville, Manitoba. It is seen through binoculars as it directs a beam of light down at a lake it is hovering above. Two nights later it returns, moving high above the lake. They drive to the home of a neighbor who joins them outside to watch four objects flying in formation. Two of the objects suddenly change direction and disappear from view, then the other two shine beams of light on the lake again and disappear by moving into the clouds.

November 16 — During an exhibition by the Brazilian Air Force’s Smoke Squadron over the coastline of Santos, São Paulo, Brazil, one of the EMB-312 Tucano aircraft’s wings breaks off and causes it to crash. A piece of the wing falls on a swimmer and kills him. A video taken at the time of the accident shows a small spherical object approaching the aircraft from behind and passing just at the point where the wing breaks off. Ufologist Reginaldo de Athayde analyzes the video images and finds that the object is real, metallic, reflective, and boasts a speed five times greater than the airplane. It measures about 3-by-3 feet in diameter and has a speed of 746–932 mph. It passes about 6.5 feet from the wing of the plane. (Clark III 205; Brazil 549–551)

December — 11:00 p.m. T/Sgt Anthony W. Keel is engaged in a field training exercise about one mile from the Weapons Storage Area at Ellsworth FB near Rapid City, South Dakota. He looks at the top of a hill and sees a light bobbing around and moving west to east. About 10 minutes later, he looks up again and sees it moving east to west and then back several times. It now moves in a straight line east away from Ellsworth but stops and hovers 2–3 miles from the base. Then it makes several short darts in different directions. After about 5 minutes, the radio operator announces that all flights from Ellsworth are grounded. The light eventually blinks out. (Nukes 469–470)

December 11 — 7:00–8:30 p.m. At least 31 people in the Yukon Territory, Canada, witness a giant UFO. Indications are that it may be the size of several football stadiums.

December 19 — A Boeing 757-200 operated by China’s Southern Airlines takes off from Beijing on a routine flight south to Wuhan. As the jetliner reaches an altitude of 31,500 feet, the copilot spots a bright flash in the sky just ahead of them. A silver-gray metallic UFO strikes the top of the 757’s cockpit, cracking the outer windshield. The pilot immediately declares an in-flight emergency and radios Beijing’s Capital International Airport, requesting permission to land. The plane lands safely 10 minutes later.

1997 — In his 1997 article “Dead Cows I’ve Known,” cattle mutilation researcher Charles T. Oliphant speculates that cattle mutilations are the result of covert research into emerging cattle diseases and whether they can be transmitted to humans. He suspects the NIH, CDC, or other federally funded bodies are involved, and they are supported by the US military. Pazrt of this is based on allegations that human pharmaceuticals have been found in mutilated cattle, and that necropsies show cattle mutilations commonly involve areas of the animal that relate to

“input, output, and reproduction.” To support his hypothesis, Oliphant cites the 1990 Reston Ebola virus case in which plainclothes military officers, traveling in unmarked vehicles, entered a research facility in Reston, Virginia, to secretly retrieve and destroy animals that were contaminated with a highly infectious disease.

Winter — 3:00 p.m. Sgt. John F. Duffy is serving as loadmaster and radio operator aboard a KC-130R Hercules cargo plane flying at an altitude of 24,000 feet north of the Horne Islands in the South Pacific. He notices a white object on the left side of the aircraft. At first it seems stationary, then appears to jump behind a nearby cloud, moving in a horizontal direction and disappears after only 2 seconds. (Richard F.

January 13 — Morning. A woman driving on Highway 1 from Abbotsford to Chilliwack, British Columbia, notices a fluffy cloud in a clear sky that “bursts downward” with a bright white light three times in succession. It dissipates, leaving behind a black bar. After 5 minutes, a solid stream of white light comes downward from it and another black bar appears, about 45° below the first one. They both start moving east in a wavy motion. She loses sight of them when she gets off the freeway at the Sardis exit. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Satellite Objects and Cloud Cigars,” IUR 29, no. 1 (Spring 2004): 26)

January 27 — 10:40 p.m. A man is driving on a quiet back road just south of Llangynidr, Powys, Wales, when he sees a “massive star” moving toward him. His car radio fails, and he is unable to use his mobile phone to call for help. He stops and gets out of the car. The glowing tube of smoky gray and blue light descends and encircles the car, remaining for 5 minutes. The witness can move around in the cloud but can hear no sound associated with the object. After the glow vanishes, he remains frightened and a bit sick. The car is coated with dust of unknown origin. He drives home to Newport, and the following morning he notices a skin rash. (Jenny Randles, “A Sprinkling of Star Dust,” Fortean Times 392 (May 2020): 33)

February 22 — Near Aklavik, Northwest Territories, Canada, two silver-gray objects follow five people along a road. They hover above the highway then glide smoothly down to the snow behind them. The objects have rows of windows with bright blue light shining through them. After 15 minutes, the objects are lost to view as the witnesses turn along an ice road. (Chris Rutkowski, “1997 Canadian UFO Survey,” IUR 23, no. 2 (Summer 1998): 15)

February 27 — 7:30 p.m. A luminous blue sphere appears over Aviano Air Base, Italy, and hovers. After it disappears, a larger, orange-yellow-red sphere appears, and six fighters are scrambled to intercept it. The jets circle around the sphere but it disappears. (2Pinotti 155)

March — Cheltenham, England, researcher Robin Cole and his UFO group named Circular Forum have looked into the activities of the nearby Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) facility known as the Oakley Installation. He issues an unpublished report on their findings, titled “GCHQ and the UFO Cover-Up,” which includes information on radar/visual encounters reported by RAF personnel in the 1950s, evidence that GCHQ

studied gun-camera footage of UFOs taken by British military pilots, the fact that the GCHQ library contains numerous UFO publications, and evidence that GCHQ still monitors military UFO encounters. Shortly afterward, he is visited by two Cheltenham policemen who ask him about a UFO group called the Truth-Seekers. It turns out they are actually from the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police, a counter-terrorism division.

March 3 — The Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, chaired by Sen. [Daniel Patrick Moynihan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170533070&usg=AOvVaw0Upy817TpvHalcTsCG3Dap) (D-N.Y.), after conducting an “investigation into all matters in any way related to any legislation, executive order, regulation, practice, or procedure relating to classified information or granting security clearances,” issues its final report. It concludes that secrecy is a form of government regulation; that excessive secrecy has significant consequences for the national interest when policy makers are not fully informed, the government is not held accountable for its actions, and the public cannot engage in informed debate; that some secrecy is important to minimize inappropriate diffusion of details of weapon systems design and ongoing security operations as well as to allow public servants to secretly consider a variety of policy options without fear of criticism; that the best way to ensure that secrecy is respected, and that the most important secrets remain secret, is for secrecy to be returned to its limited but necessary role; that secrets in the federal government are whatever anyone with a stamp decides to stamp secret; and that a new statute is needed to set forth the principles for what may be declared secret.

Moynihan reports that approximately 400,000 new secrets are created annually at the highest level, Top Secret.

March 6 — 6:45–10:30 p.m. Dozens of UFOs descend from the sky and briefly hover above Aviano Air Base, Italy. They zoom toward Venice Marco Polo Airport before heading toward Istrana and Treviso air bases, where they remain hovering in the sky for a while before returning to Aviano. The display repeats several times, despite Italian and US fighters attempting to intercept them. (2Pinotti 156)

March 8 — 3:00 a.m. Folkestone Herald journalist Sarah Hall is driving through Burmarsh, Kent, England, when she sees a large triangular object descend and hover above a field some 700 feet away near Dymchurch. It has a disc attached to it on the back and a big light on the front. When she pulls to a stop, it shoots away to a spot about 1,500 feet away and hovers. It does this four times, making a humming sound, and moving westward in increments for only a few seconds at a time. The UFO seems to be twice the size of an airliner. Other witnesses to a strange object come forward after Hall writes an article about her sighting.

March 13 — 6:55–10:30 p.m. Aerial lights of varying descriptions are seen by thousands of people (many of whom are looking for Comet Hale-Bopp) in a space of about 300 miles from Henderson, Nevada, at 6:55 p.m., through Phoenix to the edge of Tucson, Arizona. Tim Ley and his family at first see a tiny arc of five white lights just after 8:00 p.m. in the northwestern sky. They slowly draw nearer (around 30 mph), and Ley discerns a V-formation flying no more than 100 feet above the ground. The lights hold this pattern for more than 15 minutes, leading him to believe they are on one structure. Ley’s report is the most detailed, but there are many others. There are two distinct events involved in the entire incident: a triangular formation of lights seen to travel around 8:10–9:30 p.m. from Paulden to Tucson, passing over Prescott and Phoenix. Some witnesses see a huge carpenter’s square-shaped UFO, containing five spherical lights or possibly light-emitting engines. Gov.

Many witnesses say it is the size of multiple football fields and up to one mile long. Reports vary in terms of the number and color of lights and their movements. The second group of events is a series of stationary lights seen in the Phoenix area around 10:00 p.m. The Air Force identifies this group as magnesium LUU2 flares dropped by A-10 Warthog aircraft in a training exercise at the Barry Goldwater Range in southwest Arizona as part of Operation Snowbird; news coverage later shows a video taken around 10:00 p.m. by an amateur photographer that clearly shows the flares, not the earlier UFO.

March 24 — 10:00 p.m. Reports come in from the public that there is a low-flying aircraft over Howden Moors, Yorkshire, England. These reports soon turn into accounts of bright flashes, loud booming noises, and “several plumes of black smoke” rising from somewhere in the woodlands of the open countryside. Several search operations from several different counties are launched, both on foot and in the air. These continue through the night. The main concern is that a light aircraft or a helicopter has come down. However, no survivors or any wreckage is discovered during the search, which goes on well into the following day. At one stage, no-fly zones are put in place, an action that some UFO researchers later find suspicious—particularly when there are commercial airliners “stacking” as a result. Despite all of this activity, the official word from the military is that there is no crash at all. It is simply a mistaken sighting—despite many reports from the general public. Soon, rumors circulate from the many volunteer searchers. The most prominent comes from a unit of Yorkshire Water workers who happen to be in the area. They see a wrecked pile of metal in a clearing and a “military presence” that is loading “body bags” onto a Sea King helicopter. When the military is confronted with this, they claim they are merely moving equipment. An explanation remains elusive, although a military exercise did take place, at least 3 groups of observers reported UFO-like sightings, the sonic events did take place, and at least 1–2 civilian aircraft are reported in the area.

March 26 — 3:30 p.m. The San Diego County Sheriff’s Office takes a 911 call from a man later identified as Richard Ford, reporting a group suicide in a house in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Two deputies find 39 bodies of identically dressed, androgynous-looking men and women. Autopsies establish that each had drunk a lethal combination of vodka and barbiturates then smothered themselves with a plastic bag. Videotaped statements left behind explain that the suicides, members of a religious millenarian cult called Heaven’s Gate, were leaving their “earthly vehicles” behind and expect to board a spacecraft trailing Comet Hale-Bopp. It was founded in 1974 and led by [Marshall Applewhite](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Applewhite&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170551445&usg=AOvVaw3r50ObvrM8V5JKdyA5vNnL) and [Bonnie Nettles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Nettles&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170552068&usg=AOvVaw3DfElAjAxnfTe-tchVq6Rh) (formerly called Bo and Peep).

Others allegedly there are retired Cmdr. Will Miller, Adm. Mike Crawford, Gen. Patrick Hughes, Shari Adamiak (Greer’s assistant), and Stephen Lovekin. Greer claims he has extracted a pledge from Wilson during the meeting to investigate SAPs involving UFO technology. But Wilson soon reports that he doesn’t have the proper security clearance to inspect those files. As Greer informs a Portland, Oregon, audience in 2001, Wilson says, “‘I am horrified that this is true. I have been in plenty of black projects, but when we tried to get into this one,’ he was told, and I quote, ‘Sir, you do not have a need to know.’ The head of intelligence Joint Staffs. You don’t have a need to know. Neither did the CIA director, and neither did the president.” In a July 4, 2008, appearance on Larry King Live, Mitchell tells the audience he had learned the admiral “had found the people responsible for the cover-up and for the people who were in the know and were

told, I’m sorry, admiral, you do not have need to know here and so, goodbye.” Shortly afterward, Wilson admits meeting with Mitchell but denies he was ever refused access. (Steven M.

April 20 — 1:40 p.m. A woman is sitting on a park bench along the St. Clair River in Sarnia, Ontario. A grayish-white object suddenly appears in front of her, suspended vertically, with the bottom party positioned 25° above the horizon. The object has tubelike shape, rounded at both ends. She then notices a white spherical object that seems to have been ejected from the first. It travels a short distance north to Lake Huron and vanishes. The original object then disappears after another few seconds. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Satellite Objects: A Further Look,” IUR 29, no. 2 (Spring 2004): 26)

May 18 — Day. A tradesman sees a “flying entity” near Ponte a Mensola in the hills northeast of Florence, Italy. It descends vertically and lands in a field not too far away. He approaches it and sees that it is a man wearing black overalls with a red belt, helmet, and dark glasses, and with no apparent flying apparatus. The intruder notices him and disappears in the long grass, which is flattened where the man has landed. (2Pinotti 156–157)

She thinks it is odd, but suspects it is some kind of aircraft. Suddenly she falls down on her face, sustaining some minor scrapes and bruises. Asked why she fell, she says she was looking at a sky object, but it is no longer there. Later, she hears about chevron-shaped objects over Phoenix.

Much of the book is an account of Corso’s claims that he was assigned to a secret government program that provided some material recovered from a crashed spacecraft to private industry (without saying where the items came from) to reverse engineer them for corporate use. Corso was a special assistant to Lt. Gen. [Arthur Trudeau](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Trudeau&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170562185&usg=AOvVaw3YAsx41QJ58ocC44N9vqSD), who headed Army Research and Development, and was in charge of the Foreign Technology Desk. In this position, he would take technological artifacts obtained from Russian, German, and other foreign sources and have American companies (including IBM, Hughes Aircraft, Bell Labs) reverse engineer that technology. The book contends that several aspects of modern technology such as fiber optics and integrated circuits were developed by using information taken from the craft. Corso also claims the world was “at war” with extraterrestrials and that the Strategic Defense Initiative project in the 1980s was part of that campaign successfully concluded in Earth’s favor. The book concludes with information about Project Horizon, a 1959 US Army plan to construct a base on the Moon. When first released, the book contains a foreword written by Sen. [Strom Thurmond](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170562683&usg=AOvVaw1HdSPQ34sfBB_cmVH2kZd2) (R-S.C.), for whom Corso had served as an aide. Thurmond writes, “He has many interesting stories to share with individuals interested in military history, espionage, and the workings of our Government.” The foreword does not mention anything about UFOs, since Thurmond has assumed the book is a straightforward memoir. When he learns about the book’s contents, Thurmond asks for his foreword to be retracted, saying, “I know of no such ‘cover-up,’ and do not believe one existed.” (Wikipedia, “[The Day after Roswell](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After_Roswell&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170563100&usg=AOvVaw1BAhZXIY7nYi75AYxzuO4s)”; Philip J.

Grzegorz Nowak and four friends are visiting the monument to the Battle of Annenberg in Góra Świętej Anny, Poland, when they see glowing fireballs playing about on the hill and a large orange sphere. They try to communicate with the fireballs by flashing their headlights on and off; one of the lights responds with a similar signal. They watch other aerial objects and two of the youths have some missing time of more than an hour. The next night, they improve their headlight signaling. An enormous cigar-shaped object appears, shooting out multicolored lights that hover almost directly above them.

As many as 10 smaller spheres emerge from the upper part of the object and remain 10 feet away from it. Some darker colored spots can be seen rotating on the surface of the original light. After several minutes, the lights go off. (Poland 121–122)

July — Witnesses, one of whom is an Air Force and Coast Guard veteran, at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, see a “square of eight lights” in the sky. Fifteen minutes later, a silent boomerang-shaped object glides above them “like a huge bat” at low altitude. Its underside is covered with hundreds of small, dim, rectangular lights. (Chris Rutkowski, “1997 Canadian UFO Survey,” IUR 23, no. 2 (Summer 1998): 15)

July 3 — Two witnesses driving along Highway 16 near Nojack, Alberta, see a “black ring” with faint lines hanging down into a motionless “big puff of smoke.” It is in view for 5 minutes. (Chris Rutkowski, “1997 Canadian UFO Survey,” IUR 23, no. 2 (Summer 1998): 15)

July 14 — 10:49 p.m. Air traffic controllers at Henri Coandă International Airport at Otopeni, Romania, are supervising the landing of an airliner when they notice a light about 3 miles distant between Buftea and Corbeanca and well below the scattered cloud layer. It does not appear on radar. The duty officer turns the airport video cameras toward the UFO and records its image for 2 hours. Through binoculars the light is seen to have a horizontal band colored white, orange, and red. When the airport lights are switched on for another landing, the light blinks out and reappears in a different location, this time looking like two light balls joined together. The lights appear brighter when the airport lights are on and dim as soon as they are turned off. The lights disappear abruptly at 1:10 a.m. (Romania 75–77)

August 3 — The New York Times’s [William J.

Haines in a CIA journal, Studies in Intelligence, that Project Blue Book had known that more than half of UFO reports in the 1950s and 1960s by citizens and aviation experts were based on “fleeting glimpses of U-2 and SR-71 spy planes.” Rather than acknowledging their existence, Blue Book came up with “false cover stories” like ice crystals and temperature inversions. Not a single linkage of a reconnaissance flight to a UFO report is provided. These allegations are treated uncritically in the news media. One-time Blue Book head [Robert J.

August 9 — 5:07 p.m. Swissair Flight 127 to Zürich, Switzerland, is flying northeast over Queens, New York, near John

F. Kennedy International Airport, when pilots Capt. Philippe Bobet and First Officer Kurt Grunder see a cylindrical, glowing-white object, about the size of a fuselage of a small light aircraft, heading toward the Boeing 747 at high speed. The airliner is in level flight at 20,000 feet and cruising at 390 mph in a cloudless sky, and the UFO is 100–200 feet above it. There is no noise from the object, and no trail or wake disturbance is detected. The near collision lasts about only one second. The object is not detected on radar, and it does not trigger the aircraft’s collision warning system. The object is explained as a weather balloon, which is spotted by a United Airlines pilot in nearly the same location and height 72 minutes after the incident.

The panel makes several observations: The UFO problem is not a simple one, and it is unlikely that there is any simple, universal answer; whenever there are unexplained observations, there is the possibility that scientists will learn something new by studying them; studies should concentrate on cases that include as much independent physical evidence as possible; continuing contact between the UFO community and physical scientists could be productive; and institutional support for research in this area is desirable. After four days of presentations and discussions, Sturrock announces that the panel will issue a statement to be drafted later that encourages UFO study by scientists. (Michael D.

October 17 — In an effort to gauge the vulnerability of military satellites to laser attacks, the US military tests a directed energy weapon, Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL) developed by the US Navy in 1980, against an aging USAF reconnaissance satellite. From its location at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, MIRACL sends two blasts of its deuterium fluoride laser against MSTI-3 at a distance of 238 miles. The Pentagon claims mixed results because a computer glitch prevents the satellite from reporting back that the second shot has struck the target.

November 4 — 6:00 p.m. Between Minehead and Porlock, Somerset, England, a man driving home in foggy conditions sees three white beams of light that suddenly permeate the fog from above and converge into a circle on the hood of his car. The electrical system fails, and he cannot restart it. After about 5 minutes the light beam disappears suddenly and the headlights come back on, so he resumes driving. When he gets home, he finds that his watch and car clock are 5 minutes slow and that a compass placed near the car gives a reading 90° from true. (Herbert S.

The process goes on until April 27, 1998, when the report is sent to the editorial office of the Journal of Scientific Exploration. The report’s release engenders a mostly positive press response, but with little effect on scientists’ continuing refusal to examine UFO reports. (Clark III 1117)

December — Retired Sergeant-Major Cherd Chuensamnaun is deep in Buddhist meditation at his home in Nakhon Sawan, Thailand, when he begins receiving communications from space aliens. The following day his skeptical son and son-in-law Jaroen Raepeth are lifted up from the living room sofa and thrown outdoors into the yard. His daughter Wassana sees a 33–50-foot long UFO outside at treetop level. Cherd continues to transmit messages from the extraterrestrials (who hail from Pluto and another planet named Loku) until his death in 2000.

December 8 — Night. After two brightly lit objects fly above Surrey, British Columbia, a large, disc-shaped, pewter- colored craft spins and bobs around in the sky. The witnesses give chase in their car, but lose sight of it. (Chris Rutkowski, “1997 Canadian UFO Survey,” IUR 23, no. 2 (Summer 1998): 15)

December 14 — Seven people in Vancouver, British Columbia, see an object shaped like an “@” sign. It zooms into view and stops in mid-flight, appearing as a “flattened silver pyramid.” It bobs up and down then disappears suddenly. (Chris Rutkowski, “1997 Canadian UFO Survey,” IUR 23, no. 2 (Summer 1998): 15)

December 22 — An object like an “airplane wing cross-sectioned” is seen by a witness near Halifax, Nova Scotia. It has a solid appearance and is slow-moving, disappearing after 8 minutes. (Chris Rutkowski, “1997 Canadian UFO Survey,” IUR 23, no. 2 (Summer 1998): 15)

December 31 — 11:30 p.m. Many people in the area of Rzeszów, Poland, watch a spherical orange object. Jan Skobran and Maciej Robert see it briefly before it disappears. At 11:50 p.m., it reappears and they videotape it on VHS. After about 40 seconds it disappears, but another shows up at 12:20 a.m., pulsating with an intense orange glow. Seconds later it disappears, but another light appears over the Słocina forest. (Poland 153–154)

1998

1998 — The Roper Organization conducts a second survey on abductions, using the same indicators as its 1991 survey. This one is commissioned by [Robert Bigelow](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bigelow&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170600683&usg=AOvVaw1JmCG2lmPCvGwA7am91aNJ)’s National Institute for Discovery Science. Results indicate that the number of potential abductees has dropped from more than 3.7 million in 1991 to 2.2 million in 1998. (Mark Rodeghier, “Counting Abductees: What Can Surveys Tell Us?” IUR 25, no. 3 (Fall 2000): 21–23)

Leir has performed surgery to remove small objects from the feet and hands of 17 abductees.

Some of the findings are potentially noteworthy—the objects are found on the left side of the body, most of them fluoresce under ultraviolet light, some are magnetic, and most appear metallic and seem to emit radio signals.

Calcium, copper, and iron are the most common constituents. Critics dismiss the objects as tiny slivers of metal or glass embedded in tissue and find no evidence for radio emissions. None of the objects reveal any apparent technological structure. (Roger K.

January — [David Jacobs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Jacobs&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170604655&usg=AOvVaw0VX4YlwA4YLBbiIraNzSoR)’s book The Threat expresses his belief that the aliens are not doing research; rather, they are carrying out a deliberate and massive breeding program using individuals from childhood onward and families for generations. The aliens create pregnancies, steal fetuses, and grow hybrids in vats and incubators. When those hybrids become children, they require emotional nurture from humans to thrive, so the aliens bring abductees back to touch and interact with the children. The abductees report seeing hybrids that look less and less like the gray aliens. Another series of hybridizations occurs as the aliens breed or engineer early-stage hybrids into progressively more human late-stage hybrids, who are all but indistinguishable from ordinary people (blond, blue- eyed Nordics). Some adult hybrids assist the aliens in their work, while others live on earth and mingle with humans for a time. Jacobs raises the alarm that apparent benevolence from the aliens is a con to lull us into complacency and hide their true intentions. (David M. Jacobs, [The Threat: Revealing the Secret Alien Agenda](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/threat00jaco/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170605387&usg=AOvVaw0BlN78FQPoEj74nX1yYd-0), Simon & Schuster, 1998; Thomas E.

January 2 — 9:30 p.m. Fernando Mariano de Oliveira and Luciene da Cunha Lopes are in a townhouse on the Rua Luis Augusto Ferreira in the Capão Redondo neighborhood of São Paulo, Brazil, when they see a small luminous sphere about 8 inches in diameter moving up and down in the sky at variable speeds about 500 feet away from them. Other family members join them to watch the silent white light, and the neighborhood dogs bark constantly. Fernando’s brother, Alan Bruno de Oliveira, 10, picks up a camcorder and films the light with the help of his cousin Katiuscia da Cunha Lopes for 4.5 minutes. The light disappears around 10:00 p.m. (Brazil 385–392)

January 11 — 1:00 a.m. A pair of dark triangular objects appear to merge together over Cuddington, Cheshire, England. (Marler 145)

February — Night. Two young men are driving from Opole to Niemodlin, Poland, when the car radio goes off and the engine of their Polski Fiat 125p fails just as a large object flies over them. The lights, radio, and engine come back on by themselves after the object is gone, but they can still see it in the west as it apparently descends toward the road a mile or two ahead. From the top of a hill, they see it emitting a dazzling light and hovering above the trees. Suddenly it approaches them, flying 65–100 feet off the ground, and they speed ahead into town. (Poland 84–85)

February 17 — An Army intelligence document summarizes the “Bioeffects of Selected Nonlethal Weapons,” including microwave, acoustic, and radio-frequency directed energy devices. As for RF energy, “There is no sound propagated through the air like normal sound. This technology in its crudest form could be used to distract individuals; if refined, it could also be used to communicate with hostages or hostage takers directly by Morse code or other message systems, possibly even by voice communication.” And, “The phenomenon is tunable in that the characteristic sounds and intensities of those sounds depend on the characteristics of the RF energy as delivered. Because the frequency of the sound heard is dependent on the pulse characteristics of the RF energy, it seems possible that this technology could be developed to the point where words could be transmitted to be heard like the spoken word, except that it could only be heard within a person’s head. In one experiment, communication of the words from one to ten using ‘speech modulated’ microwave energy was successfully demonstrated. Microphones next to the person experiencing the voice could not pick up the sound. Additional development of this would open up a wide range of possibilities.” (US Army, “[Bioeffects of Selected Nonlethal](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/bioeffects-of-selected-non-lethal-weapons-1998/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170607182&usg=AOvVaw2EMF6ngn_HINO0i67o8ga0) [Weapons,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/bioeffects-of-selected-non-lethal-weapons-1998/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170607729&usg=AOvVaw0yl1j5Y-bs4Y7MswAi5KfA)” February 17, 1998)

April 22 — 9:20 p.m. A former Canadian F-104 pilot watches a UFO embedded in a cloud of green light fly toward the south over his car as he is driving near Whistler, British Columbia. It is visible only a few seconds. Other witnesses further south see the UFO stop over Puget Sound for 5–10 seconds, jump instantly to another location, and hover again before speeding away to the south.

April 22 — 9:23 p.m. Civilian Larry Swanson sees a disc-shaped UFO fly silently north to south at about 300–400 feet altitude over the center of Naval Submarine Base Bangor \[now Naval Base Kitsap\] on the Kitsap Peninsula, Washington. At one point, the disc tilts slightly, allowing Swanson to view its underside, which is glowing white

except for a central circular area about 30 feet in diameter. It slowly glides out of sight. (“Sighting Report,” National UFO Reporting Center, January 28, 1999; Nukes 494–498)

July 21 — 11:19 p.m. An object the size of a small trailer appears suddenly over Napoleon, Ohio. It is emitting a dense fog and stays stationary for 7 minutes, then branches out and grows until 5 smaller craft are seen circling it. The large object seems to dissolve and disappear, the smaller objects still circling for another few minutes. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Cloud Cigars: A Further Look,” IUR 30, no. 3 (May 2006): 13)

August 10 — 12:00 noon–1:00 p.m. At least four witnesses at Quirindi, New South Wales, see “20 silver balls” performing complex maneuvers. Angel hair streams from the objects during acceleration and right-angle turns. The substance consolidates into long, white strands that slowly fall to earth, draping on telephone lines and trees. It is white, cotton-like, and strong, requiring a good tug to break, but quickly sublimates to nothing on handling. A sample is sent to UFO researcher [Bill Chalker](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Chalker&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170615984&usg=AOvVaw0LRD6iOSAm_O5AMzOOG1hC) for analysis.

October 18 — 12:40 p.m. Dave Rose is at Sandwell Valley, West Midlands, England, with his parents when they see a motionless sphere in the sky. After 20 minutes another object, a metallic-looking triangular UFO, also appears. The triangle moves from side to side in short bursts before vanishing completely. The sphere dwindles to a dark spot in another 10 minutes.

October 19 — Four different radar stations in Hebei province, China, pick up an unknown target moving above a military flight training base near Cangzhou. At least 140 observers at the base see the object as a small star that grows larger and larger as it descends. It has a mushroom-shaped dome on top and a flat bottom covered with rotating lights. The base commander scrambles a Shenyang J-6 fighter, which gets to within 2.5 miles of the UFO over Qing County, whereupon it abruptly shoots upward. The UFO plays cat and mouse with the jet, appearing and reappearing. Permission to fire on the UFO is denied by ground control. The fighter is forced to return after running low on fuel, and the UFO disappears before other aircraft arrive.

November 6 — 3:00 a.m. A man is driving with his wife near Childers, Queensland, when he sees an object moving quickly across the road. Five minutes later he sees a green beam of light shining down from the sky. The light source seems to be about 3,000 feet above them. Both he and his wife, who is asleep in the car, experience swelling in the hands and lips, as well as headaches. They both feel compelled to take their wedding rings off and sense that something else will happen to them. (“Australian CE2,” IUR 24, no. 2 (Summer 1999): 12)

November 6 — 7:00 a.m. A witness in Bothell, Washington, sees a thin, horizontal cloud that tilts and descends. A taller horizontal cloud tilts to the left, but it soon appears to be a dark, cylindrical object. Two small oval clouds emerge from a larger cloud. All of the objects slowly descend past the Cascades Mountains. A few jets fly toward them one at a time, until 9:30 p.m. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Mystery Clouds and the UFO Connection,” IUR 29, no. 4 (July 2005): 26)

November 11 — 11:55 a.m. Two daylight discs are seen by Ms. R. M. Jones as she is driving through Alexander, Arkansas: “The first was larger, more white, more stationary and lasted longer. The second was a white cigar sort of thing, sort of shimmery.” (“[UFOs Dominate Night Sky over Arkansas,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rense.com/ufo2/ufoark.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170630501&usg=AOvVaw1jr_5Orveszw2xJ_rR12pl)” UFO Roundup 3, no. 49, December 7, 1998)

November 27 — 7:00–7:30 p.m. A woman is driving east on 25 Mile Road north of Mount Clemens, Michigan, when she sees a “highly intense,” basketball-sized ball of white light coming directly at her from the right at high speed.

There is no sound and no time to avoid a collision. The object hits the car with a low thud, but the car’s motion is not affected. She does not see it again and continues driving home. Upon inspecting her car, she finds a cream- colored residue where it hit the car, forming a streak about 12–13 inches long that is broken in several spots. The residue is saved and after several months it is sent to analytical chemist [Phyllis Budinger](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.mufonohio.com/mufono/FRtour.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170631115&usg=AOvVaw2lUckpkiCzzCacdqwNO8uU) for tests and analysis.

The results show prominent components of kaolin (aluminum silicate), a hydrated metal (perhaps manganese) oxide, and a celluloidal material. Only the oxide is not attributable to the car’s own finish. There is no evidence of heat transferred to the car’s paint.

November 30 — Night. Bright blue-white lights are seen throughout Sussex County, Delaware. One man reports a “large blue light that was moving all over erratically,” with smaller lights coming from the larger one.

December — 5:45 p.m. Christopher Cabrera is at the end of his patrol shift at Area 2 in Nellis AFB in Nevada and chatting with a few other guards. All four of them notice three extremely bright amber lights in front of them in the southeast blinking sequentially in a vertical, triangular formation. The bottom two lights are about 100 feet off the ground and a quarter-mile away. They seem to be attached to one solid object that blocks out the stars behind it. It remains eerily silent. The event lasts about 10 seconds and the lights are so bright that it looks like daytime. The guards report the incident to the Flight Chief, who tells them not to repeat the story to anyone or they will be eligible for dishonorable discharge. (Robert L.

Much of the experience consists of a life lesson in symbolic form, Mack asserts. The hybrids combine the human and alien in a shared mission to save the Earth. The nurturing of hybrid children emphasizes the importance of emotion, and the otherness of the aliens awakens a sense that humans are not the apex of existence. The shock and terror of kidnap by unearthly beings breaks the illusion that the world is under our control. Although Mack hears the usual accounts of examinations and reproductive procedures from dozens of other experiencers, he still reads these events as symbolic agents of the larger purpose to save Earth from humans and humans from themselves.

Whether or not the abductors are extraterrestrial hardly matters. (John E. Mack, Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters, Crown, 1999; Clark III 9, 10)

July 27 — Day. Several people living near the shore of Lake Backsjön, near Gunnarskog, Värmlands, Sweden, see and hear a rocket-shaped object plunge into the water. The object is 6–10 feet long and descends at high speed, creating a splash in the water before sinking. One witness contacts the rescue station at Arvika, who in turn contact the police and military. Stellan Jansson, chief of staff for the I 2/Fo52 Värmland Regiment, interviews the witnesses. In September, the army begins an intensive search of the lake under the code name Operation Sea Find using divers, sonar equipment, and a mini-sub. The operation conducts a 10-day search and examines 75% of the lake, but the search is discontinued on September 16 after finding no evidence. On October 1, a secret report is

completed for military intelligence in Stockholm. (Clas Svahn and Eileen Fletcher, “The Swedish Military and UFOs,” IUR 25, no. 3 (Fall 2000): 16–17; Swords 370)

September 30 — 10:35 a.m. A serious criticality incident takes place in the Tokaimura uranium processing facility operated by JCO in the village of Tokai, Iberaki Prefeccture, Japan. The accident occurs as three workers are preparing a small batch of fuel for the Jōyō experimental fast breeder reactor, using uranium enriched to 18.8% with the radioisotope uranium-235 (with the remainder being the fertile uranium-238). It is JCO’s first batch of fuel for that reactor in three years, and no proper qualification and training requirements appear to have been established to prepare those workers for the job. A precipitation tank reaches critical mass when its fill level, containing about 35 pounds of uranium, reaches about 11 gallons. The two technicians who receive the higher doses die several months later.

October 9 — 7:57 p.m. While fishing off Fort Pickens near Pensacola, Florida, an ex-Air Force security policeman and a city police officer watch a triangular UFO with high-intensity blue arcing lights traveling west over the Gulf of Mexico in a zigzag fashion. It is about 200 feet in the air, a quarter of a mile distant, and moving at 115–350 mph. At least four times it seems to hover for 30 seconds. After 15 minutes, it moves away to the west. (George Filer, “Florida Triangle with Blue Ionization near Gulf Breeze,” Filer’s Files, #43-1999, October 18, 1999)

October 10 — 11:45 p.m. A couple in Lewiston, Michigan, see a hazy, pulsing object outside their bedroom window.

Other lights seem to be flying around it, so that it resembles moths flying around a light bulb. They watch it for 45 minutes, then go back to sleep. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Cloud Cigars: A Further Look,” IUR 30, no. 3 (May 2006): 13)

October 29 — 5:45 p.m. A man and woman in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, see a nickel-colored object emerge from a strange contrail-like cloud and fly back into it. A few seconds later, it shoots out again and circles around it for 15 minutes. About an hour later, they see jets flying around, apparently searching for the object. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Cloud Cigars: A Further Look,” IUR 30, no. 3 (May 2006): 13)

November 11 — A sample of “angel hair” is recovered from a fall in Sacramento, California, and sent to analytical chemist [Phyllis Budinger](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.mufonohio.com/mufono/FRtour.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170653543&usg=AOvVaw17PJ6qowIgAFp7-NE-BG08) for Fourier Transform infrared spectrometry analysis. She finds that the fibrous material is not spider web but consists of a silk-like substance containing secondary amide linkages similar to protein. It also contains volatile hydrocarbons.

November 11 — 8:30 p.m. Two men are loading gravel onto a truck in Tomelilla, Skåne, Sweden, when they see a boomerang-shaped object flying overhead, blocking out the stars. The object is solid and observed for 5–10 seconds.

December — Cao Gong, a middle-aged man from Beijing, China, claims he is abducted by aliens and flown to Qinhuangdao, Hebei province, in a UFO. The entities look like humans but have large hands and are very pale. [Zhang Jingping](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/746113.shtml&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170655181&usg=AOvVaw3_LEfoLZfh66hfs_yqGX25) of the World Chinese UFO Association begins to investigate the Cao case in April 2000 and has him hypnotically regressed by a psychologist from Suzhou. Cao also passes a lie detector test at the Beijing Bureau of Public Security. Cao remembers meeting in the spacecraft a Chinese girl who looks about 13 years old. She tells him the aliens cured her of a disease. Zhang brings Cao to the Tangshan Bureau of Public Security in July 2000, where the police construct a computer reconstruction of the girl’s face according to his description. In November 2002, Zhang leads a group of students from Beihang University on a trip to Qinhuangdao to look for the girl. They arrive in Qinglong County and begin a blind search among the area’s 400,000 inhabitants. On the second day, an old man recognizes the girl in the image. They locate her and she turns out to be 15 years old.

Zhang brings her back to Beijing to meet Cao Gong, who identifies her as the girl he met.

He also claims aliens have followed his car, visited his home, and communicated with him telepathically. In 2003, he claims he woke up and found himself wearing a ladies’ flannel nightgown, which makes him suspect he has been abducted and returned in woman’s clothing.

Romanek eventually comes to suspect that the clothing belongs to another supposed abductee, [Betty Hill](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_and_Betty_Hill&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170672636&usg=AOvVaw0-aP5dmyFuzQNpZhD5cwSF)[.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_and_Betty_Hill&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170672987&usg=AOvVaw2q7-7p49DUTZbDbG-QwPxT) When asked if the gown has been tested for Hill’s DNA, Romanek claims that it has not because the test is too expensive.

One goes out to the truck for food and sees a massive, dark, triangular object hovering motionless above him. He yells for the others to come out, lights on the object turn on, and it slowly moves toward the nearby mountains. When it reaches one, it tips upward and ascends the side of the mountain vertically. When it reaches the top, it tips forward and disappears from sight. (Marler 228–229)

October 15 — [Richard Haines](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/bio-haines.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170708139&usg=AOvVaw11z8N0TKCmcLheEUossma_)’s National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena releases a 90-page report that summarizes more than 100 UFO incidents reported by pilots and their crews, including 56 near misses, all affecting aircraft safety. Most cases involve multiple witnesses, and many are backed by ground radio communications and radar corroboration. Experienced pilots present accounts of objects, ranging from silver discs to green fireballs, flying loops around passenger aircraft, pacing planes despite pilots’ evasive attempts, or flooding cockpits with blinding light. Haines documents cases with electromagnetic interference on navigation and operating systems. He writes that a crew’s ability to perform its duties safely is disrupted when the crew is faced with “extremely bizarre, unexpected, and prolonged luminous and/or solid phenomena cavorting near their aircraft.” The primary danger is in the human response, since the objects do not appear to be hostile and seem to be able to avoid collisions using extraordinary maneuvers.

October 31 — After sunset. A woman delivering pizzas in Cygnet, Ohio, is stopped along Cygnet Road when she sees an elongated, football-shaped object clearly visible just beyond a thin grove of trees ahead of her. It is slowly moving westward toward and above Interstate 75, which is busy with cars and large trucks. It hovers for a few seconds

and turns brighter, then shoots off westward in a streak of light. Two men driving north on I-75 also see the object. (John P. Timmerman, “Possible Close Encounter in NW Ohio,” IUR 25, no. 3 (Fall 2000): 18)

November — 7:00 p.m. A retired law enforcement officer and several friends are cooking dinner over an open fire in a wooded area near Elsberry, Missouri, when they see a huge flying wing with white lights on each end. It seems to be flying completely silently at 3,000 feet. They watch it for 30 seconds before it disappears into the southeast. ()

November 4 — Two witnesses near the Del Lago Golf Club north of Vail, Arizona, see a teardrop-shaped object flying at 300 feet. It has multiple lights around its perimeter. They drive toward it, flashing their lights, and the object climbs another 300 feet and moves west along some railroad tracks. Two A-10 Thunderbolt II fighter aircraft appear and try to follow the object, but it accelerates and loses them. (George Filer, “Arizona Formation of Flying Triangles,” Filer’s Files, #49-2000 (December 11, 2000))

November 4 — 8:45 p.m. A family in Scottsdale, Arizona, sees a triangular formation of three bright lights in the southern sky blinking irregularly. The object they are attached to is larger than a commercial airliner that happens to pass by. (George Filer, “Arizona Formation of Flying Triangles,” Filer’s Files, #49-2000 (December 11, 2000))

November 20 — 8:45 p.m. An 11-year-old boy on the north side of Phoenix, Arizona, watches three dark triangle-shaped objects maneuvering and hovering. (George Filer, “Arizona Formation of Flying Triangles,” Filer’s Files, #49- 2000 (December 11, 2000))

November 28 — 7:00 p.m. Jason Ingraham sees a flying triangle with a deep red blinking light on each point in Phoenix, Arizona. It moves northwest for about 10 seconds, then it leans to the left and begins to rotate in a clockwise motion. It makes a full rotation before disappearing behind some distant trees. There are 6 normal airplanes in the sky at the same time. (George Filer, “Arizona Formation of Flying Triangles,” Filer’s Files, #49-2000 (December 11, 2000))

December 1 — 6:45 p.m. A witness in Avondale, Arizona, sees a bunch of lights in the shape of a triangle to the southeast. Helicopters seem to be flying around it. (George Filer, “Arizona Formation of Flying Triangles,” Filer’s Files, #49-2000 (December 11, 2000))

December 4 — The UK Ministry of Defence notes in a “loose minute” that DI55, the space weapons section of the Defence Intelligence Staff, has completed a study of UFO reports, concluding that there is nothing of value in its assessment of “threat weapons systems” and will carry out no further investigations. It will be released in 2006 as the Project Condign report.

December 13 — 10:00 pm. A group of five people is traveling in a Volkswagen on a dirt road 9 miles from Iturama, Minas Gerais, Brazil—João Caiana, his wife Valdeir Martins, daughter Magui Martins, a 3-year-old granddaughter, and an 18-year-old friend. Some odd colored lights in the sky seem to follow them for 2 miles. Suddenly the interior of the car begins to get hot, and a light gray entity with big eyes approaches them. Everyone loses control and seems to be sucked into a UFO for an abduction scenario.

December 19 — 6:10 a.m. Reporter Alfondo Reyes is observing the eruption of Popocatépetl southeast of Mexico City, Mexico, and taking time-exposure photographs. On one 20-second exposure he catches a bright luminous object that contrasts with the smoke of the eruption and seems to make a turn toward the crater. He does not actually see the object and only discovers it after the photo is developed.

December 24 — 7:00 p.m. A woman living in the Baranówka neighborhood of Rzeszów, Poland, sees a light outside her window on the 4th floor of an apartment building. It makes unusual maneuvers like a figure-8 and zigzags, and is joined by another light that flies at a constant speed. Both are about 5 feet in diameter. She snaps two motion-blur photos with her Minolta that shows an object hovering above the apartment block opposite her. The second object approaches the first one and they fly away together.

January 1 — 12:01 a.m. Five people driving along Highway 3 south of New Plymouth, New Zealand, spot an orange object about 30–50 feet in diameter pacing their car 100 feet above them. They pull over to watch and see three similar objects hovering and swaying around. They look like they are changing color from metallic glowing orange to metallic deep purple and shades of blue. One more larger object appears on the horizon and speeds toward the other four. Each seems to react in a way similar to an army unit and forms a line and disappears almost instantly to the south. As they leave several minutes later, they realize they haven’t seen any traffic for 30 minutes and only see some as they enter New Plymouth.

January 5 — 10:30 a.m. A white, “self-lit” cigar-shaped object with a small vapor trail is seen at Whitehorse, Yukon Territory. Its hops forward in its progress through the sky before it moves out of view behind a mountain. It returns and flies back again.

January 14 — Late afternoon. Witnesses on both sides of the hill see a small object appear to strike the telecommunications mast on top of Snaefell, Isle of Man. Two women on horseback see a 20-foot-long object that crashes in a shower of sparks and smoke. The emergency services think a small plane has crashed, because they have lost power and are using a backup generator. As light fades, however, helicopter crews can see damage to the mast, but no sign of wreckage. The UK government blames a model aircraft. (Jenny Randles, “Mysterious Island: The UFO Legacy of the Isle of Man,” IUR 29, no. 1 (Spring 2004): 14)

January 22 — 12:30 a.m. Barnaul Airport in Altai Krai, Russia, shuts down after a slightly tilted, oscillating, disc-shaped object is detected hovering above its runway. The crew of an Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane refuses to take off, claiming they can see a luminous object. An incoming Yakovlev Yak-40 passenger plane also sees an object at Barnaul and lands at another airport. Sergei Kurennoi, the chief airspace controller at Barnaul, sees the object at an elevation of 15°–20º above the horizon above the end of the track. With his binoculars, he distinguishes a solid structure that radiates light of various colors (red, green, purple). Nothing is tracked on radar. The UFO noiselessly takes off to the northwest, changes direction to the southwest, and vanishes after 90 minutes.

February — French ufologist Dominique Weinstein creates a massive catalogue of 1,305 UFO sightings by pilots from 1916 to 2000. She finds that 606 cases (36.7%) are sightings by military pilots and crews; 444 cases (26.9%) are by civilian pilots; and 196 cases (11.8%) are by private pilots. In 200 cases (12.1%) the visual observation is confirmed by on-board or ground radar. And in 57 cases (3.45%) the pilots note electromagnetic effects on one or more of the plane’s transmission systems. (Dominique F.

April 1 — 10:30 p.m. Farm manager George Hofer and several children from the Rosedale Hutterite Brethren Colony near Etzikom, Alberta, see a brilliant fireball falling and apparently striking the Earth only a few miles away. On April 16, Ken Masson, who farms 13 miles south of Etzikom, discovers a circular, crater-like formation on his land. On May 1, Pano Karkanis of the University of Lethbridge Department of Geography visits the site, interviews the witnesses, measures the crater, and takes soil samples. The crater is 6 inches deep, with an inside diameter of 7.9 feet, surrounded by a mound of dirt 16 inches high. He notes four indentations inside the circle that he suspects are caused by rainwater. The dirt inside is cracked and sere, and he finds some odd reddish-brown particles of dirt on the mound. He concludes the crater was formed by a meteorite fragment that vaporized, leaving only the reddish-brown particles.

June 23 — 9:45 p.m. Three witnesses are sitting in their yard in Fernandina Beach, Florida, when they see a bright white light with a bluish tinge descend and hover about 2,000 feet due east of them above the ocean. After one minute it emits a mist from three points on its underside so that it appears to be sitting on a cloud. Then it emits mist from its upper area and becomes enshrouded with the light shining through. Then the light blinks off, leaving only a cloud that stands there for about one minute. It disappears 5–10 seconds afterward. (“Sighting Report,” National UFO Reporting Center, February 11, 2003; Nukes 506–507)

June 30 — 10:30 p.m. Electrical power goes off in the small village of Năneşti, Romania, even though the lights in neighboring villages are still on. A number of witnesses notice a red, round ball moving slowly in the air. When it stops it begins to spin, turning into a rotating segmented ring of pale yellow light. The ring becomes larger in diameter, coming closer to the ground where it gets as large as 600 feet in diameter. After a short period of time it climbs again, still rotating but shrinking and turning into a red dot that moves around in the sky until it starts rotating again and repeating the cycle some 8–20 times over the course of 45 minutes. Some witnesses see it as a

dark red cloud lit from inside by squares of light. The display ceases sometime after midnight and the power returns mysteriously at around 2:00 a.m. (Romania 70–73)

July 9 — 11:30 p.m. A man and his daughter watch six orange, oval objects flying in a V-formation toward the west at Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. (Mark Rodeghier, “UFOs in Canada, 2001,” IUR 26, no. 4 (Winter 2001–2002): 17)

July 14–15 — Evening–night. Dozens of Staten Islanders and residents of Carteret, New Jersey, observe lights in the southwestern sky on a clear, cloudless night. The lights appear in various formations at about 45° above the horizon. Witnesses view the scene from Arthur Kill Road and the West Shore Expressway on the New York side. The Waterloo Cafe, located opposite the Blazing Star Burial Ground on Arthur Kill Road, provides the most significant witnesses. The consensus of their testimonies reveals a series of lights, numbering from 4–5 to as many as 16–20, bright orange or orange-red in hue, and appearing as solid round objects. Witnesses number about 50, including the owner of the cafe, but not all come forward. Those who do, agree that there was no sound emanating from the lights, and no one can see any wings. The lights are often no more than 1,000 feet in the air, often described as flying in an inverted V-shaped configuration. Unknown targets without transponders, some at heights of 99,000 feet, are picked up on radar at Newark International Airport. (Dennis K. Anderson, “The Arthur Kill Sightings, July 14–15, 2001,” IUR 28, no. 2 (Summer 2003): 3–6, 26–27)

August 3 — Day. A Brazilian Air Force pilot and four others are taking supplies from Belém to Salvador, Brazil, aboard a C-130 Hercules transport. One of the military officers draws the colonel’s attention to a disc-shaped object that is accompanying the plane about 6t0 feet away. Ground control cannot detect anything on radar. The object has a brushed gray color and is the size of a bus. It has a dome at the top and flat at the bottom. The sighting lasts about 10 minutes. (Clark III 208; Brazil 559–560)

August 6 — Afternoon. Two Turkish Air Force pilots from 122 Squadron are practicing maneuvers in a Cessna T-37B Dragonfly jet trainer over the Gulf of Çandarli, an inlet of the Aegean Sea in western Turkey. 1Lt. Ilker Dinçer and his student Lt. Arda Gunyel are surprised by an extremely bright object, shaped like something between a disc and a cone, with a pod on its lower part. Ground control has nothing on its radar. The UFO approaches the Cessna at high speed, then positions itself alongside, behind, and above the jet. It plays cat and mouse with the plane for some minutes before it disappears at high speed. The Turkish Air Force announces that it is a weather balloon.

September 9 — 10:30 p.m. A family traveling in a pickup truck between Achiras and Sampacho, Argentina, notice an intense red light in the sky moving from the southwest. It looks like an intense red beam with bright flashes behind it. In the front is something like an arc of light. The object seems as if it about to fall on top of them, but it changes course and heads toward the mountains. (“UFOs Seen in Argentina,” IUR 27, no. 2 (Summer 2002): 4)

November 5 — Apache County sheriff’s deputies attempt to arrest [Milton Willian Cooper](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_William_Cooper&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170741035&usg=AOvVaw1MSeLTyzG94h8IwRbNrM9A) at his Eagar, Arizona, home on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and endangerment stemming from disputes with local residents. After an exchange of gunfire during which Cooper shoots one of the deputies in the head, Cooper is fatally shot. Federal authorities report that Cooper has spent years evading execution of a 1998 arrest warrant for tax evasion. According to a spokesman for the Marshals Service, he vowed that “he would not be taken alive.”

December — Peru sets up a new Air Force agency, the Departamento de Investigación de Fenómenos Aéreos Anómalos (DIFFA), tasked with studying UFO cases. It is founded and directed by Comandante Julio Chamorro because “these anomalous events had occurred frequently enough over national territory to create a danger, and we recognized that they needed to be taken seriously.” It is first publicly acknowledged in February 2003 by Col.

February 2 — 2:53 a.m. A witness is driving down a road in Clermont, Florida, when he sees a silent, bright light over Lake Minnehaha. The object passes over his car at about 15–20 feet in the air, and his engine dies. It shoots off like a slingshot and disappears. The car starts again. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 18)

February 20 — 8:15 a.m. A witness aboard a cruise ship off the southern coast of Puerto Rico sees an irregularly shaped object like a cloud high in the sky. He takes a photo, then leaves to attend a meeting. Analysis indicates that the object is most likely a Tethered Aerostat Radar System airship used to provide radar data in support of the US drug interdiction program. (John P. Timmerman and Mark Rodeghier, “Snapshot from a Cruise: An Aerostat Sighting,” IUR 28, no. 1 (Spring 2003): 13–14)

Summer — Two men see an object over Mosinee, Wisconsin, that shines a straight, 5-foot-wide beam of light on the Wisconsin River like a searchlight. The beam does not change shape as the object goes higher above the water. (Carl W. Feindt, “Beam of Light into a Body of Water,” IUR 33, no. 3 (December 2010): 23.)

July 26 — 1:00–1:55 a.m. Near Andrews AFB, Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C., independent witnesses 8 miles apart become aware of unusual and persistent aircraft activity. In both locations, witnesses see odd lights or objects pursued by one military jet. Two pairs of fighters take off from Andrews at 1:00 a.m., remain airborne for 50 minutes, fly at low altitude using afterburners over residential areas, and pursue an unidentifiable light on three occasions. Gary Dillman, working late shift at a sand-and-gravel operation in Brandywine, Maryland, sees the first two fighters at 1:00 a.m., then at 1:30 a.m. and 1:40 a.m. he sees a glowing, round, hard-edged orange object that one of the fighters is chasing. The pursuit takes place between broken clouds at about 4,000 feet and a light overcast at about 6,000 feet; the unknown object and fighter are about 1–2 miles away. In Waldorf, Maryland, around 1:35 a.m. Renny Rogers feels the walls of his home rattling from a low-flying aircraft and goes out to see a single jet fighter. At 1:40 a.m., he sees a bright, pale-bluish light in the north-northeast moving at a high rate of speed. He calls a neighbor to come watch the display. Soon a fighter comes over his house in obvious pursuit of the light and about 1,000–2,000 feet behind it. The four fighters return to base around 1:50 a.m. (Kenny Young,

October 18 — A fall of angel hair covers a large area of Alessandria, Italy, including roofs, cars, and trees. A sample is recovered and examined by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Richerche in Parma and shows “unequivocally” that the filaments are not organic, but similar to synthetic polymer textile fibers. They have a clear alternation of bright and dark segments. The Agenzia Regionale per la Protezione Ambientale in Turin disputes the finding and proclaims the material spider web. (Brian Boldman, “Angel Hair Physical Analyses: A Review,” JUFOS 9 (2006): 108)

October 23 — 7:40 p.m. Pilot Thomas J. Preziose takes off from Mobile, Alabama, in a Cessna 208B single-engine cargo plane en route to Montgomery. Six minutes later, he collides with an unknown object at 3,000 feet and descends uncontrolled into swampy water in the Big Bateau Bay in Spanish Fort, Alabama. The pilot’s final words are: “Night Ship 282, I needed to deviate, I needed to deviate.” A strange red residue (“transfer marks”) is found coating at least 14 different areas of the downed airplane that are widely separated in location both inside and outside the aircraft. The engine block has been split. The final NTSB report indicates that the accident is caused by pilot disorientation. However, an independent investigation finds numerous discrepancies with regard to both the FAA documentation and the NTSB investigation. The composition of the red residue is variously found to be tere- and isophthalate polymer with possible presence of inorganic silicate compounds; and epoxy material with some inorganic silicate filters.

January 31 — 10:30 p.m. Two witnesses in Villeneuve, Alberta, watch a large white object described as “two saucers rim to rim” move slowly through a farmyard and over some houses, then out of sight. (Mark Rodeghier, “UFOs in Canada, 2003,” IUR 28, no. 3 (Fall 2003): 13)

February 8 — 1:00 a.m. Carlos Eduardo Montilho wakes up in his home in Guará I, Brasilia, Brazil, to tend to his dog in the backyard. An intense white light comes down about 23 feet in front of him that is attached to an oval object abut 10 feet in diameter.

He retreats to the kitchen, where they both watch the object for 3 minutes before it rises slowly and disappears. The dog is asleep the entire time. (Brazil 400–402)

February 12 — 9:02 p.m. A dark triangular object with some sort of structured undercarriage is seen flying over Vancouver, British Columbia. It is in view for 3 minutes by two witnesses. (Mark Rodeghier, “UFOs in Canada, 2003,” IUR 28, no. 3 (Fall 2003): 13)

April — 2:30 a.m. Some Air Force security policemen for Area 2, a weapons storage area of the Nevada Test Site \[now the Nevada National Security Site\], are having a meal outside when they notice a red glow at their feet. The light is coming from a giant sphere perhaps 100 feet across approaching them from the south. By the time they notice it, the reddish-orange object has passed silently overhead at about 75 feet altitude in a few seconds. Apparently, it projects a zone of silence and exerts a zone of pressure directly below it, causing the guards’ ears to pop. It disappears over some mountains to the north, where it apparently explodes in a burst of white light with no sound or shockwave. Building in intensity, the explosion keeps growing until it is painful to perceive through closed eyes, then quickly dies down. The light effects last for 5 seconds. The security controller orders all outside units to search for the downed object. They look until 7:00 a.m. but find nothing. (Nukes 512–515)

June — The Turkish press announces that Turkey’s National Intelligence Service has received a top-secret request from the US Central Intelligence Agency for details on all its latest UFO reports. The Service accordingly asks the

Turkish Air Force, Turkish Airlines, and other agencies to submit reports. It recommends that the Air Force should establish an investigative agency headed by a colonel.

June 5 — 4:45 p.m. Shortly after TAM Flight 3287 takes off from Palmas–Brigadeiro Lysias Rodrigues Airport in Palmas, Brazil, to Brasilia, air traffic control asks the pilot if he can see any other aircraft near his plane. He cannot, but ground control says there is another object in his flight area. When they are over Palmas, the copilot sees a gigantic object on the right side of the plane. It is metallic and surrounded by bright multicolored lights. It flies as if it is sliding with no friction. The UFO follows the aircraft for almost an hour before moving away.

August 11 — 6:00 p.m. Diana Luca and her mother are chatting at the kitchen table in her home in New Westminster, British Columbia. Out of the corner of her eye, Luca spots a black object behind the trees in the back alley. The two step out on the patio for a better look and see a UFO flying behind the trees and over the top of the shorter ones. The object, flat and shaped like a Frisbee, flips on its underside, which is as red and shiny as a Coke can. She calls her husband, Mark Murphy, who is inside. By the time he gets to the porch, the UFO looks cigar-shaped and is an estimated 1.8 miles away. Murphy rushes inside to get a camcorder and gets the rest of the sighting on tape.

It is being followed in for landing on Runway 10 by a British Midland Airbus A330- 200 at a distance of 6 miles. Both are at an altitude of 3,000 feet and moving at 287 mph. As the 737 approaches Slane, the A330 crew observes unidentified traffic take off vertically from a field. The object has bright strobe lights and is triangular in shape. It begins to circle the 737, which experiences a power drain. The A330 sees a purplish glow surround the 737, whose captain requests a course change to avoid the object, which is passing in front of the airliner. The UFO angles to the port side and the 737 experiences a huge wake turbulence and an increase in outside air temperature to 327° F. for about 15 seconds. The A330 also feels the turbulence, and the UFO heads southeast at great speed. When the 737 lands, the crew cannot raise the speed brakes on the wings, which are found to be damaged, as if dented by a hammer. There is also aircraft skin damage and hydraulic damage to the brakes caused by the UFO wake.

January 4 — 10:30 p.m. Another Airbus 330-200 is approaching the east coast of Ireland, bound for Dublin Airport, when the crew sees a flashing strobe light over Slane, County Meath. As the aircraft throttles back to 265 mph at 2,500 feet, the UFO takes on a triangular shape, passes in front of the plane, and gives off a bright flashing light. The UFO begins circling the Airbus in an aggressive manner. The crew expects a collision with the object, which is about 360 feet wide. The interior lights dim (power drain) and the encounter continues for 8–10 minutes as passengers watch. At one point, wake turbulence from the UFO triggers the wind shear warning device. Other aircraft in the vicinity are watching the encounter and listening in to radio transmissions. Just 2 minutes before landing, the UFO shoots away to the southeast.

January 17 — 7:45 p.m. A witness at Bass River, New Brunswick, sees a bright, fast-moving fireball. Around 11:00 p.m., a couple near Saint-Louis-de-Kent, New Brunswick, watch two flashing lights low in the west. They descend rapidly then fly in front of the witnesses at tremendous speed. They then stop and settle above some trees on the eastern horizon and disappear. A man in Caraquet is looking south and sees two objects, one on top of the other, flying west to east. They take 5 minutes to cross the sky but do not look like airplanes. In Moncton, another witness sees a single light moving steadily and rapidly across the ocean toward the east. In Saint Paul, another witness sees two lights heading toward the northwest, They make no sound, rotate around each other, hover, then leave at high speed.

January 21 — A man is driving on the Trans-Canada Highway 10 miles north of Sussex, New Brunswick, when he sees a blinking light off to his left, apparently hovering above the road. As he approaches, he sees the object is composed of two bright white lights that seem to be attached to a structured object. It descends and hovers above a field. The witness can’t pull over, so the light is soon lost to view behind him. (Chris Rutkowski and Geoff Dittman, The Canadian UFO Report, Dundurn Press, 2006, p. 211)

January 22 — 9:00 p.m. S/Sgt Shawn Burke of the 86th Operations Support Squadron stationed at Ramstein Air Base outside Ramstein-Misenbach, Kaiserslautern, Germany, sees a row of seven lights directly overhead and glowing a bright white. When the clouds become thicker, the display disappears briefly, then reappears and become more elongated, looking more like lines than dots. Burke takes a few photos. They remain stationary all night. His cellphone and the internet in his building goes out when the lights get brighter. Possible light pillars.

January 25 — 6:26 p.m. A woman and her son watch a strange triangular object in the sky above Richibucto, New Brunswick. It has sparkling lights on top and a V shape on its underside. In a telescope, they can see it is a large gray object with something like a round door on the bottom. It suddenly speeds up and disappears in the distance.

January 27 — Night. Alec Birch, who has confessed to faking a UFO photo in 1962, takes a series of color slides showing the town hall in Retford, Nottinghamshire, England, for a photography competition. He sees nothing unusual at the time, but on examining one transparency he finds an image that appears to be an elliptical UFO. Ruling out lens flares and aircraft, he contacts the Ministry of Defence, which sends the slide to the Defence Geographic and Imagery Intelligence Agency for analysis. The agency reports back to the MoD on August 2, saying that no definite conclusions can be reached, but “it may be coincidental that the illuminated plane of the object passes through the centre of the frame, indicating a possible lens anomaly, \[for example\] a droplet of moisture.” (UFOFiles2, [pp. 147–148](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/the-ufo-files-the-inside-story-of-real-life-sightings-david-clarke/page/n239/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170798169&usg=AOvVaw3Y2nANZqqU7fuFwzo06p1k))

February 20 — 2:00 p.m. Lt. Ribeiro of the Brazilian Air Force is retuning on a flight from São Paulo to Recife, Brazil.

He is ordered to intercept a radar return that he can visually confirm as a yellow light. During the interception, the light remains stationary. Suddenly it begins moving toward the aircraft and gets very close. The pilot can only see a sphere of light coming closer, so he maneuvers sharply to the right. At this point his plane is illuminated by a beam of light. Seconds later everything is back to normal and the object is gone. (Clark III 206; Brazil 553–554)

August — The National Institute for Discovery Science releases a report, “NIDS Investigations of the Flying Triangle Enigma,” with analyses of triangle-shaped UFOs in the US, Belgium, and elsewhere. (“NIDS Investigations of the Flying Triangle Enigma,” August 2004)

August 21 — Three red lights hovering in a triangular formation are seen by several witnesses in Tinley Park and Oak Forest, Illinois. Further observations take place on October 31, 2004; October 1, 2005; and once again on October 31, 2006. The lights are captured on video by some witnesses. The video evidence suggests that the lights keep the geometrical shape and move as if they are attached to each other through a dark object.

October 28 — Night. An Iranian Air Force F-14 is on combat air patrol near the heavy water reactor near Khondab, Iran, when it picks up an unidentified target at a distance of 50 miles away that is making rapid changes in altitude, heading, and speed. The pilot is ordered to bank toward the target after regional command receives a visual confirmation from an Arak Air Defense Group observer. Approaching at 22,000 feet, the pilot spots the target at 5,000 feet. The object is spherical and has a green halo surrounding it and a green light on its tail end. When the pilot turns toward the light, it disappears then reappears a few miles away, apparently moving at a speed of Mach 7 or greater. The F-14 is ordered to turn all lights off and descend to pursue the target. At 7,800 feet the target disappears again, but after the F-14 makes a turn at 7,000 feet, it picks up the target again and flies 2,000 feet below it. The F-14 arms its weapons and the pilot requests clearance to engage the object. Every time the radar officer attempts to lock on the object, the radio, radar, and other instruments become jammed. Finally, the F-14

ascends to 19,000 feet because it is low on fuel and spots the object one last time at low altitude. The pilot returns to the 8th Predator Tactical Fighter Base in Isfahan.

He is startled by their slow speed of

120 mph but receives confirmation of their presence from radar operators on other vessels. Regular observations are made of a similar number of objects over the following six days.

November 14 — 9:30 a.m. Navy Commander David Fravor and pilot Jim Slaight, flying two McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets over the California coast on a routine training mission, are diverted from their exercise to investigate some unusual radar contacts detected by the cruiser [USS](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Princeton_(CG-59)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170814331&usg=AOvVaw3jAdJZJBZZH1L2FsLCfEjv) [Princeton](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Princeton_(CG-59)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170814635&usg=AOvVaw1w9yFPh_QgrjEX3s8E99u9) that is part of the [USS](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170814977&usg=AOvVaw1zUp6-5amnfwma1l0mynzf) [Nimitz](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170815273&usg=AOvVaw3yTf_pe0GfE7djHUuV--KE) Carrier Strike Group. They observe a 40-foot-long wingless craft flying at incredible speeds in an erratic pattern. Controllers on one of the Navy ships report objects that are dropping out of the sky from 80,000 feet and going “straight back up.” As they are looking for the object that appears on the radar, Fravor spots a white disturbance in the water and a white object (nicknamed “Tic-Tac”) moving in random directions. The planes fly lower to investigate the object, which seems to be about 40 feet long and then starts to mirror their movements before accelerating at high speed and disappearing. Fravor and another pilot, Alex Dietrich, say in an interview that a total of four people (two pilots and two weapons systems officers in the back seats of the two airplanes) witness the object for about 5 minutes. The disturbance in the water vanishes. Soon the same or a similar object reappears at their rendezvous point 60 miles away, but by the time they arrive it has disappeared. Another plane launched from the USS Nimitz has its radar jammed and is able to pick up the object on an infrared channel. Two objects emerge from the

bottom of the blip, which takes off and goes off the right side of the screen. The speed of the object, which has no exhaust trail, is stunning. However, the Navy claims it “never obtained an accurate” radar track of the objects reported by Fravor; they are quickly dropped by the Princeton’s radar when the computer categorizes them as “false targets.” After the return of the first team to USS Nimitz, a second F-18 team, led by Chad Underwood, takes off at approximately 12:00 noon, this time equipped with an advanced infrared camera (FLIR pod). This camera records an evasive unidentified aerial system on video. Underwood says “he never had visual, only seeing the object via FLIR.” David Fravor says that the radar operator on the USS Princeton briefed him that they had been tracking radar targets for two weeks. The footage is publicly released by the Pentagon in 2017. This footage is known as the 2004 USS Nimitz [FLIR1 video](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlWLZgnmRDs4&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170816645&usg=AOvVaw3VXk93SYMBJPmCmY-VjLJC)[.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlWLZgnmRDs4&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170816949&usg=AOvVaw0UBxOPRZOd990IEtSKxrEN) It officially sheds some light on a decade-old story that had been largely unknown and unreported, aside from a 2015 secondhand story on FighterSweep.com that, in spite of providing many details, remained unconfirmed at that time. Jonathan Axelrod \[possibly Naval officer John F. Stratton\], investigating the case in 2009 for BAASS, concludes tat the object “was no known aircraft or air vehicle currently in the inventory of the United States or any foreign nation,” and that it remained “stationary with little or no variation in altitude transitioning to horizontal and/or vertical velocities far greater than any known aerial vehicle with little or no visible signature.” Analysis of the FLIR footage by Mick West of Metabunk claims that the impressive sudden departure is an illusion; the object does not actually move except when the aircraft’s own infrared camera moves.

January 1 — The UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 comes into full force. Around 120,000 requests are made in the first year. Private citizens make 60% of them, with businesses and journalists accounting for 20% and 10% respectively. However, requests from journalists tend to be more complex and consequently more expensive.

UFOs are one of the three most popular FOI requests made to the Ministry of Defence.

His father had told him in 1959 when he was 12 that the American military had been experimenting in 1947 with monkeys and pigs being dropped in devices equipped with retrorockets from stratospheric balloons to test them for eventual space rocket research. In one of these experiments, which were conducted at night, they used live 2–3 humans with a hydrocephalic condition (enlarged heads caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid) whom they obtained from a facility. The retrorockets failed, the balloon crashed, and a rancher found the material and one of the humans who was still alive. A medical retrieval team came for it. The UFO cover story for this crash near Roswell, New Mexico, was concocted to keep the experiments secret.

January 31 — 10:00 p.m. Two men ice fishing at Columbia City, Indiana, encounter a large triangle above the east end of the pond. It crosses the frozen water at a low altitude, then hovers for some seconds before rising silently upward, leaving a trail of steam from the surface of the ice. The men try to call the local sheriff, but their cellphones are dead, as is their electrical fish locater. After the object disappears, they find a two-inch hole in the ice where the object had hovered. (Jenny Randles, “UFOcal Points,” Fortean Times 196 (June 2005): 28)

January 31 — 12:00 midnight. A large oval mass is seen floating above a cornfield at Wood River, Nebraska, by a man leaving his parents’ house. It rocks slightly from side to side for some 10 minutes and then sends out bursts of light toward the ground before climbing upward, seeming to suck up an object, apparently a large cow, from the field below.

February 7 — 2:00 a.m. In the farming area of El Paraiso, Mar del Plata, Argentina, a resident hears a noise like a strong wind or turbine and sees two misty yellow lights drifting above a copse of trees and climbing slowly. Other witnesses hear and see the phenomena, and others are wakened by their farm animals going crazy and dogs howling as if in pain. At dawn, two circular marks are found near the copse. Police forensic experts take samples of an ash-like deposit that leaves a greasy smear when touched. Meanwhile, the daughter of one of the locals involved is having nightmares about a UFO trying to catch her. (Jenny Randles, “UFOcal Points,” Fortean Times 196 (June 2005): 28)

May 1 — Night. A biotechnologist and his daughter are driving on the Central Oregon Highway about 50 miles southeast of Bend, Oregon. They notice three bright blue objects zigzagging around each other about 300 feet away above a field. Suddenly two of the lights move toward them and through their vehicle. One passes through the windshield and passes through a window. The second passes through the man’s left arm and upper body, exiting his right arm. He feels a bit hazy, but notices the light is spherical and about the size of a softball. Still driving, the man feels nauseous and scared. The next 45 minutes into Bend seems like 3 hours. Days later, he develops a red rash on the left side of his face and loses some hair on that side. His ankles swell, and he loses some sight and hearing on the left. In the next few weeks, he gains about 50 pounds (although exercising and dieting) and sleeps a lot. In February 2007 he is diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in his left chest, a pre-cancerous condition, and undergoes surgery in May, his health gradualy improving by the end of 2008.

May 3 — 5:30 a.m. A witness sees strange red and white lights crossing the flight path into Dulles International Airport in Virginia, west of Washington, D.C. (Jenny Randles, “UFOcal Points,” Fortean Times 199 (September 2005): 26)

May 4 — 10:00 a.m. Angler John Walker sees an object the size of a house, shaped like a large gray bullet, in the sky above Squeaking Point, Tasmania. He estimates its height at 150 feet. It moves extremely slowly, taking 15 minutes to cross his view. (Jenny Randles, “UFOcal Points,” Fortean Times 199 (September 2005): 26)

May 8 — Night. A witness captures video footage of pulsating, kaleidoscopic lights over the Denbigh Moors near Llannefydd, North Wales. The lights had appeared for several nights and remained visible for a lengthy amount of time. (Jenny Randles, “UFOcal Points,” Fortean Times 199 (September 2005): 26)

May 9 — 9:30 p.m. A man getting into his car in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, spots a huge, pulsating mass overhead, shaped like a double cross, and brilliantly studded with red, green, and white lights. It stays visible for a long time. The witness goes to bed at 1:20 a.m., and the object, or a similar one, is still visible. (Jenny Randles, “UFOcal Points,” Fortean Times 199 (September 2005): 26)

May 9 — 11:25 p.m. A woman outside her house in Kuujjuaq, Quebec, watches multi-colored lights heading northeast at a slow pace and low altitude. (Jenny Randles, “UFOcal Points,” Fortean Times 199 (September 2005): 26)

May 11 — 11:28 a.m. Radar trackers spot a plane entering the Air Defense Identification Zone around Washington, D.C. As the aircraft bears down on Washington from the north and officials cannot contact the pilot, the White House’s internal threat level goes from yellow to orange and then to red within four minutes. Fighters are scrambled, and occupants and visitors to the Capitol, the Supreme Court, and the White House are sent scurrying for safety. The aircraft flies over the vice president’s residence and comes within moments of reaching the White House and close to being shot down. Officials say 35,000 people are evacuated from the Capitol and adjacent office complexes. An additional 200 are evacuated from the White House.

The airplane is a Cessna 150 piloted by two aviators flying with outdated maps from a rural Pennsylvania airstrip and they are lost. Authorities say the pilots are so clueless that when officials finally make radio contact and order the plane to divert at 12:06 p.m., the fliers refuse, asserting their right to proceed. The F-16s then fire four bright flares across the plane’s nose, and the two men realize the gravity of their situation.

He has interviewed elderly whistleblowers—a woman he calls the Black Widow, Al Barker, Bill Salter, and a retired military man he calls the Colonel. In 2001, the Black Widow claims to have worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, at which time elements

of the Usgovernment conducted high-altitude balloon tests with attached gondolas that contained live test subjects and sometimes dead bodies. These subjects were handicapped humans, possibly Japanese, including sufferers of progeria. She claims to know of 3 classified balloon flights in May–July 1947. The bodies were broiught to Oak Ridge under stringent security. In 2003, the Colonel states that Roswell and other crashes were a cover for research linked to high-altitude balloon experiments. He mentions crashes in May and July 1947 of two experiments with handicapped persons on board.

June 19 — 3:10 p.m. Three witnesses in Silverdale, Washington, see a black, rectangular object fly silently in a straight line and constant speed from south to north almost directly above the town. (“Sighting Report,” National UFO Reporting Center, June 20, 2005; Nukes 502–503)

June 28 — Early morning. Following reports of unidentified lights above Dublin Airport in Ireland, a UFO 30 feet wide and 10 feet high approaches dangerously close to a commercial aircraft flying at 3,000 feet. The plane experiences intense waves of heat and wake turbulence. A strobe light on the object induces dizziness and nausea; the copilot vomits a few times, but after a while both pilots feel strangely relaxed. After heading in the direction of Malahide, County Dublin, the UFO returns and continues further harassment, causing the aircraft to become uncontrollable for a few minutes. The pilot reports to London Air Traffic Control Centre: “Need assistance… We have a hostile craft and we have made dangerous maneuvers to avoid it.” London confirms the presence of unauthorized air traffic. Some RAF Tornados are scrambled and reach the aircraft 25 minutes later, but there is little they can do except escort the plane to a UK airport, accompanied by the UFO.

July 5 — 8:50 p.m. A woman is driving home from a fishing trip at Sargent, Texas, on FM2611 when her lights blink twice and the engine goes dead. She gets out of the car to check the battery cables, and sees a bright bluish glow lighting up a wooded area across the highway. The light gets brighter and moves upward through the trees. The outer edges of the light seem to vibrate or tremble slightly. The higher it goes the faster it gets until it disappears. The car starts right up afterward. (Herbert S.

Late July — 7:30 p.m. Just as an airliner is making its final approach to the Santa Rosa Airport, La Pampa province, Argentina, the airport control tower operator notices an unknown, luminous object moving slowly and parallel to the aircraft. The flight plan operator is alerted, and they both watch the UFO stop, emit a brilliant flash of blue- white light, move again, emit another flash, and vanish. The airliner crew does not see the UFO.

These tests reveal a propensity for false memories and magical ideation, making abductees more likely than average to imagine, be led by investigators, and integrate cultural scripts like the abduction story into memory. Clancy demonstrates that alien abduction stories give people meaning and a way to understand their own lives and circumstances. It also gives them a feeling that they are not alone in the universe.

November 1 — An anonymous email is received by Victor Martinez, who runs a discussion list for retired intelligence people who are interested in UFOs. This person, in return for anonymity, passes on a huge volume of information each month for the next three years, all of it extracts from an alleged original document—a top secret, 3,000-page report compiled by the Defence Intelligence Agency in the late 1970s. The major revelations are: There were two crash sites in New Mexico, one southwest of Corona, and the second at Pelona Peak, south of Datil. The Corona site was discovered a day later by an archaeological team, who reports the crash site to the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Department. One live entity (EBE 1) was found hiding behind a rock; it and some dead bodies were later transferred to Loa Alamos National Laboratory. Roswell Army Air Field took the craft and sent it on to Wright- Patterson AFB. The second site was not discovered until August 1949 by two ranchers. It took the sheriff several days to reach this crash site. He took photos, drove back to Datil, and notified Sandia Army Base, which recovered six bodies that were first sent to Sandia then to Los Alamos. The live entity established communication and supplied the name of his home planet, Serpo, in our constellation of Zeta Reticuli. It died in 1952 after being allowed to use a communication device in the crashed UFO to contact his home planet. An alien/US military meeting was set for April 1964 in Alamogordo, where the aliens (nicknamed Ebens) landed and retrieved their comrades’ bodies (which had been frozen). In 1965, the US had an exchange program with the aliens, where one entity was left behind and 12 trained Americans (10 men, 2 women) left for Serpo from the Nevada Test Site.

They were supposed to stay 10 years, but something went wrong. In 1978, seven men and one woman returned; two had died on Serpo, and four others decided to remain. Of the 8 that returned, all have since died, the last in 2002. A few months after the documents became known, a UK Ministry of Defence official nicknamed “Chapman” claims the events were not as described but that the document is real, as he had seen it in 1969 or 1970 in London. He claims is was a CIA document authored by [Alice Bradley Sheldon](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tiptree_Jr&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170853901&usg=AOvVaw3jWcmPNj0x_vIk53fDJB7v) (a science fiction author using the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. who worked for the CIA in 1952–1955) in response to Soviet disinformation in the 1960s about nuclear bombs in the US.

2006

2006 — The UFO Research Coalition (CUFOS, MUFON, Fund for UFO Research) launches an Abduction Monitoring Project (later changed to Ambient Monitoring Project), an effort to create a compact, multi-instrumental device to be placed in the homes of recurrent abductees to record magnetic, electrical, and atmospheric anomalies over an extended period. The goal is to compare any reported abduction experiences with the anomalies to see if they coincide. After considerable difficulty with the design and construction of these boxes through 2008, data are recorded from participating abductees. However, funding is not available for the analysis needed to reach any conclusions.

May 15 — The UK Defense Intelligence Staff releases (after a September 2005 Freedom of Information Act request by [David Clarke](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Clarke_(journalist)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170857950&usg=AOvVaw1OEXXFLqQrB6fekeDfrN8x) and Gary Anthony) a 400-page report on a secret UFO study, codenamed “Condign,” undertaken by DIS between 1997 and February 2000. Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Air Defence Region, written by former Marconi Electronic Systems scientist Ron Haddow, draws on approximately 10,000 sightings and reports that have been gathered by the DI55, a section of the Directorate of Scientific and Technical Intelligence (DSTI) within the Defence Intelligence Staff. The report concludes that UFOs have an observable presence that is “indisputable,” but also that no evidence has been found to suggest they are “hostile or under any type of control.” According to its authors, the majority of analyzed UFO sightings can be explained by the misidentification of common objects such as aircraft and balloons, while the remaining unexplainable reports are most likely the result of a supernormal meteorological phenomenon not fully understood by modern science. This phenomenon is referred to in the report as “Buoyant Plasma Formation,” akin to ball lightning, and it supposedly produces an unexplained energy field that creates the appearance of a Black Triangle by refracting light. The electromagnetic fields generated by plasma phenomena are also said to explain reports of close encounters due to inducing perceptual alterations or hallucinations in those affected. The Condign report suggests that further research into “novel military applications” of this plasma phenomenon is warranted, and that “the implications have already been briefed to the relevant MoD technology manager.” The report also notes that scientists in the former Soviet Union have identified the close connection between the ‘UFO phenomena’ and Plasma technologies,” and are “pursuing related techniques for potential military purposes.” The report describes people who believe themselves to have had close encounters as being convinced of what they said that they had seen or experienced, but also as not representing proof that such encounters are real. It attributes a number of cases to the “close proximity of plasma related fields” which it said can “adversely affect a vehicle or person.” (“[Unidentified Aerial Phenomena](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.uk-ufo.org/condign/condrep.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170858527&usg=AOvVaw2DhwGYQYDyo3tKXN87jUFm) [in the UK Air Defence Region (The Condign Report): Summary of Contents,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.uk-ufo.org/condign/condrep.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170858787&usg=AOvVaw0Hj9olGhXmed7rIH4_jyT3)” The Real UFO Project; UK Defense Intelligence Staff, [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Air Defence Region](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/396201-defe-24-2090-1/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170859048&usg=AOvVaw3pNV4ZTFbjxHNIIrgwEMum), released 2006; David Clarke and Gary Anthony, “The British MoD Study: Project Condign,” IUR 30, no. 4 (August 2006): 3–13, 29– 32; Kean, [pp. 173–175](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307716842/page/172/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170859477&usg=AOvVaw0SHV0Sgpz-2UAaEiedd1tZ); UFOFiles2, [pp. 149–155](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/the-ufo-files-the-inside-story-of-real-life-sightings-david-clarke/page/n243/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170859825&usg=AOvVaw3kfE5-qPsWL0dUd5rvQXv1))

May 16 — At least three green fireballs brighter than the moon but not as bright as the sun blaze over northeast Australia.

A farmer sees one with a blue tapering tail pass over the mountains of the Great Divide about 75 miles west of Brisbane, Queensland, then watch a phosphorescent green ball about 12 inches wide roll slowly down the side of a mountain, bouncing over a rock along the way. A commercial airline pilot landing in New Zealand sees a meteor breaking up into fragments that turn green as the bits descend in the direction of Australia. The timing of the fireballs suggests they might be debris from Comet 73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann 3, according to physicist [Stephen Hughes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/6363/stephen-hughes&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170860405&usg=AOvVaw3IiQpE2mJIN6ZCic-LaKUE) at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.

July 13 — 11:00 p.m. A woman camping on the beach at Wicie, Poland, sees several red and blue lights maneuvering within a glow about 10 feet above the water. Then she realizes that the glow surrounds a huge metallic saucer- shaped object with lights that are turning on alternately from left to right. Her cellphone is acting crazy and she thinks the sea is roaring louder than usual. The object scares her so much that she hides in the forest nearby. (Poland 125)

September 5 — Residents of Vladivostok, Primorsky Krai, Russia, see several types of UFOs maneuvering near the city. One looks like a radaint sphere with three parts. Other witnesses report four lights. A police officer sees an object with 10 yellow lights moving around in a circular motion and hovering above the Sea of Japan at an altitude of 1– 2 miles. Other smaller objects approach it, one of which explodes in a bright flare-up. The official explanation is that these are candle bombs used as aerial targets for Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter aircraft. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, pp. 117–118)

November 7 — 4:15 p.m. Federal authorities at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, receive a report that a group of 12 airport employees are witnessing a metallic, saucer-shaped craft hovering over Gate C-17. The object is first spotted by a ramp worker who is pushing back United Airlines Flight 446, which is departing Chicago for Charlotte, North Carolina. The employee apprises the crew of the object above their aircraft. It is believed that both the pilot and copilot also witness the object. Several independent witnesses outside of the airport also see the object. One describes a “blatant” disc-shaped craft hovering over the airport, which was “obviously not clouds.” According to this witness, nearby observers gasp as the object shoots through the clouds at high velocity, leaving a clear blue hole in the cloud layer. The hole reportedly seems to close itself shortly afterward. According to the Chicago Tribune’s [Jon Hilkevitch](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/jhilkevitch&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170865871&usg=AOvVaw23JyYukZcXtcgqWuWpo9Z5)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/jhilkevitch&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170866072&usg=AOvVaw2Z8av3REgW1mKpY4YQodyg) “The disc was visible for approximately five minutes and was seen by close to

a dozen United Airlines employees, ranging from pilots to supervisors, who heard chatter on the radio and raced out to view it.” So far, no photographic evidence of the UFO has surfaced, although Hilkevitch finds out that one of the pilots is in possession of a digital camera at the time of the sighting and may have photographed the event. NARCAP publishes a 155-page report and has called for a government inquiry and improved energy-sensing technologies: “Anytime an airborne object can hover for several minutes over a busy airport but not be registered on radar or seen visually from the control tower, \[it\] constitutes a potential threat to flight safety.” The FAA stance concludes that the sighting was caused by a weather phenomenon and that the agency would not be investigating the incident.

January 11 — China conducts an anti-satellite missile test in which a Chinese weather satellite, the FY-1C polar orbit satellite of the Fengyun series orbiting at an altitude of 537 miles, is destroyed by a kinetic kill vehicle traveling with a speed of 8 km/s in the opposite direction. It is launched with a multistage solid-fuel missile from Zichang Satellite Launch Center or nearby. It is the first known successful satellite intercept test since 1985.

January 12 — Afternoon. Amateur radio enthusiasts record the conversation of pilots in two USAF F-15C fighters on a training mission just north of RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, England. One fighter gets a radar lock on an unidentified target 17 miles in front of him. He breaks the lock and reacquires it to validate the target, which is moving slowly at 17,700 feet. Closing to 500 feet, the pilot sees a small, irregular object like a “black rock.” His wingman joins him and they make three additional passes as they track it on airborne radar.

April 23 — Afternoon. The passengers of Flight A-Line 544 depart Southampton, England, in a BN2a Mk3 Trislander aircraft at about 2:00 p.m. in fine weather with good visibility for miles around, though a haze layer is present at 2,000 feet, and a continuous cloud layer at 10,000 feet. They rise to an altitude of 4,000 feet and are cruising

on autopilot about 10 miles south of the Isle of Wight. Capt. Ray Bowyer notices, exactly in the direction

of Guernsey in the Channel Islands (southwest and 12 o’clock ahead) what appears to be a brilliant yellow lamp or light. He thinks that it might be an airplane or reflections from the ground, as Guernsey is immediately behind it. The reflection of the sun off a greenhouse is a possibility but the UFO persists for a couple of minutes. It is brilliant yellow, with a dark grey band enveloping it one third from the right, like a band around a cigar. Bowyer makes contact with Jersey ATC to check on traffic heading his way. Paul Kelly at Jersey ATC cannot see any traffic in that position, but he picks up a faint primary return radar signal. A passenger behind the captain confirms what Bowyer is seeing and points out a second UFO immediately behind the first: Bowyer estimates both lights to be “up to possibly a mile across.” Radar traces also seem to register the presence of two objects, which Bowyer believes to be correlated with the position and time of the sighting. The first object is presumed to have been near the Casquets, west of Alderney, and the second some miles north of Guernsey. A study by [David](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Clarke_(journalist)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170879022&usg=AOvVaw3YHLe_MWbdnxfxehFFJxYe) [Clarke](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Clarke_(journalist)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170879299&usg=AOvVaw1QsjEif5YXUFoNl2M_4bG_)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Clarke_(journalist)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170879512&usg=AOvVaw0DeUDc_7q3sp9_flC9L5tt) however, cannot establish a definite link, as the radar reflections of cargo or passenger ferries may have affected at least some of the readings. Bowyer disagrees with Clarke’s team on the supposed link between the radar traces and ferries and proposes that two solid airborne UFOs are working in unison that day.

October 30 — Afternoon. Pilot Marin Mitrică is flying a MiG-21 LanceR fighter on a training flight from Romanian Air Force 71st Base at Câmpia Turzii, Romania, when he is suddenly hit by an unknown object. The collision breaks the plastic window covering the cockpit, punches a hole in his helmet, and wounds his face. He reduces speed and descends from his altitude of 4 miles to avoid hypoxia and hypothermia. After landing, an examination of the flight recorder shows two small triangles approaching from the right. No traces of organic matter are found on the plane, ruling out birds, and there are no other civilian or military aircraft or balloons in the area.

January 8 — 6:10 p.m. Truck driver Harlan Cowan is traveling east toward Stephenville, Texas, when he sees two stationary lights directly ahead. They are as bright as welding arcs. They split apart and move rapidly away from each other to the north and south at a high rate of speed. At 6:15 p.m., private pilot Steve Allen and three other witnesses 5 miles southeast of Stephenville see four lights similar in intensity to burning magnesium. They come out of the northeast at a speed faster than a military jet. Allen thinks the lights are spread out over a one-mile area. They slow down and remain stationary northwest of his position, then they shift from 4 lights in a horizontal position to 7 lights in a vertical position, emit a white flame, and blink out. Over 30 more witnesses come forward to report odd lights until about 9:30 p.m. Some also see fighter jets chasing the light.

When she asks about military aircraft reported by witnesses, Lewis volunteers the information that there were no F-16s from his unit operating that night, and no other pilots had reported a UFO. On January 16, a FOIA request is sent to the Federal Aviation Administration for any radar data from sites around Stephenville. On January 23, the Air Force admits in a press release that there indeed were 10 F-16s performing training operations that night between 6:00 and 8:00.

Military bases unanimously respond with “we have found no records responsive to your request.” However, the FAA releases its raw radar information in mid-February. It is clear that the unknown lights are not related to F-16 activity, but there is intense Air Force activity that night. Ten F-16s and one AWACS jet make figure-8s over the area. Two F-16s from Oklahoma fly south to the Stephenville area. FAA radar returns also show a target four miles north of Allen’s sighting that moves at an apparent speed of 2,100 mph.

Another radar track begins at 6:51 p.m. An unknown object without a transponder signal is tracked with FAA radar for more than one hour. Two different radars (one at Fort Worth and another at Temple) make contact with the object 187 times as it covers a distance of 50 miles on a constant trajectory to the southeast.

April 22 — The last F-117 stealth fighter-bomber is retired and returned to Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. Although officially retired, the F-117 fleet remains intact and photos show the aircraft carefully mothballed. Some of the aircraft are flown periodically and have been spotted flying as recently as July 2019.

May — Scripps-Howard News Service and Ohio University conduct a telephone poll on UFOs and extraterrestrial life. 55.8% of respondents believe that the existence of intelligent life in space is either likely or somewhat likely, while 33.1% believe it is likely or somewhat likely that intelligent life has visited earth. Only 7.6% answer that they have had a UFO sighting. (Mark Rodeghier, “Influences on Opinion about ETI and UFOs,” IUR 32, no. 2 (December 2008): 19–24)

When skeptics are not arguing along those lines, they use a priori logic, which insists that if extraterrestrials exist, they would not behave or look as UFO witnesses describe. Another assertion is that spacecraft could never get to Earth, given the constraints of distance and speed. The authors argue that the problem is that the idea of real UFOs challenges anthropocentric norms, making it a taboo even to acknowledge a phenomenon that has been declared non-existent.

May 26 — New York Times staff reporter Sarah Lyall, based in the UK, selectively focuses on some of the silliest UFO documents released by the Ministry of Defence (letters written to the agency by citizens) and provides readers with standard ridicule and the biased approach traditionally associated with New York Times coverage. (Sarah Lyall, “[British UFO Shocker!

Event anomalies require a scientific investigation to be understood, documented, and incorporated into current or future knowledge. Experience anomalies are indifferent to truth narratives, supporting false ones just as readily; they embrace the notion of liminality, in which it is possible to enter a “realm between the daylight of science and reason and the dark night of dreams and superstition.” Clark expands on the concept in later books and articles.

August 18 — The Defense Intelligence Agency issues a small-business set-aside solicitation (HHM402-08-R-0211) for a company to handle its new Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP), with a due date of September 10. The solicitation states that the primary focus is on “breakthrough technologies and applications that create discontinuities in currently evolving technology trends.” (Skinwalkers 20–21, 42–43)

August 20 — 4:45 p.m. A military witness one mile outside Hrubieszów, Poland, watches a silvery isosceles triangle hovering and rotating around its axis in the west. He estimates it is 50 feet long on one side and less than 2 miles away. It flies over the area at an altitude of 330 feet. At one point it dims and literally vanishes in mid-air in a matter of seconds. (Poland 94–95)

September 16 — 10:30 p.m. A witness and his fiancée are driving north near Radomsko, Poland, when they see a black triangle with lights (apparently gas jets) at its corners slowly floating 500 feet above the road. Two of the lights are blinking and one is steady. The 30-foot-wide object has cubical protrusions on its side and a smooth bottom. It seems to be rotating at first and takes another pass over the highway at a higher altitude after doubling back. (Poland 93–94)

September 22 — A $10 million initial contract for the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) is awarded to Bigelow Aerospace, the only bidder on the August solicitation, by the Defense Intelligence Agency.

May 8 — 11:45 p.m. “Derek Jones” is alerted by his two dogs barking in his backyard in northern Georgia, where his 10- year-old son is camping out in a tent with a friend. He sees a large triangular object about 300 feet long with yellowish lights at each apex moving silently above him. There is a bluish-white light in the center. Behind the triangle are four small objects, two egg-shaped and two round, with bluish-white lights that change to greenish to white and back to bluish. The smaller objects dart up and down soundlessly and erratically. He attempts taking pictures of it with a camera and a videocamera, but the batteries fail in both devices. When he points a bright spotlight beam at the triangle, it responds immediately with a beam of intense bluish-white light about 2–3 feet in diameter that strikes him for about 3 seconds, causing a burning sensation. He runs back into the house, where he watches two of the smaller objects move away to the south-southwest while the other two shoot straight up. He goes to bed, but is awakened by low-flying helicopters at 2:00 a.m. Around 7:30 a.m., he is visited by two men who want to talk about his “sighting report.” They are driving a black sedan, produce no identification, one of them is armed, and they behave oddly as they interview him for 30–40 minutes. After he sees the same men in the black sedan a week later, he reports the license plate to BAASS, which tracks it to a Department of Homeland Security carpool. Jones experiences hair loss and general unwellness within 18 days of the incident. In October he develop lumps on his legs, groin, and back; they enlarge, multiply to 24, and become painful in February 2010.

One of the lumps is diagnosed as non-malignant lymphoma, but a BAASS-contracted physician suspects Jones has undergone about 300 grays of ionizing radiation. (Skinwalkers 99–105)

June 24 — 1:55 p.m. A package handler at Louisville International Airport in Kentucky sees a reflection in the sky from the south end of a runway. As it approaches, he sees it is a rotating object, first a cylinder, then a diamond shape. It moves over the runway in a straight line and at a steady speed about 1,500 feet high. The object stops at the end of the ramp and hovers for 30–40 seconds, then moves up into the clouds and disappears.

July — At the invitation of [Robert Bigelow](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bigelow&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170933939&usg=AOvVaw24ZMhAZv7RiKaVYEC37MnS)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bigelow&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170934187&usg=AOvVaw30azeJ0kvOR0oTu2N_hDqW) naval aerospace engineer Jonathan Axelrod \[possibly John F. Stratton\], Jim Costigan, and David Wilson arrive at the Skinwalker Ranch in Utah to deploy a wide variety of sensory equipment to detect and record anomalies. They experience an odd temperature drop, intense anxiety, and a menacing dark oval shape. After Axelrod returns home to suburban Virginia, paranormal phenomena plague his family, including a humanoid shape, phantom footsteps, blue orbs, and a wolf-like creature standing on two legs. (Skinwalkers 1–8)

July 5 — 9:20 p.m. Retired police officer Buck Scarsdale is sitting with his son Bo and girlfriend Joanna Fife on the porch of his ranch home in Lagol, Ventura County, California. They notice seven bright blue lights silently hovering several feet off the ground in the orchard about 500 feet away. They jump in a truck and drive slowly with the lights off toward the display. When they get there, the lights are gone. After returning to the house, they decide to drive back, this time with flashlights. After 10 minutes of searching on foot, they hear two loud clicks coming from some dense bushes, and three others clicks coming from different directions. They return to the house.

Buck’s brother Roger arrives at 10:30 p.m., and both of them return to the orchard. Just before 11:00 p.m., Roger sees a silver, gray, and blue flash as an oblong object disappears into an opening in the sky that closes quickly. On July 10, Buck, Bo, and Joanna see an intensely blue light at the northern end of the pasture. Buck and Roger approach it and watch a floating light 5 feet in diameter maneuvering for 5 minutes 900 feet away before it vanishes. Two teams of investigators sent by [Robert Bigelow](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bigelow&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170934917&usg=AOvVaw1FwQP2FuIqm0z0DPL1bUS9) also see lights and orbs the rest of the month, and their camera and video equipment behaves oddly.

August 21 — 9:40 p.m. Tomasz Skorupski sees a deep-black object in the shape of the letter M flying west to east 200 feet above the ground at 50 mph at Kowale Oleckie, Poland. He estimates it is 10 feet in length and 30 feet at the widest point. Seven dimly yellow lights are positioned on the craft, while the rest seems dark and obscures the stars on its flight path. (Poland 100)

September — 10:00 p.m. Jim Costigan, who had visited Skinwalker Ranch in Utah two months earlier, is walking his dog with his wife Laila in suburban Maryland when they see a blue, softball-sized light moving in their direction about 6 feet off the ground to the left. It accelerates and shoots between them, grazing Laila’s shoulder as it passes. Within seconds it is lost behind a house. The dog does not notice it. Laila becomes lethargic the next day and shows severe flu-like symptoms for the next few weeks. She is ultimately diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease of the thyroid.

November 25 — 12:15 a.m. A mental health professional in Port Jervis, New York, is driving home listening to Christmas CDs on the car’s player. Coming around a bend, he sees an object about one mile away. As he comes to the next turn, he slows down to 25 mph to get a better look, but by then he is surprised to see that it is almost on top of him. He stops the car on the side of the road, putting it in park with the engine running. The object is cigar-shaped and turning clockwise slowly as it approaches. It is moving slowly like a hot-air balloon. He hears a sound like a cat purring at a low frequency. The UFO passes overhead and his vehicle suffers a complete power failure. His cellphone is also dead. He opens the driver’s door and looks up, seeing lights on the bottom of the object, which immediately blink out. The car starts again spontaneously. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part 1,” IUR 33, no. 4 (May 2011): 20–21)

December 1 — The UK Ministry of Defence shuts down its UFO hotline and closes its UFO desk, ostensibly because it has produced “no defence benefit” and no evidence of extraterrestrial aliens in more than 50 years.

December 9 — Night. A large beam of light is seen and photographed for 10 minutes over all of northern Norway from Trøndelag in the south through all the counties further north, as well as parts of northern Sweden. The phenomenon consists of a blue beam of light with a grayish spiral emanating from one end of it. It moves from behind a mountain, stops in mid-air, and starts to spiral outwards. A similar, though less spectacular, event also occurred in Norway the month before. Both events have visual features of failed flights of Russian RSM-56 Bulava SLBM. The Russian Defense Ministry admits shortly afterward that such an event had taken place at the time on December 9.

July 7 — 8:40 p.m. A UFO is seen hovering above Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport near Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. An airliner preparing for descent first notices the object and notifies the tower. Within minutes, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) closes the airport down, grounding outbound flights and diverting inbound ones to other airports. Normal operations resume an hour later. Nearby residents take photos of the UFO. One daylight photo taken earlier in the afternoon shows an object with a clear, comet-like tail; another, taken after dusk shows a glowing object emitting golden light.

September 30 — The contract for the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program is extended until December 21, 2010, at no cost to the government. However, there is no congressional funding available for 2011. One of its most significant achievements is the development of a Data Warehouse that links 11 separate UFO databases and supporting documentation. The databases are the NIDS database airline and military pilot sightings, the USAF Blue Book database, UFOCAT, the MUFON Case Management System database, Project Colares, the Canadian government’s UFO releases, the UK government’s UFO releases, BAASS cases investigated, Skinwalker Ranch database, and a database of Skinwalker Ranch contagious health effects.

Each UFO case is assigned a credibility rating designed by [Jacques Vallée](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%25C3%25A9e&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170962146&usg=AOvVaw3L5V99NnlXKssdJtG1Q_ho)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%25C3%25A9e&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170962391&usg=AOvVaw1mHZkI58jpyO8OLecUQ55j) and the database configuration is based on a six-layer model developed by Vallée and [Eric W.

October 11 — 8:40 p.m. A man named Qiao sees two luminous objects, one small one and the other larger, over the Xincheng district of Taiyuan, Shaanxi, China. They keep circling in a regular pattern. Other luminous objects are reported above the Sanqianglu district. Soon the media hotlines are flooded with phone calls. Two luminous objects circling in the air are seen at 8:55 p.m. in the Xinhuajie district, at 9:01 p.m. near the Apparel Town area, and at 9:05 p.m. near the racetrack. When reporters arrive at the plaza of the Taiyuan Railway Station, they see a large, milky-white, luminous spot circling above the clouds with a diameter of at least 32 feet. The object first looks like a luminous spot produced by a searchlight against the clouds, but it has no obvious light beams. The object circles and moves up and down and from side to side until it disappears around 9:10 p.m. (“[Chinese UFO](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/ufo_extraterrestrials/2011/09/24/847.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170963205&usg=AOvVaw2wtKP6YCh4W5SD0FLbSocl) [Report Affirms Reality of Manipulative Extraterrestrial Abduction,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/ufo_extraterrestrials/2011/09/24/847.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890170963549&usg=AOvVaw1vYtspq8pzLJsTAvye4rNl)” Canadian Business Daily, September 24, 2011)

October 13 — 4:00 a.m. A village in the Qinling mountains of southern Shaanxi province, China, supposedly disappears overnight after witnesses contact news agencies to report UFOs in the area. Chinese troops allegedly cordon off the area with no explanation. A video circulates online, reportedly showing bright blue lights in the sky over the village. Subsequent reports deny a military presence in the area and attribute the story to rumor and misinformation.

October 23–24 — Air Force personnel at Francis E. Warren AFB near Cheyenne, Wyoming, report seeing an enormous cigar-shaped craft maneuvering high above its missile field. The UFO appears similar to an advertising blimp but has no passenger gondola or advertising on its hull. On the same day, the missile site temporarily loses its ability

to communicate with 50 of its Minuteman III nuclear missiles. The five Missile Alert Facilities affected, Alpha through Echo, are responsible for launching those ICBMs in time of war and comprise the 319th Strategic Missile Squadron. The Air Force then quickly acknowledges the problem, saying that a backup system could have launched the missiles if necessary and that the breakdown lasted only 59 minutes. But according to two missile technicians stationed at the base, the communications problem, while intermittent, lasts several hours. These confidential sources further report that the commander of the squadron sternly warns its members not to talk to journalists or researchers about “the things they may or may not have seen” in the sky near the missiles in recent months and threatens severe penalties for violating security.

March 11 — 2:46 p.m. A 9.0 Mw earthquake takes place with an epicenter near Honshu, Japan. Immediately after the earthquake, the electricity-producing Reactors 1, 2, and 3 at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Okuma, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions by inserting control rods in a safety procedure referred to as a SCRAM, which ends the reactors’ normal running conditions, by closing down the fission reaction in a controlled manner. Because the reactors are now unable to generate power to run their own coolant pumps, emergency diesel generators come online, as designed, to power electronics and coolant systems. These operate normally until a 46-foot tsunami sweeps over the plant’s seawall and destroys the generators for Reactors 1–5. Large amounts of water contaminated with radioactive isotopes are released into the Pacific Ocean during and after the disaster.

February 18 — 2:00 p.m. A father and son, both pilots, are in their propellor-driven Mooney Ovation II flying at 7,480 feet. Shortly after they cross the border of Virginia from Charlotte, North Carolina, they prepare to land in Richmond. Above Chase City, Virginia, the father unexpectedly sees a bright, glowing sphere about 30 feet in diameter flying alongside the aircraft. As the UFO begins to soar about 50 feet away from the right wing, the plane loses power. All of the electrical equipment (including the computer) suddenly turns off.

August 1–15 — Indian Army troops deployed along the Chinese border from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradash report as many as 100 UFO sightings. The 14th Corps, which is deployed in the Kargil and Leh districts and patrols the frontier with China, sends reports to Army headquarters about sightings by an Indo-Tibetan Border Police unit in the Thakung district near lake Pangong Tso in the Himalayas. The reports describe yellowish spheres that appear to lift off from the horizon on the Chinese side and slowly traverse the sky for 3–5 hours before disappearing. The Army uses a mobile ground-based radar unit and a spectrum analyzer to verify the identity of the UFOs, but they cannot track the spheres on radar. Officials insist the objects are not Chinese drones.

August 3 — Kathleen Marden reports on a survey of abductees in which 38% report seeing hybrids, usually in a large facility along with humans being examined. These respondents see short and tall gray humanoids along with a few mantis-like, reptilian, Nordic, and occasional rarer types. One surprise finding is that 40% suffer chronic fatigue syndrome or mononucleosis. They also report examinations focused on glandular tissue, especially the thymus, a gland that has been implicated in these illnesses.

January 4 — Night. Dogs belonging to Carlos Torres of Pine Bush, New York, become noisy and agitated. When he goes outside, he sees a huge rectangular object blocking out the stars and moving silently overhead. His young daughter is terrified. It takes 2 minutes to travel out of sight. (Randle, Levelland, 2021, p. 125)

January 8 — 4:00 a.m. Two policemen in a village near Nysa, Poland, notice distant lights that appear and reappear. At one point, they stop their patrol car to observe the light, which is changing shape and radiating a number of colored lights. The light approaches them and stops a half-mile away. Small points of light break off from its base, some returning into it and others disappearing in mid-air. The primary light then gives off a stroboscopic flash of light that illuminates a large area. The officers drive away, but the light follows them. They stop again at a parking lot and see that the light is coming from a domed disc emitting dazzling yellow lights. Three blue lights are on its base. They drive off again, but the object paces them at a distance of about one mile. Both officers experience strong anxiety during the sighting, and there is a possible element of missing time. (Poland 110–114)

January 12 — 8:20 p.m. A married couple pull out of their driveway in West Melbourne, Florida, to go out to dinner. As the couple drive west down their street, they see three bright lights in a row in the sky. They assume that the lights are Chinese lanterns, since they are all at or above the same elevation. As they draw closer, they realize that the lights form a single object. As the object turns, the lights are in a pyramidal shape (indicating rotation of the object that causes the three horizontal lights to appear like a pyramid). At the same time, the object bolts away at an incredible speed and disappears in a few seconds.

She looks through binoculars and sees that the lights are attached to an object with a cupola hovering about 650 feet above some houses in the area. It flies away to the east. (Poland 157)

March 19–20 — In the early hours of March 19, a couple living in a rural section of Warkworth, New Zealand, see a blue flash and hear a loud explosion that causes the building to shake. The next morning they find their telephone service is out and their fax machine’s circuitry is melted. Around midnight on March 20, the woman is watching TV while her husband has gone to bed. She hears a loud sound like jet engines thrusting and goes outside to see a large, black isosceles triangle about 800 feet away and 600 feet in the air, slowly rising among the treetops. It drifts sideways and gradually turns or pivots. The underside of the craft is flat and smooth, a pale pearly metallic color. It has three reddish-orange rings with black centers, one at each point of the triangle, which resemble hot glowing metal rather than actual lights. In the center of the underside is a white strobe light, rotating with a circular movement and casting an intermittent short beam of light. She watches it for 20 seconds as it moves above the house, tilts its nose upwards, and rises more quietly up the ridge-line behind the house, briefly pausing near a transmitter mast positioned on the top of the hill. From there it gains altitude rapidly and suddenly shoots away at phenomenal speed and disappears within seconds.

April 25 — 9:20 p.m. An unknown object flying at a low altitude passes directly above the Rafael Hernández Airport runway in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, causing the delayed departure of a commercial aircraft. No transponder signal or other communication from the object alerts the airport tower, creating a dangerous situation with departures and arrivals. The pilots of an airborne US Customs and Border Protection De Havilland Canada Dash 8 turboprop aircraft see a pinkish or reddish light over the ocean in their vicinity, so they film the object on infrared thermal video. The object is 3–5 feet in length and its speed varies from 40 to 120 mph. The 3-minute footage shows the flight of an object that crosses into northwestern Puerto Rico from the Atlantic Ocean, traverses the space over the airport twice, then returns to the Atlantic where it apparently submerges. Its speed through the water reaches a high of 95 mph.

June 27 — 12:20 p.m. An F/A-18F Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11, the “Red Rippers”), flying out of Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, has an encounter with an “aircraft \[that\] was white in color and approximately the size and shape of a drone or missile” in the W-72 warning area, a patch of airspace off the coast of Virginia and North Carolina. The jet’s crew visually acquires it as they see it “pass down the right side of their aircraft with approximately 200 feet of lateral separation” while flying at an altitude of 17,000 feet. It is climbing and has a visible exhaust trail. Neither the Super Hornet nor NAS Oceana records a radar track of the object.

July 15 — 10:00 p.m. A 60-year-old postal worker and his wife see a rectangular-shaped object maneuver through the sky and come within 100 feet of them in Bellingham, Washington. It executes precise turns that avoid electrical poles, wires, and streetlights. The object’s color changes from a glowing red to a dull gray as it performs a banking turn and comes to a standstill. The color change is not uniform because it begins at the top of the object and moves downward. The object appears about the size of a large SUV, and at its closest approach it is about palm-width in size at arm’s length. The wife sees it as tumbling along its central axis.

August 3 — 10:30–11:00 p.m. Witnesses in multiple points in Poland report three successive sightings of unidentified triangular objects. A woman in Lubliniec walking her dog sees a giant boomerang floating silently to the west only about 150 feet above her housing estate. It has dim symmetrical lights that are the same intensity as stars and is about 65 feet long. A young couple in Łosice watches a dark, triangular UFO with gray-violet colored lights.

An engineer in Dobrzykowice observes a high-altitude, delta-shaped formation of lights. (Poland 96–97)

August 14 — Night. An amateur astronomer in Lublin, Poland, is tracking an object in an orbital trajectory. Close-up, it resembles a rocket with a triangular contour, crimson-red color, and yellowish center. A smaller isosceles triangle seems to be embedded in it. (Poland 98)

August 18 — 7:00 p.m. A family that owns a dacha in Tyczyn, Poland, watches a wingless object with spear-shaped panels maneuvering slowly and silently above them. It has an apparently rotating blinking light and is making constant turns and ascents. (Poland 101–102)

August 20 — 9:45 p.m. Three vehicles pull over on Homer Watson Boulevard just west of Doon South Drive in Kitchener, Ontario, to observe a strange object that is crossing in front of them. The highway lighting makes it easy to see a spherical object 30 feet in diameter move very slowly across the freeway just above the utility poles. The object, only a few hundred feet from the stopped cars, is apparently solid with a glow that illuminates the trees as it passed by.

October 1 — The first-generation Air Force Satellite Surveillance System ceases operation. The main advantage of the system was its ability to provide uncued data on new objects as opposed to tracking objects based on existing information. However, the system was also said to be inherently inaccurate due to its dated design.

October 6 — 9:00 p.m. A father and daughter are traveling west on Highway 40 through Rabbit Ears Pass, Colorado, when the father notices two white lights in the distance. The dimmer of the two begins to descend erratically. It seems to wave back and forth, rather than just move straight down, as it disappears behind a stand of tall pine trees. Then the brighter light begins to grow as it approaches quickly. He tells his daughter to look up, and she immediately sees the object as it speeds toward them. The white light develops a red border that transitions into a solid red light. A very short bright green line also appears just below and to the immediate left of the solid red light. The object then slows and swerves to the north. When the object is positioned just to the left and in front of them, it drops in elevation and begins to pass slowly overhead. The father sees that the short green line is actually a long, flat, bright, rectangular strip. Both note how crisp and clear the green box angles are and how there is no glow, given the brightness of the green light. The father, who had previously worked with low-powered lasers, identifies the green color as exactly 532nm. They cannot see any reflections on the body or wings. The object slows almost to a hover as it passes above them. Once the object passes out of view to the rear, they are unable to see it again out the back window or in the rearview mirrors. They do not want to stop and get a better look. The father comments that he has never seen a solid object emit such a bright green light.

November 18 — 12:55 p.m. An F/A-18E Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 143 (VFA-143, the “Pukin Dogs”), flying out of Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, spots an object in the W-72 warning zone via radar off its nose at around 12,000 feet and a speed of approximately 0.1 Mach. “The aircraft had an approximately 5-foot wingspan and was colored white with no other distinguishable features,” according to the pilot, who is able to visually acquire the object and track it for one hour. The Navy concludes that this object is an unmanned aerial system (UAS), but that Commander, Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic and Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Virginia Capes (FASCFAC VACAPES), the latter of which is also identified here by its callsign “Giant Killer,” is not able to ascertain the operator.

November 19 — 6:20 p.m. Two witnesses, each with 30+ years experience as Army and Air Force aircraft maintenance technicians, see a huge triangular UFO that flies from north to south about 500 feet above them near Adel, Georgia. The surface of the object is not clear and has a rippling effect like “a heat mirage down the road on a hot summer’s day.” There are no anti-collision lights required for all aircraft. The object has a wingspan larger than a C-5A cargo plane and flies slowly at 12–17 mph with absolutely no noise.

Greenwald writes: “These GCHQ \[Government Communications Headquarters\] documents are the first to prove that a major western government is using some of the most controversial techniques to disseminate deception online and harm the reputations of targets.

March 26 — 4:30 p.m. An F/A-18E Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron 106 (VFA-106, the “Gladiators”), flying out of Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, detects a possible radar track at around 19,000 feet and with a speed of 0.1 Mach in the W-72 warning area. The pilot’s wingman does not have the object on radar and there is a debate about whether it might be a false track given high winds that are gusting at over 100 knots at 18,000 feet. “The unknown aircraft appeared to be small in size, approximately the size of a suitcase, and silver in color,” according to the report. The pilot is only able to pass within 1,000 feet of it and cannot identify it. After that pass, they lose sight of it and never regain visual contact. “I feel it may only be a matter of time before one of our F/A-18 aircraft has a mid-air collision with an unidentified UAS \[unmanned aerial system\],” the head of

VFA-106 comments. The report also says that “FACSFAC VACAPES has received multiple UAS sightings in the recent months,” but does not say how many of those sightings resulted in sending in hazard reports. The jets’ radar has been upgraded, allowing them to zero in on unidentified targets with infrared targeting cameras.

The crew initially detects two UADs on radar, one at 12,000 feet and another at 15,000 feet, both apparently stationary or near-stationary. They then confirm both of these objects using the jet’s Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) system.

July 31 — Gen. Ricardo Bermúdez, director of Chile’s official UFO agency, Comité de Estudios de Fenómenos Aéreos Anómalos, convenes a three-hour meeting at the offices of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) in Providencia of 19 experts from a wide range of disciplines to discuss whether UFOs pose a threat to aerial safety. Among those present are astronomers, psychologists, meteorologists, physicists, and representatives of the armed forces. All seem to accept the premise that UFOs, whatever they are, exist and are worthy of investigation. The DGAC chief of operations says that because many witnesses believe UFOs demonstrate intelligent behavior, it is

the government’s duty to look for the intention behind that intelligence. However, the group concludes that, despite some accidents attributed to UFOs around the world, they “do not present a threat or a danger to air operations.” (Leslie Kean, “[Chile Declares UFOs Pose No Threat to Aircraft,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chile-declares-ufos-pose-_b_5670136&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171036408&usg=AOvVaw0gLxVjvz1yPvJTERj9ip4o)” HuffPost, August 12, 2014; “[Capitulo 55 DGAC TV,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D8BHrr1-IG-g&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171036794&usg=AOvVaw3khPhj7gWnpM4kTTvfDDSw)” DGAC TV Institucional YouTube channel, August 7, 2014)

October 16 — The Swedish military reportedly intercepts a radio transmission in Russian on an emergency frequency, sparking a massive search for a Russian submarine thought to be stricken in Swedish waters, the largest Swedish mobilization since the Cold War. Further encrypted radio traffic from Kanholmsfjärden in the Stockholm archipelago, Sweden, and in Kaliningrad, Russia (home to the Russian Baltic fleet), is intercepted the next day. The search involves stealth ships, minesweepers, and helicopters, as well as hundreds of sailors, pilots, and divers. On the island of Korsö, Finland, a mysterious man dressed in black with a backpack is seen wading to shore and is later photographed wading off the nearby island of Sandön, Finland. (It later turns out that the man is a Stockholm pensioner named Ove who is doing some trout fishing.) At a press conference later in the month, the Swedish navy shows a photograph of an unidentified foreign vessel (although it later turns out to be a Swedish ship).

Five pilots from the VFA-11 “Red Rippers” fighter squadron report sighting UFOs “almost daily” while training for a deployment to the Persian Gulf. Three of those pilots have chosen to remain anonymous, while two, Lieut. Ryan Graves and Lieut. Danny Accoin, have given interviews and appeared on a History Channel program about UFOs. Radar contacts, infrared detections, and visual sightings by the pilots and weapon systems officers are reported for several months. According to Accoin, the objects have “no distinct wing, no distinct tail, no distinct exhaust plume.” One pilot describes something “like a sphere encasing a cube.” Another source confirms to “The War Zone” that the same description is given by several other pilots and that encounters are commonplace among multiple squadrons including the nearby E-2 Hawkeye squadrons from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. Accoin says that “multiple sensors \[are\] reading the exact same thing.” Graves states that the objects are showing up at 30,000 feet as well as sea level and can accelerate, slow down, and hit hypersonic speeds with maneuvers “beyond the physical limits of a human crew.” The pilots also report that the objects persist in the air for long periods of time and might “be out there all day.” When one of the sightings is made, “usually we’d just say, ‘we’re seeing one of those damn things again,’” Graves says. Once, an object almost collides with two jets, prompting the VFA-11 fighter squadron to submit a Notice to Airmen aviation flight safety report. According to the pilots, the squadron has speculated that the sightings could be a classified drone development program, but the near miss angers the pilots and convinces them that this is a safety issue and not a black project.

Within days of the presentation in Mexico City, a skeptical group uses a SmartDeBlur program to read the text of the placard, which reveals that the supposed alien is actually the mummified body of a two-year-old Native American child taken from the ruins of Montezuma Castle cliff dwelling in Camp Verde, Arizona, in 1894 by an S. L. Palmer and loaned to the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum in Mesa Verde, Colorado, where it had been on display for many years before it was returned to the Montezuma Museum in June 1947.

The alien hierarchy consists of insect-like entities as the leaders, tall Grays the skilled workers, short Grays the menial workers, and masses of hybrids—the end products of the abduction program. These hybrids begin as half-human/half-Gray entities and become progressively more human over four successive stages. The ultimate product is the human hybrid (“hubrid”), fully human in appearance, capable of integration into society. Hybrids have become deeply embedded on Earth, living in their own apartments, mingling with humans, working their way into positions of influence. Their growing numbers on earth advance the Change, the day when they and their alien masters supplant or absorb humankind.

February 3 — 7:00 p.m. A married couple is driving on Interstate 10 near Katy, Texas, when they look up through the sunroof and see three black dots that they at first think might be breaks in the cloud cover. Watching them while stopped at a traffic light, they see the dots are part of a vast, noiseless triangular object that emerges from the clouds. The witnesses think it is generating a kind of night fog low above the ground.

September 19 — 11:45 p.m. An Air Canada Express pilot flying to Vancouver, British Columbia, reports “3 red lights 3,000 feet above him and going slower” while at 25,000 feet over an uninhabited stretch of British Columbia’s rugged northern coast. Vancouver air traffic controllers report the incident 20 minutes later to the RCAF in Ontario as a “vital intelligence sighting.” The RCAF reviews radar data, but finds nothing near the plane. Within an hour, reports are faxed to the Canadian government’s transportation department and the RCAF’s secretive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Division in Winnipeg. There is no further follow-up.

October 27 — Two Georgia men are arrested on drug charges. They are reportedly plotting domestic terrorism based on conspiracy theories about HAARP. The Coffee County Sheriff’s Office says the men possess a “massive arsenal” that includes AR-15 rifles, Glock handguns, a Remington rifle, and thousands of rounds of ammunition.

According to police, the men want to destroy HAARP because they believe the facility manipulates the weather, controls minds, and even traps the souls of people. Police say the men confess that “God told them to go and blow this machine up that kept souls, so souls could be released.” (“[Georgia Men Plotted Attack on Alaska Aurora](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2016/11/01/2-men-arrested-in-georgia-planned-to-attack-alaska-aurora-research-facility-investigators-say/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171069600&usg=AOvVaw2endjvIfyh0tOvA_gBLS28) [Research Facility to ‘Release Souls,’ Detective Says,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2016/11/01/2-men-arrested-in-georgia-planned-to-attack-alaska-aurora-research-facility-investigators-say/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171070060&usg=AOvVaw28iCji-0rdBoNg4qhUfmt9)” Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News, November 1, 2016; “Suspected Terrorists Believe Research Facility Controls Minds, Traps Souls,” WALB, Albany, Georgia, November 1, 2016)

December 10 — 4:44 a.m. A married couple is driving near Windsor, Maine, when they observe a “large triangle-shaped object” in two pieces (“like a carpenter’s framing square”) in the northeast sky. The object has six flashing red lights and one turquoise light that goes out as they are watching. It shows a black surface that is about 300 feet long. When they get out of the car for a better look, the man grabs his wife’s phone to take photos and a video. He shoots 6–8 minutes of video, but when he views it, it shows only black. The object seems to move effortlessly like a boat coasting through the water—“slow enough to where we could make out some detail but fast enough to where it was out of sight within 10 minutes or so.” They both feel weird as they watch the object. The woman becomes nauseous and the man feels strangely “awestruck.” (MUFON case file)

In 2001, Redfern interviewed an elderly woman (the Black Widow) who had worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee from the mid-1940s to the early 1950s, who told him that just after World War II she had seen some 15 human “guinea pigs,” including Japanese prisoners and handicapped persons, who were involved in government experiments involving exposure to high altitudes in balloons. Through her testimony and that of other witnesses, Redfern concludes that the “aliens” found at the Roswell crash in New Mexico in 1947 were likely these humans deemed expendable by the US government, and that flying saucers and aliens were a convenient cover story. The experiments were inconclusive and the methods unethical, so all the records were destroyed. (Nick Redfern, The Roswell UFO Conspiracy: Exposing a Shocking and Sinister Secret, Lisa Hagen, 2017)

August — Reports begin to surface that US and Canadian diplomatic personnel in Havana, Cuba, have experienced unusual, unexplained health problems dating back to late 2016. The health problems typically have a sudden onset: The victim suddenly begins hearing strange grating noises that seem to come from a specific direction. Some of them experience it as a pressure or a vibration; or as a sensation comparable to driving a car with the window partly rolled down. The duration ranges from 20 seconds to 30 minutes, and always happens while the diplomats are either at home or in hotel rooms. Other people nearby, family members and guests in neighboring rooms, do not report hearing anything. Affected individuals describe symptoms such as hearing loss, memory loss, and nausea. Some US embassy individuals reportedly experience lasting health effects, including one unidentified diplomat who now needs a hearing aid. In October, the Associated Press releases what it says is a recording of the sound some embassy workers are hearing. Accusations are made that these are a result of attacks using unspecified technology, perhaps a sonic or ultrasonic weapon.

August 9 — 9:20 p.m. A couple are walking south along North Lake Shore Drive just north of Schiller Street in Chicago when they notice something large and dark flying toward them from the east and crossing ahead of them at an altitude of 20 feet or so. It sweeps upward over the trees in front of 1400 North Lake Shore Drive, then stops in mid-air after it reaches a height just below the top of the building. It hovers with a large pair of wings for about 5 seconds, then dives toward the ground. As the witnesses quicken their pace toward the building, the “winged being” descends in front of them, no more than 25 feet away, and hovers 5 feet above the sidewalk with its wings spread open. They can see its bright red eyes that vary in intensity. Several people on the other side of the street also see the being, which hovers for 10 seconds, pulls its wigs in close, and silently shoots up into the sky. The witnesses describe it as “human-like” with a small head that narrows at the top, two legs with long tapered feet, and no apparent arms. It is 5–6 feet in height and has wide wings that resemble the top wings of a butterfly. The sightings is the most recent of 29 reported in the Chicago area in the summer.

Cuban officials analyze air and soil samples and consider a range of toxic chemicals. They also examine the possibility that electromagnetic waves are to blame and even look into whether insects might be the culprits but find nothing they can link to the medical symptoms.

February — The Brazilian Ufologists Commission begins a new phase of its “UFOs: Freedom of Information Now” campaign called “We Have the Right to Know.” The campaign demands that the Brazilian Army, the Minas Gerais military police, and the fire brigade of Varginha release the secret files on the 1996 Varginha case.

February 1 — 6:10 p.m. An Airbus A321 pilot is descending from 10,000 feet into Manchester Airport, England, when he sees a grayish, thin-profiled object that passes by very close at the same altitude at great speed down the left side of the aircraft. His initial reaction is that he has seen an internal reflection, but the First Officer and another person have also seen it. None of them have a clear view because it is in the landing-light beam for a split second.

March — University of Pennsylvania researchers examine 21 affected diplomats from the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba, and the preliminary results are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The report “found no evidence of white matter tract abnormalities” in affected diplomats, beyond what might be seen in a control group of the same age and describe “a new syndrome in the diplomats that resembles persistent concussion.” While some diplomats recover swiftly, others have symptoms that last for months. The study concludes that “the diplomats appear to have sustained injury to widespread brain networks.” Some experts criticize the study, arguing that there is “no proof that any kind of energy source affected the diplomats, or even that an attack took place.” MRI scans and other tests taken by a chief neurologist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on an unspecified number of Canadian diplomats posted in Havana show evidence of brain damage that mirrors the injuries of some of their US counterparts.

October 26 — Harvard astronomer [Avi Loeb](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Loeb&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171150538&usg=AOvVaw2kR3rriyzwwoQ59sci4K6i) and his postdoctoral assistant Shmuel Bialy submit a paper exploring the possibility that the recently discovered interstellar object ʻOumuamua is an artificial thin solar sail accelerated by solar radiation pressure in an effort to help explain the object’s nongravitational acceleration. Other scientists state that the available evidence is insufficient to consider such a premise and that a tumbling solar sail would not be able to accelerate. In response, Loeb writes an article detailing six anomalous properties of ʻOumuamua that make it unusual, unlike any comets or asteroids seen before. A subsequent report on observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope sets a tight limit on cometary outgassing of any carbon-based molecules and indicates that ʻOumuamua is at least 10 times shinier than a typical comet. A detailed podcast produced by Rob Reid provides the full details about the differences between ʻOumuamua and known comets.

November 6 — Around midnight. The pilots of a US Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopter are preparing to take off from an airstrip about 40 miles northwest of Tucson, Arizona, when they spot three objects in a loose triangular formation in the sky at a low altitude. The copilot continues to follow the three objects with the aircraft’s multi- sensor imaging system, the Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor. As the three objects approach the foothills of nearby Picacho Peak, they suddenly appear to rotate around each other, as if revolving around an unseen axis, all while maintaining a steady eastward trajectory. Pilot Chris Lehto says they are moving at an unexpectedly high rate of speed. After several rotations, the objects then resume an obtuse triangular formation before speeding out of sight as the Apache begins to take off.

November 9 — 6:47 a.m. A British Airways 787 is flying eastward just off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, near the Dingle peninsula at 330 mph at an altitude of 39,000 feet. Two other aircraft, a Norwegian Airlines 737 in front of it and a Virgin VA 76 behind, are on the same flight path. The pilot of the British Airways plane notices a bright

light moving fast on the left and rapidly veers north. She asks Shannon Airport if there are military planes in the area. They tell the pilot no and that nothing is showing on their radar. The Virgin pilot has seen it and thinks it is a meteor or satellite re-entry. The Norwegian pilot has seen two bright lights. Shannon verifies that other aircraft have witnessed the event.

January 15 — 11:40 a.m. An RAF Typhoon pilot is leading a pair of fighters from Coningsby, England, to an exercise in the North Sea. After receiving clearance to climb to 30,000 feet from 15,000 feet, he notices an object at 11 o’clock about one nautical mile away, slightly higher and maintaining a constant altitude. The radar and data link show no traffic conflictions. The object reflects sunlight and appears to have a linear form. It passes down the left- hand side of the aircraft. The wingman independently sees the same object as it passes over the leader’s aircraft.

He maintains the formation at 15,000 feet until they are clear of the object. Nothing unusual is noticed by ground radar. (UK Airprox Board, “Assessment Summary Sheet for UKAB Meeting on 13th March 2019”; “UKAB ‘Unknown Object’ Log 2017–2020,” Fortean Times 406 (June 2021): 43)

June 23 — The catalog of space objects built by the US Space Surveillance Network lists 44,336 objects including 8,558 satellites launched into orbit since 1957. 17,480 of them are actively tracked while 1,335 are lost. The rest have re-entered Earth’s turbulent atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The SSN typically tracks space objects that are baseball size or larger. The Space Surveillance Network has numerous sensors that provide data. They are separated into three categories: dedicated sensors, collateral sensors and auxiliary sensors. Additionally sensors are classified as Near-Earth (NE) tracking (observing satellites, space debris, and other objects in lower orbits), or Deep Space (DS) tracking (generally for asteroids and comets). This global program consists of at least 29 distinct worldwide space surveillance systems, featuring the world’s most powerful radars (including the Solid State Phased Array Radar System), the DARPA Space Surveillance Telescope, the ground-based optical GEODSS space surveillance system (which detects “uncorrelated targets”), the Geosynchronous Space-Based Situational Awareness Program, and the Navy’s sea-based X-band radar system. The Combined Space Operations Center (formerly the Joint Space Operations Center) at Vandenberg Space Force Base and the Space Control Center at Cheyenne Mountain are both repositories of data from the SSN.

July — Subsequent findings by the University of Pennsylvania team find that, compared to a healthy control group, the US diplomats who report injury in the Havana, Cuba, embassy have experienced brain trauma; advanced MRI scans (specifically res-fMRI, multimodal MRI, and diffusion MRI) reveal “differences in whole brain white matter volume, regional gray and white matter volume, cerebellar microstructural integrity, and functional connectivity in the auditory and visuospatial subnetworks” but find no differences in executive functions. The study concludes that the US government personnel have been physically injured in a way consistent with the symptoms that they describe but express no conclusion on the cause or source of the injury. The New York Times reports: “Outside experts were divided on the study’s conclusions. Some saw important new evidence; others say it is merely a first step toward an explanation, and difficult to interpret given the small number of patients.” (Benedict Carey, “[Were U.S. Diplomats Attacked in Cuba?

The timeline also indicates that the bridge was able to see flashing red lights. At 8:50 p.m., the timeline notes a “UAS swarm.” By 9:11 p.m., the timeline notes that one of the objects is directly overhead at 2,000 feet. Just a minute later, all of the objects appear to change course and head away from the ship at 69 mph. However, eight minutes later, UASs are again seen behind the ship.

July 24 — 10:30 a.m. A new term is introduced to the USS Russell log: “ghostbusters.” A log entry reflects an apparently brief counter UAS exercise lasting about eight minutes. Though official references are hard to come by, “ghostbuster” is a term sometimes used to refer to lower-end counter UAS devices that look similar to rifles.

These anti-drone countermeasures are increasingly being used by security forces around the world. They operate

by using highly-directional radiofrequency jammers designed to disrupt communications between drones and their operators. One key limitation of these devices is that they can only disable drones that are directly controlled by a human operator. Autonomous systems are far more resilient against such countermeasures.

August 8 — An explosion at the State Central Navy Testing Range near Nyonoksa, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, triggers radiation levels to rise. According to official Russian sources, the explosion is the result of a failed test of an “isotope power source for a liquid-fueled rocket engine,” possibly a 9M730 Burevestnik cruise missile test or recovery.

October 17 — The To the Stars Academy announces it has entered into a cooperative research and development agreement with the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command. The five-year contract will focus on “inertial mass reduction, mechanical/structural meta materials, electromagnetic meta material wave guides, quantum physics, quantum communications, and beamed energy propulsion.” According to the US Army, no public funding will go the group, but at least $750,000 will be provided in support and resources for developing and testing To the Stars technologies. The contract states that To the Stars will provide samples in its possession of “metamaterials,” any data or “obtained vehicles” that use “beamed energy propulsion,” and any information or technology related to “active camouflage” for testing and analysis of potential application on Army ground vehicles.

According to two sources, after listening to the investigators lay out their evidence that suggests the Russian security services are behind the hits on Agency personnel, Haspel challenges them. She accuses the investigators of both hiding information from her and lying to her about what their inquiry has uncovered. The director questions the motives of those looking into the attacks. “This is why we need to clean out Russia House,” she says, referring to the CIA’s operations unit focused on Russia, according to two sources. “You’re just trying to stir up trouble on Russia.” A third source confirms that “the meeting did not go well.” (Julia Joffe, “[The Mystery of](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gq.com/story/cia-investigation-and-russian-microwave-attacks&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171239893&usg=AOvVaw2Ar4Jx7qX1bD0_-i8ihFkr) [the Immaculate Concussion,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gq.com/story/cia-investigation-and-russian-microwave-attacks&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171240190&usg=AOvVaw3A8eY4sJGt-Ft7GYKm2Kq_)” GQ, October 19, 2020; Ana Swanson, Edward Wong, and Julian E.

January 8 — Drones are now being seen in Castle Rock and Parker in Douglas County, Colorado, and Fort Collins in Larimer County. Kerry Garrison, a vice president at drone vendor Multicopter Warehouse in Centennial, claims the drone reports are actually sightings of Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX; although they are at orbital altitude, in a clear sky they can look lower than they really are. But Garrison also visited the eastern planes with other aviation experts to view the drones. He says he saw red lights go zipping by at 100 mph, faster than any drone. A close call with a drone and a Flight for Life helicopter near Fort Morgan, Colorado, prompts officials to add ground-based spotting teams and aircraft equipped to hunt drones. However, an investigation by Colorado Homeland Security later say the incident is unrelated to the drone activity.

March 19 — Night. A commercial Boeing 767 airliner is flying from Mexico City to Houston, Texas. At an approximate position somewhere west of Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico, the plane is flying north at 37,000 feet at 575 mph when the first officer, looking across to the left side of the cockpit, sees a yellowish-white light descend into view from above. He first thinks that it is a meteor and begins to say so when it suddenly stops at nearly the same altitude as the aircraft. The UFO then projects an illuminating beam of bright white light on the aircraft and appears to take a collision heading. The captain takes a defensive attitude and prepares for evasive measures, but the beam of light illuminating the aircraft ceases, and the UFO suddenly accelerates to the same speed and heading of the aircraft, maintains separation, and begins pacing. The captain estimates that the UFO maintains a distance of 1,000–2,000 feet, near the minimum allowable separation of 1,000 feet. The copilot describes the UFO as a “brilliant yellow white plasma object, teardrop shaped.” There are no navigation lights or other features associated with airplanes, and the light seems to have a tail. During the following 30 minutes, the crew observes and takes 8 photographs and four video segments of the UFO, one of which lasts 4:47. The video documents that the Airborne Collision Avoidance System SSR radar does not detect anything while the crew is actively observing the object. As the aircraft and its attendant UFO approaches the Mexico/US border, the light begins to flicker, changes colors from yellow-white to pinkish-purple, and turns on a perpendicular heading away from the aircraft and parallel to the border without crossing into the US.

May 28 — Postdoctoral researcher Darryl Seligman and astrophysicist Gregory Laughlin argue that the interstellar object ʻOumuamua could be a hydrogen iceberg generated by a giant molecular cloud. The hypothesis explains the object’s strange cigar shape, as cosmic radiation would chip away at its edges (in some directions more than others) that would produce an elongated shape. The fact that it sped up as it entered the Solar System can be explained because it is outgassing hydrogen increased by the solar flux.

July 16 — 5:00 a.m. Paul Froggatt sees a glowing orange sphere that follows him as he is cycling through the Oakwood and Blacklow Spinney Woods in Warwickshire, England. The usual early morning birdsong has gone silent.

Turning a bend, he encounters a 7-foot-tall, green-colored creature that stands on two legs and looks like a praying mantis. It has a triangular head and two large black eyes that stare at him. He thinks it is trying to transmit evil thoughts into his mind, so he speeds up and escapes it. (Nigel Watson, “M Is for Mantis and Missile,” Fortean Times 404 (April 2021): 22)

August — The National Academy of Sciences completes a report on Havana Syndrome, concluding that embassy personnel in Cuba, China, Russia, and other countries were most likely subjected to “directed, pulsed radiofrequency energy” in malicious attacks. A committee of 19 experts says that the immediate symptoms that patients reported—including strange sensations of pain, pressure, and sound that often appear to emanate from a

particular direction or occurred in a specific spot in a room—are more consistent with a directed “attack” of radiofrequency energy. The report does not point to a perpetrator, though it mentions “significant research in Russia/U.S.S.R.” on pulsed radiofrequency technology, as well as the exposure of military personnel in Eurasian communist countries to microwave radiation. The CDC concludes, “The evaluations conducted thus far have not identified a mechanism of injury, process of exposure, effective treatment, or mitigating factor for the unexplained cluster of symptoms experienced by those stationed in Havana.” The report is inexplicably withheld from congressional and public scrutiny after it is submitted.

Both pilot and First Officer suddenly see a bright light and an object that appears to be headed toward the aircraft, almost head on, slightly up and to the left. It appears without warning and gives them no time to act. After landing, the crew informs Air Traffic Control, who tells them that the West Yorkshire police helicopter had earlier seen “lanterns” in the area, but neither crew member thought that matched what they saw.

There is a sharp increase in March and April due to the launch of SpaceX satellite trains.

February 9 — 10:30 p.m. An unidentified drone with a green light on its underbody is spotted from the corner of East Ajo Way and South Palo Verde Road in Tucson, Arizona, directly adjacent to a fuel terminal just west of Davis- Monthan. It flies into controlled airspace surrounding the base and Tucson International Airport after the Tucson Police Department and US Customs and Border Protection helicopters began to pursue it. The law enforcement helicopters follow the drone northwest out of the city for nearl 45 minutes before losing it in the clouds around 14,000 feet.

April 15 — Tyler Rogoway of The War Zone summarizes the defense implications of drone and UAP interference with military aircraft, ships, and weapons systems, concluding that “at least one of our adversaries, and possibly two, have played our own cultural norms against us and have executed what may be among the most successful and ingenious intelligence-gathering plays of all time.

May — During a briefing prior to a planned US Air Force exercise, USAF personnel observe a slide presentation that explains what to do if they encounter a UAP. They are clearly instructed to complete the Air Force reporting form, which features shapes of several different types of UAP they could encounter (plasma-like balls, tic-tacs, discs). It also features specific questions, such as whether the UAP interferes with their radar operation. This is all new, the officer points out to researcher Robert Powell, something that would not have occurred 18 months previous. He finds the stigma associated with this subject in the Air Force has significantly changed.

June 25 — The US [Office of the Director of National Intelligence](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Director_of_National_Intelligence&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171291624&usg=AOvVaw0x3R8RbyeJfFtJrbc9b_xD) releases a summary 6-page report on UAPs, largely centering on evidence gathered in the last 20 years from US Navy reports. It claims that 143 of the 144 are unidentified, though none of the data is provided. (The full report, available only to those with proper security clearances, is released in a redacted version in March 2022.) The report comes to no conclusion about what the UAPs were, based on a lack of evidence, though in a limited number of incidents, UAP reportedly appear to exhibit unusual flight characteristics, including high velocity, breaking the sound barrier without producing a sonic boom, high maneuverability not able to be replicated otherwise, long duration flight, and an ability to submerge into the water. Some of the UAPs appear to move with no discernable means of propulsion, and it is noted that the alleged high speeds and maneuvers would normally destroy any craft. These observations could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or observer misperception, and require additional rigorous analysis. The report indicates that, in some cases, the UAP recordings are of physical objects and not false readings, as individual instances had been detected by different sensor mechanisms, including visual observation. The report also states that “UAP probably lack a single explanation,” and proposes five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an “Other” category. The report raises concerns that the UAPs could be a safety issue, with regard to a possible collision with US aircraft, and that they could pose a security threat if they are foreign craft gathering information about the US. The report indicates that investigation of the topic will continue, including development of reporting protocols. The report also indicates that, of the sightings reported, all except one (confirmed as a weather balloon) lack sufficient information to attribute a specific explanation or explanations.

January 19 — The CIA announces it has ruled out a sustained global campaign by a hostile power aimed at hundreds of US diplomats and spies as the cause of Havana Syndrome symptoms. In about two dozen cases, the agency cannot rule out foreign involvement, including many of the cases that originated at the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba, beginning in 2016. Another group of cases is considered unresolved. But in hundreds of other cases of possible symptoms, the agency has found plausible alternative explanations.

February 2 — An intelligence panel investigating the cause of Havana Syndrome says that some of the episodes could plausibly have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source, according to a partially declassified intelligence report. A panel of intelligence community experts drew up the report after analyzing over 1,000 documents and interviewing affected individuals. They determine the symptoms associated with the illness to be “genuine and compelling,” and note that while some cases can be attributed to known psychological or medical factors, others remain unexplained. The authors sought to determine the feasibility of five potential causal mechanisms, including “acoustic signals, chemical and biological agents, ionizing radiation, natural and environmental factors, and radiofrequency and other electromagnetic energy.” They assessed the potential of each of these mechanisms to account for cases that cannot be easily explained by other means. More specifically, they looked at cases involving a combination of four particularly puzzling “core

characteristics.” These include “the acute onset of… sound or pressure in only one ear or on one side of the head,”

as well as vertigo, “a strong sense of locality or directionality,” and an absence of any obvious environmental or medical causes for such symptoms. Ruling out the possibility that Havana syndrome could represent an underlying brain disorder, the authors state that “the combination of the four core characteristics is distinctly unusual and unreported elsewhere in the medical literature, and so far have not been associated with a specific neurological abnormality.” On the other hand, they conclude that “pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radiofrequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics,” although they do concede that such a theory is riddled with “information gaps.” Addressing the possibility that Havana syndrome could therefore be caused by a nefarious device, they go on to explain that devices do “exist that could generate the required stimulus, are concealable, and have moderate power requirements” that could produce the observed symptoms.

Bray testifies that their database of reports of UFOs now includes about 400 incidents, up from 143 assessed in a report released in 2021. He cites improved sensors, an increase in drones and other non-military unmanned aerial systems, and aerial clutter such as Mylar balloons as causes for the uptick. Incidents in the 2021 report date as far back as 2004 and are based on both sensor data and observations by military aviators. Bray says that “Navy and air force crews now have step- by-step procedures for reporting UAPs on their kneeboard, in the cockpit.” In a back-and-forth with Rep. [Brad](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Wenstrup&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171336716&usg=AOvVaw1o9qiH6IoKypPxszK82rOp) [Wenstrup](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Wenstrup&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171337083&usg=AOvVaw2e1AE1ia0eeEvQMx6zGdPZ) (R-Ohio), Bray agrees that standardizing the civilian reporting process will be useful. While the military database does include some civilian reports, the vast majority have come from within. Rep. [Adam Schiff](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890171337446&usg=AOvVaw0_mH8fLzlTbWbhZj76CrmM) (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, pushes for the Pentagon and the public to understand that UAPs are becoming a national security concern. At the hearing, officials play a declassified video clip showing a mysterious UAP that zipped by a pilot’s aircraft in a US Navy training yard. It appears to be a spherical object traveling at extremely high speeds. Bray says that he does not have an explanation for what this specific object is. Bray and Moultrie both say they will commit to declassifying more information when possible and when it does not pose a national security risk, adding the task force will operate with more transparency than past Pentagon programs.
