Late July — 4:30 p.m. Richard H. VanPelt and his teenage son are driving on Beeler Road south of Shawnee High School in Lima, Ohio, when they see a Saturn-shaped metallic object hovering above Breese Road 600 feet away. It is about 1,200–1,500 feet in the air and has a revolving ring around its center. It suddenly starts to move to the southwest, then tips on end and with tremendous speed goes straight up and out of sight. (Richard H. VanPelt, “[Letter,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cufos.org/CUFOS_Associate_Newsletter/1984-85_CUFOS_Associate_Newsletter_V5.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014543046&usg=AOvVaw3xVYKihgfUEIWwSMslDG5J)” CUFOS Associate Newsletter 5, no. 3 (June/July 1984): 2)

August — 7:00 p.m. Raimo Blomqvist is visiting with his parents at their summer cottage at Kallavesi lake, Finland, when he suddenly notices a strange, colorful ball of light coming from the sky. The light approaches and turns out to be an oval glowing object. While it is hovering above the shallow water of an island he sees something fall from the object and hears a sound resembling hot metal touching cold water. The object shoots straight upward. Blomqvist recovers a 2–2.5-inch piece of stone. In 1975, Blomqvist contacts UFO investigators and gives them the stone.

The fragment is x-ray analyzed at Åbo Akademi University in Turku, which states that it appears to be volcanic. Analysts at the University of Turku look at it with a mass spectrometer and conclude it is mostly iron, not a piece of ore, not volcanic, not a meteorite, and not machined, although it has been subjected to a temperature of around 650° C.

August 9 — 9:00 p.m. Baltazar Flores, Franciso Perez, Ruben Lozaya, and Elpidio Salas are camping near the Cerro Viejo, Sonora, Mexico, where they plan to explore for minerals. Suddenly a “dark, cloud-like object” approaches at high speed. As it passes by, the trees shake and they hear an explosion. They return the next day and less than 2 miles from their campsite they find a compact, gelatinous mass of green-turquoise color about 8 inches long.

When they poke it with a stick, the stick becomes covered with a sticky substance like chewing gun. They report the incident to the authorities, but no one is interested. One of the witnesses returns 3 days later and finds most of the mass gone, with some residue on the rocks and grass.

September 5 — 10:00 p.m. Donald Schrum and his friends are bow-and-arrow hunting in an isolated area of Placer County, California, near the Loch Leven Lakes in the vicinity of Cisco Grove. Schrum becomes separated from his companions. At sunset he decides to sleep in a tree for the night. Later he sees a white light zigzagging at low altitude and, thinking it is a helicopter, jumps out of the tree and lights fires to attract its attention. The light turns toward him and stops about 50–60 yards away. The object’s strange appearance frightens Schrum, so he climbs back up in the tree. After a while two humanoid beings and a robot-like creature approach the tree. From then on, Schrum is in a state of siege as the beings try to dislodge him from the tree. At one point a white vapor emanates from the robot’s mouth and Schrum blacks out, but wakes up again, nauseous, and begins lighting matches and throwing them down to frighten the beings away; they back away. Finally, he shoots an arrow at the robot; when it hits, there is an arc flash and the robot is knocked backwards. This is repeated two more times, and the humanoids scatter each time. A second robot appears and a vapor renders Schrum unconscious. When he awakes, he discovers that the two humanoids are climbing up the tree toward him, so he shakes the tree and throws things down at them to ward them off. The same actions are repeated all night. Near dawn, more beings approach and “large volumes of smoke” drift up and he blacks out. He awakes hanging from his belt, and the creatures are gone. Later, when reunited with his companions, Schrum finds that one of the other hunters, who also have gotten lost and separated from their camp, saw the UFO.

September 15 — 8:27 a.m. USAF Lt. Robert Jacobs is officer-in-charge of photo-optical instrumentation for the 1369th Photographic Squadron at Vandenberg AFB \[now Vandenberg Space Force Base\] near Lompoc, California. His crew films an SM-65F Atlas missile launch where a UFO allegedly causes the ICBM’s warhead to malfunction over Big Sur, California. At the time of the filming, apparently no one knows anything about a UFO sighting. But the next morning, Jacobs is ordered to report to the office of Maj. [Florenz J. Mansmann](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/123924772/florenz-john-mansmann&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014556296&usg=AOvVaw2fL-YSXSJvrQnmxICWzFWB), First Strategic Aerospace Division, his commanding officer, where he is shown the film and told to forget it ever happened. Kingston George, the project engineer for the experiments and who probably never saw the film, “identified” the object as “nothing to do with UFOs” in an article in the Skeptical Enquirer. Before Mansmann’s death, and 40 years after the actual event, the major confirms the UFO incident in writing. The controversy centers on the opinions of some researchers who suggest that the telescope imaging system is not adequate enough to produce the results described by Jacobs and Mannsman. However, several other researchers have shown that, with the viewing conditions at the height of the equipment used, and the imaging systems operating at that shoot, the incident could have occurred as described.

The caretaker and another employee run into a cabin to get their wives. The four watch for a while longer, then flash another SOS. The light approaches again, then retreats, dims, and takes off.

The ship relays a message to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station \[now José Aponte de la Torre Airport\] in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, which then contacts Lt. Cmdr. K. H. Woodsbury, pilot of an F-8C aircraft of Utility Squadron Eight that is already flying in the neighborhood at an altitude of 30,000 feet. The aircraft reports a stranger closing in very fast. The pilot describes the object as delta-shaped and about the size of a fighter. Its color is black or gray and it has no contrail or lights except for a light source emitting from the tail during periods of acceleration. The pilot pursues the object but cannot intercept. The target accelerates out of sight in a wide starboard turn climbing through 50,000 feet at about an 18°–20° angle in excess of Mach 1. Woodsbury says: “Its speed, acceleration, ceiling and ability to decelerate exceed any aircraft I have ever seen or heard of. There is no reasonable explanation for this target.” During the encounter the SPS-49 radar is jammed for a short period of time. Other radar encounters take place in the Caribbean November 16–18 and 24. (NICAP, “[U.S.S.

November 25 — 12:45 a.m. A 29-year-old woman sees two lighted objects land on a hilltop near New Berlin, New York. Through binoculars she can see some 9–11 humanoid beings apparently engaged in repair work on a round object with landing struts for four hours. Some of them are holding boxes filled with unusual gadgets.

December 21 — 5:00 p.m. Driving east on US Highway 250, Horace Burns is approaching Fishersville, Virginia, when an enormous object appears from the north and descends slowly in a gradual slant. Just before it crosses the highway 200 feet in front of him, the UFO narrowly misses power lines. It is so huge that when it passes nearly in front of him, it fills his entire windshield. The UFO comes down gently and lands in a field to Burns’s right. Meanwhile, Burns’s car engine has shut off. The object appears to be at least 125 feet in diameter and 80–90 feet high. After 60–90 seconds, it rises up several hundred feet, makes a sound like rushing air, and shoots off to the northeast, vanishing from sight. A high level of radioactivity is detected at the site December 30 by investigators German professor [Ernest G.

Collins is tasked with finding the balloon visually and using radar. In the air, he realizes it is a wild goose chase because, flying at 2,200 mph, even if he sees the balloon briefly it would be behind him in a second. He identifies an object on radar 350 miles away. He circles it as closely as he can, which is a circle with a radius of 400 miles.

1965 — A short color film of a “huge, windowed, hovering craft” with three smaller objects attached to it “as a kind of tail” is taken by a converted RAAF aircraft during a photo-mapping flight over central Australia. A door on the large object opens—two vertical panels and two horizontally aligned panels slide apart—and the three smaller objects fly inside. A US Air Force sergeant with a top-secret clearance is shown this clip at a CIA screening in Texas in 1967. He says the filmed image of the UFO is extraordinarily clear, filling the entire screen.

January 12 — 10:58 a.m. The Kiwi Transient Nuclear Test is conducted at Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site as part of Project NERVA. The nuclear rocket engine code-named Kiwi is allowed to overheat until it bursts, sending fuel hurtling skyward. Deadly radioactive fuel chunks as large as 148 pounds shoot up into the sky and last as far away as a quarter mile. A radioactive cloud rises up to 2,600 feet, then drifts out over Los Angeles, California, and out to sea. The AEC calls it a “safety test,” but the USSR says it violates the test ban.

They watch it for 2 minutes. (Harold H. Deneault Jr., “UFOs Return to Washington,” Fate 18, no. 7 (July 1965): 48)

January 12 — 8:20 p.m. A Mrs. Jubert in Custer, Washington, sees through her window what seems to be the landing lights of an airplane apparently coming into her yard. She herds her three teenage girls outside in the opposite direction. The four lights merge into one intense white light, which moves in a straight line toward the house, lifts several hundred feet and clears a clump of evergreens, then dips down on the far side and touches the ground. A border patrol officer also sees the object after he is alerted by radio. He is buzzed by the UFO, which is low enough that he stops his car, gets out, and watches it move out of sight. Where the object lands in 16 inches of snow, they find a large circular imprint about 10–12 feet in diameter. The ground beneath the melted snow ring shows evidence of having been scorched. Oval-shaped tracks 8 inches long and 8 inches apart, in a single file, are found leading from the landing site to the evergreens, where they disappear. One month later, the circular area still shows traces.

He loses control of the car and pulls to the side of the road and then hears a loud humming sound like a high- frequency electrical whine. He opens the car door, steps out, and sees a bright light below the cloud cover at around 2,000–5,000 feet altitude. It seems to hover for a moment and then takes off to the south.

The smaller one, 20 feet across, descends quickly and silently and lands 45–55 feet away from Blackburn. A door opens, making a slight noise and revealing an interior light. Three figures, each 3 feet tall and wearing tight-fitting metallic-looking suits, emerge. They have reddish-orange skin and piercing eyes. One has an extra-long finger on its left hand.

January 25 — Night. Policeman Woody Darnall, his family, and several neighbors see a glowing object hovering on a mountainside near Marion, Virginia. It seems to explode and take off in a shower of sparks.

January 26 — Evening. Steven Houffer, 16, and six friends are driving on US Highway 250 near Brands Flats, Virginia, when they see a small man walking toward the road from a field. He sits down and peers intently at passing cars. Houffer stops the car and he and his friends get out. When they approach, the being runs up a hill. Two other entities appear and run in the same direction. They are all about 3.5 feet tall, wear silvery one-piece garments, and leave no footprints. Police officers conduct a search with local photographer Charles Weaver, but find nothing.

Some time later, Houffer and Weaver see a “glowing aluminum barn,” which they go down to investigate. Weaver is walking around inside when something hits him on the head. The two turn to run after Weaver snaps a photo. In the light of the flashbulb, they see a little man standing by the barn. The photo is allegedly confiscated by government agents. A local man, Donald Cash, 6 feet tall, confesses to dressing up in overalls to pose as an alien, although his story does not completely match the details of the account.

January 27 — 6:00 p.m. NASA research engineer A. G. Crimmins Jr. observes an object at Plum Tree Island Wildlife Refuge, near Poquoson, Virginia, that is approximately 75 feet across and 10–15 feet in height. The object has 3– 7 lights colored red and orange and appears to rotate. It moves approximately a quarter mile west of its original position on a zigzag course and then appears to land on the ocean shore. It remains still for about 5 minutes, then takes off to the north and turns right to depart to the east at a high rate of speed. Crimmins watches it through 20x binoculars. The same object is apparently seen by retired USAF Maj. John R. Nayadley, another NASA research engineer, who observes a V-shaped object with blinking red-orange lights over Hampton, Virginia.

It hovers, then shoots straight up about 500 feet, fades, drops down, and hovers again. Then it drops toward the water and disappears. The Coast Guard finds nothing.

February 27 — The first conference of Australian UFO organizations takes place in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It is arranged by W. Howard Sloane of the Ballarat Astronomical Society to share information and remove some of the stigma of UFO research. The conference is held at the Ballarat Municipal Observatory in Mount Pleasant.

Representatives of the Perth UFO Research Group, the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society, the UFO Investigation Centre NSW, and the Flying Saucer Research Society of South Australia are in attendance.

Witnesses include Rev.

G. Roberts, senior research scientist at the Operational Research Office, Department of Air. Roberts says that the RAAF has determined that 90% of reports are explainable, but that only those that might be a threat to national security are worth investigating and “there are no documents, files, or dossiers held by the Department which prove the existence of ‘flying saucers.’” The researchers quiz him on the 1953 Drury photographic case, but Roberts is unaware of that one. Jones insists on keeping an open mind about reports like those by Gill and Brew.

March 2 — 1:55 p.m. John F. Reeves, 65, retired, while walking in the woods east of Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida, sees a bluish-green and reddish-purple object 20–30 feet in diameter, 6 feet thick, saucer-shaped, and with an outer rim and a stairway, two 2-foot windows on top, landed on the ground on four 4-foot legs about 2,000 feet away. He approaches to 100 feet. After watching the object for 10 minutes, he sees a robot-like being about 200– 300 feet away, about 5 feet tall, wearing a gray-silver uniform, glass dome headgear, wide-spaced eyes, and pointed chin. It walks to 15 feet away from Reeves, stares at him for 1.5 minutes, points a box or 6–7-inch black object at Reeves that emits a flash 3 times, then walks back to the landed vehicle and climbs in. The object has

Ground Equipment Facility QRC\] in Ricketts Glen State Park near Red Rock, Pennsylvania, when they see a small, saucer-shaped object land nearby. As they approach it, a beam of light comes out and strikes both of them. That is the last thing they remember, and they fail to report to the command post. Their equipment is left behind at the antenna, but air police cannot locate the men. Pennsylvania State Police assist in a search of the area. About 16 hours later, a state trooper locates the two men walking along State Route 487 south of Lopez, about 10 miles away. They seem dazed, so they are taken to a hospital in Williamsport, where they are found to be dehydrated and confused. No alcohol or drugs are found. They are then taken to an Air Force hospital at Stewart AFB \[now Stewart Air National Guard Base\] in Orange County, New York. Trace amounts of alpha radiation are found on their clothing and strange marks are on their necks. AFOSI special agents interview them, but the men cannot remember anything. After 2 weeks in the hospital, they are released back to their unit.

March 15 — Around 1:00 a.m. James W. Flynn is deep in the Everglades in his swamp buggy, somewhere east of Immokalee, Florida, with his four hunting dogs. He sees a hovering object like an upside-down cone about 200 feet above some cypress trees slightly over a mile away. It moves back and forth from its original position.

Through binoculars it looks 25 feet high and 50 feet in diameter, with square windows emitting a yellowish glow. Around its base an orange-red glow extends downwards and illuminates the ground some 75 feet around the rim. Some 40 minutes into the sighting, Flynn decides to approach it in his buggy. A high-pitched ringing sound bothers one of his dogs. He stops 600 feet away and walks, waving his arms, toward the UFO, which is hovering 4 feet off the ground. A blast of wind from the object nearly knocks him off his feet. He continues, and at 75 feet from the UFO he waves his arms again. The object beams a light like a “welder’s torch” that hits his forehead. He blacks out twice. When he wakes up he is temporarily blinded. In the morning he finds a symmetrical circle of burned ground. The tops of trees are burned. Flynn makes his way to the home of Henry Osceola (or Henry Billy) later in the day and arrives at his own home in East Fort Myers on March 17 and spends 5 days in the hospital with damage to his right eye, bruises, burns, deep muscle tissue damage, and loss of hearing. His eye damage is permanent. The landing marks and burned trees are verified by the Lee County sheriff’s office.

March 18 (or 21) — 7:06 p.m. Capt. Yoshiharu Inaba is flying a TOA Airlines Convair 240 from Osaka to Hiroshima, Japan, at an altitude of 6,500 feet. Just after the aircraft passes Himeji, Hyogo, an elliptical luminous object appears and follows the plane. Inaba makes a 60° turn to avoid a collision, but the object makes a similar maneuver then follows along the plane’s left wing for about 56 miles. Emitting a greenish light, the object affects the automatic direction finder and the radio. As copilot Tetsu Majima radios the Matsuyama control tower, he hears frantic calls from Joji Negishi, the pilot of a Tokyo Airlines Piper Apache, who says he is being chased by a luminous object over Matsuyama. The object shoots away and disappears.

It stops nearby and a door opens. Three beings appear and beckon to him. He approaches the saucer. Two of the three beings appear to be nonhuman, but the third seems to be a youth in his teens. The youth speaks with an accent that Bryant thinks might be Russian and calls himself Yamski. He says that he is from Venus, and then remarks that he wished “Des” was there, as he would understand what is happening. At the close of their conversation, he says that in a month he will return and bring proof of “Mantell.” Ufologists who eventually hear the story immediately associate Yamski with [George Adamski](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Adamski&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014617522&usg=AOvVaw1nSzZOjOUa0lCwn7hwkBCD)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Adamski&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014617703&usg=AOvVaw3gpnVsmbwUIL1iIchNyv5S) the controversial contactee who died on April 23.

According to Bryant, the saucer returns June 7 and leaves some items, including several pieces of metal, allegedly from an F-51. He reports the story to the British UFO Research Association, which launches an investigation. The various items Bryant turns over to the two investigators (a turbine fitting, metal parts, a broken bulb and fitting, a phial containing silver sand, and a piece of paper on which the words “Adelphos Adelpho” are written) prove to be mundane and irrelevant to the F-51, according to aeronautical engineer [Leonard](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?99973&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014618684&usg=AOvVaw1Ud5lPAToeuTh2zMoT4Y7_)

Shortly afterward, Bryant unexpectedly takes ill and dies from a brain tumor on June 24, 1967. The other investigator, Norman Oliver, visits his widow. She says that she is familiar with the story in the book, as her husband had presented it to her first as the script for a science fiction novel. It is only after the investigation is well along that she realizes her husband was trying to sell the story as a real event. She indicates that the supposed items related to Mantell were purchased at a naval surplus store. Alice Wells, head of the Adamski Foundation, dismisses the Scoriton story from the beginning, as does Desmond Leslie. Between their rejection and Oliver’s uncovering of the hoax, few remain to support Bryant except Buckle.

May 6 — 9:10 a.m. The crew of a US Navy ship in the Philippine Sea notices an aircraft approaching. At 9:14 a.m., the SPS-6C air search radar detects four targets at ranges up to 22 miles for the next 6 minutes at extremely high speed (3,500 mph), making various maneuvers. As seen through binoculars, they appear as three lighted objects, one of 1st stellar magnitude the others 2nd magnitude. The objects hover directly over the ship for 3 minutes.

There is no IFF response. One object to starboard appears larger on radar. The objects depart to the southeast at extremely high speed.

May 24 — 12:05 a.m. John Burgess, James Tilse, and Eric Judin are playing cards at the Epsom Retreat Hotel near Epsom, Queensland, when their attention is drawn to something on or near the ground. It appears to be a disc- shaped object with banks of lights underneath it to their southeast. Tilse estimates its diameter to be 30 feet, Judin as 20 feet, and Burgess as 6 feet. In the moonlight, its color seems to be charcoal. At times, it seems to approach them, then recede. Finally, it rapidly rises to about 300 feet, then it accelerates away to the northeast. Burgess and Judin heard a buzzing sound. Total duration is 40 minutes. Two days later, a circular depression is found nearby close to a telephone line.

May 28 — 3:25 a.m. An Ansett-ANA DC-6b airliner piloted by Capt. John Barker is flying over Bougainville Reef off the coast of Queensland, Australia, when it is paced for 10–15 minutes by an oblate UFO with exhaust gases coming from it. The copilot and a stewardess also see the object. Barker takes photos of the UFO, but when he lands in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, he is not allowed to have the film processed until he returns to Australia.

When he eventually arrives in Brisbane, he is flown directly to Canberra where both the film and the flight recorder are confiscated. The Directorate of Air Force Intelligence in Canberra later denies that any such incident took place. However, an official statement by Barker to the RAAF surfaces, in which he says: “I had always scoffed at these reports, but I saw it. We all saw it. It was under intelligent control, and it was certainly no known aircraft.” (Good Above, [pp. 168–170](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/168/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014625465&usg=AOvVaw3qSrJn4HQchlLzOKq23tNJ))

June 19 — 4:00 a.m. Two farm boys are stacking hay near Rocky, Oklahoma, when a bright white, circular, wingless craft appears and descends at a 45° angle to the height of nearby telephone wires. The apparent size of the full moon, it moves horizontally across the farmyard. It has numerous lights around the outside and appears to be rotating in a counterclockwise direction. Their dogs start barking at it. They believe it is going to crash, so they run back into the barn after 3 minutes. It is last seen over a small silo. (J.

June 25 — The Phoebus 1A nuclear rocket engine is tested at Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site as part of Project Rover. It runs at full power for 10.5 minutes. Unfortunately, the intense radiation environment causes one of the capacitance gauges to produce erroneous readings. When confronted by one gauge that says the hydrogen propellant tank is nearly empty, and another that says it is a quarter full, and unsure which is correct, the technicians in the control room choose to believe the one that says it is a quarter full. But the tank is indeed nearly empty, and the propellant runs dry. Without liquid hydrogen to cool it, the engine, operating at 2,000° C., quickly overheats and explodes. About a fifth of the fuel is ejected and most of the rest melts. The whole decontamination effort takes 400 people two months to complete, and costs $50,000.

July — 11:30 p.m.–midnight. Talking on the phone in her second-floor bedroom in Lake Forest, Illinois, Pat Harvey sees a flash and hears a commotion or “rustle” outside. When she finishes the conversation, she looks out the window toward her neighbor’s lawn and sees a transparent bubble of light about 100 feet away. Inside the globe are several individuals who look like normal human beings, though slightly shorter (5 feet tall) and with skin that looks tanned. They are lying down in a somewhat haphazard arrangement. There are no visible instruments or seats. The object bobs up and down slightly, and the beings’ arms are moving in a way that reminds Harvey of “rowing motions.” (Clark III 277; Patrick Gross, [URECAT](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/ce3/1965-07-usa-lakeforest.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014635669&usg=AOvVaw2vl7OBZWxmxHvg7BsPv7lY)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/ce3/1965-07-usa-lakeforest.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014635891&usg=AOvVaw21R7YLXPvZfiXGShknpJdz) June 21, 2008)

July 1 — 5:45 a.m. Maurice Masse is farming just north of Valensole, Alps-de-Haute-Provence, France, when he is startled by a whistling sound and sees an elliptical object resting on four legs some 200 feet away from him in his lavender field. Squatting on the ground near the object are two figures about the size of 8-year-old boys, apparently looking at a lavender plant. Masse approaches them to about 20 feet and the figures stand up. They are dressed in gray-green overalls and have smooth, pumpkin-like heads. Their eyes are large and slanted, their mouths have no lips and look like little holes. He hears some grunting sounds, and Masse hints that there is a telepathic communication. One of the figures points a pencil-like object at Masse and he is paralyzed. They enter the UFO through a door and the object shoots off at enormous speed with a whistling sound. It takes Masse another 20 minutes to regain control. Tracks left by the landing gear are found later by Masse and confirmed by gendarmes.

Finally, it disappears to the northwest, decreasing in size and gaining altitude. Cpl. Uladislao Duran Martinez takes 10 color photos through theodolite and field glasses.

July 6 — 6:52 p.m. Chief Mate Torgrim Lien of the Norwegian ship TT Jawesta watches a star-like UFO through binoculars in the North Atlantic Ocean about 900 miles southwest of the Azores. He, the captain, and other officers see an intense blue, fiery tongue of light approaching the ship at tremendous speed. As it gets closer, he sees it is a cigar-shaped UFO with a row of square windows.

July 9 — 4:30 p.m. A white cylindrical object is seen flying over Santa Maria Island in the Azores islands, Portugal. All electric clocks at the Santa Maria Airport stop when the object passes overhead. Weather personnel and other witnesses all agree that the UFO is at an altitude of 24,000–30,000 feet. At no time does it make any sound.

According to witnesses, the clocks stop at the same time the UFO reaches the zenith directly over the airport. Attempts to identify it are unsuccessful.

July 9 — 10:00 p.m. Connie Wolferd and other residents of Bunker Hill, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, watch a clam- shaped object, about 10 feet in diameter, with red lights around its rim hover above some nearby trees. Wolferd is sitting on the porch listening to the radio when it suddenly stops functioning. The living room lights flicker (although fluorescent lights in the kitchen and bathroom do not), and a neighbor’s loud TV suddenly stops. She hears something making a “bleep-bleep” sound, looks up, and sees the object. Neighbors find the leaves of nearby trees are singed.

July 12 — 4:30 a.m. Laura de Freitas Machado Fernandes gets up to go to the well for some water at her home in Porto, Portugal, near the Porto Airport. She notices a luminous red object shaped like a cardinal’s hat coming from the west at high speed. It stops in mid-air and hovers above some nearby woods, rocking back and forth. She rushes back to warn her husband, Manuel Fernandes. They notice that their radio set has started making a loud noise. They estimate the object is about a quarter-mile away. Its top part is orange, and on its brim is a flickering red light. They watch it for 3 minutes before it takes off to the north at full speed. The radio goes back to normal.

July 26 — 9:35 p.m. Astronomers Robert Vitolniek, Ian Melderis, and Esmeralda Vitolniek at the Baldone Astrophysical Observatory in Latvia are observing noctilucent clouds when they see a star-like object drifting slowly westwards.

July 26 — Night. Adilon Batista de Azevedo, 14, leaves home with two friends to go to a movie theater on the outskirts of Carazinho, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. When they pass a vacant lot on Rua David Canaberra between the Rua 15 de Novembro and the Rua Alexandra de Motta, they see a light beam coming from a cloud illuminating an area about 33 feet in diameter and hear a buzzing noise. The other boys run, but Adilon remains and sees an oval- shaped object landing in the vacant lot and hovering about 3 feet off the ground. Another smaller object descends and hovers next to the first. Two beings about 5 feet tall emerge from the larger object and walk around it. They are wearing dark clothing and light helmets. After 5 minutes, 3 others emerge from the smaller object and converse with the others. The beings reenter the objects, which take off several minute apart.

July 28 — 9:40 p.m. A USAF Reserve major and his wife observe a manta ray–shaped object fly almost directly overhead at Carswell AFB \[now Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base\], Fort Worth, Texas, below 1,000 feet altitude. The object moves at a constant speed on the same course. The object is approximately 40 feet long and has two brilliant white lights pulsating off and on once every second. It is completely silent and flies directly through the Carswell control zone at low altitude. The sighting is verified by three other persons on duty. The report states: “This sighting was a positive observation, under ideal circumstances, of a definite object of an unconventional nature—possibly of foreign origin, which could be a threat to national security.” (NICAP, “[RAPCON Fails to Identify Low Flying Manta Ray](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/650728carswell_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014662351&usg=AOvVaw2TvDiL8atDoVB3PN582JTW)”)

August 1 — 1:30–4:30 a.m. Various personnel from Francis E. Warren Air Force Base west of Cheyenne, Wyoming, report more than 70 UFOs near the base’s ICBM Minuteman I launch control facilities (LCFs) and launch facilities (LFs, missile silos). A Lieut. Anspaugh logs the reports and incoming telephone calls for three hours. The reports begin with a “large circular object emitting several colors but no sound” seen by civilians over Cheyenne itself at 1:30 a.m. This results in an alert at the base for all personnel to be on the watch for anything suspicious. Five objects are spotted over the Sioux Army Depot \[now closed\] in Sydney, Nebraska, at 1:45 a.m. Two UFOs are seen over the Echo LCF southeast of Pine Bluff at 1:48 a.m. Nine more objects are sighted at 2:50

a.m. The Echo LCF reports six UFOs stacked vertically. A Strategic Air Command team at the H-2 LF northeast of Gurley reports a white UFO directly overhead at 3:00 a.m. The Sioux Army Depot reports five objects going east at 3:35 a.m. Reports of white, round- or oval-shaped objects in various formations, continue solidly at the H- 2 LF for the next 40 minutes. At 4:05 a.m., the Warren base commander calls to say that the Quebec LCF southwest of Chugwater has nine UFOs in sight: four to the NW, three to the NE, and two over Cheyenne. Sightings continue to be reported the next two nights at missile sites assigned to Warren AFB, for a total of 148 objects seen by 143 combat defense force airmen, missile maintenance men, and NCOs. The sheer scope and blatant ostentation of the UFOs’ reported aerial displays over a sensitive atomic missile base is remarkable. (J.

August 1 — Night. A TWA Boeing 707 airliner flying west of Topeka, Kansas, picks up 12–15 targets on Air Intercept Radar flying toward them at high speed on a 50-mile scope. They change to a 20-mile scope and observe the objects approaching in formation. The pilot, copilot, and engineer all witness this clearly. The aircraft passes the objects but cannot see them visually. Two films of the scopes are taken.

August 2 or 3 —1:30 a.m. Mr. A. L. Smith, accompanied by his 14-year-old son Alan and three other witnesses, watch an unusual, multicolored UFO over Tulsa, Oklahoma. The UFO is slowly moving toward the witnesses. Still several hundred yards away, it pauses briefly and hovers. At that precise moment, Alan snaps a photograph with his inexpensive camera, using ASA 64 film. Alan decides not to try for a second shot. He takes his camera inside the house and runs back outside just in time to see the object rapidly flying away into the night sky. The photo is a probable fake of a color wheel for an aluminum Christmas tree.

August 2 — Project Blue Book puts out an official USAF press release declaring the majority of the sightings on August 1 are “most likely” due to the planet Jupiter and the stars Rigel, Capella, Betelgeuse, and Aldebaran, “clearly visible in the eastern sky.” But astronomer Robert Risser of the Kirkpatrick Planetarium in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, counters that Jupiter and the four stars are “on the opposite side of the earth” at the time of the sightings.

August 2 — 3:00 a.m. KXWI-TV news photographer Robert Campbell hears on his radio a conversation between Oklahoma and Texas highway patrolmen that a UFO has been tracked on radar and is streaking towards the Texas border. Campbell takes his 4-by-5 Speed Graphic camera and drives into Sherman, Texas, where he locates Chief of Police Peter McCollum. Together they search for the object and soon see it hanging stationary one mile east of Bells on US Highway 82. The object has a “Mercury capsule” shape at one end, possibly rounded at the other end. Several distinct bands circle the cylinder, with disc-shaped embossments on the surface. He takes four camera exposures, two minutes each at three-minute intervals.

August 2 — The crew of the Russian steamship Raduga in the Red Sea watch a fiery sphere emerge from the water 2 miles away, causing an enormous pillar of water to rise and collapse. It hovers above the surface at an altitude of 490 feet. A motorboat with six Arab fishermen is in the area and also sees the object, which is apparently 200 feet in diameter. The object shoots straight up, and the boat is hit by a strong wave that overturns it. (Stonehill and Mantle, Russia’s USO Secrets, Flying Disk, 2020, pp. 59–60)

August 8 — 11:30 p.m. A luminous UFO is allegedly photographed in Beaver, Pennsylvania, by James Lucci, 17.

According to estimations by witnesses, the diameter of the UFO is around 42 feet. Lucci is photographing the full moon with his brother John, 23. According to them, a shining object appears from behind a hill. James manages to take two shots before the flying object leaves. His friends encourage him to send the photos to the Beaver County Times, where they are analyzed and declared authentic.

August 11? — 3:30 p.m. David Gibson is sitting in the front yard of his house in Waverly, Iowa, with his father and sister. They hear a high-pitched whine and see an object descending to the south. The silvery UFO is about 15–20 feet in diameter and looks like two saucers put together. It lands on a tree-lined hill out of view and the whining sound fades away. Gibson walks about a half-mile to take a look and briefly sees a “being,” about 3–3.5 feet tall, watching him from behind a tree at the top of the hill. It quickly vanishes and he hears a rush of air. He reaches the spot but sees no footprints.

The object’s speed is highly erratic during the 3 ascents and descents that the object makes. On its third descent the object appears to level off and accelerate at a speed of 690 mph or more. Project Blue Book evaluates this sighting as a solar mirage, even though the position and time of day rule that out.

August 13 — 9:30 p.m.? Leonard Chalupiak has just put his car into his garage at Baden, Pennsylvania, when he sees a disc-shaped object about 300 feet in diameter flying in front of the moon toward the north at about 50 mph and

2,300 feet away. It is surrounded with orange lights that weaken as a blue light comes on, which is intense for about 3 seconds. Then all the lights disappear and a sort of “shock wave” that shakes the tree leaves commences. The witness goes into his house and calls the Air Force. About 20 minutes later his vision becomes hazy, his eyes grow painful, and he gradually loses vision in both eyes. He notices his entire body is sunburned. A medical examination indicates exposure to ultraviolet radiation. His vision returns gradually over several days. The Air Force labels it a hoax, perhaps confusing it with the Beaver, Pennsylvania, hoax photo of August 8.

August 16 — 10:45 p.m.–12:20 a.m. A woman leaves her house on the northwest edge of Sedalia, Missouri, to drive to a drug store. As she is returning home, she sees an unusual figure in the ditch to her right. It turns and waves at her, then stumbles as it climbs out of the ditch. Something (a large bird?) flies up in the air a few feet from the car. She steps on the gas and goes home, where her husband asks her where she has been because it is now 12:25 a.m. In 1977, she undergoes hypnotic regression with hypnotist Ron Owen and recalls an abduction experience where she undergoes some type of examination.

August 18 — 9:50 p.m. Michael S. Henry and another college student are driving 3 miles south of Noblesville, Indiana, when a large red lighted object swoops down on their car. The radio and ignition go dead. The UFO looks like a top, with a large, gray cone and a flat or slightly domed top. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part Two,” IUR 34, no. 1 (Sept. 2011): 15)

August 19 — 3:00 a.m. Thelma B. Schumaker and her mother, Mrs. W. H. Blackburn, are awakened by an explosion in their backyard in Mount Airy, North Carolina. The sound seems to rise and travel west. They see a bright golden cigar hovering in the north. The object moves to the right then to the left, then up and down, left again, then disappears behind some high oak trees. The next morning, the witnesses find a 6-inch-wide circle of depressed sod that is worn down to the soil. The circle is 12 feet in diameter.

August 19 — 8:20–9:00 p.m. Harold Butcher, 16, is milking the cows in his father’s barn in Cherry Creek, New York, and listening to radio station WKBW. Just outside, a 3-year old bull is tied by its nose to a metal pipe. Harold hears the bull make a noise “like I have never heard come from an animal before.” Looking out the window, he sees the animal is bending the pipe. Simultaneously, he sees a metallic-looking, football-shaped UFO about 50 feet long and approximately 20 feet thick hovering just above the trees an estimated 450 feet from the barn. Slowly, the object descends behind a maple tree, emitting a red vapor from around its edges and a “beep-beep” sound.

Meanwhile, the radio is emitting static, even though WKBW usually has a clear signal. Harold calls the house on an intercom, then runs outside. As he approaches the bull, the UFO rises and moves behind some clouds “as fast as a snap of my fingers” emitting red vapor toward the ground, then bounces back to the ship as it hovers about 10 feet in the air. The noise also increases to a level approximating a sonic boom as it goes up. As the UFO disappears, the clouds turn green. Inside, the boy’s mother, Mrs. William Butcher, notes that there is “definite interference” in her radio reception. Harold’s brother, Robert, also goes outside and the two boys see that the UFO has reappeared, this time hovering over a pine grove. It ascends again, emitting the red vapor and turning the clouds green. Others in the house include William Butcher Jr. and Kathleen Brougham, a friend. They do not see the object. It returns twice at 8:45 and 9:00 p.m., finally disappearing to the southwest. Trooper E. J. Haas and a fellow officer arrive on the scene shortly thereafter. As they all walk out to inspect the area of the initial sighting, they notice a pungent odor. Harold and the young daughter suffer from upset stomachs. Mrs. Butcher says the cows produce only one can of milk that evening, as opposed to their usual two and a half cans. Harold discovers a purple, oily-smelling liquid and gives a sample of it to the state police, who turn it over to Capt. James A. Dorsey and five others from Niagara Falls Air Force Base \[now Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station\], who come to investigate the report the following afternoon. When NICAP investigator Jeffrey Gow arrives on the scene, he notices the foot-tall grass in the area “seemed to be bent over in long curved sweeps.” Radar targets are picked up between 8:00–8:30 p.m. by an AN/FPS-6 Long Range Height Finder Radar of the 763rd Radar Squadron at Lockport Air Force Station \[now closed\] near Shawnee, New York. The target is sighted near the upper limit of the radar.

September 3 — Around 1:00 a.m. Exeter, New Hampshire, Police Officer [Eugene F. Bertrand Jr.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44131765/eugene-f_-bertrand&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014687295&usg=AOvVaw3hG3WZSs7KO8nRqKqNVrLJ) comes across a woman parked on State Highway 101. “She was real upset,” he says, “and told me that a red glowing object had chased her.” Around 2:00 a.m., while walking home to Exeter on Route 150 (Amesbury Road) near Kensington, New Hampshire, teenager [Norman J. Muscarello](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43739662/norman-j_-muscarello&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014687678&usg=AOvVaw2JxtwHAR7Ppl5LVWos46Re) is terrorized by a large object with four or five bright red lights that approaches from nearby woods and hovers over a field. Horses are spooked. Muscarello gets a ride to the Exeter police station, pale and shaken, and reports the incident at 2:24 a.m. Officer Bertrand drives him back to the field along Route 150 to investigate. When he is called to investigate Muscarello’s report, the earlier incident causes him to pay attention. At first Bertrand and Muscarello see nothing, but when Bertrand flashes a light around the field around 3:00 a.m., a huge dark object with red flashing lights rises up over the trees, moving back and forth, tilts, and comes toward them. They both see pulsating red lights that dim from left to right then right to left in a 5- 4-3-2-1 then 1-2-3-4-5 pattern. Each cycle takes about 2 seconds. The object hovers for several minutes, and everything is silent except for the dogs and horses. Then it darts, turns sharply, slows down, and begins to move away. Another patrolman, [David R. Hunt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135259184/david-r_-hunt&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014688022&usg=AOvVaw38YzN4bDM9zjl1U0a1zWKu)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135259184/david-r_-hunt&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014688216&usg=AOvVaw2AUJZZIDcDOUrlETqn9GfL) pulls up and sees the pulsating lights and the UFO. Bertrand says the lights are always in a line and at a 60° angle; when the object moves, the lower lights are always forward of the others. In the daytime, the police station calls Pease AFB \[now Pease Air National Guard Base\] in Portsmouth to reconfirm the incident. By 1:00 p.m., 2–4 police officers arrive to interview the three witnesses at length.

September 6 — 9:30 p.m. Capt. Marcelo Cisternas is piloting a DC-6b at 8,500 feet for LAN Chile Flight 904 in northern Chile when he sees a zigzagging object change course and approach his airliner. The UFO follows the aircraft for 13–14 minutes at a distance of 1.8 miles. It is emitting a light of an intense color that shifts to radiant white.

Cisternas checks with control towers in Arica and Iquque, but no other flights are expected in the area. (Good Above, [p. 311](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/310/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014696823&usg=AOvVaw0KxOJCg54TmgYwLR7bC4pO))

September 10 — 8:30 a.m. Farmer Antônio Pau Ferro is working on his farm in São João, near Garanhuns, Pernambuco, Brazil, when he hears a noise and sees two metallic objects descending from the sky about 26 feet away. They touch the ground in a uniform motion, let two humanoids about 2.5 feet tall exit, then rise up again to 16 feet and hover. The beings approach Ferro, then move back to the two UFOs. They pick up a tomato and examine it. The objects descend and envelop them, then take off with a whining and then a low sound.

September 14 — 1:00 a.m. Engineer Paul Green is riding a motorcycle south of Langenhoe, Essex, UK, near Langenhoe Hall Lane when he hears a high-pitched humming to the east and notices a pinpoint of blue light moving in his direction. The humming becomes a loud buzzing, and his engine sputters and dies and the headlight goes out. The

light resolves into an enormous domed disc that tilts and slowly descends. The underside of the disc has numerous round items. Green walks toward the object, but he feels paralyzed as the flashing blue light becomes intense, fluctuating in rhythm with his heartbeat. He feels a tingling like an electric shock. The object seems to land in an area with farmhouses. Green notes that another cyclist has had a similar problem, but with some difficulty he gets his cycle started. The next day he notices that his hair and clothes are imbued with static electricity. (Bernard E.

September 16 — Just after 12:00 midnight. Constables John Lockem and Koos de Klerk are patrolling on the Pretoria- Bronkhorstspruit highway in South Africa when their police van headlights suddenly illuminate a domed, disc- shaped object sitting on the road. The UFO is copper colored and about 30 feet in diameter. Within seconds, the object lifts off the road, emitting tongues of flame from two tubes or channels on the underside. Flames from the macadam road surface shoot up in the air about 3 feet as the UFO departs, blazing long after it is out of sight.

Later investigation shows that part of the road is caved in as if from a heavy weight, and the gravel is separated from the tar in a severely burned area about 6 feet in diameter. Lt. Col. J. B. Brits, district commandant of Pretoria North, tells the media that the incident is considered “as being of a highly secret nature and an inquiry is being conducted in top circles.” Samples of the road surface are taken for analysis by a leading scientific agency; the report is never made public.

September 17 — A UFO is seen hovering above Medina del Campo, Valladolid, Spain, for several hours. Heliodoro Carrión takes off in his light plane and goes to 15,000 feet. An Iberia Airlines jet passes him on the way up at 24,000 feet. Carrión estimates the UFO is at least 4 times larger than the jet.

Late September — 9:15 p.m. Two French submarines, the Junon (S648) and the Daphné (S641), escorted by the logistic support vessel Rhône, are anchored off Fort-de-France, Martinique, when a large luminous object the color of a fluorescent tube arrives slowly and silently from the west. Michel Figuet on the Junon goes into the coming tower and gets six pairs of binoculars that he distributes to companions. There are 300 witnesses, including four officers on the Junon, three officers on the Daphné, a dozen French sailors, and personnel of the weather observatory. All witnesses aboard the Junon see the object as a large ball of light or a disc on edge arriving from the west. It moves slowly, horizontally, at a distance estimated at 6 miles south of the ships, from west to east. It leaves a whitish trace similar to the glow of a TV screen. When it was directly south of the ships the object drops toward the earth, makes two complete loops, then hovers in the midst of a faint halo. Figuet watches the object vanish in the center of its glow “like a bulb turned off.” The trail and the halo remain visible in the sky for a full minute. At 9:45 p.m. the halo reappears at the same place, and the object switches on again. It rises, makes two more loops, and flies away to the west, where it disappears at 9:50 p.m. (Jacques Vallée, “[Estimates of Power Optical Output in Six](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.scientificexploration.org/docs/12/jse_12_3_vallee_1.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014700473&usg=AOvVaw0IiTjvB9mA0RoI93bWnXPV) [Cases of Unexplained Aerial Objects with Defined Luminosity Characteristics,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.scientificexploration.org/docs/12/jse_12_3_vallee_1.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014700737&usg=AOvVaw0c3DBto37oXmcMxIO2aR5r)” Journal of Scientific Exploration 12, no. 3 (1998): 348–350)

Fall — 10:30 a.m. A Chesapeake & Ohio train is moving 8 miles south of Fostoria, Ohio, when the fireman and engineer see a large cigar-shaped object in the sky a considerable distance away. It is dark in color and positioned at a 45° angle from the horizon. It appears to be creating its own cloud screen. Suddenly a small object falls out of the tail and descends slowly in a fluttering fashion. Near the ground the small object stabilizes, emits coal-black smoke from its top, and then rises upward faster and faster. Three more objects leave the large one, each taking 10–12 minutes. They go off in different directions. After the last one leaves, a white cloud forms around the large object, which remains in the sky with other normal white clouds. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Satellite Objects and Cloud Cigars,” IUR 29, no. 1 (Spring 2004): 3)

It is silver-gray with swept-back wings, about 16 feet long, a wingspan of about 12 feet, and its fuselage is about 4-5 feet deep. He rides over and examines it. The exterior is irregular, “like a waffle.” A transparent dome covers the cockpit. Through it he can see complicated instruments (knobs, dials, and switches), a TV screen, and two transparent (like Plexiglas) bucket seats. There are no visible motors, propellers, jets, insignia, or identifying marks of any kind. It has an exterior door about 2 feet wide and 3 feet high that is open about 2 inches. His horse is extremely skittish, so he ties it to a tree and returns on foot. He spends 10–15 minutes examining it and can see no landing gear (although it seems to be suspended 18–20 inches off the ground) or seams of any kind. He realizes he can go inside the door but is a bit too scared to even touch the object, and has to return to chores anyway. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, pp. 87–102)

After watching for about 10 minutes from the car, the group drives down the road about a half mile and stops. Strauch observes it both with the naked eye and through 7x35 binoculars. At first they hear no sound, but as the object flies over them, Donald Martin Grewe describes the sound as a “whistling whine.” Strauch snaps a photograph just as the object begins to move. The object then flies into the wind for several hundred feet, then stops for a few seconds, at which time its lights change from bright white to dull orange, alternating several times. It then moves toward the southeast at a high rate of speed and disappears out of sight.

Geof Gray-Cobb, a Canadian technician working with the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility \[now the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory\] in Gauteng, South Africa, in tracking [Mariner 4](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_4&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014709872&usg=AOvVaw0Y_DM4jzJT2Pg28XccrEWz)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_4&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014710043&usg=AOvVaw3tIQFetj6y0L0Z5R8JOxS5) is present when the spacecraft’s signal strength begins rising at a point when it should not have. The team alerts the Jet Propulsion Lab. The signal strength is now so high that the instruments are clicking as they max out. Gray- Cobb says the “raw radio energy” is coming in indecipherable “blips and dashes.” Nothing can be seen visually. Eight minutes later, everything goes silent. JPL later asks them to point their dish in the direction it was pointing when they picked up the signal. They do, but forget to correct for the earth’s rotation. Nonetheless, they get the signal again, which means it is a local source. Nothing is visible in the sky, but a sound sweep reveals that the source is a perfect circle 2° in diameter. The team directs a packet of radio pulses at the source, but it falls silent. Two months later, Gray-Cobb discovers that the pages for the event are gone from the log; the tape recording of the event is also missing. The manager tells him that two men with “authorization” had come three days after the event to confiscate the tapes. (Michael D. Swords, “Gazing at the Moons,” IUR 32, no. 4 (October 2009): 16)

October 22 — Evening. José Camilo Filho is walking through a field near the city cemetery in Canhotinho, Pernambuco, Brazil, when he runs across two little men only 3 feet high with whitish hair sitting next to a tube 4 feet tall and

October 23 — Night. KEYL-AM radio announcer James F. Townsend, 19, is driving on State Highway 27 four miles east of Long Prairie, Minnesota, when he slams on his brakes to avoid hitting a rocket-like device resting on three legs or fins. As his car skids to a stop 20 feet from the object, the vehicle’s motor and electrical system die. The object looks like it is made of stainless steel, stands 30–40 feet high, and is 10 feet in diameter. In a circle of light under it, Townsend sees three things that resemble beer cans with “tripod legs and three matchstick arms.” They have no eyes, but Townsend feels as if they are looking at him. He gets out of the car to try to knock one over, but they come over to him and they stand there looking at him. Eventually they turn around and “scoot under the ship,” disappearing into the light beneath it. An ear-splitting humming sound emanates from the UFO, which assumes a bright illumination and shoots off. The Todd County sheriff and UFO investigators assume that Townsend, a deeply religious man, is sincere.

October 27 — The Air Force issues a press release that gives two basic explanations for the Exeter, New Hampshire, sightings: Some stem from a high-altitude SAC exercise out of Westover AFB \[now Westover Air Reserve Base\] near Chicopee, Massachusetts; others are explained by temperature inversion that causes the appearance of stars and planets to dance and twinkle. Around the same time, [John Fuller](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Fuller&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014714765&usg=AOvVaw0ddJqPkhBewYNnpn8eRUtc) hears from an Air Force pilot that pilots have been ordered to shoot down UFOs when possible, but the objects appear to be “invulnerable” and can outmaneuver any aircraft.

November 9 — 5:16 p.m. The Northeast power blackout, a significant disruption in the supply of electricity, affects parts of Ontario, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. Over 30 million people and 80,000 square miles are left without electricity for up to 13 hours. The cause of the failure is the setting of a protective relay on one of the transmission lines from the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Station No. 2 in Queenston, Ontario, near Niagara Falls. Prior to and coincident with the blackout, there are a number of reports of unusual lights in Syracuse and Niagara Falls, New York, and Holliston, Massachusetts, and there is speculation that the blackout is related to UFO activity in some way. But there is no evidence of a direct connection.

They claim the blackout is a small demonstration of their power and ask Whitman to do what he can to fight malice, prejudice, and hate on earth. The objects disappear.

December 9 — 4:47 p.m. A large, brilliant fireball is seen by thousands in at least six states and Ontario, Canada. It streaks over the Detroit, Michigan–Windsor, Ontario, area, reportedly drops hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio starting some grass fires and causes sonic booms in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area. It is generally assumed and reported by the press to be a meteor after authorities discount other proposed explanations such as a plane crash, errant missile test, or reentering satellite debris.

Another observer reports feeling a vibration and “a thump” about the time the object reportedly lands. Others from Kecksburg, including local volunteer fire department members (Carl Metz and Paul Shipco), report seeing an object in the shape of an acorn and about as large as a Volkswagen Beetle. Writing resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs is also said to be in a band around the base of the object. A reporter and news director for WHJB, [John J.

He takes several photographs and conducts interviews with witnesses. His former wife Bonnie Millslagle later reports that all but one roll of the film is confiscated by military personnel.

WHJB office manager Mabel Mazza describes one of the pictures: “It was very dark and it was with a lot of trees around and everything. And I don’t know how far away from the site he was. But I did see a picture of a sort of a cone-like thing. It’s the only time I ever saw it.” Witnesses further report that an intense military presence, most notably the US Army, is secures the area, orders civilians out, seals the area within 2 hours of the event, and then removes an object on a flatbed truck. The military claims they have searched the woods and can find “absolutely nothing.” The official explanation of the widely seen fireball is that it is a mid-sized meteor, as suggested, for example, by University of Michigan astronomer [William P.

December 13 — An amateur astronomer in Fort Worth, Texas, watches a UFO through several different telescopes. It has a recessed ring with small dark objects attached around its edge and a dark cross on its bottom. It moves from directly beneath the Moon and past Arcturus, then suddenly disappears.

December 19 — 11:45 p.m. Edward A. Bruns is driving his father’s 1962 Ford pickup truck, heading west just south of Herman, Minnesota. He sees a bright, oval-shaped object hovering several feet above the road. It covers the entire road and is shaped like two saucers with a dome on top. A window-like structure surrounds the dome and emits a green light. Suddenly the truck engine stops, the headlights go out, and the vehicle lifts up, spins violently to the right, ending up in a ditch on the other side of the road. Stunned, Bruns stares at the UFO, which makes a whistling sound, emits sparks, shoots upward, and disappears. He runs home, scared and nervous. His father goes to the site of the crash but cannot get the truck out. A reporter later confirms seeing the truck in the ditch with a complete “absence of skid marks in the snow to account for how it got there.” (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

January 17 — A B-52G Strategic Air Command bomber collides with a KC-135 tanker during mid-air refueling at 31,000 feet over the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Spain. The tanker is completely destroyed and the B-52G breaks apart, killing 3 of its 7 crew members. Of the four Mk28-type hydrogen bombs the B-52G carries, three are found on land near the small fishing village of Palomares, Spain. The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons detonate upon impact with the ground, resulting in the contamination of a 0.77-square-mile area by plutonium.

The fourth, which falls into the Mediterranean, is recovered intact after a 2 1⁄2-month-long search. Some 800 individuals with no hands-on expertise improvise search and decontamination procedures. More than 1,400 tons of radioactive soil and plant life are excavated and shipped to the Savannah River plant in South Carolina for burial.

January 18 — 4:55 p.m. Two surveyors are taking readings at China Lake Naval Ordnance Test Station \[now Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake\] in the western Mojave Desert, California. The surveyor using a theodolite hears a hum, looks up, and sees a UFO flying nearly straight at him from an angle of 35°–40° and from almost exact north. It passes directly overhead at less than 150 feet, then dives smoothly, turns to the east, then comes to within 10 feet of the sloping ground. The surveyor observes the object through the theodolite until it is lost in front of a lava flow about 2 miles away. Both observers (the other one is in a truck) say it is moving at 150 mph and it is a dull black color and very quiet. They attempt to report the sighting, but the radio is garbled. Their truck has difficulty starting, and the theodolite exhibits an odd change in the gravity reference indicator, requiring it to be

re-leveled. (“A Professional Observation,” IUR 7, no. 2 (March 1982): 7–8)

January 19 — Around 9:00 a.m. A banana grower, George Pedley, is driving a tractor about one half mile from a farmhouse at Tully, Queensland, Australia, owned by Albert Pennisi. Pedley’s attention is drawn by a hissing sound, clearly heard over the noise from the tractor’s engine. He looks about for the source of the noise and sees an unusual object about 75 feet away. It is some 30 feet in the air, rising vertically, and is shaped like “two saucers face to face.” It is light gray in color, dull, and non-reflective. He estimates its size as 25 feet long by 8–9 feet deep. The hissing diminishes as the object rises to a height of 60 feet, then departs, climbing at about an angle of 45°, extremely fast, to the southwest. The duration of his observation is only 5–6 seconds. The object appears to be always rotating. After its departure, Pedley finds a clearly defined, nearly circular depression in swamp grass, in a water-filled lagoon, at the point where he first saw it. The marking is about 32 feet long by 25 feet wide. The grass on the surface of the water is flattened in a clockwise direction. Royal Australian Air Force intelligence officers find a variety of circles in the area, ranging from 8 to 30 feet in diameter. Within each circle the plant roots are pulled completely out of the soil, as if the ground has been subjected to an intense rotary force.

The group recommends that Blue Book “be strengthened to provide opportunity for scientific investigation of selected sightings in more detail and depth than has been possible to date.” Furthermore, USAF should negotiate contracts “with a few selected universities to provide scientific teams to investigate promptly and in depth certain selected sightings of UFOs…. The universities should be chosen to provide good geographical distribution.” They also conclude that “perhaps 100 sightings a year might be subjected to this close study, and that possibly an average of 10 man-days might be required per sighting so studied. The information provided by such a program might bring to light new facts of scientific value.” The group recommends that Blue Book data be given “wide unsolicited circulation among prominent members of the Congress and other public persons.” The Air Force ignores their recommendations.

February 6 — Around 8:00 p.m. Several persons in the barrio of Aluche, Madrid, Spain, allegedly see an unusual flying object. Looking out a window, Maria Ruiz Torres watches an object descending.

March — Kathleen Reeves and a friend are walking on a rural road near their homes in Toledo, Oregon, when they think they see a neighbor’s field on fire. The fire seems oddly dome-shaped. They continue walking and see another smaller, duller light. Kathleen thinks it might be a prank, so she throws a rock at it. Suddenly, a group of much larger lights come on all around the small one. Frightened, the girls run home. Over the next few months, through October, the Reeves home experiences such poltergeist phenomena as whirring or sawing noises, rose-colored lights inside, small rings of light that crawl over the bedroom walls, and light beams.

March 12 — 10:40 a.m. A security guard at the Fábrica Nacional de Motores in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, alerts 10 employees to a mysterious light that is approaching the factory. It descends to 1,500–1,800 feet and hovers above the plant. The object is approximately 18 feet in diameter and emits a brilliant white light that makes it difficult to look at directly. It periodically flashes even brighter. Plant director Col. Jorge Alberto Silveira Martins calls the Army and Air Force. After 30 minutes, the object dims and moves away at tremendous speed before the Army trucks arrive. (Olavo T.

March 14 — 3:30 –5:30 a.m. Washtenaw County sheriff’s deputies Buford Bushroe and John Foster see highly maneuverable disc-shaped UFOs with flashing red and green lights over Dexter, Michigan. They call in a report that sets off a two-and-a-half hour chase that stretches over three counties and out over Lake Erie. Police from five jurisdictions are involved. Selfridge AFB \[now Selfridge Air National Guard Base\], near Mount Clemens, reports tracking UFOs on radar over Lake Erie.

March 16 — 5:45 p.m. Many people see a white, oval object crash into the Atlantic Ocean close to the Ilha Cagarras off Ipanema, Brazil. Some see a few smaller white parachute-shaped objects fall from it. A thorough search turns up nothing in the sea or the island itself. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, p. 54)

March 17 — 4:25 a.m. Police Sgt. Neil Schneider and Deputy David Fitzpatrick see top-shaped objects making sharp maneuvers over Milan, Michigan. They alternatively hover, rise and fall quickly, dart around at jet-like speed, dimming and brightening periodically. Two objects are operating together, while a third UFO hovers at a lower altitude.

They walk over to the area for a look, taking about 30 minutes, and see a pyramid-shaped object with a rounded top, corrugated surface, and blue, red, and white lights. Mannor’s son-in-law Bob Wagner, back at the house, sees the object light up and rise to 500 feet, then come down again making some noise. Washtenaw County sheriff’s deputies David Fitzpatrick and [Stanley McFadden](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/136211746/stanley-arthur-mcfadden&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014767299&usg=AOvVaw3iW3lf-furzydQUnpEX5Vb) arrive about 9:00 p.m. drive towards the swamp on Quigley Road. They see a brilliant light that dims and then reappears. By this time a crowd has gathered. One man reports that when two flashlights appear in the distance, the object seems to react by flying away at high speed. At another point the object passes directly over the Mannors with a whistling sound like a rifle bullet ricocheting. It remains in the swampy area for 30 minutes.

March 21 — 10:32 p.m. Cynthia “Pinky” Poffenberger and 16 other Hillsdale (Michigan) College students see a football- shaped object with red, green, and white pulsating lights descend from the sky and pass close to their dorm. It settles in a hollow in the Slayton Arboretum about 1,500 feet away. Some 87 students collect to watch the UFO, then they notify Civil Defense Director William Van Horn, who arrives with police. From the dormitory, the landed lights appear yellowish-white, dimming and intensifying. Only student [Barbara Kohn](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncnewsonline.com/archives/barbara-kohn/article_ac8bed04-0b06-5a0d-9a0e-05368dbed1f7.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014769199&usg=AOvVaw2DH916pUQdSEKoqyMgAnFy) stays most of the night, watching the lights vanish, reappear, and recede. Around 5:10 a.m., Kohn sees a lighted object move away and disappear from sight.

March 23 — 5:05 a.m. As Sheppard AFB (near Wichita Falls, Texas) civilian instructor William E. “Eddie” Laxson is driving west on US Highway 70 eight miles south of Temple, Oklahoma, he finds the road blocked by a wingless aircraft, shaped like a fish, in the road. It is about 75 feet long, nearly 8 feet high, 12 feet wide, with a Plexiglas bubble on top, and bright lights forward and aft. Laxson stops his car about 300 feet away and walks to within 50 feet, noticing a designation on its side like “TLA138” or “TLA738” or “TL 4768.” He sees a “man” wearing a baseball cap or mechanic’s hat climbing up steps or a ladder on the object. Soon after it lifts off with a hissing or

high-speed drilling sound and heads off southeast at about 700 mph. There are no landing traces. Laxson finds another witness, truck driver C. W. Anderson, parked a mile down the road.

Hynek, disappointed with the quality of the sightings and suspecting a mundane explanation, announces: “It would seem to me that the association of the sightings with swamps, in these particular cases, is more than coincidence.

It appears to me that all the major conditions for the appearance of swamp lights were satisfied.” The swamp gas theory doesn’t go over very well with the witnesses, the media, or the public.

March 29 — 4:15 p.m. A 10-year-old boy and his Dalmatian are walking familiar paths in a wood lot behind their home near Hampton Falls, New Hampshire. He notices something silver on a ridge and walks toward it. He sees an “L” shaped box, long side parallel to the ground, sitting on tripod legs. His dog runs ahead and sniffs the boxy structure, and then, appearing uninterested, the dog goes off into the woods. The boy stops about 24 feet away, not sure what he is seeing. The object makes intermittent sounds and movements in the following minutes. Then a blast of air from the object sends debris flying. A short high-pitched, then low-pitched, sound is heard as the object lifts off the ground about one foot, stops, swings in a clockwise motion, and settles back on the ground.

Intermittent electric-like humming sounds are heard until the object again, with a blast of air stirring up debris and the same sounds as earlier, ascends vertically, this time to about 10 feet, where it pauses, moves horizontally, pauses and rotates clockwise again, then accelerates straight up. On the final ascent, the sound increases in pitch and loudness. The witness’s mother and sister who were at some distance from him also hear the sound. When the object moved horizontally, saplings directly under it swayed. Three elongated imprints are found in the form of a triangle. Reportedly plants do not grow in the area for the next 2 years.

March 29 — 9:15 p.m. Charles Cozens, 13, is strolling in a field behind the Hamilton Mountain Police Station in Hamilton, Ontario. He sees two luminous oval objects about 8 feet in diameter descend and land, making a buzzing sound. The objects have a row of multicolored lights around their rims “flickering like a computer.” He approaches for a closer look and touches the nearest object, which feels hard and smooth like metal, but neither hot nor cold. He then touches an antenna-like projection at the end of one of the objects and receives a shock.

Frightened, he runs home. His parents confirm a 3-inch burn mark on his hand and question him thoroughly before reporting the incident to authorities. His first-degree burn is treated at a hospital and heals normally. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

March 30 — 8:35 p.m. A woman and her four children watch an oval object crossing the road as they are driving south about 9 miles north of Lewisburg, Indiana. It comes close to the car and she hears a pulsating sound, but it seems to come through the car radio, not directly from the object. She drives away, but the UFO pursues her for 8 miles. It changes from reddish-orange to blue-white before it accelerates away.

March 31 — 2:00 a.m. Jeno Udvardy is driving home from a late work shift near Vicksburg, Michigan. He sees a cluster of lights on the highway ahead and slows down. When he is within 10 feet, he realizes the lights are on a disc hovering a few feet above the road. It has a brilliant white light, and red, green, and purple blinking lights.

Udvardy backs up and his car is buffeted by gusts of wind as the object lifts up. The car motor stalls. He rolls down the window and hears a humming sound. Moments later, the UFO speeds off at a steep angle.

April 1? — Night. Students at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, see a star-like object that looks football-shaped through binoculars. It moves in geometric angles around two bright stars until it shoots straight up and disappears. (Michael D. Swords, “We Know Where You Live,” IUR 30, no.2 (January 2006): 10–11)

April 2 — 2:02 p.m. James Kibel, a Melbourne businessman who is a member of the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society, sees a shiny, hemispherical object above his garden in Balwyn, Victoria. It looks to be 20–25 feet in diameter and 120 feet in the air. “It seemed to float down towards me,” he says. “It resembled a big mushroom with a stalk pointing towards the earth.” He snaps a Polaroid photo, after which the object takes off and disappears to the north.

In 2017, Canadian researcher François Beaulieu reexamines the original and notices the reflection of the house below in the shiny object, and he finds that the discontinuity is actually caused by the Polaroid developing chemicals spreading unevenly across the photo.

April 4 — 7:50 p.m. Businessman Ron Sullivan is driving about 60 mph near Burkes Flat, Victoria, Australia. In the distance he sees a light near the road. Suddenly, the headlights of his vehicle bend to the right and light up a nearby fence. He brakes his car. In the middle of an adjacent field, he sees a column of light some 25 feet high and shaped like an inverted ice cream cone, 3 feet wide at the bottom and 10 feet wide at the top. It then rises to a height of 20 feet, after which the whole light complex disappears. There is no associated noise. Sullivan drives on to Wycheproof, where he checks his lights but finds nothing wrong. On the night of April 7, 19-year-old Gary Taylor is killed at the same spot when the car he is driving leaves the road and hits a tree.

April 6 — Around 11:00 a.m. A class of students and a teacher from Westall High School \[now Westall Secondary College\] in Clayton South, Victoria, Australia, are just completing a sport activity on the main oval when they see an object, described as a gray saucer-shaped craft with a slight purple hue and about twice the size of a family car. Witness descriptions are mixed: Andrew Greenwood, a science teacher, tells The Dandenong Journal at the time that he saw a silvery-green disc. According to witnesses, the object is descending and then crosses and flies over the high school’s southwest corner, going in a southeasterly direction before disappearing from sight as it descends behind a stand of trees and into a paddock at The Grange in front of the Westall State School (primary students). After about 20 minutes, the object—with witnesses now numbering over 200—then climbs at speed and

departs towards the northwest. As the object gains altitude, some accounts describe it as being pursued from the scene by five unidentified aircraft that circle it. Some describe one disc, others claim to see three. The Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society arrives on the site on April 8, speaks to students, and views the ground marking, originally described as a large patch of yellow, flattened grass with a swirly pattern.

April 8 — 8:05 a.m. Mike Dorsey and Gary Hunt, both 12, are walking along Redcoat Road in Norwalk, Connecticut, when they see sunlight reflecting off a distant object to the west and behind them. It zooms toward them in a flash, passes overhead from west to east, turns, makes a second pass from east to west, turns again, and makes a third pass. It makes a low humming sound when it passes about 15 feet above them. The boys run to the Holy Ghost Seminary nearby and hide under a nearby bridge abutment as the object continues to maneuver. When it hovers, it does so edge down and makes a fluttering motion. The disc looks metallic, 8 feet in diameter, has a black spot on top near its rim, and a red light on top of an antenna-like protrusion. Red and white lights appear to rotate counterclockwise. Nearly 2 hours later, the object takes off in a burst of speed.

The light is headed in their direction. They have heard of a UFO reported over police radio that night and figure this must be what was seen. The object hovers 50–100 feet in the air, bathing the two officers in a bright light. Spaur’s eyes water up. They rush to the cruiser and radio the station; the dispatcher says to wait there until a car with a camera arrives. The object makes some sharp maneuvers, and Spaur drives toward it cautiously. The UFO is 18–24 feet thick and about 35–45 feet in diameter. The object is so bright he hardly needs his headlights to drive.

Just before 5:30 a.m., two police officers in Salem, Ohio, see the UFO as a “bright ball” much larger than a jet. They also see three jets following it, apparently Air Force Reserve planes from Youngstown, Ohio. Police officer Frank Panzarella in Conway, Pennsylvania, sees the UFO, very bright and in the “shape of a half of a football.” He hears on his radio that a jet interception is in progress. Now in Pennsylvania, Spaur and Neff are given orders to abandon the chase. For most of the event, the object has remained at 1,000 feet, but now it rises to 3,500 feet and hovers. Then it shoots even higher and disappears. In 30 minutes, many police and civilians have seen the UFO. Panzarella alerts the Rochester, Pennsylvania, police operator, John Beighey, and asks him to contact the Greater Pittsburgh International Airport. Beighey calls Panzarella and says the Air Force wants to talk to the police witnesses. Spaur, Neff, and Huston go to the Rochester, Pennsylvania, police station and Spaur phones the USAF station at Pittsburgh. Spaur speaks to some colonel who tries to convince him he has seen something conventional.

NICAP’s William B. Weitzel, a philosophy professor, begins his own investigation, tracking down witnesses. Within a few weeks, he or his NICAP associates have interviewed all the police officers, as well as several others who have figured in the UFO chase, either as dispatchers or as those who overheard the radio communications.

NICAP members also interview some civilians who claim to have seen a UFO at the same time of the chase and/or had monitored police scanners.

April 18 — The Air Force begins a cursory investigation into the Portage County, Ohio, police chase case. Initially they telephone local news outlets, seeking information. However, local newspapers and radio have only vague outlines of the case. Air Force investigators also interviewed meteorologists and weather agency personnel, hoping to learn that a weather balloon was launched in the area during the UFO chase. They learn that there were no weather balloons launched that morning, and also that the wind had been so mild that the police would have had no difficulty catching up with any wind-borne object.

Quintanilla then, as Spaur said, “kind of lost interest.” (Clark III 910)

April 18 — An egg-shaped object, 80 feet in diameter and 15 feet high, is observed from a distance of 80 feet by a 42- year-old witness driving a car near Battle Creek, Michigan. The object supports a cockpit with windows and three rows of lights, emits red flames, and makes the same noise as a heavy truck on wet pavement. The object follows the car for some time.

April 19 — 10:45 p.m. In Peabody, Massachusetts, witnesses report an oval object with red, green, and white body lights, oscillating up and down when in motion.

April 23 — 10:45 p.m. On hearing a listener call in a live UFO sighting on WMEX radio, Jeanne Kalnicki of Dorchester, Massachusetts, goes to the window with her two daughters and sees an oval, domed UFO with a ring of blinking red lights bobbing up and down above a building across the street. A yellow light is on top of the dome and alternately flashes on when the red lights blink off. It moves across the street and appears to be moving directly toward them at eye level. Humming, the object moves between their apartment building and the one next door, where it hovers for a few minutes. When the yellow light goes off, Kalnicki can see a glow within the dome. The object then moves erratically away to the east. The family goes to bed, but at 5:00 a.m., 11-year-old Judy Kalnicki is too upset to sleep, She wakes up when she sees a light coming in her window and realizes that the UFO is right outside, bobbing up and down, looking about the size of their 1955 Lincoln automobile, and flashing its lights as before. Thinking it is going to come inside her bedroom, Judy screams. Seemingly in response, the object speeds up its bobbing motion, and she hears a heavy thudding sound. The windows rattle, Judy’s bed rocks, and all the lights in the house go off. Downstairs, their German shepherd is whining and scratching at the door. The entire family rushes to the back porch, where they watch the object for about 12 minutes moving to the north toward Boston. The lights come back on. NICAP’s investigation shows that the power failure affected 2,500 homes in the area and was caused by two cables burning out a block away from the Kalnicki apartment. One particle on the window sill registered a strong radiation reading of .025 millimentgens per hour from a Geiger counter. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

May 4 — 4:30 a.m. An FAA air traffic controller tracks an unidentified non-transponding target for about 5 miles at Charleston, West Virginia. The crew of Braniff Airline Flight 42, headed east at 33,000 feet, sees a white-blue object giving off brilliant, flaming light of alternating white-green-red colors. The radar shows the object veering 8–10 miles away at the 10 o’clock position, then approaching the Braniff airliner to a distance of 3 miles. It then makes a 180° left turn to the northwest within a diameter of 5 miles at 1,000 mph, which the Braniff crew confirms as the object descends from 20° above the horizon.

June 19 — 12:05 a.m. A group of Boy Scouts camping out at Mount Mitchell State Park, North Carolina, sees three red pulsating lights in a triangular pattern approach, then hover until about 5:00 a.m. The lights blink at different speeds, with the center one turning white every fifth pulsation. At sunrise, the object lifts up, appearing red and bell-shaped through binoculars. Six smaller objects are hovering nearby on either side of the larger object, changing formation. The group then disappears behind a mountain. When the Scouts start to explore in the direction of the objects, about 60 feet from their camp they discover trees with broken branches and some crushed undergrowth, plus three holes in the ground forming an equilateral triangle.

June 23 — 3:42 a.m. NASA contract flight engineer Julian Sandoval and two independent witnesses see a glowing elongated object with a blunt end. It has a series of four body lights varying from brilliant green to a bluish tinge, and is hovering at an estimated 12,000 feet near Placitas, New Mexico. When the object moves its glow brightens, and it appears to be a powered craft. The witnesses watch the object for an hour and a half, after which it climbs vertically, accelerates to a high velocity, and disappears to the northeast in about 12 seconds. In a report to NICAP, Sandoval estimates the departure speed at “Mach 6 or better.” (“[New Reports by Space Experts Add to](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cufos.org/UFOI_and_Selected_Documents/UFOI/033%2520AUG-SEPT%25201966.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014830298&usg=AOvVaw2ZMuKRo-IN_hjBWFip5Eai) [UFO Proof,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cufos.org/UFOI_and_Selected_Documents/UFOI/033%2520AUG-SEPT%25201966.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014830556&usg=AOvVaw0UG2jYjQby9CWACBstrb3v)” UFO Investigator 3, no. 9 (Aug./Sept. 1966): 3)

August 1 — 7:45 p.m. Several children are playing outside in Rushville, Indiana, when they see an object hovering above a tree near them. Its altitude is about 75 feet. They describe it as round, brighter than the moon, silver, and about 4 times larger than the full moon. It has a fuzzy edge and rocks slightly as it hovers. One girl, Donna Glosser, calls it to the attention of others who are about a half-block away. When she does, the object changes to reddish- orange, seems to revolve, and moves across a road so fast it seems to jump. It stops abruptly over some trees on a hill about one block away. At least one adult watches the object for 5 minutes. The same object is apparently seen by a group of teens at the Dairy Delight Drive-In about a mile and a half away. It becomes brighter after 45 seconds and speeds away.

August 16 — The chief of the Australian Directorate of Public Relations writes to the Directorate of Air Force Intelligence requesting reconsideration of its decision to stop making summaries of UFO sightings reported to the Department of Air available to the public. DPR hopes the summaries will be useful in responding to public inquiries and thinks that restricting them will reinforce the theory that the government has something to hide. The summaries continue to be published erratically through the end of the 1970s. (Swords 393–394)

August 19 — 4:50 p.m. US Border Patrolman Donald E. Flickinger, in the process of taking two prisoners back to Canada, sees a silvery domed disc floating down the side of a hill near Donnybrook, North Dakota, about 10 feet off the ground. It moves across a valley and climbs to 100 feet, hovers over a reservoir, then appears to land in a field 250 feet away. It tilts on edge and rises into the clouds at high speed. Flickinger finds three odd indentations in the field in the form of a triangle with sides of 10–12 feet. Some stones alo seem to have been moved recently.

August 20 — Afternoon. Some boys looking for a lost kite on the Morro do Vintém in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, discover the bodies of two dead males and report them to the authorities. The Morro do Vintém is a hill with difficult terrain, and the police are unable to reach the bodies until August 21. When a small team of police and firefighters arrive, they encounter an odd scene: the bodies are resting next to each other, partly covered by grass. Each one is wearing a formal suit, a lead eye mask, and a waterproof coat. There are no signs of trauma or struggle. Next to the corpses, police find an empty water bottle and a packet containing two wet towels. A small notebook is also identified, on which were written the cryptic instructions, “16:30 be at the specified location.

18:30 ingest capsules, after the effect protect metals await signal mask.” The two men are identified as Manoel Pereira da Cruz and Miguel José Viana, two electronic technicians from Campos dos Goytacazes. Following an investigation, police reconstruct a plausible narrative of the men’s last days. On August 17, Cruz and Viana leave Campos dos Goytacazes saying that they needed to purchase some materials for work (although they tell others they are on a secret mission). The two men then board a bus to Niterói and arrive at 2:30 p.m. Evidence shows that the waterproof coats were purchased at a shop there, and one bottle of water from a local bar. Upon being interviewed, the waitress from the bar described Miguel as “very nervous,” and noticed he frequently checked his watch. That is the last time they are known to have been seen alive; it is presumed they go directly from the bar to the spot where they were discovered. One theory revolves around the testimony of a friend of the two men, who claims that they are members of a group of “scientific spiritualists” who are apparently attempting to contact extraterrestrials or spirits using psychedelic drugs. Believing that such an encounter would be accompanied by blinding light, the men cut metal masks to shield their eyes and may have died of drug overdoses. This account is corroborated by the esoteric diary entry found at the scene and by mask-making materials and literature concerning spirits found at the men’s homes. In April 1980, [Jacques Vallée](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%25C3%25A9e&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014854111&usg=AOvVaw3EVICX9kBPjMqlB-DhlFMH) locates the exact spot where the bodies were found and notes that no vegetation is growing there.

August 24 — 10:00 p.m. Airman 3d Class Michael D. Mueller reports by base radio seeing a multicolored light high in the sky above the Minot AFB M-6 Minuteman launch site southeast of Norma, North Dakota. A team goes to his location and confirms the object and sees a second white object passing in front of clouds. The base radar detects the object, which is tracked at about 100,000 feet (20 miles). The object rises and descends a number of times, and each time Maj. Chester A. Shaw Jr., in charge of the M-6 missile crew, finds his radio transmission interrupted by static, even though he is 60 feet underground. The UFO gradually descends to ground level 10–15 miles south of the base. The Air Force sends a strike team to check on it. When they are within 10 miles of the site, static disrupts their radio contact. Five to eight minutes later, the glow diminishes and the UFO takes off.

Another UFO is sighted and tracked on radar; the first object flies underneath this second one. The two objects disappear separately. The entire episode lasts about 4 hours and is confirmed by two other missile launch sites, M- 4 and N-7 (near Mohall). Another report from the same time period mentions that some missiles went off alert for 24 hours after a UFO sighting at the N-1 missile alert facility.

August or September — Mid-afternoon. Two men are returning home from bowling in Norwood, Massachusetts. The Moon is visible in about three-quarter phase in the sky. Both glance up and see a group of 6–7 disc-shaped objects moving horizontally toward the Moon. When they reach a position just below the Moon, they loop around it in an upward, back, and onward motion, then continue on their way. (Michael D. Swords, “We Know Where You Live,” IUR 30, no. 2 (January 2006): 9–10)

Early September — Night.

September — Early morning. A UFO is seen hovering at low altitude by all personnel at Heathrow Airport Air Traffic Control in London, England, at a time when no aircraft are in motion. The UFO is tracked on radar and its speed at departure is clocked at 3,000 mph. The Ministry of Defence is notified, and investigators arrive on the scene and tell the witnesses that they have seen nothing, threatening to charge them under the Official Secrets Act if they reveal the sighting publicly.

September — 1:30 a.m. Airman 1C Patrick McDonough is working on an astro-azimuth observation at one of the Malmstrom AFB missile launch facilities near Conrad, Montana, when a UFO comes in from the north and stops directly overhead at 300 feet. It is about 30–50 feet in diameter and disc-shaped, with dim lights outlining it and a white light emanating from the center. It remains about 20–30 seconds, then shoots away noiselessly to the east at tremendous speed. Montana Highway Patrol dispatchers in Pondera County receive more than 20 UFO reports that morning.

September — 4:00 a.m. Deputy Sheriff Ed Korenek is driving north of El Campo, Texas, on State Highway 71 when he sees something like a car on fire ahead of him. Suddenly he notices that another object is pacing him, He hits his brakes and reaches for the radio, but it is dead. He sees another flaming object above Wharton Regional Airport to the east. He accelerates toward the object ahead of him, which slides off the highway to the right, sucking its flame up behind it as it moves away. The object above the airfield disappears, and when Korenek turns his car around, his radio begins working again.

September 22 — 3:00 a.m. Police from several vantage points in Deadwood, South Dakota, see a large white hovering object, changing color to green to red then back to white. It hangs motionless for 15 minutes. When a spotlight is shone on it, the object blacks out. Two smaller white objects operating independently approach and hover nearby. The large object bobs around and emits blue light beams toward the ground, and finally speeds away in 3 seconds.

September 24 — 3:30 a.m. A man named Gaines is driving his girlfriend home in Peoria, Illinois, when they see a large, luminous, blue sphere hovering low in the sky. It shoots off, so he drops the girlfriend off. On the way home the blue ball returns; his car begins to pick up speed, the brakes won’t work, and the doors won’t open. He races on

Autumn — Night. A young couple parking in a rural area near Rockford, Illinois, see a bright light that appears over some nearby trees. It is so intense that it hurts their eyes, so they start the car up and drive down a gravel road. The light is gone, but near where it had been they can now see two gray figures with large slanted eyes and wearing clothing with a square insignia on the torso. As they leave the area, they smell a pungent, metallic odor. (“Letter,” IUR 9, no. 2 (March/April 1984): 6, 9; “Out of the Past,” IUR 9, no. 2 (March/April 1984): 8–9)

October 2 — 8:20 p.m. Mrs. Everett Steward is talking on the telephone at her home in Cincinnati, Ohio, when she smells a foul odor in the room. She goes to her bedroom, but she has a feeling of being watched. Looking out the window, she sees an oval-shaped object with portholes and red, green, and white lights revolving around it. It is 75 feet in diameter and hovering at 100 feet. She wakes up her husband, who also sees it, and calls her married daughter, Mrs. Janet Emery, a mile away; the Emerys also see it, and a neighbor with binoculars can see that it has square windows glowing yellow. Janet goes outdoors and sees the UFO eject a red ball, which maneuvers while the first UFO takes off southward. The red ball flies 75–100 feet over Janet’s head; its underside is shiny like aluminum foil. Mrs. Steward goes to bed, but the odor is still in the house. After some time, the room is filled for an instant with brilliant white light; then this vanishes and a globe of light about 21 inches in diameter appears at the foot of her bed. Inside are 5 “non-human, hairless heads” with oval, sunken eyes. Instead of noses, there are slits, and they have no mouths. Telepathically, they repeat several times: “We have made contact.” Mrs. Steward screams and the globe disappears. She is so disquieted by the experience that she goes under psychiatric care for the next 2 years. (Stringfield, Situation Red, Doubleday, 1977, pp. 33–36)

October 4–5 — 5:00 a.m. Jack Jones is delivering newspapers on John Street in Connersville, Indiana. He notices a group of lights in a field to the west past the dead end. He thinks it might be a new light installation and moves on. The next day, Jones is with another paper carrier, Don Doe, and he suggests they go see the new lights. Jack sees the lights, but they are in a different position somewhat to the north. Both boys sit on their bicycles and watch a dark disc-shaped object with flashing red, green, and white lights on it that is apparently on the ground some 840 feet into the field. They estimate it is 27 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. They hear a high-pitched whirring sound and smell a faint odor of sulfur and tannic acid. After watching it a few minutes, they hear a new sound as if someone is walking slowly toward them through some thick weeds. They take off on their bicycles and don’t look back. Some days later, investigators find three holes, 8 feet apart in an equilateral triangle, where the object was seen. The holes measure 7 inches at the top and 1 inch at the bottom.

October 11 — 9:45 p.m. Two boys in Elizabeth, New Jersey—Martin Munov and James Yanchitis—are walking home on 4th Street near East Jersey Street, adjacent to the elevated New Jersey Turnpike. Yanchitis tells his friend that there is someone following them. They turn and see a man standing behind a high wire fence separating them from the turnpike 30 feet above them. The fence is 8 feet high and the embankment running up to it is steep. John Keel interviews the two boys three days after the incident. They tell him that the man is 7 feet tall, has a dark complexion, and is wearing a green work suit. He has a bald head, large eyes, and a huge grinning mouth full of white teeth.

October 15 —4:45 a.m. Forester Jerry H. Simons is driving home from a camping expedition, notices a reddish glow behind him, and stops his car near Split Rock Pond, south of Newfoundland, New Jersey, to investigate. A flat- bottom, red-orange disc with a dome on top is hovering above and behind his car. Near panic, he flees the area with the object following him. When the light from the object illuminates the ground around him, his car engine, dashlights, and headlights all fail. When the object recedes, his lights and engine function normally. This sequence is repeated three times, strongly demonstrating a direct correlation between the light from the UFO and the failure of his car’s electrical system.

October 21 — Night. Three junior high school students are standing at one end of their street in Amsterdam, New York, when they notice a star-like light to the right of the Moon. The star proceeds to draw aright-angle step around the Moon and continues northward, where it joins two other objects. The three objects then form 90° angles, equilateral triangles, and other geometrical figures. Two of the students go home for binoculars, and while they are away the sky show stops. They remain in the sky, but stationary. The objects look spherical through binoculars with some sort of lighted, colored areas that rotate. (Michael D. Swords, “We Know Where You Live,” IUR 30, no. 2 (January 2006): 10)

October 26 — 11:50 p.m. A man is driving in a rural, wooded area near Takoma Park, Maryland, when he sees a disc that seems about to land in a clearing. It puts on a red-and-green light show as it hovers. A large central beam of light shines onto the field below. The car radio bursts with static, and he hears a whirring sound coming from the object. He tries to accelerate the car, but it won’t move. Radio and drive functions resume when the UFO moves away. (Michael D. Swords, “Messing Around with the Force,” IUR 31, no, 4 (March 2008): 17, 29)

October 31 — Night. An observer in Gloucester, Massachusetts, notices a particularly bright star in the southwestern sky that is moving in a wide arc. When it reaches Ursa Major, it paces along the Big Dipper, then turns and takes an approximately parallel course to the front of the constellation. (Michael D.

November 1 — The University of Colorado UFO project officially launches. [Michael D.

Normally a governmental grant goes to a scientist who has initiated it or is at least vitally interested and experienced in the field, and essentially knows exactly what he is going to do.

This grant was to a scientist who was pushed into it, had little interest and apparently no experience, and, despite his brilliance, ‘didn’t have a clue.’ Because the reports of the UFO phenomenon are so complex and multidimensional, this short-term ‘backwards grant’ was doomed to fail before it was even signed.” (Swords 309– 312)

November 1 — 8:00 p.m. Mrs. Ray Tibbetts is talking on the phone in her home at Newfields, New Hampshire, when her son, Dale, yells that there is a strange light outside. Her foster daughter, Anita Purrington, joins Dale and they both get excited. Mrs. Tibbetts runs to a window when the house lights begin blinking on and off. She goes to her son’s room and sees a huge object with two tiers of four windows from which a strange, yellow-green light is shining. The size of one of the windows is as big as her living room wall. An apparent ceiling line is visible in the bottom tier. Suddenly an intense white light shoots out from the object at Mrs. Tibbetts, who is knocked backward and gets spots before her eyes. When her vision clears, the UFO is gone. She has pains in her eyes the next two days and they are extremely sensitive to light. She drives to a clinic in Exeter, New Hampshire, which finds a spasm in the eyelid and tearing, but it attributes this to the cobalt therapy she has been getting. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

Interstate 77 when a low-flying dark object about 35 feet wide cuts in front of him and forces him to stop. It hovers a foot above the ground, only 20 feet ahead. The object has a profile similar to a kerosene lamp chimney flattened on the bottom side. A door opens and a smiling man of dark complexion descends, wearing a topcoat (“blue and quite shiny, having a glistening effect”) over shiny blue trousers. Without opening his mouth, which bears a fixed grin, he addresses Derenberger telepathically, asking him to open his window. For the next 10 minutes he conducts a telepathic conversation, first asking Derenberger’s name and saying that his own is “Indrid Cold” from a planet called Lanulos in the “Ganymede galaxy.” He tells Derenberger not to think of him as an alien and concludes by saying, “We will see you again.” After admitting Mr. Cold, the UFO rises vertically and disappears.

November 6 — 6:30 p.m. A driver on State Highway 47 near Parkersburg, West Virginia, sees a UFO and gets out to watch it. At first it looks like two lights near the American Viscose plant across the Little Kanawha River. The object crosses the river and the highway then turns off its lights at about 100–150 feet altitude. The lights come back on and it starts moving toward the witness, stopping right over his car and focusing a bright beam of light on him for 10 seconds. It shuts off and the object moves leisurely away to the south. (Clark III 405)

November 15 — 11:30 p.m. Two young couples from Point Pleasant, West Virginia—Roger and [Linda Scarberry](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/92851560/linda-sue-scarberry&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014903511&usg=AOvVaw1-elAd5_Dd-dgESdieVMDX) and Steve and Mary Mallette—are joyriding in an area outside of town known as the “TNT area” \[the site of a former World War II munitions plant and now part of the McClintic Wildlife Management Area\] when they

encounter a large gray creature whose eyes glow red when the car’s headlights pick it up. Scarberry describes it as shaped like a man but nearly 7 feet tall. They describe it as a “large flying man with 10-foot wings” that are folded against its back. Terrified, they drive away but pass a similar creature on a hill by the road. As they pass it, it spreads its wings, rises into the air, and pursues their car, keeping pace at even 100 mph. The entity does not pursue them into town, but they drive directly to the Mason County Courthouse, where they tell their story to Deputy [Millard Halstead](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63046926/millard-w_-halstead&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014903993&usg=AOvVaw0q_-PeCreIEXfop1UDcz1j)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63046926/millard-w_-halstead&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014904199&usg=AOvVaw3oMgo8uEc74Yw5hdwLPuZy) who accompanies the witnesses back to the site. He hears strange static disturbances coming from his radio, but they find no evidence of the encounter. On November 16, Sheriff [George E.

The Scarberrys and Mallettes go back to the site in the daylight and find odd-looking tracks like “two horseshoes put together.” After this sighting, more people begin reporting encounters, and hundreds of cars swarm out to the TNT area at night in search of a Mothman sighting. In May 1976, representatives of the Ohio UFO Investigators League reinterview several witnesses, all of whom stick to their stories and sometimes add interesting details. (John A.

November 17 — 4:00 a.m. Two police officers see a round, glowing object with a wide, flat rim around the center resting on the ground near Gaffney, South Carolina. They estimate the diameter to be about 20 feet. As they watch from less than 50 feet away, a door opens and a small humanoid being descends. The observation lasts several minutes. Footprints are found at the site. (John A.

November 22 — 9:00–10:00 a.m. A biochemist and consultant to a logging company and his wife are traveling on State Highway 58 through the Willamette Pass, Oregon, when he decides to stop and take photos of some scenery. He stops at the Diamond Peak overlook, takes 2 photos, then pauses to take a third. Suddenly, he claims, a disc- shaped object with a domed top ascends into his field of view. After stopping for 3 seconds, it shoots off toward the right and disappears into a cloud bank. When he develops the roll of film, the photos show a blurred disc- shaped object with two black bands beneath and sitting atop a seeming column of vapor. NICAP is given the photo but is not impressed. In 1989, physicist [Irwin Wieder](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/photos/wieder-irwin-b1&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014906296&usg=AOvVaw1mtk7M9g7mVz9W04fmx195) performs a detailed analysis of the photo and determines that it is a blurred photo of the “Diamond Peak” sign taken from a passing car.

November 22 — 10:00 a.m. A deer hunter searching for game near Roaring River State Park, Missouri, returns to his group’s camp and becomes alarmed when he sees smoke rising from it. He finds their tent and other camping equipment destroyed. The tent is still smoldering, one of the aluminum tent poles is singed, and the aluminum cots are melted. The tent is set up under two trees, but their leaves show no traces of damage at all. About 15 feet away is a dead tree with its top still burning. The witness then heasr a low humming sound and sees an object rising from the valley about 300 feet away. He is able to take a photograph of it as it ascends and manages a second photo a few seconds later. It is an aluminum-colored disc, about 25 feet in diameter and 8 feet thick, with a band around its center and some kind of projection at its rear. The humming sound intensifies as the object picks up speed and disappears in 20 seconds.

November 22 — 4:20 p.m. At least eight employees of the American Newspaper Publishers Association in New York City watch a UFO from their offices on the 17th floor at 750 Third Avenue. The UFO is a rectangular, “cushion- shaped” object whose bright, reflective surface first catches the eye of Assistant General Manager Donald R. McVay. They go outside onto the terrace and watch the object move southward over the East River, then hover above the United Nations building. It flutters and bobs “like a ship on agitated water.” It rises slowly and moves south then west. One of the other witnesses is the manager of the Publications Department, William H. Leick.

1967 — The US nuclear stockpile reaches its peak at 31,255 bombs. (Ryan Crierie, “[U.S. Nuclear Stockpile, 1945–2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20190123105349/https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/ABC_Weapons/US_Nuclear_Stockpile.htm)”) 

1967 — Night. Miss E. R. East, of Gibsons, British Columbia, is awakened by a banging noise and sees a brilliant orange-red light soaring above hills behind the town. As she watches, its color changes to glowing white and the object moves toward the Strait of Georgia. Suddenly, a 10-foot-wide beam of light shoots down to the water. As it strikes the surface, it bends and lies flat on the surface, lighting up the wharf on Keats Island. As she stares at it, her eyes begin to sting.

Early January — 7:30 p.m. Robert Blaine is driving with five other witnesses on State Highway 55 two miles southeast of Farwell, Minnesota, when his headlights and engine suddenly go out. He sees an orange flash to his left at the level of his hood and tiny beads of light cross in front of the windshield.

January 13 — 10:00 p.m. The crew of a Lear Jet flying at 41,000 feet over southwestern New Mexico sees a flashing red luminous object in their 10 o’clock position. The object splits into four smaller red objects vertically several times, each separated by about 2,000 feet and each emitting a “red ray.” It then retracts the lowest objects into the top object. Albuquerque radar tracks a target 39 miles ahead of the Lear Jet moving on the same heading, with no transponder signal. At that moment the object blinks off visually for 30 seconds then blinks back on. The UFO floods the jet with an intense red light so bright that the pilot has difficulty seeing his instrument panel. It maintains its position in front for a few minutes then blinks out, comes on again, and falls back behind the left wing. It then pulls forward again. Albuquerque radar reports that it looks like the target had merged with the jet. Both the UFO and the jet make left turns over Winslow, Arizona, after which Los Angeles Center radar picks up both targets. Past Flagstaff, the object climbs at a 30° angle and disappears to the west in less than 10 seconds.

January 17 — Night. Francis Bedel Jr. is driving on State Highway 135 five miles north of Freetown, Indiana, when a glowing white light darts into his field of vision. It hovers above the road for a few seconds, then slowly reverses its course. Bedel is so busy staring at the spectacle that he loses control of his car, which goes off the road and is badly damaged. Phil Patton and his wife apparently see the same object, about 30 feet in diameter, that comes within 100 feet of their car on the same road. It has a brilliant red light and flashing ywllow and white lights on its perimeter.

January 26 — 8:30 p.m. The teenage daughter of a lieutenant colonel residing on a US Army base in Heidelberg, Germany, hears a strange pulsating sound. She tells her father, and they look out the window to see a dirigible- shaped object about 50–60 feet long hovering about 150 feet off the ground above a motor vehicle shed. Before long, a crowd of 50–60 people gather around their apartment building to watch the object, which is only 100 feet away. Some observers with binoculars say it is metallic and has lights that alternate in red, blue, and green colors. After about 20 minutes, US Air Force jets approach in response to a call from the base, and the UFO’s lights increase in intensity and it speeds away.

January 28 — 1:45 p.m. Alex Butler, 10, and five young friends are playing on Studham Common as they are making their way to Studham Lower School, Bedfordshire, England. Suddenly a flash of lightning strikes nearby, and Alex sees a little blue man about 3 feet tall with a high bowler hat and beard standing motionless on the opposite bank. It is clothed in a one-piece garment with a broad black belt and black box in front. A dim glow envelops him, giving him a blue color. The other boys see it too. They begin to run toward the creature, but it disappears in a puff of smoke. The little man appears in a different spot, and the boys start running there, but again he disappears. As the vanishing act repeats again, the boys hear a deep-toned sound emanating from two spots nearby. At that point the school bell sounds, and the boys rush off to class.

They move without producing the slightest sound, by creating around themselves a pneumatic vacuum that protects them from burning up in our stratosphere. Their craft have the mysterious capacity to vanish and reappear at will. Besides, they are able to affect our power resources, putting to a halt our electricity-generating plants, our radio stations, and our engines, without, however, leaving any permanent damage.

February 2 — 6:30 p.m. Capt. Oswaldo Sanvitti is flying a Faucett Perú DC-4 airliner from Chiclayo to Lima, Peru, when the crew and passengers notice a bright light coming toward them from the west. Sanvitti estimates it is about 9 miles away, but it soon reaches the aircraft and hovers above it. The cabin lights dim, the plane’s compass fluctuates, and the radio gives off static. The UFO speeds away to the east, increasing its luminosity by 50%, but reappears 5 minutes later with another object. Both UFOs trail the aircraft until 5 minutes before it lands at Jorge Chávez International Airport in Callao.

February 5 — Evening. A young man in Hilliard, Ohio, hears a strange noise and a barking dog. He looks up and sees an object approaching at a low altitude over a road shoulder. It lands on three legs in a field. The object is egg- shaped and about 75 feet long and 45 feet high. An “elevator-like” shaft opens and beings emerge carrying small, circular balls that they place on the ground around the UFO. The human-like creatures appear to be waiting for something. Then a man approaches from across the field and talks to them, apparently by telepathy. The witness accidentally steps on a twig, and the beings hear it. One runs toward him and catches him by the back of the neck, leaving a burned wound. Another being comes and both drag him toward the object. As they get close, the beings look at each other, seemingly panic-stricken. They drop the witness, collect the balls, and run inside the UFO, which takes off.

February 8 — 6:43 p.m. Mary McCarthy and five of her young nieces and nephews see a glowing object as they are eating dinner at their farm 3 miles south of Deep River, Ontario. The television immediately stops working properly. About a quarter of a mile away on a hill is a circular “craft” with a large core of dazzling, pulsating yellow lights in its center. From this core, red lights pulsate outward toward the rim, somewhat like neon lights. They have it in view for 40 minutes. After the object leaves, the TV starts working again. A Canadian Forces

February 14 — 7:00 a.m. A farmer in Miller County, Missouri, notices that his cows are all staring in one direction. He goes to investigate and sees a landed object about 360 feet away. He sees several entities moving around it, so he picks up some stones and approaches it. From about 30 feet away, the object looks like a hovering parachute or a grayish-green shell. The creatures, apparently wearing overalls, scurry behind the craft and go inside. The farmer throws one stone, but it stops in midair about 15 feet away and drops to the ground. He throws the other stone to try to strike the top of the object, but it bounces off something. When he gets to 15 feet away, he walks into an invisible wall and can’t see the object at all.

The lights are attached to an object that emits a light beam from its bottom center that moves around and illuminates the desert. The lights disappear, but a few minutes later the UFO reappears from behind a hill a mile away, followed by two white lights flying in step formation, one of which lands or nearly lands. The remaining light merges with the large object.

February 24 — A well-known engineer in Osorno, Chile, sees a disc-shaped object land near him. Seconds after touching down, a strange being, about 4.5 feet tall and wearing a transparent outfit, emerges. It has a white face and hands, a pronounced jawbone, and no neck. When it sees the man looking, it gets back into the object and takes off. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, p. 59)

March — Cuban air defense radar controllers report a UFO approaching Cuba from the northwest, moving at 660 mph at an altitude of 33,000 feet. Two MiG-21s are scrambled and are guided to within 3 miles of the object. The flight leader radios in that the UFO is a bright metallic sphere with no visible markings. He is unable to establish radio contact with it and Cuban air defense orders him to shoot it down. The flight leader reports that his radar is locked and missiles ready. Seconds later, a wingman screams into the radio that the flight leader’s MiG has disintegrated. The UFO then accelerates and climbs above 90,000 feet, heading towards South America. The US 6947th Security Squadron headquartered at Homestead AFB \[now Homestead Air Reserve Base\] in Miami–Dade County, Florida, is monitoring the incident and sends a report to the NSA at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. NSA orders the squadron to ship all tapes and data to them and list the airplane loss as “equipment malfunction.” The details sound like it might be the CIA’s Oxcart A-12, the Air Force version of which is the SR-71, which are known to overfly Cuba.

March 5 — 1:25 a.m. Lenny and Tommy Söderström are returning home to their farm in Lövåsen, Vilhelmina, Sweden, when they notice a “spaceship” behind a barn. They rush inside and wake their parents and a sibling. Looking through the kitchen window, they see a dark, cigar-shaped object, 82–130 feet wide, silhouetted against the sky. Wobbling slightly on its axis, it hovers 24 feet in the air. After someone turns on the kitchen light, the UFO shoots off toward the north, emitting a whistling sound, as a smaller object appears from behind it. This UFO is a silvery globe about 20–40 feet in diameter; it turns and approaches the farmhouse. When it passes above a power line, it stops and hovers for 4 minutes. It takes off toward the northeast.

March 7 — 12:30 a.m. Lucille Drzonek and her daughters, ages 24 and 17, are driving northwest on US Highway 20 just past Keeneyville, Illinois. Their beagle is with them. They see a solid object, estimated at 15 feet in diameter, outlined in bright white lights and with two big beams in front. As it nears the ground it takes on a disc shape and begins flashing red and green lights. The beagle is so frightened that its hair stands up straight on its back. As they turn off the highway toward Bartlett, Illinois, the object descends into a woods, lighting the trees with a red glare. It projects two white light beams into the rear window of their car. As they pull into their home, the UFO is hovering about 10 feet above a tree in their yard. A strange, localized gray mist appears and when it dissipates the UFO is gone. The beagle is visibly upset for the next two days. A veterinarian suggests he might have heard a noise inaudible to humans. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

March 8 — 1:05 a.m. Mr. and Mrs. William L. Wallace are returning home to Leominster, Massachusetts, when they pass through a dense fog near St. Leo’s Cemetery and notice a bright light on the left. Wallace turns the car around and heads back for a closer look. The glow is from a light that is hovering 400–500 feet above the cemetery. Intrigued, Wallace places the car in neutral, pulls the emergency brake, and steps outside. As he points toward the light, something pulls his arm back and drops it on the roof of the car, which then stalls and the electrical system goes out. He remains immobile for more than 30 seconds even as his wife is trying to pull him back. As the lights and radio come back on, the UFO rocks back and forth, rises with a humming sound, and disappears. Wallace goes back into the car, which now starts normally. Wallace still feels “slow and sluggish” on the drive back, and he collides with the garage door as he pulls into his driveway. They return to the cemetery 10 minutes later, but the fog is gone.

March 11–13 — Night. Red, green, and white lights are observed in the air by several witnesses at Tillamook, Oregon, including police and sheriff’s deputies. Radar contact is made in the same area as the visual sightings by the radar station at Mount Hebo Air Force Station \[now closed\]. On March 11, objects are observed for one hour. On March 12, they are again observed for one hour. On March 13, the objects are seen for four hours and 35 minutes. The radar returns show hovering and rapid movement of the targets. The visual sightings also show rapid movement of the objects at times. One radar sighting shows a rapid distance change from 39–48 miles within one minute.

March 12 — 7:15 p.m. Larry Burke sees an object with red, green, and white flashing lights southwest of McIntosh, South Dakota. He picks up three friends—Dick Makens, Junior Edinger, and Charles Warren—to go investigate. On a country road one mile west of town they see four blinding, fluorescent-green lights low above the road ahead. As they are driving up a hill, the car engine stops. Frightened, they let the car coast back down the hill, and the engine starts again. The witnesses disagree on the size, shape, and altitude of the lights.

Mid-March — Night. Future UFO researcher [Robert Hastings](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ufohastings.com/bio&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890014991576&usg=AOvVaw1iEW6-ctn5P3g4o1pWUpOo) has a part-time job as a janitor in Malmstrom AFB near Great Falls, Montana. One night as he is cleaning out the Radar Approach Control center, one of the FAA controllers calls him over to look at 5 unidentified targets that two jet fighters have gone up to intercept. Soon he is asked to leave and clean the room later. Later on, he hears that the targets ascended vertically, leaving the jets far behind, and that the incident takes place in the Judith Basin area many miles to the south. (Nukes 6–7, 279, 282–286)

March 16 — 8:30 a.m. At the Malmstrom AFB Echo-Flight missile launch facility between Winfred and Hilger, Montana, 1Lt Walter Figel, deputy crew commander of the Missile Combat Crew, sees one of his Minuteman missiles go into “no-go” status. He calls the missile site to see if there is scheduled maintenance and is told no. The guard tells him of a large, round object over the site. Within seconds, the nine other missiles shut down. Strike teams are dispatched to the two Launch Control Centers, where maintenance and security personnel tell them about the UFOs. The missiles are offline for the greater part of the day.

March 20 — 11:00 p.m. A man and his daughter living in Butler, Pennsylvania, take the car out to go looking for lights his wife had seen in the sky earlier. After stopping with the car lights off for a while, he sees two yellowish-white globes of light at 200 feet altitude, which start moving toward the car in a parallel course. The objects descend a quarter mile away, then shoot toward the witnesses at 70–80 mph. The daughter hears a “chorus of voices” in her head saying “don’t move” repeatedly. The man switches on the headlights, the lights disappear, and the voices stop. Moments later, 10 feet from the car, they see five figures standing in an irregular semicircle. The man gets into the car but the daughter continues staring at the figures, which have slits for eyes and mouths. All have long blond hair and are wearing something like baseball caps. They wear loose-fitting clothing. The witnesses drive away quickly and go to their minister’s home. (Robert A.

March 21 — A Brazilian military aircraft with 14 passengers encounters a glowing-red, oblong object over the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, while on its way to Salgado Filho Airport near Gravataí. The control tower operator there alerts pilots of a Cruzeiro do Sul aircraft coming in from the southwest. Minutes later these pilots see apparently the same object, which follows them for 25 minutes before zipping up into the sky. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, pp. 58–59)

March 21 — Night. Mary Beth Neufeld and three other teenagers are driving on US Highway 56 one mile west of Hillsboro, Kansas, when they see a bright object “like an upside-down cup on a saucer.” They start driving toward it, but it approaches them and hovers above the car for a few seconds. The car starts rocking and the engine quits. When the UFO leaves, they are able to start it up again.

March 22 — 11:00 p.m. Ann-Lis Danielsson is driving home to Tjuvkil, Västra Götaland, Sweden, when she notices a greenish illumination outside her car. Slowing down, she sees a disc about 15 feet in diameter hovering 500 feet away at an altitude of 1,500 feet. It begins to circle the area slowly, rising and sinking and giving off a whining noise. After pacing her for 15 minutes, it climbs vertically with an oscillating motion.

March 24 — 10:45 a.m. An astronomer at the Catalina Station observatory on Mount Bigelow 18 miles northeast of Tucson, Arizona, sees a white oval disc the apparent size of the moon moving silently in a straight line from northwest to northeast. It slowly changes from an elongated shape to a more circular one. He estimates its speed as 600 mph, size as 230 feet, and distance as 6–12 miles. It disappears after 50 seconds.

March 24 — Late evening. An airman with the Malmstrom AFB Oscar-Flight Launch Control Center for the SAC USAF 341st Strategic Missile Wing south of Roy, Montana, sees a star-like object zigzagging high above him. Soon, a larger and closer light appears and behaves similarly. He calls his NCO and the two men watch as the lights streak through the sky, maneuvering in impossible ways.

Salas is dubious and tells them to let him know if they get any closer. A few minutes later the NCO calls him again and shouts that a red, glowing UFO is hovering outside the front gate.

March 27 — Day. The crew of a Brazilian Air Force C-47 and the crew of a Serviços Aéreos Cruzeiro do Sul photo- mapping aircraft see a UFO in the vicinity of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The BAF crew describes it as a “reddish-colored full moon” that is flying in circles.

The object is about 12 feet wide at the base and 25 feet high, with a ball-shaped object at its top. Looking at the road ahead, Morris sees four or five large-headed humanoids moving rapidly back and forth about 50 feet ahead. He slams on his brakes, but it is too late. He feels a thump against the right front corner of his car and sees an arm with a thumbless mitten fly up, then down. The car stops 10 feet later; Morris thinks about providing assistance, but the otherworldliness of the situation causes him to get away quickly. In his rearview mirror he sees a group of the entities position themselves around something lying on the ground.

Low tries to find out if NORAD can help with identifying satellites that might be misreported as UFOs and whether NORAD can’t track a UFO entering the atmosphere from outer space (or just aren’t), but the analysts are evasive. NORAD says its satellite-tracking radars (with non-ballistic maneuvering and erratic flight paths) actually can “see” UFOs, but no one will ever know because the data that does not fit satellite or ballistic trajectories are thrown out automatically by system computers. No mention is made of NORAD’s high priority for not ignoring unpredictable, UFO-like maneuverable cruise missiles or hypersonic space planes.

elevation of about 30° approaching at a modest angular rate of 1° per second. It remains silent even as it passes above them. A second light, much fainter and blue in color, is following it. The second light turns away and moves south into the distance. The orange light continues eastward, then performs a tight 180° turn and returns to their zenith. It accelerates west and disappears from view. After about 20 minutes it disappears, followed by a thread of rippling blue light. The thread breaks into 7–8 individual blue lights, which exit in several directions. (John O. Williams, “Louisiana Lights in 1967,” IUR 22, no. 4 (Winter 1997–1998): 10–11)

April 4 — Carlo Cammarata watches a metallic object about 100 feet in diameter hovering some 20 feet above the terrace of his house in San Cataldo, Caltanissetta, Sicily, Italy. He also sees three humanoids wearing silvery suits and green belts with lights on them. They seem interested in the birds Cammarata is keeping caged on the terrace, touching them occasionally. They ascend into the object on a luminous beam and speed away. (1Pinotti 157)

April 5 — 7:45 p.m. Justice of the Peace John H. Demler is driving north on State Highway 72 just south of Lickdale, Pennsylvania, when his car’s engine sputters and stops and the lights go out. He sees an object approaching about 20 feet above the road. It is about 30 feet across and looks like “it had lights in back of a painted black glass.” It flies over the car as Demler lowers his window and he notices a smell of sulfur and oil. It emit a sound like an electric motor, which grows louder as it leaves the area. The UFO shoots off sparks similar to that of “grinding on an emory wheel.” The UFO comes to a stop alongside the car, tilts, starts off slowly, then puts on such a terrific burst of speed that Demler and his automobile seem to be pulled to it. The car settles down so fast that he is moved all the way across the front seat. When he looks up again, the object has “turned to a bluish tinge” and is far in the distance. The next day, the skin on his hands and feet begin to peel and Demler is a nervous wreck. His coworkers confirm he is in a state of physical or psychological shock for many hours.

It stops, descends to 100 feet, and hovers about 600–700 feet away. He shuts off the tractor but can hear no sound coming from the object, which has red flashing lights around its base. There is a small dome with portholes on the top. Suddenly it takes off to the north, the lights changing to green as it does so. Statenberg returns home badly shaken.

April 17 — 9:00 p.m. School principal John L. Metz and three teachers in separate cars are driving home in Jefferson City, Missouri, and see a 350–400 foot, bluish-white, WWI-helmet–shaped object come over the Missouri River bluff and move directly above their cars, bathing them in intense light. Metz observes it through 8x binoculars. The object hovers above power lines for about 10 minutes then heads toward the airport. Two smaller objects emerge from its base; they are disc- or helmet-shaped and the size of a DC-3. Metz drives to the airport on Highway 94 and finds two more witnesses. Jefferson City Memorial Airport employees watch a flat, circular, star- like orange light flashing an intermittent red-blue through a 30x 40mm telescope around 9:40–10:08 p.m. The Ozark Airliner Flight 319 crew sees two large round objects moving in various directions below their airplane during its final landing approach.

April 28 — 11:30 a.m. Brian F. Jenkins and seven other coast guards at Brixham, Devon, England, watch a huge, cone- shaped object through 25x binoculars mounted on a tripod. The object is hovering at 15,000 feet and seems to be revolving. Jenkins says the cone is pointing down, and the object seems made of glass or highly polished metal: “Near the bottom there was a triangular-shaped opening or door with a white rim on the top that reflected a lot of sunlight. The bottom was crinkled, very white, and seemed to consist of strips of metal hanging down.” It drifts to the northwest, rising to 22,000 feet and 8 miles away. At 12:40 p.m., a jet aircraft approaches it, flies above it, passes it, turns, and approaches it from below before it disappears from sight. Possible balloon.

April 29 — 7:40 p.m. Ian McGregor and two other oil drillers drive out to an airstrip near Mount Whaleback, Western Australia, to look for a UFO that has been appearing in the area for several nights. Toward the southeast a bright haze appears that turns into an inverted cone of light that is followed by an orange disc that rises vertically, turns on its edge, and approaches them. They flash their headlights and the object stops moving. It then returns in the direction it came from and lands in the same spot. Their compasses are not working accurately. They wait iuntil 11:30 p.m., but do not see it again. (L. J.

May — The CIA launches the Phoenix Program in Vietnam to gather information on the Viet Cong, whose members would then be neutralized (captured, converted, or killed). Emphasis for the enforcement of the operation is placed on local government militia and police forces, rather than the military. Heavy-handed operations—such as random cordons and searches, large-scale and lengthy detentions of innocent civilians, excessive use of firepower, torture, and targeted killings—have a negative effect on the civilian population. Between 1968 and 1972, Phoenix “neutralizes” 81,740 people (26,369 are killed) suspected of belonging to the National Liberation Front. The reported torture is carried out by South Vietnamese forces with the CIA and special forces playing a supervisory role.

May — A man identifying himself as Maj. Richard French visits a woman in Owatonna, Minnesota, who has had a UFO encounter the previous November. He is 5 feet 9 inches with an olive complexion and hair too long for an Air Force officer. He is wearing a fashionable gray suit, white shirt, and black tie. At one point, French complains of stomach problems, and the woman recommends Jell-O. He says he will return if the symptoms persist, so he shows up the following morning. The woman sits him down with a bowl of Jell-O, which he tries to drink. “I had to show him how to eat it with a spoon,” the woman tells [John A.

May — 12:30–3:15 p.m. During a reconnaissance exercise in Madagascar, a detachment of 23 officers and men serving with the French Foreign Legion watch a bright object landing in a “falling leaf” motion. When it touches down on tripod legs, the glow dissipates. The egg-shaped craft is 23–26 feet high and has no visible markings except for openings at the base through which flames are visible. The witnesses seem paralyzed or at least extremely distracted while the UFO is on the ground. When they recover their senses, they find that 2.75 hours have elapsed. For 2 days afterward, they all have violent headaches, a buzzing in their ears, and a throbbing in their temples. (H.

May — Evening. A woman in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, sees a light shining through her basement window. Across the street she notices a large object beaming with three colored lights and rotating. She goes outside with another woman and watch the slight slowly spin for 20 minutes above a neighbor’s house. When she tries to call the neighbors, all she gets is a busy signal, and when she looks outside again, the object is gone. The next day, the neighbor tells her that there was nothing wrong with the phone and that all evening she had been playing cards with friends and talking about UFOs. (Michael D.

May — Evening. A farmer near Holbæk, Denmark, is working outside when he sees a strange lilac-colored light.

Approaching, he sees a domed object with windows. Something is moving behind it. He goes home but returns to the spot the next day and finds an odd substance. It looks like “cotton wool,” but is finer than cotton. He leaves it in the same spot, but it dissipates over the next three days. There is also a depressed area where the object had been, and some wire is pulled away from some pylons.

May 1 — Night. A man’s car engine fails while he is driving near Peeltree, West Virginia. He sees a 40-foot-long elliptical object emerge from behind a shed and hover 15 feet from his car. It tilts toward the car at a 30° angle. He hears static on the radio, and the dashboard temperature gauge goes off the dial. He feels an intense wave of heat when he puts his head out the window, and his hands burn when he touches the horn rim and dashboard. He also reports headaches and a partial loss of vision.

It descends to a spot about 500 feet away and gives off an intense white-orange light from its cone-shaped body. The couple stops and shuts off their headlights. When the object approaches closer, the man turns the headlights on again. The UFO stops in midair and blinks its light off and on twice. The couple become frightened and drive to the nearest town.

He says he described the \[inspector general’s\] conclusions and that Johnson said: “Then you were not responsible for [Trujillo](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015034632&usg=AOvVaw3UgBrVBB_VetLeG77cZMB8)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015034818&usg=AOvVaw2s5s-_2Gx7YIivIxH8QROx) ‘No.’ Correct answer. ‘[Diem](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngo_Dinh_Diem&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015035026&usg=AOvVaw1DXY-QnWwSzuaqiQmV-jqE)?’ ‘No.’ Correct answer. ‘[Castro](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015035262&usg=AOvVaw3KsGC8UCjGcMyqRhpKyvbt)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015035448&usg=AOvVaw01jt-O1vuO2KxIN74qgg0i) he’s still alive, okay.’” At the same meeting Helms also tells Johnson about the mail interception program “and some other things that were going on.” Johnson’s response to that was equally laconic; he just nodded and said something along the line of, ‘But be careful, don’t get caught.’” (Thomas Powers, The Man Who Kept the Secrets: Richard Helms and the CIA, Random House, 1979, [pp. 156–157](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/manwhokeptsecret0000powe/page/156/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015035767&usg=AOvVaw12nNEuwsBH8BhbmCaEWcND))

May 13 — 1:43 a.m. Michael Campeadore is driving in Arizona about 17 miles southwest of St. George, Utah, when he hears a loud humming sound. After stopping the car and getting out, he notices a huge object, 45–50 feet in diameter, hovering 25–30 feet above him. He reaches into the car and gets a .25 caliber pistol, loads it, and fires point blank at the object. He hears the bullets hit and ricochet as they strike. Before he has finished the clip, the object begins moving off and disappears in seconds.

May 13 — 4:40 p.m. An object is picked up on radar at the Colorado Springs, Colorado, airport. A Braniff flight is coming in for a landing on runway 35. The track of the object behaves like a ghost echo, perhaps a ground return being reflected from the Braniff aircraft. The blip appears at about twice the range of the Braniff blip. When the Braniff airliner touches down, however, the situation changes radically. The UFO blip pulls to the right (east) and passes over the airport at an estimated height of about 200 feet. The object track passes within 1.5 miles of the control tower. The object is not visible even through binoculars by personnel in the control tower. The Colorado project finds this to be one of the most puzzling radar cases on record.

Mid-May — 11:00 p.m. Patricio Hanessian and Alfredo Padilla are driving in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, and see a flat-bottomed, domed object in the sky. The central part is bright white and the edge is bright pink or red. It holds its position for 2–3 minutes then moves away, reappearing about 500 feet in front of their car, where it hovers for 2 minutes before speeding off.

May 16 — 10:10 p.m. Ship Master Donald W. Dee and 3rd Mate Homer Hawthorne, seamen Earle Bradley and Eric Koster, all crew of the Pacific Coast Transport ship SS Point Sur, see six red point-source lights that seem to be pacing the ship over the Gulf of Mexico. One object is confirmed by sporadic radar returns as at 12,000 feet, 11 miles away. Through 7 x 50 binoculars, the objects appear brilliant yellow with red lights across upper two-thirds, but to the naked eye, the colors blend to reddish-orange point sources. They pulsate with a 4.5-second period and an approximate 1:3 brightness ratio. The lower objects rise and fall near the horizon.

May 20 — 12:15 p.m. [Stefan Michalak](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/204651773/stefan-michalak&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015045346&usg=AOvVaw1LcQNp3lo6_jiX_678lOjS) is quartz prospecting near Falcon Lake, Manitoba, when he sees two red, glowing, cigar-shaped objects in the sky. One object begins to hover then move away, while the other lands on a large, flat rock 160 feet away. The landed object is more than 35 feet wide and 10 feet thick with a 3-foot high cupola. It

* * *

goes through several color changes then appears like hot stainless steel with blinding purple-colored lights coming through slits in the cupola. It is making a whirring sound and warm air seems to be coming from it. Michalak sits and sketches the object for 30 minutes, then a small door opens on the side, revealing a lighted interior. Michalak walks to 60 feet away and hears voices inside. Thinking it is a US aircraft, he steps forward and shouts. “Okay, Yankee boys, having trouble? Come on out and we’ll see what we can do about it.” He says the same thing in five other languages. There is no response, so he puts green lenses over his glasses and looks inside, where he sees a series of flashing lights. He pulls his head back, noting that the wall is 18 inches thick. Almost immediately the opening closes. When his glove accidentally touches the surface, it burns and melts. The UFO angles upwards and he sees a 9-by-6 inch gridlike vent with a uniform pattern of small holes. A blast of hot gas erupts from the grid, searing his chest, sending him reeling backwards, and burning his shirt and undershirt. He rips the flaming clothing off just as the UFO ascends in a rush of air. It heads off to the west, the same direction the other UFO has gone. Michalak now has a headache and severe nausea, so he starts driving back to his motel. He eventually gets to Misericordia Hospital in Winnipeg and receives a sedative. His chest burn heals, but the gridlike burn lesions on his abdomen persist. The symptoms continue well into 1968, when Michalak visits the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, staying there 2 weeks and undergoing outpatient treatment. He relocates the landing site on June 30, 1967, and the RCAF visits it in July, noting a 15-foot circle of cleared vegetation on the flat rock.

Michalak obtains metal samples of unknown provenance from the site in 1968.

June — Night. Giuseppe Aldini, 17, is with his family in Montalcino, Siena, Italy, when he sees a round, luminous object from his window. Later he notices a glowing red light on a nearby hill. The next day he goes to the spot and finds a circular burned area 100 feet in diameter with four imprints in its center. Inside are many black minerals that are analyzed by the University of Florence’s Mineralogical Institute and found to be quartz crystals. (1Pinotti 157)

June 1 — The UFO seen by [José Luis Jordán Peña](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rr0.org/people/p/PenaJoseLuisJordan/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015058962&usg=AOvVaw0GrxzX1WlJ9Q9y3ZPzZFbT) in Aluche, Madrid, Spain, allegedly reappears in the neighborhood of San José de Valderas. This time, Jordán Peña plays UFO investigator, taking statements from witnesses who describe a low-flying disc-shaped object with the same strange symbol on the underside. An anonymous man takes several photographs that he drops off at a photo lab on June 2. He then calls newspaper photographer Antonio San Antonio, telling him where to pick them up. All but one show an edge-on view of what appears to be a large, squat disc with a rim through its midsection. One photo shows the bottom of the UFO with the Aluche symbol, this time with a horizontal bar crossing the verticals and linking the two arms. In August, another photographer calling himself Antonio Pardo produces two more photos of the edge-on disc taken the same day, as well as some hard green-colored plastic strips bearing the distinctive Aluche symbol supposedly found in a capsule that leaflets by a “Henri Dagousset” predicted in June would be found. Jordán Peña later confesses to hoaxing the plastic strips, which are made of Tedlar (polyvinyl fluoride) produced by DuPont for the US space program.

June 9 — Day. Two Spanish Air Force pilots flying Lockheed T-33s at 4,000 feet encounter a UFO over the Extremadura region, Spain. Attempts at radio contact fail, and when they fly above or below the object, their radios cease to function and emit interference noises. The UFO soon moves off, easily outstripping the jets, stopping and waiting for them to approach, then moving on again, The two pilots notify the Talavera la Real Air Base in Badajoz and Torrejón Air Base in Madrid, from which two faster fighters are scrambled. The new fighters experience the same radio interference and maneuvers until the object shoots straight up at high speed.

June 13 — 2:30 a.m. Carmen Cuneo, a mine worker in Caledonia, Ontario, steps out of the mine headquarters building and sees two strange objects near a pond in the vicinity of the mine dump. One is cigar-shaped and about 36 feet long with four windows along the side; a boom-like aerial protrudes from one side. The other is disc-shaped and about 15 feet across. Both are hovering 12 feet above the ground. Three small men wearing what look like miners’ hats with four amber lights are underneath the boom. After watching for 10 minutes, Cuneo goes back to find another witness, but when he returns the men are gone. The two objects, however, remain until 3:05 a.m. when they take off to the southwest, flashing multicolored lights.

June 18 — Several people in Mulluri, \[perhaps near Viña del Mar\], Chile, see three discs flying in a V formation above the town. They flash orange and blue lights alternately and make no sound. They maneuver for 10 minutes before disappearing at high speed. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, p. 61)

June 18 — Late evening. A family is returning home by boat near Clearwater Bay on Shoal Lake, Ontario, when they notice a bright oval object hovering 50 feet above the treetops about a half-mile away. As they approach, the object turns an orange tinge and suddenly sweeps toward their boat at great speed. They beat a hasty retreat to the other shore, while the UFO returns to its original position. The same thing happens when they approach the object again. After about 15 minutes, the object takes off at an incredible speed to the northwest. One resident, who is not aware of the UFO, reports later that the static on his radio was so bad that he had to turn it off. Wilted leaves on the top of birch, hazel, and chokecherry trees are discovered in the sighting area. Leaf samples are analyzed by the Canadian Department of Forestry, which cannot find an explanation for their condition other than heat. The University of Manitoba finds evidence of fungus on one sample but not on others. (J.

July — 10:00 p.m. A witness sees an intense orange light through the window of her home in the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia. She calls her mother and they go outside to watch a cigar-shaped light hovering, moving up and down slightly, and turning over on its side. It has portholes around its lower edge.

July 3 — 5:30 p.m. Warren Smith and two friends hiking in the mountains near Highwood Ranger Station, 50 miles southwest of Calgary, Alberta, take two color photos of a daylight disc that appears to be about 25 feet in diameter. The disc appears from less than 2 miles away and at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. It travels toward the hikers, gradually losing altitude, then at a distance of about one-half mile it hovers for a moment and an object appears to fall from it. It disappears from sight at treetop level at great speed. The photos are examined by both Canadian and American authorities; [Hynek](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015079627&usg=AOvVaw016JlxmCDKCI00Wg6qU8Re) describes them as some of the best photos on record at the time. An analysis by Canadian National Defence finds the object is an oblate ellipsoid with a diameter of 40–50 feet and a thickness of 11–14 feet. The witnesses sign statutory declarations to the effect that the photos are not a hoax; if proven false, they would be subject to prosecution under the Canada Evidence Act. Nevertheless, the Colorado Committee thinks the object could be a hoaxed hand-thrown model. Ground Saucer Watch declares it genuine.

July 3 — 7:15 p.m. Joe Ferriere sees a large, cigar-shaped object about 75–100 feet long hanging low in the sky above Woonsocket, Rhode Island. A peculiar piston-like apparatus appears to be pumping in and out of its left end. It is moving right to left in the manner of a pendulum. Before it moves off to the east, it releases a glowing disc- shaped object, about 12–15 feet in diameter. He takes a total of 6 photos of the objects.

It is bright metallic in color, about 50 feet in diameter, and traveling 100 mph at an altitude of 2,000– 3,000 feet. The red-orange color emanates from three lights on the rear side. After 5 minutes, the object blows up, leaving in its wake a “nearly pure white” cloud that dissipates. The witnesses see fragments falling to earth.

July 4 — 5:15 a.m. At least five witnesses from two independent locations about 5 miles west of Corning, California, see an oblong, metallic-appearing object with a brilliant light on top and a smaller light on the bottom near the front. Jay Munger, proprietor of an all-night bowling alley, and two police officers, Frank Rakes and James Overton, describe it as a dark-gray flattened sphere with a brilliant light beam on top directed upward, and a smaller and dimmer light on the bottom directed downward. A dark band circles the midsection. Two men north of Corning independently see the object. The witnesses estimate a diameter of 50–100 feet. At first the object appears to be hovering, then it moves slowly a few hundred feet above the ground, finally picking up speed and disappearing from view to the south after being visible for about 10 minutes.

July 5 — Night. A witness is driving five miles north-northeast of Murray Bridge, South Australia, on the Karoonda Highway when he notices interference on the car radio, which becomes a high-pitched whine. He turns the radio off. Within 300–450 feet, his car engine stops by itself. The ignition is on but the warning lights on the dash come on. Looking up, he sees a distinct break in the fog with stars visible and a “large dark shadow” at a height of 20 feet. The shadow seems 120 feet thick. Above it is a grayish-blue glow. The top of the shadow appears

convex. He stops the vehicle and gets out to look, but the shadow and light are gone. There is no sound, and the object has vanished. The witness returns to the vehicle, tries the ignition, and the motor works. There is no longer radio interference. (Herbert S.

July 6 — 6:00 p.m. An Air Canada DC-9 Vanguard has just taken off from its stop in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and is heading east. Air traffic controllers notice an unexpected radar return, also heading east, near the aircraft. In the space of 70 seconds, they watch the target accelerate from 800 to more than 4,000 mph before it zips off the scope near the town of Vivian. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, p. 126)

July 6 — 9:24 p.m. A radar operator in the airport at Kenora, Ontario, notes an unidentified target heading northeast. It approaches to about 40 miles, then turns and retreats to 50 miles away. At 9:35 p.m. another target appears, following an Air Canada flight; it turns northeast and disappears from the scope. At 9:53 p.m., an additional blip follows another Air Canada airliner before veering away to the northeast. None of the pilots see anything unusual.

July 7 — 7:00 p.m. Air traffic controllers at Winnipeg International Airport in Manitoba, while monitoring an eastbound Air Canada flight on radar, notice a target moving at high speed toward Kenora, Ontario. At 9:24 p.m., the same or a similar object is detected on the Kenora Airport radar headed northeast. For three hours the object executes various maneuvers, including 180° turns and twice follows Air Canada flights before resuming its northeast course and disappearing off the scope. (Gregory M.

July 7 — 11:30 p.m. Antonio Brambilla and another man watch a UFO land on some grass in a deserted part of the Rondò-Torretta quarter in Milan, Italy. A glow comes from the object, which is about 21 feet in diameter and 8 feet high. It has a dome on top and four telescopic legs with spheres on their tips. They feel a strange vibration that makes them weak, but the feeling dissipates as the legs of the UFO retract and it takes off. (1Pinotti 157)

July 13 — 11:26 p.m. Robert Richardson and Jerry Quay are driving near Whitehouse, Ohio. When rounding a bend, they encounter a brilliant blue-white light blocking the road. It appears to be a triangle 8 feet tall and 21 feet wide.

Richardson brakes and close their eyes. They feel a bump but can see nothing. The local police do not take the incident seriously. However, the accident is investigated by the state police and highway patrol, who find only skid marks at the scene. The next day Richardson returns to the site and finds a piece of metal in the road. Marks on his car hood and bumper suggest a collision with an object taking off. On July 18 and 23, Richardson is visited by mysterious men, those on the second occasion being foreign-looking, who make a threat against his wife.

July 26 — 8:38 p.m. Capt. Shindler is piloting Pacific Western Airlines Flight 748 westbound near the Westfall River in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. He notices a small pink light moving erratically at about 16,000 feet. It zips away after 18 minutes. Radar operators in Kamloops also observe the object.

July 30 — 6:15 p.m. The Naviero, a ship of the Argentine Shipping Lines Company, is 120 miles off the coast of Garopaba, Santa Catarina, Brazil, when Office Jorge Montoya notices a strange object in the ocean about 50 feet away on the starboard side. Capt. Julián Lucas Ardanza comes to the deck and sees a cigar-shaped UFO about 110 feet long, glowing blue and white. It paces the ship for 15 minutes, then suddenly dives and passes underneath the ship, vanishing in the depths. Chief Officer Carlos Lasca describes the object as a “submergible UFO with its own illumination.” (Oscar A.

It is later joined by a second similar object appearing to try to “steer” the first onto a “definite course.” Through binoculars the first object appears bright blue. A second independent observation from Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in the Mojave Desert locates an object visually and/or on radar to the west over Walker Pass (about 20 miles) and is reported to Edwards AFB. Thus the visual sighting lines intersect from opposite directions. A controller at Edwards uses RAPCON (Radar Approach Control) radar (or Boron AFS FPS-35 search radar) and confirms the visual report at China Lake but tries to dismiss the 115 mph target as merely civil aircraft that “frequently” fly over the area. The Kernville witnesses report by phone during their sighting to the Boron AFS ADC radar site. Blue Book claims the date of the sighting is in question because the questionnaire sent to the Petyaks uses the military time (Greenwich Meridian Time or Zulu time) instead of local time.

August — 2:00 a.m. A man is returning to his mother’s home in Wapakoneta, Ohio, when he sees a strangely bright star to the left of Polaris. As he watches, it grows a bit brighter and begins to move directly beneath Polaris and then continues to the right. It repeats this in reverse and then goes under Polaris and stops. The star then migrates north and south, tracing out the elements of a large cross. It does this several times rapidly. Then it comes back below Polaris and just sits there. After nearly 3 hours, the witness decides to stop watching. At that, the star goes up to Polaris and shoots away to the left. (Michael D. Swords, “We Know Where You Live,” IUR 30, no. 2 (January 2006): 11)

August 3 — 8:00 p.m. Amauri Barbosa da Silva and Jonil Faydit Vieira are driving on the road to Japeri from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when they see several yellowish lights that eventually extinguish themselves, one at a time. Later, they see similar lights positioned directly in front of them. Da Silva blinks his headlights, and the lights respond similarly. The lights maintain their position in front of them, moving from one side of the road to the other. When they are approaching Miguel Pereira on a mud road between Arcádia and La Chaumiere, they see two bright beams of light, one yellow and one blue, about 1,000 feet away from them on the right, apparently attached to the dome of a disc. The object follows them for at least 40 minutes and is seen by Nelson Gonçalves Ferreira at their destination in Miguel Pereira. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, pp. 16–21)

August 3 — 11:30 p.m. A married couple and their teenage son are sleeping in their car outside their home in Caracas, Venezuela. They wake up and see a white, disc-shaped object hovering 100 feet above a nearby palm tree. Within a few minutes, an opening appears in the UFO, and a smaller lightbulb-shaped object emerges and drifts downward, stopping just inches from the ground near their front porch. A door slides open and a small, glowing figure steps out, who bends over, picks up some stones, examines them, and looks up at the larger object, apparently communicating with someone. He looks toward their car frequently. After a few minutes, the figure reenters the small object, which returns to the large disc and enters it. The disc speeds away and disappears in seconds.

August 4 — Early morning. An engineer, Hugo Sierra Yepez \[or Yepes\], is fishing from his boat in the sea about 15 miles north of Arrecife \[or La Guaira\], Vargas, Venezuela, when he feels a vibration and the water begins to boil “in big bubbles, in a circle about six meters in diameter.” A gray-blue, flat globe emerges. As it hovers close to the surface, dripping water, he notices a revolving rim with triangular windows of blue and red. It ascends in a curve then shoots upward.

Jones finds two more rings. The marks vary from 5 to 7 inches wide and from 31 feet 9 inches to 36 feet 3 inches, and each is incomplete on its western side. He is puzzled as to what made the marks, can find no evidence of a hoax, and seriously considers whether an aerial object could have made them.

August 6 — 7:55–8:20 p.m. Formations of lights in groups of 3–5 are seen in many states of Mexico, including Tamaulipas, Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Veracruz, and Lake Pátzcuaro in Michoacán. Most are generally moving west to east. Many people at the Mexico City International Airport watch a group between 8:10 and 8:20 p.m.

Technicians in the control tower can make out 9–10 objects through binoculars. Capt. Angel Fojo Ceballos and Capt. José Luis Espejo are flying an Aeronaves de México \[now Aeroméxico\] DC-9 at 23,000 feet over Salamanca, Guanajuato, Mexico. They see three bright points flying in formation from northwest to southeast an estimated 30–40 miles away. They cross the horizon at 55,000–60,000 feet in 40–45 seconds. One of the objects

August 8 — Evangelical pastor Estanislao Lugo Contreras is on the shore at Catia La Mar, Vargas, Venezuela, when he sees the water stirring up in a vast round area. The water begins to turn light blue, then whitish, yellowish, then brilliant orange. An orange disc rises out of the sea about 1,650 feet from shore, hovers, then rises obliquely and disappears. It makes an intense buzzing sound. (Lorenzen, UFOs over the Americas, Signet, 1968, pp. 54–55)

August 8 — 8:40 p.m. An object shaped like a sharply outlined asymmetrical crescent flies over the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station near Kislovodsk, North Caucasus, Russia. The object is slightly smaller than the moon with a color described as reddish by some observers, yellow by others. It flies from west to east about 20° above the horizon, moving from the Big Dipper to Cassiopeia in about 30 seconds at a uniform speed.

They are awakened by their dog barking outside. They look out the window and see a large, fluorescent, half-moon-shaped object in a neighboring pasture about 450 feet away. It is shining a beam of light at a milk house only 25 feet from their camper. The dog has stopped barking and they can hear none of the usual night sounds. After about one hour, they hear the sound of someone walking in the gravel and sand outside. Three times the footsteps are heard going from north to south. The Miedtkes remain in bed, hoping no one would know they are in the camper. After another hour, just before dawn, they hear the dog whimpering and barking, followed by the muffled noise like a huge generator that fades away after 6–8 seconds.

August 13 — 8:00 p.m. Between Pilar de Goiás and Crixás, Goiás, Brazil, a plantation worker at the Estancia de Santa Maria, Ignácio da Souza, is returning home from work when he and his wife see an object in the form of an upside-down basin 115 feet in diameter sitting on the landing strip of the ranch. They initially think it is some flying machine tested by the ranch owner, Ibiracy de Moraes, a wealthy man and former president of the Bank of Brazil. Between the object and the couple, there are three humanoid, child-size beings that they initially think are naked children before realizing that they are hairless creatures wearing a tight suit of yellow. The beings seem to be playing around silently, but then move quickly towards them. Da Souza tells his wife to lock herself up in their house. He is armed with a rifle and frightened, so da Souza shoots the closest of the beings. At the same time, the UFO emits a ray of green light that hits him, throwing him to the ground unconscious. Seeing her husband fall from the kitchen window, his wife runs onto the scene shouting, interposes herself between the beings and the body of her husband, and picks up his rifle. But during this time the beings have retrieved the one that had fallen to ground and quickly flee to enter the craft. After a short time, it slowly rises vertically while emitting a buzz similar to that of a swarm of bees. Taken to the hospital of Goiânia, the state capital, de Souza suffers from nausea and a general numbness. Burns are noted, initially attributed to a toxic plant, but when de Souza and de Moraes hear the erroneous diagnosis and are told what had happened, doctors perform a blood analysis that returns with a diagnosis of advanced leukemia with life expectancy of two months. Da Souza quickly deteriorates, suffers, develops yellowish spots, and dies on October 11. In accordance with his instructions, his wife burns the bed, the mattress, and the clothing that he has used.

Mid-August — About 12:00 noon. Electrical engineer Albert Fulton and superintendent Sherman Anderson are making rounds at the Nova Scotia Light and Power substation in Caledonia, Nova Scotia. They notice steam rising from one of three large transformers, then Fulton spots two silvery disc-shaped objects maneuvering around the sky some distance away. The pair watches them a they zip back and forth in different directions from horizon to horizon in 3–4 seconds. Each time they leave a silvery line about 10 times their length behind them, which disappears when the objects stop. They watch this spectacle for about one minute, then both discs come to a common point in front of a suddenly visible gray, cigar-shaped object. After stopping briefly the two smaller objects merge into the cigar, taking 12–15 seconds. The large object disappears. (Herbert S.

August 23 — 4:00 a.m. Stanley Moxon is driving on Ontario Highway 15 between Joyceville, Ontario, and Pine Grove Road when he sees a green light in a field to the south. He turns off his lights and drives down a side road to get closer. Minutes later, he turns on his lights again and they shine on a huge metallic disc hovering just above the ground. Two entities, 4 feet tall and dressed in white suits and helmets, appear to be startled and hurry back into the craft, which takes off at tremendous speed.

August 23 — 8:00 p.m. Two 15-year-olds are strolling around the Kolmården ridge area in Östergötland, Sweden, when they see a reddish glow moving back and forth in the nearby woods. Continuing home, they run across a locked, deserted shack that seems to have some yellowish lights moving around in one room and noises like muted thuds. The red glow reappears moving close to the ground from the west. Suddenly it turns brilliant white and appears to land on the other side of a brook. They run home and see a huge light like a flashlight hovering 13 feet above the ground near the house. They hear a whistling sound coming from the brook and what seem to be footsteps coming toward them. They run to a ravine where they see, about 35 feet away, a small being with a disproportionately large head and wearing dark clothing. It lifts its arms and seems to be holding a box-like apparatus with a tube.

Two thin, wire-like bands appear around the creature’s ankles and give off an intense white light. They run home again. The next day they return to where the being was and find some odd three-toed footprints about 6 inches long.

August 24 — 5:00 p.m. Ron Hydes is riding his motorcycle near Wodonga, Victoria, Australia, when he is surrounded by a blinding blue-white light that illuminates the road. As he stops, a bright lens-shaped domed disc, estimated to be 25–30 feet in diameter, descends within a few feet of the ground about 100 feet away. Two humanoids about 5–

5.5 feet tall with round helmets and silver coveralls emerge. One steps nearer to the witness, who flees. The object, surrounded by a pinkish glow, follows the motorcycle at about 100 feet off the ground. Hydes can hear a humming sound above the motorcycle’s engine. He stops again and the object hovers, the hum subsiding. After 30 seconds, the color around the object changes from pink to brilliant red, and it tilts up at a 45° angle, then shoots away.

August 27 — 11:20 p.m. Kenneth Flack is passing a car near Texas Creek, Colorado, when his engine and car lights fail. He pulls to the side of the road, along with the car he is passing and a camper-trailer. He sees a large object in a field some 900–1,200 feet away. It is football-shaped and silvery. He approaches it on foot and is hit by a bright light coming from the object that knocks him out. Bystanders from other cars carry him back to the roadside and tell him that he had been frozen in a standing position for 5 minutes.

He meets a dwarf, 3 feet tall, with a big head and bulging, reddish, glowing eyes, wearing a silver-colored, metallic-looking coverall. Andrade points his automatic weapon at the creature, but a voice from a hovering disc says in Spanish that he should not harm the creature. The dwarf then tries to convince Andrade to “come to their world,” adding it is “very distant and much larger than the Earth, and with many advantages for Earthlings.” When Andrade declines, the creature flies back into the object, which takes off.

September 6 — 9:50 p.m. Several witnesses at Meir, Stoke-in-Trent, England, see a vertically oriented “sausage-shaped cloud” in the eastern sky, behind which a light flashes for about 20 seconds at irregular intervals. A bright, glowing orange oval then emerges from the cloud and heads southeast at “fantastic speed.” A light again flashes in the cloud for about 10 seconds, then stops. The mode of disappearance of the cloud is not reported. (Roger Stanway and Anthony R. Pace, Flying Saucer Report, UFOs: Unidentified, Undeniable, Newchapel Observatory, 1968, pp. 14–15; Herbert S.

The animal appears to have been skinned from the neck to the shoulders, which are nothing but bleached bones. The cut in the neck looks smooth and surgical. The soil beneath the horse is damp, and there is a medicine-like smell. A nearby bush is flattened oddly. Alamosa County Sheriff Ben Phillips blames Lady’s death on lightning. A few days later, rangers at Great Sand Dunes arrest [John Henry Altshuler](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rr0.org/people/a/AltshulerJohnHenry/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015123619&usg=AOvVaw1HqFud00y2Ifr_TfClwhoa), a pathologist at Ross Medical Center in Denver, for trespassing after dark; he has actually gone to the area to look for UFOs. When they find out he is a specialist in blood coagulation, they say they will drop the arrest record if he takes a look at the dead horse. He finds that Lady’s lungs, heart, and thyroid are completely missing and finds the complete absence of blood distressing. Altshuler begins to think the dead horse has something to do with the UFOs he had seen when he was in the Great Sand Dunes. Nellie Lewis also admits she has been watching something in the sky every night. [Duane Martin](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/69050807/duane-edwin-martin&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015123908&usg=AOvVaw0ADPnYt0HhQ57x438UBtxQ), a US Forest Service ranger, records a pulse of unusually high radioactivity near Lady’s carcass, although others think it is only background radiation. The Pueblo Chieftain reports on the case in its October 5 edition and it gets picked up by the AP. Pathologist Robert O. Adams, chief of surgery at Colorado State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, investigates Lady for the Colorado project and concludes that bacteria, birds, and coyotes are responsible for the lack of blood and organs. He finds an infection in the horse’s right flank that could have killed it; the cut at the neck might have been someone’s mercy killing. “Exhaust marks” found are probably fungal infestations, and indentations are probably weathered hoofprints. Alamosa veterinarian Wallace Leary later finds evidence of two bullet holes in Lady’s rump.

September 11 — 3:30 p.m. About a dozen employees of the Douglas Point Nuclear Generating Station near Kincardine, Ontario, watch a UFO pass over the plant in an easterly direction. At one point it hovers above Lake Huron about a mile and a half offshore and drops something into the water. Other plant workers see similar objects over the lake or above the plant on five succeeding nights. The plant isn’t operational for another year.

September 14 or 17 — 10:50 a.m. “Fábio Jose Diniz,” 16, is walking along an asphalt path near the deserted grounds of an isolation unit at Hospital da Baleia on the outskirts of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. He notices an object in an adjacent football field. It is shaped like a mushroom with a domed top and surrounded by a row of portholes and a thick central “stalk” in contact with the soil. A hazy screen like a force field drops around the object, and a door appears out of nowhere and slides upward along the column. Two humanlike figures, 6 feet tall, emerge, dressed in one-piece diving suits of greenish material and helmets. One of them carries a tube-like implement, and the other has a probe sticking up from his helmet and talks to Diniz in Portuguese, telling him not to run away. He starts running anyway, but the figure tells him to come back the next day or they will take his family. The figure reenters the UFO, which takes off vertically. He sees psychologist and UFO researcher [Hulvio Aleixo](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/MUFON/Pratt/BrazilianUFOlogists.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015130022&usg=AOvVaw0b5uMN9OEqlLEKI5dwq3fq), who says he is in severe shock.

September 18 — 1:00 a.m. Russell Hill is stationed as a forestry lookout at the Raspberry Ridge station near Mount Burke, Alberta. He hears a strange pulsating sound as a green light sweeps the walls of the lookout cabin. He sees an object hovering to the southwest and giving off a greenish glow. He attempts to radio the nearby Highwood Ranger Station, but the radio ane lights do not work. The object turns white and shoots up straight into the sky.

September 20 — 8:30–9:30 p.m. Seven people in Stoke-on-Trent, England, see a large, bright, silver-colored, oval-shaped object almost overhead and moving slowly to the northeast. It stops and hovers, then 2–3 smaller silvery objects emerge from the larger one and move rapidly away in different directions. The large UFO moves off to the northeast and slowly disappears.

September 20 — 10:30 p.m. Mrs. Charles Pasko notices a peach-pink glow in the woods outside her home near Winsted, Connecticut. Thinking it is a fire, she wakes up her son Jack and they watch it for a while. Three days later her husband and a forest ranger try to find the burned spot. They locate a burned and depressed teardrop-shaped area about 35 feet in diameter. They also find three triangular imprints forming an equilateral triangle with sides 10 feet long, and a fourth depression in the center. Other witnesses had seen a UFO coming in at a slant, breaking and burning tree leaves. Several tall trees in the area are broken off at the top.

September 28 — 1:30 a.m. Omar Amaya T., chief dispatcher at the Maiquetia International Airport \[now the Simón Bolívar International Airport\], Venezuela, watches three luminous disc pass across the sky from north to south. Suddenly one lags behind and dives toward the sea but veers up just before contact. Resuming its position in the formation, it joins the other objects as they disappear to the east.

October 4 — From early evening until 11:30 p.m., numerous independent witnesses observe unexplained aerial activity in Nova Scotia. Near Sambro at 9:00 pm, Capt. Leo Howard Mersey and 20 crewmembers of the MV Nickerson see four brilliant red lights in a rectangular formation that appear to be on or just above the water. Occasionally one flares up so brightly that it causes an afterimage in their eves. The objects are also tracked on ship’s radar. They file a report with the Lunenburg CMP office. Between 11:00 and 11:30 pm, northwest of Brier Island, the captain and crew of a fishing vessel see a brilliant white light the size of the moon. As they watch, three brilliant yellow lights emerge and form a triangle around the larger light. The satellite objects then move across the sky and back at high speed. Observations are also made by other vessels. Five miles southwest of Weymouth, a policeman and three game wardens see an orange-colored light just above the tree line moving silently and slowly with spark-like objects emanating. At about 11:20 p.m., just west of Shag Harbour, [Laurie Wickens](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.superstitioustimes.com/shag-harbour-witness-cleans-up-interpretative-centre-after-breakin/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015143408&usg=AOvVaw1QgfaCOgS9UeNYh4kLxSkY) and four other teenagers driving in a car along Highway 3 see an object flying low, flashing four lights one after the other, in a straight line. It appears to be slowly descending at a 45° angle. Multiple witnesses hear a whistling sound “like a bomb,” then a “whoosh,” and finally a loud bang. When next seen by the teens, the object has hit the water’s surface 820– 980 feet offshore. It drifts on the surface, showing a pale-yellow light. Wickens contacts the RCMP detachment in Barrington Passage and reports he has seen a large airplane or small airliner crash into the waters off Shag Harbour. Within about 15 minutes, 10 RCMP officers arrive at the scene. Concerned for survivors, the RCMP detachment contacts the Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax to advise them of the situation and ask if any aircraft were missing. Before any attempt at rescue can be made, the object starts to sink and disappears from view. A rescue mission is quickly assembled. Within half an hour of the crash, local fishing boats go out to the crash site in the waters of the Gulf of Maine off Shag Harbour to look for survivors. No survivors, bodies, or debris are found, either by the fishermen or by a Canadian Coast Guard search and rescue cutter, which arrives about an hour later from nearby Clark’s Harbour. By the next morning, RCC Halifax has determined that no aircraft are missing. The same morning, RCC Halifax also sends a priority telex to the Air Desk at Royal Canadian Air Force headquarters in Ottawa, which handles all civilian and military UFO sightings, informing them of the crash and that all conventional explanations such as aircraft or flares have been dismissed. The head of the Air Desk, Squadron Leader William Bain sends another priority telex to the Royal Canadian Navy headquarters concerning the “UFO report” and recommends an underwater search be mounted. The RCN in turn sends another priority telex tasking Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic with carrying out the search. A detachment of RCN divers from Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic is assembled on the [HMCS](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMCS_Victoriaville_(K684)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015144052&usg=AOvVaw1n5P8njZcpfqJx0LGmh4If) [Granby](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMCS_Victoriaville_(K684)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015144345&usg=AOvVaw0DCdsvmtmuLhLhvv6SZMHr) on October 6 and for the next three days they comb the seafloor looking for an object. The final report says no trace of an object is found. In the 1990s, researcher [Chris Styles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/styles-chris/73410&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015144747&usg=AOvVaw3F8ZTsweFCEMbJyy6vClWv) finds evidence that there is a second crash the same night. Witnesses see American naval exercises in Shelburne Harbour 30 miles to the northeast. Speculation is that the original object may have traveled underwater from Shag Harbour to Shelburne.

October 9 — 5:40 p.m. The 13-year-old son of a prominent businessman is riding a bicycle along a wash in the back of his home in the area of the Tucson Speedway in Arizona. He comes across a cylindrical metallic object standing on end and sitting on two legs about 44 feet away from him. The legs end in circular pads and are joined by a curved bar. The object, which is making a low-pitched hum, is about 8 feet tall and more than 2 feet wide. The boy approaches it for a better view, but it takes off vertically and disappears in 12 seconds. He finds two impressions in the hard surface of the wash, 13.4 inches across and about 42 inches apart (measuring from the outer edges).

They also meet with Boulder Daily Camera journalist R. Roger Harkins, who has been covering the Colorado project. They give him a 7-point rationale on why the CIA might be interested in UFOs, just to see if it gets published. Harkins dictates the story to the Associated Press, but it is never published. The Lorenzens suspect the project has a CIA mole. (Low did work for the CIA in 1949 when it was aiding Albanian resistance fighters.)

He obtains their names. They ask him about his 1965 photos and topics like the Bermuda Triangle. He notices a figure in the back seat of their car and a violet glow. Heflin thinks he is being photographed or recorded. The FM radio acts strangely. ()

October 11 — 8:00 p.m. Nora Tibbs is driving on Highway 2 near Aldersyde, Alberta, when the headlights, radio, and car engine stop. She notices an oval-shaped object with a turret on top that begins to circle her car. It has two white lights and a lighted-up underside. It circles the car four or five times at a height of 1,000 feet, then flies away. The witness feels cold during the sighting. The car engine starts by itself as the object leaves.

One is fiery red, while the other two are bright green. The objects dart about sideways, backwards, in circles, in jagged lines, and in formation. When Gregory’s writer, Jim Saunders, signals with a flashlight, the objects seem to respond by moving in the same direction as the beam. The partygoers watch the lights for about 40 minutes. Gregory takes two Polaroid photographs that show a red object at the top and two green ones at the bottom.

They then notice a triangular shape beneath the light. Thirty seconds later it moves upward to the west, increasing its speed. The triangular shape fades, and Hollander notices a white glow (“definitely an ionization color”) behind it. It disappears at an extreme altitude after 3 minutes. (NICAP case file)

October 14 — 7:45 p.m. A father and son are returning from a fishing trip when they notice an odd orange object like a “haystack on fire” landed in the desert near Ouray, Utah. They stop, get out of the car, and watch. The object lifts off immediately, looking like a half-moon in shape and size. It then goes over to the Moon and flies a loop around it, keeping its flat side down. Then it flies across the Moon’s face and leaves to the northwest. (Frank B.

October 21 — 6:16 a.m. Two control tower operators and an observer at the south end of the runway at Blytheville Air Force Base \[now Arkansas International Airport\] in Blytheville, Arkansas, see two dark oblong objects flying east to west at about 1,200–1,500 feet. They are tracked by RAPCON radar for 2 miles. They make a turn to the southwest and disappear.

October 21 — 10:00 p.m. Ivan Ritter, Jerry Bennet, and two other teens are driving east out of Duncan, Oklahoma, on the new State Highway 7. They see something in the road ahead, far out of the range of their headlights. When the driver turns on his high-beam lights, they see three men who seem to fly off the road and disappear. They are about 4 feet tall and wearing tight-fitting blue-green clothing. Their faces appear human, but with large ears. The next morning, Ritter and Bennet look around for evidence at the landing site, but all they find is a small, four-toes footprint in the muddy bottom of a creek bed about 300 feet from the road.

October 22 — Night. Edward Fortney and another real-estate agent are locking up for the night in Charleswood, a suburb of Winnipeg, Manitoba, when they notice a formation of brilliant red, pulsating lights above an adjacent field.

They are joined by six other people who have stopped their car to look at the lights. Two similar lights appear and take up a position near the formation. The objects then rise and move away noiselessly in formation. Floating above Canada Highway 100, they appear to change positions, forming a perfect triangle. Fortney looks at them through binoculars and sees dark rectangular objects that the lights are attached to. The formation dips and bobs toward a line of high-voltage towers half a mile away. The three lights in triangular formation break up and form a single file, the wires and towers lighting up with a red glow as they speed over them. They are last seen traveling northwest. On his way home, Fortney experiences a “skullbuster” headache that lasts until midnight.

The next day, he visits the site in the field and finds child-like footprints in the moist soil, 7 inches long and under 3 inches wide, leading to and from a peculiar circular pile of fist-sized stones. The heel marks seem deeply impressed in the soil. Fortney also experiences leg and back pain, sunburn on his face and hands, and a yellow- green coating on his tongue.

October 24 — 4:00 a.m. Two police constables, Roger Willey and Clifford Waycott, chase a bright cross-shaped light in their patrol car at 90 mph between Holsworthy and Hatherleigh on the A307 road, Devon, England. The object appears to land behind some trees, but takes off before they can reach the site, though they approach to within 120 feet of the object. The UFO is later observed to rendezvous in the sky with a similar object. Other policemen report a UFO on this day and the following day.

Putnam, a brakeman on a train running from Truro, Nova Scotia, to Moncton, New Brunswick, when he sees a disc with green vapor billowing from it pacing the train at treetop level near Wentworth Station, Nova Scotia. Putnam feels an intense blast of radiation, forcing him to cover his face with his hands to look at it. The object soon drifts away from the train, tips to a 45° angle, then turns to a vertical poistion. A jet arrives, seemingly in pursuit, and the object levels out, taking on the appearance of a cigar-shaped cloud.

Both fly out of sight to the west after 35 minutes of observation. One week later, the hair on the back of Putnam’s

October 26 — 11:25 a.m. J. B. W. “Angus” Brooks, a former BOAC pilot and photo interpreter, is walking his Dalmatian and German shepherd at Moigne Downs near Ringstead Bay, Dorset, England. An odd-looking craft descends and hovers at an altitude of 200–300 feet at a distance of about a quarter mile from them for 22 minutes. The German shepherd has been foraging for game; when she returns she seems “distraught” as she stands beside Brooks. Her ears are pricked, indicating she is worried about the sounds she is hearing, although Brooks can detect no sound from the object. The odd-shaped craft has a central round chamber estimated to be 25 feet in diameter and 12 feet thick. Four long slender fuselages (estimated 75 feet long and 8 feet wide) extend from the central chamber. In flight, one of the 4 fuselages leads, while the other three are together in the rear. As the object slows to hover, the fuselages move to form a cross. The object rotates 90°, then remains motionless for 22 minutes despite strong winds. Upon departure, the leading fuselage is not the one that led on approach. The remaining 3 fuselages come together in the rear as on the approach, and the object climbs away with increasing speed. The craft appears translucent, taking on the color of the sky above it. There are dark shadows along the bases of the fuselages and the center chamber. On future visits to this area, the German shepherd appears nervous.

It approaches on a collision course and is seen to be a gray equilateral triangle with a triangular opening at its center. The object makes an unbanked 180° turn, then takes off and disappears in a flash. (Willy Smith, “A Huge ‘Open’ Triangular UFO,” IUR 9, no. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1984): 4–6; Philip J.

October 27 — 3:00 a.m. A waitress driving home in Parshall, North Dakota, sees a large, round, revolving object with alternating triangular areas of coloration. The object is low and moving horizontally an estimated two blocks away. As it paces her car, she sees 2–3 white light beams coming down vertically from the object. Her car drives like it has flat tires or rocks that are hitting the bottom of the chassis. A second witness, police Lt. Glen G. Brunsell, sees a low-altitude, bright round light like a welding-torch that illuminates the ground. The object moves slowly with vertical oscillations and changes color from blue to green-white. It departs vertically, disappearing in 5 seconds.

October 27 — 2:20 p.m. Timothy Robinson, 13, and his family are startled by the roar of a jet aircraft overhead at Winchester, Hampshire, England. He dashes out into the garden and sees two English Electric Lightning fighters fly low overhead. Ahead of the aircraft is a black, mushroom-shaped object streaking away to the west. It changes direction abruptly to the northwest and disappears into a cloud, climbing steeply and outmaneuvering the Lightnings.

He is approached by a lighted object from the sky. A beam of light comes from a “tube” on the object and immerses the car. Almost immediately, the car stops dead. However, there is no feeling of deceleration. The vehicle’s motor, lights, and radio go off. Spargo hears no noise. The tube seems 2–3 feet in diameter. It is not uncomfortable to the eyes. After about 5 minutes, the tube closes off and the object disappears. His vehicle is suddenly going at 60–65 miles per hour again, with no feeling of acceleration. The object is only seen from underneath, but he estimates its diameter as 30 feet and about 100 feet up in the air. It glows an iridescent blue.

November 2 — 9:30 p.m. Navajo ranch hands Willie Begay and Guy Tossie, both 23, are driving south of Ririe, Idaho, on US Highway 26 when they are blinded by a flash of light. Their car comes to a stop, and immediately in front of them they see an object 6–8 feet in diameter and 3 feet thick, hovering 5 feet off the ground and shaped like two saucers joined together. Around the rim is a row of alternately flashing orange and green lights. On top is a transparent dome, where two small entities are visible. The dome flips open, and one occupant floats out and approaches the car. It is 3 feet tall, bald, with ears set high on its head, round eyes, and a mouth like a slit. It is wearing tight-fitting coveralls and carries a pack on its back. It opens the car door and sits behind the wheel as Begay and Tossie move in horror to the right. The car begins to move as if fastened to the craft into a field of wheat stubble where Tossie gets out and runs toward the farmhouse of [Willard Hammon](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8575628/willard-joseph-hammon&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015175727&usg=AOvVaw0m4xG8VfU-BJttyK_cca4l) for help, followed by another entity apparently holding a light. Begay stays in the front seat of the car with the first entity, who tries to communicate with him, twice saying something in a high, chirruping voice. The second entity returns, and the two float back to the craft, which rises and departs, a yellow flame-like light coming from the bottom. Hammon lets Tossie inside his farmhouse, where he eventually calms down and tells his story. They go back to the site, where they find Begay in a state of shock in the car. At 11:30 p.m., an anonymous witness driving between Ririe and Rigby, Idaho, sees a landed UFO with a small occupant who stops the car and taps on the side window.

November 6 — 1:30 a.m. On a section of the A338 road \[now B3347\] south of Sopley, Hampshire, England, truck driver Karl Farlow (or Barlow) finds that the lights on his diesel truck have failed. As he pulls over, he sees a glowing, 15-foot-wide, egg-shaped UFO that moves slowly across the road from the right, passes slowly to the left, then speeds up and disappears. The object makes a sound like a refrigerator and gives off a smell like a drill boring through wood. Before it goes away, a Jaguar sports car comes from the opposite direction, and its engine stalls and lights fail. The UFO glows a vivid green color. The diesel engine is not affected. The driver of the Jaguar is a veterinary surgeon, and he and Farlow call the police from a nearby call box. The witnesses note that there are marks on the ground and the road surface seems to have melted. The veterinarian’s girl passenger is taken to a hospital suffering from shock. A week later, Farlow notices that a 200-foot stretch of the road at the encounter site has been completely resurfaced and the call box has been repainted.

November 17 — 6:00 p.m. David Seewaldt, 13, is crossing a vacant lot in Calgary, Alberta. He hears a high-pitched sound and sees a slivery gray UFO the size of a house about to land. A beam of light shoots from it, putting him in a “trance” and pulling him into the craft, where he meets two hideous-looking entities with brown crocodile skin, slits for mouths, and holes for noses and ears. They wear no clothes and have hands with only four fingers. They take Seewaldt’s clothes off and lead him into another room where one studies his hair, eyes, and nose. An orange ceiling light is directed on him and he is given a shot with a small needle. The entities dress him again and beam him back to the field. He runs home in a state of terror and hides under the bed. All conscious memory of the event vanishes until 5 months later, when it returns in a dream. In 1968 he is hypnotically regressed by a Dr. Masson of the University of Alberta. (W. K.

November 22 — 12:30 p.m. Ladislau Schmidt is sitting in his kitchen in Petrila, Romania, with the outside door open. Suddenly his chickens run inside the house, terrified. Looking up, he sees a silvery disc-shaped object with a dome and antennas hovering at 15,000 feet. It rotates and moves away at high speed to the northwest until it is out of sight.

Late 1967 — The Institute for Aerospace Studies at the University of Toronto, Ontario, begins a UFO study. By October 1968, it is on the verge of collapse for “lack of something to investigate.” The study terminates in 1970, but no report on its findings is ever released.

December 2 — 9:30 p.m. A lieutenant-major in the Romanian army is on duty in the radar station at Băneasa Airfield \[now Aurel Vlaicu International Airport\] near Bucharest, Romania, when he goes outside to observe an airplane. But the supposed aircraft is a strong, stationary light 30–40° in the north that descends rapidly, ascends again, moves left to right, then descends again. Through binoculars it looks conical or bullet shaped. Dozens of other personnel watch it until it disappears around 11:30 p.m. (Hobana and Weverbergh 176–177)

December 3 — Early a.m. Police Sgt. [Herbert Schirmer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Schirmer&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015193412&usg=AOvVaw0_FtvZraE3RQuZ3UQfRbM1) checks on restless cattle twice at a barn near Ashland, Nebraska. At 2:30 a.m. he is driving on US Highway 6 when he notices some red lights along State Route 63 that might be a stalled truck. He drives a short distance up that road and stops with his headlights shining on the object. The red lights are blinking through the windows of a disc hovering at a tilt 150 feet away and 6–8 feet above the road. It looks made of shiny, polished aluminum. It ascends slowly with a sort of siren sound and emits a flamelike substance from the bottom. His head sticking out the window, Schirmer watches it pass overhead then shoot up out of sight. He drives back to the police station and writes in the log book, “Saw a flying saucer at the junction of highways 6 and 63. Believe it or not!” He is puzzled to see it is 3:00 a.m. He gets a headache and a buzzing noise in his head. He also has a red welt below one of his ears. In the morning, Chief Bill Wlaskin goes to the site and finds a piece of metal that he shows to Colorado project investigators. It turns out to be composed of iron and silicon. On February 13, 1968, Schirmer is hypnotized in Boulder, Colorado, by [R. Leo Sprinkle](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2021/11/leo-sprinkle-has-died.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015193770&usg=AOvVaw0J_5XjD28yHO_RfSZVGok5). During the session he remembers that his car engine and radio failed, and a blurry white object came out of the UFO and communicated with him telepathically. He is taken on board by aliens (who first ask him, “Are you the watchman over this place?”). They are humanoids, 4–5 feet tall with long heads, gray-white skin, and cat-like eyes. They wear silver-gray helmets with small antennas on the left side of the ear area. Their uniforms and gloves are the same color. An unusual feature of this case is the emblem of a winged serpent on the left breast of each entity’s uniform. The Colorado project comes to a predictable conclusion: “Evaluation of psychological assessment tests, the lack of any evidence, and interviews with the patrolmen left project staff with no confidence that the trooper’s reported UFO experience was physically real.” Schirmer undergoes hypnosis again on June 8, 1968, and more details emerge.

December 5 — 10:30 p.m. Six teenagers returning from a basketball game in Concordia, Kansas, detour to drive by a cemetery.

December 8 — 7:40 p.m. Marilyn Wilding, 15, goes out on her front step in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to look for a friend. A light reflecting on the snow on the ground causes her to look up, and she sees a brightly lit circular object “about as big as a car” hovering above the house. The object then tips and rotates so she can see it has a transparent dome on top. Inside the dome are two indistinct figures. The object rotates clockwise, maintaining its inclination. It begins moving away; as it recedes into the distance, its light dims and turns orange.

December 10 — 7:30 a.m. Psychologist Adina Păun is walking past the Republic Factories in Bucharest, Romania, when she sees a bluish-green object above the plant at about 45°. It has projecting, tapered spines that are as long as half its diameter. It is higher than rain clouds that sometimes obscure it, but lower than high-altitude, fast-moving white clouds. She continues watching it for 15 minutes as she walks along, but it drifts out of sight when she gets home on Magnet Strada. (Hobana and Weverbergh 180)

December 12 — 7:00 p.m. Rita Malley is driving home from work on Route 34 in Newfield, New York, with her young son. She notices a red light behind her. As it draws closer, she sees it is a disc-shaped object as large as a boxcar moving at about 90 feet above the road. Then it passes overhead and causes the car to go off the road into a ditch, and Malley became terrified. Her son in the back seat looks immobilized with his eyes “bugged out.” A white beam emanates from the humming object above her and she hears voices in her head saying that her son would not remember this and that a friend of hers has been killed in a car accident. (This turns out to be true.) The car then moves out of the ditch and back onto the road facing the wrong way. She finds that she can control the car again and speeds home.

December 13 — 2:00 a.m. As a man is driving near Edmonton, Alberta, his car lights dim and engine sputters. He pulls to the side of the road and opens the hood, when he notices a dome-shaped object hovering 450 feet away. It is metallic, has lights around the edge, and is about 50 feet high. The object rocks back and forth within a range of 10–15 feet but remains above the road. Over the next hour, the car body heats up and the witness’s hair gets hot. His flashlight fails to work. Finally, the object shoots straight up and vanishes in 2–3 seconds. His headlights come back on, but he starts the motor only with difficulty.

December 19 — 10:30 p.m. A witness is driving westbound on the east edge of Belleville, Illinois, when he sees a triangular object with a row of square lights on one side. He tries following it and manages to stay roughly beneath it until he loses track of it near Southwestern Illinois College. Because it appears to be heading toward nearby Scott AFB and the witness is familiar with the base, he goes to the control tower there to see if they have tracked anything unusual but they have not.

They stop the car as the lights approach. They are attached to a domed disc that is following the road at a height of 300–400 feet. As it approaches to within about 3,000 feet, it makes a banking movement that reveals square, fluorescent panels on the bottom. The dome light in their car turns on spontaneously as the whole bottom of the UFO flashes. The two witnesses get back in their truck and drive on, but the object follows them for a while, then moves off toward Elmira, New York. About 20 minutes later, the parents of one witness experience a power failure in their home on Elmira’s south side. (Michael D. Swords, “Unusual Experiences from the Timmerman Files,” IUR 27, no. 2 (Summer 2002): 23)

December 29 — 10:35 p.m. C. J. McCready, his wife, and daughter see a round, glowing, sparkling, red object above their home on Briarcliff Road, Atlanta, Georgia. It hovers and drops several trails of a white substance that appear to fall like a liquid as the object moves slowly northwest. It is visible for 5 minutes. (NICAP case file)

In September 1968, Klass writes to McDonald’s superiors at the US Navy (McDonald is formally retired from the Navy, but often works with the Office of Naval Research), questioning how McDonald could spend so much time on UFO research and still fulfill the requirements for his atmospheric research grant. This does not result in McDonald losing ONR funding, but it does draw some criticism of Klass from members of the UFO community. (Philip J. Klass, UFOs—Identified, Random House, 1968; Clark III 659)

1968 — Vladimir Godic and Crystal Walsh found UFO Research South Australia, a group committed to use scientific methodology in investigation and research. (Keith Basterfield, Vladimir Godic, and Pony Godic, “Australian Ufology: A Review,” JUFOS 2 (1990): 25)

1968 — An Australian nuclear physicist attached to the Directorate of Scientific and Technical Intelligence (part of the Joint Intelligence Bureau) cooperates with other defense intelligence scientists to form a “rapid intervention team” to investigate UFO incidents involving physical evidence.

1968 — The Canadian National Research Council, from its base at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Ottawa, Ontario, takes over the collection of UFO reports from the Department of National Defence. It partners with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to do the actual investigations. The NRC’s primary interest is in tracking meteors and meteorite falls. Non-meteoric sightings are kept in a separate file but transferred to the Public Archives of Canada \[now Library and Archives of Canada\] at the end of every year.

1968 (or 1969) — 9:00 p.m. A Polish Air Force pilot takes off from Warsaw Modlin Airport, Poland, in a MiG-21 for a short, routine mission. Soon he sees two identical white discs, about 6–10 feet in diameter, moving at the same altitude and speed as his MiG. His wingman also sees them. He approaches to within 50 feet of them. During the 5-minute encounter, radio contact with the controller is lost and contact between the two pilots deteriorates. Four UFOs follow the two MiGs for another 3–6 miles, then they accelerate and overtake them, disappearing ahead. (Poland 65)

Early 1968 — Four artillerymen stationed at the naval garrison at Lüda \[now Dalian\], Liaoning, China, see a luminous, gold, oval-shaped object that leaves a thin trail in the air. It climbs steeply at high speed and disappears. When it begins to climb, all communications and radar systems fail, nearly causing an accident in the fleet. The naval patrol goes on alert, and the fleet commander orders his men to prepare for combat. After 30 minutes, comms and radar return to normal. A two-man coast guard patrol allegedly sees the UFO land on the south coast and fires at it with automatic weapons.

January 15 — 7:25 a.m. Two farmers driving a truck near Three Hills, Alberta, see an object that looks “like a stunted dill pickle,” greenish-blue in color and silent. Another truck stops and they point out the object to the others, who say it looks like a flying saucer. They contact the Calgary Airport, but officials there have had no reports. (J.

January 15 — 9:00 p.m. Janice, Denise, and Lori Achzehner are playing records in Villa Park, Illinois, when their father’s “Saucer Seeker” UFO detector goes off. They run outside and see a large orange light hovering near the house.

For 45 minutes they watch as a series of 6 objects fly in and out of the area. Through binoculars they can see that the objects are triangular or cone-shaped, no more than a mile away, and 500–1,500 feet high. As they watch, one of the objects approaches a commercial airliner, makes a 180° turn without slowing, then follows the aircraft until they are out of sight.

January 20 — 11:00 p.m. Robert Ballard and his wife Lynn are visiting his parents near Vermillion, South Dakota. Robert goes outside to warm up his car for the trip home. He sees a large object and calls to his father to come outside.

They watch a big ball of red and orange fire to the east. At first they think it is the moon and go inside, but as Robert and Lynn are leaving, the object gives off a flash, and one of the dogs begins barking vigorously. They drive toward the object, which seems to be flickering in a field. It seems to be spinning and is 20 feet above the ground, sometimes less. When Ballard turns onto State Highway 50, the UFO, about 30 feet in diameter, starts following them. He accelerates to 60 mph and the object jumps to just behind their car. At one point it is hovering only 3 feet above an intersection. It keeps following them at telephone height, even though Ballard speeds up to 110 mph. After another car goes by them, the object speeds up and heads straight toward them from behind. Soon it rises and disappears to the east. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

January 21 — A fire breaks out in the navigator’s compartment of a USAF B-52 near Thule Air Base, Greenland. The bomber crashes 7 miles from the air base, causing the non-nuclear explosives aboard to detonate and rupturing and dispersing its nuclear payload of four hydrogen bombs carried on an ongoing (since 1960) Operation Chrome Dome alert mission to deter a Soviet nuclear first strike. The recovery and decontamination effort is complicated by Greenland’s harsh weather. Contaminated ice and debris are buried at the Savannah River plant in South Carolina. Bomb fragments are recycled by Pantex, in Amarillo, Texas. The incident causes outrage and protests in Denmark. USAF Strategic Air Command Chrome Dome operations are discontinued immediately after the accident, which highlights the safety and political risks of the missions. Safety procedures are reviewed and more stable explosives are developed for use in nuclear weapons. A BBC News report in 2008 seems to confirm through declassified documents and interviews with those involved that one nuclear bomb was lost. However,

the Danish Institute for International Studies concludes in August 2009 that there is no missing bomb and that the US underwater operation was a search for the uranium-235 of the fissile core of a secondary, a small object one half meter long. For the first time, the report is able to present an estimate of the amount of plutonium contained in the pits of the primaries.

January 31 — Morning. At Lajes Air Base on Terceira in the Azores, a Portuguese military watchman, Serafim Vieira Sebastião, notices a strange interference on his transistor radio. Looking around, he sees an oval metallic object surmounted by a transparent tower on top of which is a small balustrade on which two beings are leaning. The silhouettes of two more beings are visible in the tower. The object is hovering above a munitions dump. Serafim phones one of the other sentries then shines his flashlight on the machine. As he does so, the men on the tower see him. The object emits a cloud of gaseous dust that overpowers him. When his colleague finds him a few minutes later, the object has vanished.

He mentions four UFO reports and concludes that they could be extraterrestrial in origin. He thinks the 1908 Tunguska event is a remarkable UFO case and reveals that the USSR established a “UFO Section of the All-Union Cosmonautics Committee” in October 1967. Ziegel soon afterwards receives a letter from [Edward Condon](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Condon&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015219034&usg=AOvVaw2Si-UKrr4TV3-NAojO3YIL), the director of the University of Colorado UFO Project, suggesting that the Soviet and the American groups should cooperate, starting with an information exchange.

February 4 — 7:20 p.m. About 200 residents of Redlands, California, see or hear a huge, low-flying, disc-shaped object as it passes overhead. The UFO is about 50 feet in diameter, with seven lights on its base emitting bright orange flame. Some 8–10 other lights on its rim alternate red and green, giving the impression that the object is rotating. A minister recording his sermon captures a high-pitched, modulated, whining sound from the UFO on tape. The UFO apparently descends just west of Columbia Street and north of Colton Avenue, then proceeds to the northwest for about a mile at an altitude of 300 feet. Coming to a stop, it hovers briefly, jerks forward, hovers again, then shoots straight up in a burst of speed. The object is not detected on radar at Norton AFB \[now closed\] near San Bernardino or March AFB \[now March Air Reserve Base\] in Riverside County. An investigation is conducted for APRO by four University of Redlands faculty: [Philip Seff](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://rickright.com/dr-philip-seff-october-5-1923-february-18-2016/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015220528&usg=AOvVaw0ONHQJQfbVXGly_vQ8CHlK) (geology), Judson Sanderson (math), Reinhold Krantz (math), and [John Brownfield](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.redlandscommunitynews.com/obituaries/update-longtime-u-of-r-art-professor-dies-at-79/article_735624c4-a68d-11ea-942e-bb4010124e0a.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015220834&usg=AOvVaw0cW59HPGjgupt8KGhHk4fn) (art).

February 18 — 12:00 midnight. Teenagers Richard Frombach, Boone Powers, and Chris Beachner are parked next to a pond in a gravel pit near Vashon, Washington, when they notice a glowing oval object resting on a hill to the east. They drive into town to pick up an additional witness, Joseph Frabush, and return to the area, park on the main road, and walk into the pond area. The object has moved to the east. Frabush thinks it is metallic and about 30 feet long. They drive back into town for more witnesses, but when they return the light is gone and the 100-foot pond is completely frozen over. Temperatures in the area have been above freezing for several days. Small puddles and mud patches surrounding the pond are not frozen at all. The pond ice is dry, even though it has been raining all night. Investigators find that the ice is 3 inches thick in some spots, composed of 2–5 layers, and riddled with bubbles filled with air and dirt.

February 19 — 11:55 a.m. Martha Heggs is in her farmhouse kitchen about 10 miles west of Bengough, Saskatchewan.

She hears a high-pitched whine that has such a penetrating intensity it is similar to a mild electric shock, causing a tingling sensation throughout her body. Looking out, she sees an object 300 feet away circling around a pole with an electric transformer on it. The object is shaped like two saucers edge-to-edge, surmounted by a dome with 6–7 ports, rounded at the top and extending straight down to the base of the dome. These ports are indented and white in color, resembling frosted glass. The saucers are about 8 feet wide and the dome about 4 feet wide. The body of the object looks like dull aluminum. There is a smaller, vented structure on top of the dome and an antenna on top of that. When the object first appears, a dog is seen cowering and lying in the snow, trying to cover its ears with its paws. Sixteen head of cattle, loose in the farmyard, bolt when the object moves into the area. They enter the cattle sheds and do not emerge until at least 30 minutes after the object disappears. The object moves about the farmyard, sometimes hovering, its altitude ranging from 3 feet to 20 feet. After 20 minutes, still 9–12 feet above the ground, the object leaves the farm through a windbreak and moves north until lost to view. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

February 27 — 4:30 a.m. A brilliant flood of light from her window abruptly awakens a woman named Bernor in Templeton, Massachusetts. She becomes paralyzed, her face is immobile, and her hands and feet ache. The light goes on and off about 7–8 times, ending around 5:00 a.m. She slowly recovers over the next few days. (Michael

February 27 — 6:55 p.m. Truck driver Andrew Perry is driving from Bideford to Cullompton, Devon, England, when he sees a bright light appear at the crest of a hill. As he gets closer, he sees the light is coming from a mushroom- shaped object. As he reaches about 900 feet away from the object, he stops the truck and climbs to the top of the cab to get a better view. He sees about 4–5 figures about 4 feet tall spread out around the object. Suddenly they scramble toward the UFO and disappear inside. The object emits a high-pitched whirring sound that causes his truck to vibrate. Perry gets upset and climbs back into the truck, driving it fast down the road. Meanwhile, the UFO has risen about 200 feet into the air and is passing above his truck, making a noise so loud he can’t hear the engine running. Suddenly the truck engine cuts out. A few seconds later, the noise stops and Perry sees the UFO moving away in the distance. He drives to the nearest police station to report the incident.

March 1 — An Over the Horizon Forward Scatter Radar System 440L/Program 673A is turned over to NORAD’s Cheyenne Mountain facility in Colorado by Air Force Intelligence. It has been previously used to collect intelligence on Soviet missile launches since it was built in 1960–1962. It soon picks up unidentified radar returns. (Clark III 811)

March 2 — A magnetic monitoring device with a film camera set up by the Queensland Flying Saucer Research Bureau at Horseshoe Lagoon, Tully, Queensland, is triggered around the time that an airliner flying at 6,000 feet from Cairns to Iron Range is paced by a UFO. About 50 feet of film is exposed. On March 4, another 16 feet is exposed during a local UFO sighting.

March 3 — 8:30 p.m. Several witnesses are traveling east on Knud Drive in Columbia, Tennessee, when they notice a large rectangular object approaching them silently from behind. When they stop the car, the object is directly overhead and moving east. It has hundreds of small, dimly lit points of light in 5–6 rows on its base. Witness Norman E. Bryant thinks it is 1,000 feet long, 250 feet wide, and flying at an altitude of 2,000 feet. It passes them in a matter of seconds.

March 4 — 9:00 p.m. A man is driving his new Triumph Spitfire up a country lane near Glossop, Derbyshire, England, when two golden objects shoot over the top of his car, killing his headlights, radio, and engine. Moments after the objects pass to the north, the headlights come back on, but the radio still fails. He is able to restart his car engine after the lights come on. A BUFORA investigator takes the radio to his workplace at British Aerospace and finds that two key transistors have burned out, seemingly due to a power surge. Once the transistors are replaced, the radio works again. (Jenny Randles, “Flappy Valley, Part 4,” Fortean Times 328 (July 2015): 30)

March 10 — 6:00 p.m. Valentina Flores is bringing in her llamas on her farm between Opoco and Uyuni, Bolivia, when she discovers that her sheep pen is covered with a net made of some plastic-like material, and that inside the pen is a helmeted being, 3.5 ft tall, who is engaged in killing her sheep using a tubular instrument with a hook on the end. Flores throws stones at the being, whereupon he walks over to an instrument resembling a radio and, moving a wheel on it, quickly absorbs all the netting. The woman approaches the pen with a cudgel, upon which the being throws its instrument at her several times; it returns to him like a boomerang, after it inflicts superficial cuts on her arms. The entity picks up the machine, which has absorbed the net as well as a bag containing sheep entrails, and puts them into a rucksack on his back. Two legs emerge from the rucksack and extend down to the ground, at which time the entity rises straight up into the air with an extraordinary sound and vanishes. 34 sheep are found dead; from every one, “certain small portions of the digestive organs were missing.” (Oscar A.

March 19 — 8:30 p.m. 12-year-old Gregory L. Wells is walking toward the trailer home of his parents in Beallsville, Ohio, when he sees an oval-shaped, bright red object hovering above some nearby trees and illuminating the road. It has a band of dimmer red lights around its midsection. Suddenly a big tube emerges from the object and moves around until it is pointed at him. A light beam shoots out and hits the upper part of his arm, knocking him down. His jacket catches fire and he rolls around, screaming with fright. His mother and grandmother come out to help, and they both see the red UFO, which just fades away after 10 minutes. The boy is taken to a hospital and treated for second-degree burns.

p.m. it reappears at the Semenic Mountain weather station and is also seen at Caransebeş, Romania, and other places. (Hobana and Weverbergh 131–138; Romania 19–20)

Spring — Two prospectors, Ed Sampson and Bill Johnson, are sleeping in the Anza Borrego Desert, California, when they wake up at the sound of an explosion. The sky above is filled with a fading red light, and they see flashes on the western horizon. The two climb to the crest of a hill and look down. Sampson sees a “red, circular flying saucer” hovering over the valley, while entities with glowing red eyes march in single file close to the ridge of an adjacent canyon. Something like a church bell rings out at intervals, and mechanical clanking is also audible.

After noticing two glowing-eyed creatures standing behind them, they take off running. (Clark III 557)

Mid-April — Evening. Engineer Gu Ying is sent to a military construction regiment in the north Gobi Desert, China, when the entire battalion notices a huge, luminous, red-orange disc with a flashing light landing in the sand. It is about 9 feet in diameter. The commander dispatches a team of motorcycle troops to approach it. As they get closer, the object shoots up into the sky and disappears. The UFO leaves ground traces like a “seared cross.” The soldiers assume it is a Russian device. (Wendelle Stevens and Paul Dong, UFOs over Modern China, UFO Photo Archive, 1983, pp. 49–50)

The object appears metallic and glows orange when standing still, but gets redder and brighter when moving. The object then comes toward their car and the engine conks out. It hovers overhead for a moment, during which time the witnesses feel increased heat and weightlessness. The object departs over a nearby field, emitting a cloudy haze all around its periphery.

Early May — Night. Gerardo Vidal and his wife are driving home from Chascomús to Maipú, Buenos Aires, Argentina. They are just outside Chascomús when their car is enveloped in a thick green fog. The next thing they know they are driving on a road near Mexico City in broad daylight, 4,400 miles to the northwest. Their watches have stopped, and they discover that two days have passed. They visit the Argentine embassy in Mexico City, where Vidal calls a relative in Maipú to report that they are well. However, a June 4, 1968, Reuters dispatch from Mexico City contains a denial of the incident by the Argentine embassy, and subsequent inquiries can find no one in Maipú that could be the Vidals. Finally, in October 1998 Argentine film director [Aníbal Uset](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%25C3%25ADbal_Uset&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015256274&usg=AOvVaw0U96mWyblIwqf69Y94cNf2) admits to researcher Roberto E.

May 10 — 10:00 p.m. Grant Callison of Galesburg, Illinois, looks out his kitchen window and sees a giant bird illuminated by a streetlight. He and his wife Wilma rush outside for a better look and see three of them flying in a V-formation at an altitude of 500 feet. They look like they have metallic feathers or scales. They are flying with a graceful, fluttering motion. They then see two objects to the south with pulsating red lights moving in the same direction at the same speed (about 25–35 mph). On May 20, around 9:00 p.m., the Callisons have another odd sighting of a single bird-like creature.

May 17 — 5:00 a.m. Caetano Sergio dos Santos is returning home from his job as a night watchman at Caconde, São Paulo, Brazil. In the courtyard of his house he sees a cylinder-shaped object, about the size of a powdered-milk can, stuck in the ground. At each end are dials, one with a black band, the other with a red one. They are encased under a glass or plastic lens with embossed figures arranged in a semicircle. Above each figure is something like an Arabic numeral. Dos Santos takes the object into the house and studies it for 90 minutes, then puts it on a windowsill in the bathroom before going to bed. He goes back to work, then at about 1:00 a.m., he returns home and notices that the object is lighting up the house, with his wife and son, very agitated, standing outside with neighbors. She tells him that a loud buzzing and intense heat had wakened her, both emanating from the object. Dos Santos goes inside and finds a hole in the roof, tile scattered over the floor, and the object gone.

June 14 — Shortly after 12:00 midnight. Isidro Puentes Ventura is on guard duty in Cabañas, Artemisa, Cuba, when he sees on the ground a brilliant domed UFO with several antennas on top. He approaches to within 165 feet and fires about 40 machine gun rounds into it, convinced it is American. The object turns orange and emits a whistling sound as Puentes loses consciousness. At dawn, an Army patrol finds him still unconscious and takes him to a hospital in Pinar del Rio, where he remains in shock for 6 days, unable to speak. He is then taken to a Naval hospital in Havana, where he remains in shock another week. At the site, Cuban and Soviet intelligence specialists find 48 spent cartridges and 14 bullets flattened by impact with something solid, as well as equally spaced indentations on the ground. Tests reveal that the soil has been exposed to a high temperature.

June 15 — 1:05 a.m. María Elodia Pretzel, daughter of the owner of the Motel La Cuesta on National Highway 20 east of Villa Carlos Paz, Córdoba, Argentina, is locking up for the night when she encounters a strange-looking man in the dining area. He is 6 feet tall and dressed in a blue helmet and a suit that glows with an eerie light and seems made up of scales. In his left hand he is holding a glassy sphere that is radiating a coherent light that lights up the room. She feels somewhat paralyzed and is getting a mental message not to be afraid. The entity raises its other arm, which is emitting beams of light, and she feels helpless, falling backward. The entity walks slowly toward the outside door, putting one foot directly in front of the other, arm extended and holding the now extinguished sphere, and passes outside. Still shaken, María goes to the laundry room and drops on the floor, head and arms on a divan. A few minutes later, her father, Pedro Jacobo Pretzel, arrives and discovers her. Minutes earlier, he had seen two odd, stationary red lights about 5–6 feet from the ground off Highway 20. Maria is conscious but very disturbed, a condition that lasts for several days. (Oscar A.

June 15–17 — Night. Allied forward spotters along the eastern part of the Demilitarized Zone in Vietnam see about 30 strange slow-moving lights. At the time they are interpreted as North Vietnamese Russian-built M-14 Hound helicopters ferrying men and materiel over the border. The lights appear the following evening, and several US 7th Air Force Phantom fighter-bombers soon arrive on the scene and fire on the intruders, supported by anti- aircraft ground fire.

July — 1:00 a.m. Walter Rizzi is taking a nap in his car by the road just south of the Gardena Pass, South Tyrol, Italy, when he wakes to the smell of something burning. He sees a light about 1,600 feet further downhill shining through the mist. The mist parts, and he sees an enormous object that suddenly reminds him of an encounter he had with a strange hermit on the island of Rhodes in Greece when he was in the Italian army in World War II. The hermit had predicted he would someday meet with advanced beings from the cosmos who would provide him with the assurance of life throughout the universe. Rizzi makes his way downhill toward the object, which is silvery, some 260 feet in diameter, standing on three legs, bathed in fleecy white light, and emitting a burning odor. He gets within 10 feet and cannot go further. He sees two beings inside a transparent cupola on the top who are looking down at him. To the right of the object is a robot about 8 feet tall with three legs and four arms. A beam of light comes from the center of the object, and Rizzi sees another being dressed in a tight-fitting suit and glass helmet descending. They communicate telepathically about other planets and the universe. Eventually the entities reenter the object and take off. Rizzi claims there are landing marks, effects on the grass, and his watch starts losing time.

July 1 — 12:30 a.m. Three boys are sitting on the main gate of the UNESP Hospital das Clinicas of the Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil. Suddenly they see a large object “as big as a house” sitting about 1,150 feet to the west of them. It has a large tripod undercarriage and a ladder reaching down to the ground. The boys can hear a weird “tinging sound on a high note.” They start to yell as the UFO retracts its tripod and ladder and rise into the air and speed off to the east, reaching a great altitude. Alerted by their shouts, other witnesses see the object moving away. A student named Antônio Alegre examines the landing site shortly afterward and finds marks forming an isosceles triangle, two sides measuring 20 feet and one side 23 feet.

July 2 — 11:25 a.m. Oscar Heriberto Iriart, 15, sees two men of normal height motioning to him at Sierra Chica, Buenos Aires, Argentina. They have short, white hair and red clothes. They also have semi-transparent legs because he can see through them to the grass behind. Near the men is an elliptical, silvery machine, 6.5 feet long, 2 feet high, with three legs 19 inches high. The men give him an envelope they telepathically say contains an important message, telling him to dip it in water before reading, then they fly off. Iriart dips the envelope in a puddle and finds that both the envelope and his hands are dry. The message is written in Spanish in a crude handwriting: “You are going to know the world. F. Saucer.” The witness’s horse and dog are paralyzed for several minutes.

The boy arrives home terrified. The family goes to the landing site and finds three holes, each about 5 inches deep and forming an isosceles triangle, the base side measuring 6.5 feet and the other 2 sides 5.2 feet wide. At 11:15 p.m., five skeptical men (including Police Sgt. Raúl Coronel) from the Sierra Chica Social Club visit the landing site and declare the holes to be fake. However, they see a zigzagging light a few feet from the ground and heading their way. They drop to the ground, it passes over them, and then shoots away straight up.

July 2 — 10:00–10:30 p.m. Fred Coulthard Jr. and his brother Wayne are at a family get-together in the backyard of their father’s home in Wooler, Ontario, when they see an object with rotating red lights that agitates the family’s horses and cats. Around 11:30 p.m., poltergeist-like disturbances (a shattered window, objects thrown around, a strong odor of roses) begin in the house and continue for several days. “Fairy rings” are discovered on the ground in a wooded valley north of town.

July 17 — Late evening. A civil servant is allegedly snatched off the São Paulo Highway in Brazil and taken into a UFO by four green entities wearing devices that look like headphones. While he is in a state of paralysis, they question him via telepathy about human customs, physiology, and reproduction. The creatures depart abruptly as if in response to instructions.

July 18 — 1:05 a.m. RCMP Constable W. J. Whyte and his wife spot a yellow circular object at high altitude moving west to east near Truro, Nova Scotia. It looks like a satellite, but turns reddish before disappearing in the distance. At 1:10 p.m., a couple near Onslow Mountain a few miles to the north see a rosy red light in the southwest hovering just above the trees. They watch it for 15 minutes before it moves and accelerates out of sight. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, pp. 70–71)

July 20 — After 12:00 midnight. Three 14-year-old girls at a summer camp at Kaarnajärv, near Otepää, Valga County, Estonia, see a swiftly moving star and a cigar-shaped object in the distance that quickly disappears. Somewhat disturbed, they decide to retire to bed. Through a window they see a bright object about 165 feet away. It is surrounded by reddish-orange and yellow beams of light. Soon it goes out, leaving only a dark greenish nebula with a blue-green ring around it that illuminates the surrounding woods. They watch it for about 5 minutes until it blinks out. One of the girls goes outside and sees a female figure, less than 5 feet tall and wearing a silver ribbon, standing where the object had been. It vanishes. The next morning, they find a circular burnt area about 6 feet in diameter and four wedge-shaped prints in the soil.

July 22 — Around 12:00 midnight. Off-duty police constable Martyn Johnson is walking with his girlfriend in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, when they see two lights approaching them from above a nearby park. They are giving off many colored lights. As they hover above a nearby house, the couple’s poodle becomes agitated and runs off. The two lights then become four and arrange themselves in an oblong formation. All at once they vanish at terrific speed, following a railway to the northeast. A few hours later, Johnson is awakened and told to report to police headquarters, where there are two “government men” waiting to quiz him about the sighting. They desperately try to convince him that he has seen an aircraft or helicopter. They tell him he is sworn to secrecy for the next 25 years. When he asks what he has seen, they tell him, “What you have seen is an unidentified flying object or UFO. Some people call them spaceships, and if the people of the world knew how many genuine sightings there were like yours, there would be total panic.” (UFOFiles2, [pp. 82–83](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/the-ufo-files-the-inside-story-of-real-life-sightings-david-clarke/page/n135/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015287557&usg=AOvVaw0z0Q20rUxI0JAUfI38_hcD))

July 22 — 1:20 a.m. Adela Casalvieri de Panassiti, 45, night nurse at the Dr. Carlos Pereyra Neuropsychiatric Hospital at Ituzaingó 2837, Mendoza, Argentina, hears a loud, penetrating, humming noise outside in the hospital courtyard. Going out to see what it is, she observes a mushroom-shaped landed object only 65 feet away. It is luminous and sitting in the middle of the courtyard. A bright red beam comes from the object and strikes her, and she finds that her legs are paralyzed. Putting her hands up to her face for protection, she discovers she is completely unable to move. She remains immobilized for a number of minutes until the red beam is extinguished. At this time, the object ascends vertically then flies off rapidly to the south, barely clearing the wall that surrounds the courtyard. Before it disappears, she is able to observe several human-looking figures through square portholes that encircle the craft. These beings move back and forth, passing each other, and are visible from the waist up only. A lead- gray stain, 31 x 12 inches, that smells of sulfur is found at the landing site. It persists for two days. Several small potted trees are burned. Casalvieri de Panassiti has first-degree burns on her face and hands (an allergic reaction?), and parts of her nurse’s cap and clothing are singed. In addition, her watch, which has stopped at 1:30 a.m., is found to be radioactive, as is her ring. The daughters of a garrison commander witness a luminous, egg- shaped object at the same time from the garrison casino.

July 28 — 12:00 midnight. A farmer, his wife, and two children near Upton, Quebec, are awakened by the barking of their dog. When he gets up to investigate, he sees a sparkling, rotating “cloud” in the yard. It flies just over him and goes into a nearby field. About 12 feet in diameter, it is dark on the bottom but luminous on top. The cows in the field are being chased by 4 or 5 small entities, perhaps 3 feet tall with heads shaped like bottles. As the UFO flies above them, they disappear. The cattle seem ill for weeks afterwards. (John Brent Musgrave, UFO Occupants and Critters, Global Communications, 1979; Clark III 280)

Harder states: “On the basis of the data and ordinary rules of evidence, as would be applied in civil or criminal courts, the physical reality of UFOs has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” McDonald makes the biggest impression, presenting 30 pages of UFO reports. He states: “my own present opinion, based on two years of careful study, is that UFOs are probably extraterrestrial devices engaged in something that might very tentatively be termed ‘surveillance.’” Menzel concludes that UFOs merit no more scientific study than “the concept of ghosts, spirits, witches, fairies, elves, hobgoblins, or the devil.” The symposium has no lasting impact, as Congress does nothing about the problem.

July 30 — 2:00 a.m. A land surveyor and his wife in Claremont, New Hampshire, are preparing to retire when they see a dome-shaped object in a field about 230 feet behind their house. It is about 20 feet wide and moving slowly 10 feet above the ground, creating shadows on the freshly cut hay. The UFO shines a 20-foot wide gray-colored beam of light onto the ground. Their children moan and cry out in while they are sleeping and their dogs are whining loudly. They hear a high-pitched humming sound like a utility pole transformer. A few minutes later the object moves 25 feet to the east, the humming growing louder. At one point, a projection from the object descends to the ground. Around 4:30 a.m., the object goes brighter and slowly moves off toward the west. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

July 31 — 9:00 a.m. Farmer Luce Fontaine is collecting grass for his rabbits at La Plaine des Cafres on the island of Réunion (in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar), when he sees an oval-shaped object about 75 feet away. It is sitting about 15 feet from the ground on a flange of metal; a similar structure protrudes from its top. The cylinder has two blue ends and a transparent center through which he can see two humanoids less than 3 feet tall in metallic helmets and dressed in puffy suits like the Michelin Man (the tire company mascot). Seemingly sensing Fontaine looking at them, they turn their backs and the object disappears in a sudden flash of light and a burst of hot air. The incident is investigated by Capt. Maljean of the local Gendarmerie and Capt. Léopold Legros of the Civil Protection Service, who detect an abnormal amount of radioactivity at the site and on Fontaine’s clothing 10 days afterward, as well as six apparent landing marks in the ground. A country club called “La Soucoupe Volante” (Flying Saucer) is later built on the site.

August — The US Air Force Weapons Laboratory begins to set up a field instrumentation lab at Con Thien combat base near the Demilitarized Zone, Quang Tri Province, Vietnam, specifically for the purpose of investigating and tracking unidentified aircraft. The first project name is HAVE FEAR. At least 500 UFO sensor trackings via radar-visual, laser range-finder, video camera, infrared, nightscope, and telescope are investigated through April 1969. The UFOs, often seen as red lights, usually travel at speeds of 30–80 mph at altitudes of 1,200–1,600 feet. After several days of tracking, the red blinking lights extinguish when under radar surveillance. They are only seen at night and only in certain places. In mid-August, Project LETHAL CHASER is added, using portable manpack radars. The findings involve 99% UFOs and only 1% IFOs, primarily because the system does not include human anecdotal accounts. Pacific Air Forces’ unit history clearly states the investigation is about UFOs, not enemy helicopters.

August 4 — 4:15 a.m. Three witnesses in Qu’Appelle, Saskatchewan, watch a luminous object, about 25 feet in diameter, as it hovers for several minutes. Later it circles above the house 300 feet away. A 4-foot circle of barren grass is found, although an 18-inch circle in the center is undamaged.

August 7 — 8:10 p.m. As a young man and woman watch from the end of a dock at Buff Ledge Camp \[now closed\] along the shore of Lake Champlain north of Burlington, Vermont, a bright light appears in the southwest sky and swoops down in a long arc until it stops and assumes a horizontal position. It now resembles a white, glowing, cigar-shaped object, possibly as far away as the Adirondack Mountains more than 10 miles from the witnesses.

According to the young man, three tiny white lights emerge one at a time from the right-end bottom of the UFO. As soon as the third is expelled, the object retreats along its original path and vanishes seconds later. The three

* * *

smaller objects perform a series of spectacular maneuvers, all the while moving closer. After 5 minutes the objects assume a horizontal triangle formation, and two head off in opposite directions, one to the north, the other to the south, making a sound like “thousands of different tuning forks.” The remaining object (40–50 feet across) moves toward the witnesses. It ascends and vanishes in three seconds, only to reappear moments later as it descends along the same trajectory and plunges broadside into the water. A sudden wind blows waves across the heretofore placid surface. Animals up and down the shore howl and shriek. A few minutes later the UFO surfaces and moves toward the witnesses. It stops 60 feet from them, hovering about 15 feet above the water. The young man can see two figures with large heads, oversized oval eyes, and small mouths. Visible to the waist, they are short and clothed in skintight gray or silver uniforms. Thus begins an abduction experience that was only uncovered through separate hypnotic sessions with each of the witnesses by [Walter N.

August 15 — 12:00 midnight. Dick Skewes is driving west with his wife Anne and babysitter Gail Yemm about 20 minutes east of Springhill, Nova Scotia, on the Trans-Canada Highway. After driving up a hill, he sees a group of 5–6 lights hovering 50 feet above some trees on his left. Another light is approaching at high speed to join the others. One of the objects breaks away and descends silently over the highway in front of them, its yellow lights flashing brilliantly, on an apparent collision course. When it is 40–50 feet away it veers upward and disappears to the east. Skewes continues down the highway and loses sight of the objects when he rounds a bend.

August 16 — 2:51 a.m. The crew of a Canadian Forces Hercules C-150E are flying above Regina, Saskatchewan, when they see a cigar-shaped object cross their flight path. It has 6 rectangular patches on its side. It is visible with the naked eye for about 90 seconds, then it rapidly shrinks and disappears to the southwest very rapidly.

August 16 — 6:00 a.m. A farmer doing barnyard chores at La Serra d’Almos, Catalonia, Spain, glimpses a light more than half a mile away. He thinks someone’s car has stalled, so he walks over with his dog intending to help. But he finds a globe-shaped, glowing object hovering 3 feet above the ground. On the other side of it, he sees two creatures of an octopus-like appearance. Light-colored, 3 feet tall, they are running on “four or five legs” toward the UFO, which abruptly takes off. Reporters and UFO investigators find a considerable area of burned grass at the site. Those who visit the site shortly afterwards find their watches stop mysteriously.

Four of the ship’s crew, including Maj. W. J. Draper, see a group of starlike lights approaching from the northeast, initially only 10° above the horizon. They are flying in a row, and one in the middle of the line seems larger and has a white glow around it. Within 5 minutes, the procession of 20 objects passes nearly overhead, heading west. They maintain a steady course until they are lost to view 13 minutes later. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, pp. 73–74)

August 22 — 5:40 p.m. Capt. Walter Gardin and Capt. Gordon W. Smith are flying over Zanthus, Western Australia, at 8,000 feet in a Piper Navajo single-engine airplane when they see a large cigar-shaped object surrounded by five smaller ones. The formation maintains a constant angle from their own flight path for more than 10 minutes, while they are flying at 224 mph. The large object then opens up its center and the smaller objects fly to and from the larger object. Ground air control reports no known air traffic in the area. At this point the radio fails at all frequencies until the objects fly away.

August 25 — 5:00 a.m. Hospital assistant Maria José Cintra of the Serafim Ferrreira sanitarium in Lins, São Paulo, Brazil, hears a noise like the braking of a car. Cintra readies herself to meet people needing medical assistance. She opens a glass door and asks the visitor if she is a patient. The visitor, just over 6 feet tall, answers in an unknown language. The visitor is wearing a blue satiny cape, matching shoes, and a dress with a high collar and long sleeves. She shows Cintra a vessel with engraved ornaments, and Cintra fills it with water from a fountain and offers her a doughnut. The visitor walks to the door of the sanitorium and through some flowerbeds. At this point Cintra notices a semicircular “pebble-like” light on the ground and a UFO floating 1–2 feet above the grass. She feels the force of an invisible rotating movement and notices that the visitor is no longer there. The UFO rises into the air, making soft sounds like those she heard when the visitor arrived. Later, she and the sanitorium manager and his wife find high-heeled footprints on the freshly waxed floor near the door. On the lawn they discover a spot of scorched grass that persists for 4 months. Subsequent investigation reveals a depression in the ground 5–7 inches deep, apparently made by a vehicle with a diameter of about 6.5 feet. From his bed, another patient has seen the UFO land some 260 feet from the fence of the sanitorium and remain there for 15 minutes.

September 10 — Evening. John Dow and Paul Franklin are on the Omarunui Road southwest of Taradale, New Zealand.

They see a circular object with a red and green light that is only a few feet in diameter and glowing white. Heading toward the source, they watch as the UFO disappears behind a cloud. After crossing a bridge, they see the object again, hovering on the opposite side of the river. The object glows intensely and speeds toward the automobile from the rear. Panicking, they try to jump out of the car, which is traveling at 35 mph, but get tangled up and the car veers out of control. Both of them fall out the left door as the bright UFO hovers 2 feet above the car roof. The car crashes into the store of a fruit dealer on Gloucester Street. A crowd gathers around the two young men, still dazed and shocked. Nearly 24 hours later the witnesses are treated for “bruises and abrasions” at the Napier Hospital outpatient clinic because “their clothes were sticking to them.” Dow is charged with reckless driving, but the circumstances convince the court to drop the charge and the insurance company pays for the damages.

Anne, Manitoba. They are traveling northwest to southeast in a vertical orientation at tremendous speed. The UFOs are discharging white substance from the upper surface just like popcorn. The white substance streams upward from two of the objects and downward from the third. After they disappear, a white, fibrous substance falls and settles on foliage, buildings, and power lines. The University of Manitoba analyzes a sample and finds it to be “cellulose-like and unstable,” with a uniform fiber diameter of 5 microns, and probably rayon coated with a gummy substance.

September 19 — 3:15 p.m.–7:15 p.m. A lighted white object is seen by many witnesses over Cluj-Napoca and other towns in northwestern Romania. Some of the sightings are attributable to a balloon, but others seem to be moving against the wind and internally lit. (Hobana and Weverbergh 139–149; Romania 27–29)

Late September (or late September 1969) — Night. A teenager is putting hay in a rabbit pen at his home in the East Linden neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio. He hears a clapping noise and sees an entity dressed in a black uniform with a silver belt walking in the woods nearby. Its head has an eerie yellow glow. Scared, he runs into the house to get his parents, but the entity is gone when they go out to look for it. The next morning a neighbor stops by to ask if they had seen any lights in a field the night before. The families go to the field and find a large oval place where the grass, weeds, and bushes have been pressed down.

September 26–27 — 6:00 a.m. Industrial chemist Henrique Schneider Jr. gets up and checks the fire in the kiln next to his house in Vila Baumer in the northern part of Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil. He comes across a strange object in

* * *

the pottery yard about 16 feet away. It is a cone-shaped device about 13 feet high sitting on a tripod under which a bluish light illuminates the ground, and it has a rectangular opening through which comes a treadmill. On the treadmill are two squared cylinders standing on end, both motionless. Schneider feels paralyzed and begins to converse telepathically with the nearest cylinder, which answers his questions clearly and briefly about where they come from, which is another star system, and they are investigating global warming on earth. Soon the treadmill goes back up into the object, the entrance closes, and it takes off with a hissing sound. The next day, Schneider finds a burned circle of grass just over 2 feet in diameter at the landing site. Inside this is a smaller circle of compressed grass and three holes where the tripod stood.

In late 1967, McDonald had secured a modest grant from the Office of Naval Research in order to

study cloud formations in Australia. While there, McDonald conducts some UFO research on his own time. Klass mounts an extended, concerted campaign against McDonald, arguing that he has squandered government funds. The ONR responds by announcing that they had known of McDonald’s UFO interests and have no objections to his personal hobbies. The University of Arizona comes to McDonald’s defense, announcing that his UFO research was done on his own time, and has no adverse impact on his regular teaching and research duties at the university.

October? — A 7-page National Security Agency thought piece on UFOs is written by an unnamed NSA analyst around this time. It is declassified in 1984 with a disclaimer saying that it does not represent NSA policy. It discusses various hypotheses for UFOs (hoaxes, hallucinations, natural phenomena, secret earth projects, and extraterrestrial intelligence) and speculates what each answer would mean for the human species, placing credence in the ETH.

October — Brazil’s System of Investigation of Unidentified Aircraft, created by the Fourth Air Zone Command of the Brazilian Air Force and sponsored by Brig. Gen. José Vaz da Silva and coordinated by Maj. Gilberto Zani de Mello, goes into operation to investigate UFO sightings, especially physical trace cases. The operation lasts until the end of 1972.

October 2 — 6:20 a.m. While oiling his tractor’s engine at the end of Avenida da Saudade in Lins, São Paulo, Brazil, Turíbio Pereira sees only a few feet away a golden cigar-shaped object hovering one foot above the ground. It is about 16 feet long and 10 feet wide. There is a platform around it and on the top a transparent dome is open.

Inside there are four stools and an instrument panel. Pereira sees four beings around it wearing blue tunics and red skirts. One is on the platform with a weapon in its hand, another is picking up earth samples, the third is looking at his tractor’s engine, and the fourth is inside the object at the instrument panel. The being with the weapon fires it and a luminous ball hits Pereira in the stomach, paralyzing him. The entities go inside, and a transparent dome encloses them. The object ascends and shoots off at high speed. With difficulty, Pereira climbs off the tractor and stumbles to the road where a friend takes him home. Later he is given a medical examination by Antônio Geris and summoned to a Brazilian Air Force facility where he is questioned and held for three days.

October 5 — 7:52 p.m. John D. Hickey and his family are driving near West Morehead Street in Charlotte, North Carolina. While stopped at a traffic light, he sees a black object like a short cigar moving on his left, but it stops and hovers above a low building about 500 feet away. Suddenly three large gray-white lights shaped like television picture tubes turn on, each about 22 inches in diameter. A small black arm-like device moves slowly out of one end, extends a few feet, then stops. A blue light is at one end. The three large lights begin to blink slowly, then rapidly for 25 seconds. The blue light goes out, the arm retracts, the large lights blink more slowly until they stop. The lights go out and the object moves to the east.

October 18 — 5:00 p.m. Hundreds of witnesses view a conical object that appears above Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, traveling from northwest to southeast. The UFO at first appears bright blue then changes first to a whitish-blue then to red. When it reaches a point just south of Sarajevo and northeast of the city of Mostar, the object turns to the east. It remains in view from 90 minutes to two hours. Members of the Akademski Astronomsko-Astronautiki Klub take photos of the object and, six months later, issue a report on their investigation of the incident. It estimates that the UFO was flying at an altitude of 16 miles and a speed of 20 mph, probably guided by air currents and not self-propelled, and most likely was a military reconnaissance balloon. (Hobana and Weverbergh 84–90)

October 24 — 2:15–5:18 a.m. Sixteen military personnel stationed throughout the Minuteman ICBM missile complex at Minot AFB, North Dakota, report a very large, brightly illuminated aerial object, alternating colors from brilliant white to orange-red and green, with the ability to hover, accelerate rapidly, and abruptly change direction. Ground radar tracks an unidentified target correlated with a visual orange glow and radios it (saying, “Someone is seeing flying saucers again”) to the attention of the USAF crew of a B-52H Stratofortress bomber at 2,000 feet as a UFO target 24 miles to the northwest. It shifts to 15 miles at 3:35 a.m. RAPCON alerts the pilots (instructor pilot Maj.

Radar navigator Maj. Charles Richey captures the tracking on film. As the B-52 starts its descent back to Minot AFB, the UFO appears to close distance to one mile at a high rate of speed, pacing the aircraft for nearly 20 miles before disappearing off the radarscope. Both B-52 UHF radios cannot transmit during the close radar encounter with the UFO and when the radarscope film is recorded. Shortly afterwards, RAPCON provides vectors for the B-52 to overfly a stationary UFO on or near the ground. After turning onto the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, the pilots observe a large, illuminated UFO ahead of the aircraft for several minutes, before turning onto the base leg over the UFO while observing it at close range. After the B-52 lands, both outer and inner-zone intrusion alarms are activated at the remote missile Launch Facility Oscar-7. The duration of the reported observations is over three hours.

October 24 — 6:47 p.m. The Romanian oil tanker Argeş is steaming through the Mozambique Channel when Third Officer Ştefan Anton and Commander Nicolae Ştefanescu see a bright orange-yellow disc half the diameter of the Moon moving swiftly and emitting blue-green rays from its center. At one point it stops abruptly for a moment andchanges course to the east. By sextant they estimate it is 15.5 miles away and 56 feet in diameter. (Hobana and Weverbergh 250–251)

October 31 — The Colorado project delivers its report, Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, to the Air Force.

The first two sections, conclusions and recommendations, are written by [Condon](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Condon&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015330958&usg=AOvVaw3QvX2tftKras0KHiZ8lua0) himself. He concludes that “further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.” It is a clear signal to shut down Project Blue Book. Yet 30% of its cases are unexplained. Condon says a UFO cover-up is unthinkable because no one could keep such a secret for so long. He refutes the claim that the CIA has installed an agent within the project. He disapproves of UFO “amateurists,” especially NICAP. The project ignored old cases because they only offered witness testimony, are probably misidentifications, and it

* * *

makes little sense to reinterview witnesses. But this means ignoring the most compelling cases of the past 20+ years. Condon rejects the ETH because it is so unlikely that aliens can get here from there. This attitude suggests that Condon’s approach is fundamentally antiempirical. The report also includes summaries of field studies, photographic evidence, direct and indirect physical evidence, optical and radar cases, and astronaut sightings. In the field studies section, [Roy Craig](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/tamucush/00151/tamu-00151.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015331450&usg=AOvVaw25EG18gO_M_-IUPfw0npKB) concedes that some of the older cases suggest something extraordinary (Great Falls, RB-47).

November — Two children are playing in the garden of their father’s hotel in Southampton, England, when they notice a “speck” come out of the clouds. It grows in size and comes closer, moving above the hotel roof. The shape is a large flattened disc with black square windows on the side. It moves to a point about 10 feet directly above them and hovers for 30 seconds, then it speeds up and disappears behind some trees. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 6 (June 1978): 2)

November 2 — 3:55 a.m. A partially paralyzed Algerian veteran, Dr. X, has suffered an injury to his leg while chopping at a stump on his property in a village in the south of France on October 29. He is lying in bed when he is awakened by his crying 14-month-old son. He sees two luminous objects outside his house. They are coming close together and merging about 590 feet away. A vertical beam of light is aimed at him for a second as the object tilts, and then the display vanishes with a sort of explosion, leaving behind a slowly dissolving cloud.

Shortly afterwards, the man’s leg heals and his war wound is better. He also experiences nightmares, stomach pains, and a red pigmentation appears around his navel, forming a triangle. He goes to a dermatologist but does not mention the UFO; the doctor is stumped. The man’s son also develops a red triangle. In November 1984, a French radio reporter records the gradual reappearance of the triangle on X’s abdomen.

November 20 — 5:45 p.m. Milan and Doris Milakovic and their son are driving southwest out of Hanbury, Staffordshire, England, when several rabbits run across the road from their left. Suddenly they see a brilliant object. They stop the car and watch as it rises from a field on their left, silently pass over the car, and move toward a solitary house about 300 feet away on the right where it stops and hovers, “quivering like jelly.” The air temperature seems to drop. For approximately 5 minutes, they see what appear to be several humanoid figures walking across the bright top of the UFO, which is as wide as the house. Intermittently, some of the figures bend down as though looking at something in the part of the object below the rim. Then the UFO begins moving up in a pulsating or jerky movement. The intensity of its light increases and Milakovic feels like his eyes are burning. Thoroughly frightened, Milakovic pushes his wife and son back into the car and speeds away from the scene. (W.

November 23 — 8:05 p.m. An accountant named Jones is driving his 1967 Ford Custom along the road between Newton and Albany, Georgia. When he rounds a bend he sees a brilliant yellowish-white light about 200 feet ahead of him and 50–75 feet above the road. As he approaches, the car radio fades into static. Then the object emits a beam of well-defined light about 5–6 feet across that illuminates the trees and causes his engine and radio to cut out as it passes over his car. The object changes color to orange-red and ascends at a high rate of speed, disappearing in less than 15 seconds. The car engine starts spontaneously afterward.

November 25 — 6:00 p.m. Elaine Pelchy is driving with her 2-year-old son and dog on Highway 174 south of Marcellus, New York, when they see an object with five red, blinking lights about 100 feet in front of her car and heading

southeast. The radio gets a lot of static and the English setter begins to get nervous, clawing at the window and putting its head over its eyes and ears. The boy starts crying, then the car engine begins to sputter. The object executes a U-turn and moves to the northwest as the lights change to blinking blue and white. Suddenly, the UFO stops and changes to a white, dome-shaped object with a “fluorescent star” next to it. The larger object merges into the star and disappears. Pelchy drops her son off at her mother-in-law’s, then returns on the same route. The dog starts to whine again as a light the size of a basketball fluctuates in intensity and zigzags across the sky. She goes home but returns to the scene with a neighbor and the light is still visible and maneuvering. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

Late December — 11:30 a.m. Traumatologist Sebastian José Tarda is on vacation in Patagonia and leading a group of secondary school students on a motorboat field trip on Nahuel Huapi Lake, Argentina. Tarda is taking photos of the lake shore near Puerto Blest, but does not notice anything unusual. When one slide is developed, it shows a blurry white object against a mountainous background. An analysis by the Argentine UFO group Circulo de Investigación Cientifico Espacial states that the image is not caused by a lens flare, damaged emulsion, or a known object. Another analysis suggests that the object moved while the shutter was depressed. Ground Saucer Watch considers it a lens flare.

1969 — The CIA’s Operation Often is initiated by the chief of the CIA’s Technical Services Branch, [Sidney Gottlieb](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Gottlieb&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015343053&usg=AOvVaw0qz-soOZMJht_DeRn1Auv2)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Gottlieb&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015343331&usg=AOvVaw0RTaBXOrmpgTAF3jkQ3QtA) to “explore the world of black magic” and “harness the forces of darkness and challenge the concept that the inner reaches of the mind are beyond reach.” As part of the operation, Gottlieb and other CIA employees visit with and recruit fortune-tellers, palm-readers, clairvoyants, astrologers, mediums, psychics, specialists in demonology, witches and warlocks, Satanists, and other occult practitioners.

1969 — In Passport to Magonia, [Jacques Vallée](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%25C3%25A9e&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015346754&usg=AOvVaw3cuFNwaYRqrNOcUZE53V1V) proposes a radically revisionist argument that UFOs are better understood when related to folk traditions about supernatural creatures (elementals, fairies, angels, demons) than to astronomers’ speculations about life in outer space. He says science cannot adequately deal with such matters, although he does not specifically disavow the scientific method. It is the first book to question the ETH and the first to lay the groundwork for the psychosocial hypothesis, which sees UFOs as largely the product of unusual mental states and perpetuated by social acceptance. He argues that ostensible otherworldly manifestations are fantastic images propelled via psychic technology from humanity’s future to generate myths and religions that will change fate. In time the book leads to a new school of ufology whose advocates hold that UFOs and other anomalous experiences are internally generated and shaped entirely by cultural processes as opposed to nonhuman intelligences. [Jerry Clark](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Clark&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015347202&usg=AOvVaw1W1yC0tO-9_QR0DQ--Usm3) writes that the “genius of Passport, a genuinely brilliant work, is its success in placing UFOs into not only cultural but experiential context.” (Jacques Vallée, [Passport to Magonia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/passporttomagoni0000vall/page/n1/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015347734&usg=AOvVaw1bUjGnySh3foNl2CFegOHL), Regnery, 1969; Clark III 939–940, 1214)

Owens, who calls himself the “PK Man,” attributes his psychic and precognitive abilities to UFO occupants who operated on his brain when he was a child, a modification that made him half-human, half-alien.

But the light suddenly moves from above the water to below the surface and heads rapidly toward the ship at 45° to the bow, passing below the vessel. The sailors run to the starboard side to see whether it will emerge, but it does not. Nothing is tracked on radar or sonar or by the ECM system.

One of the guests calls his attention to a strange object visible about 30° above the horizon to the west of where he is standing. Carter describes the object as being bright white and about as bright as the moon. It appears to have closed in on where he is standing but stops beyond a stand of pine trees some distance from him. The object changes color, first to blue, then to red, then back to white, before appearing to recede into the distance.

Carter feels that the object is self-illuminated and not solid in nature. Carter’s report indicates that it is witnessed by about 10–12 other people and is in view for 10–12 minutes before it passes out of sight. Skeptic [Robert](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sheaffer&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015352333&usg=AOvVaw1WT-c90fyGEF3sIEopqEE_) [Sheaffer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sheaffer&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015352582&usg=AOvVaw3YbBPbckd4QDr7R5_3gMgF) concludes that the object is a misidentification of Venus.

January 25 — 12:30 a.m. A young couple is driving near Plattville, Illinois. The woman sees a bright object like an ice- cream cone low in the sky ahead, traveling big end first. They get within a quarter mile and the object turns point up and only 30 feet off the ground. Security lights on a nearby farmhouse go off. The object spins and flashes, and the car engine and lights go off. The front end of the car lifts 3 feet off the ground. The UFO moves away and the car drops and regains its power. (Michael D.

February 7 — 7:30 a.m. Tiago Machado, 19, wakes up at his home in Pirassununga, São Paulo, Brazil, and hears a neighbor shouting about a silvery-blue object landed on a hill on the grounds of the Zootecníca. He watches it for a time, then goes in to get binoculars. He goes off to the hill and approaches the object until he is about 33 feet away. It is a disc made of silvery metal with a dome on top. It is about 13 feet in diameter and stands on three legs. A door opens and two men come floating down to the ground. Machado can see two other beings inside. The men walk toward him, making signs. They are wearing silver diver’s suits, have black teeth and thin-lipped mouths, and one eye is lower than the other. Each has a kind of burn or cicatrice on each cheek. Machado is nervous, so he lights a cigarette. The beings apparently think this is funny, so he tosses the cigarette pack toward them. One of them leans sideways and stretches out his hand. The pack floats 8 inches up to his hand and disappears. Suddenly one of Machado’s friends calls out to him, and the beings walk back to the UFO, still facing him, and jump up to the door. The last one in pauses and pulls out a kind of weapon, points it at Machado, and a flame like a welding arc comes out of the barrel and floats toward him, hitting him in the thigh. He feels faint and paralyzed as the UFO takes off. His friends carry him to a neighbor’s house and find a red swelling on his leg.

Later, investigators find three imprints in an equilateral triangle at the site, each about 5 inches in diameter. Soil samples taken show no radioactivity.

February 18 — Morning. Barbara Smyth, a teacher in a small town in Alberta, is driving to school when she sees on her right a “gigantic, bright pinky-red coloured” object “about seven times the size of a steel granary of 14ft. diameter.” It looks like two rounded layers divided by a thin blue line. There are two flashing white lights on the top and a tent-like structure that pulsates and changes color from silver to fiery yellow. The UFO starts spinning counterclockwise and jumps over to the next hill. Suddenly, her car is no longer under her control as it floats down a very bumpy road. After three minutes the UFO disappears, and the car returns to normal. (W. K.

March 17 — Two pilots are flying a Cessna 150 between Phoenix and Lake Havasu, Arizona, when the pilot in the right seat rises up and sees maybe 2 dozen oval, white discs on the left side of the plane, flying very low and in a rough formation. Each has the hint of a blister near the front. The speed is 200–300 mph, and the only maneuver they make is pitch and roll, all done simultaneously, in unison.

April 17 — Morning. T. J. Hefferman of Bungawalban, New South Wales, wakes up and notices that his dogs are “strangely subdued.” Outside, he finds a flattened area in a sacaline (Reynoutria sachalinensis) forage crop on his property. A roughly circular area is flattened in four distinct patches, the largest 60 by 15 feet. All the stalks lie in one direction, north to south. The previous night, two men working night shift on a flood mitigation dredge a quarter mile north of the farm had seen a glow in the sky, and a neighboring farmer had seen two “toplike objects” moving about for a number of nights.

A powerful beam of light switches on across the top of the cane path, and it slowly turns in a half circle before going out and being replaced by a “low beam” and “cabin lights.” A UFO is above the cane and she feels a powerful force lifting her up and pulling her toward the object when the “high beam” is on.

They estimate it is 5 feet off the ground, 20 feet long, and 200 feet away. They can hear a whining noise like a generator. After 15 minutes, the object turns and zooms over some nearby power lines, over the trees, and out of sight. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, p. 77)

April 23 — 2:00 a.m. Virginia A. Guinn and a boarder are awakened by loud howlings and yowlings from the dogs and cats at her farm in Silver Spring, Maryland. Going outside, the witnesses see a round UFO “as large as two rooms” that is a bluish-white color like the glow around a welder’s arc. The object is moving beyond the barn to the north-northeast. They heard a humming noise and the object blinks out and the animals quiet down.

April 25 — 7:30 p.m. A woman and her 11-year-old daughter are travelling by taxi past Roberts Park in Greenacre, New South Wales, when they spot a “Japanese lantern” above some trees. One minute later, as the taxi turns a corner, they see it again, 100–130 feet away, apparently in the same spot. The driver stops the taxi, and they can see what looks like a metallic craft, approximately 33 feet in diameter, with the appearance of “two soup bowls joined rim- to-rim.” There is a steady red light on top. The object seems to be noiselessly rocking backwards and forwards, at a frequency of 1–2 rocks per second. A “depressing blue glow” can be seen through a window that takes up most of the upper part. A humanoid figure is apparently operating controls near the window. Another figure is pointing at the witnesses. A third seems to be walking toward a back door. All three are apparently human-sized and are either wearing tight black clothing, are black skinned, or seen in silhouette. After 15 seconds or less, the driver speeds off down the road, drops the couple off, and drives off quickly without taking their fare. At 8:00 p.m., the woman and her daughter return to the park.

May 1 — 5:30 p.m. An illuminated triangular object moves soundlessly from south to north over Negru Vodă, Romania.

After 20 minutes of hanging motionless it disappears swiftly to the east. (Hobana and Weverbergh 161–162)

May 4–9 — 3:00 p.m. A 24-year-old Brazilian soldier named José Antônio da Silva is fishing by himself at Bebedouro (apparently a small lagoon in the Área de Proteção Ambiental do Carste de Lagoa Santa) near Matozinhos, Minas Gerais, Brazil, when he begins dozing off. He perceives figures moving around him, and he feels himself shot with something that paralyzes his legs. Two small humanoid beings, joined by a third, drag him off into a strange machine shaped like two saucers joined together by a thick, vertical cylinder. The machine lifts off, and after a long interval it lands. Da Silva is carried by his armpits into a large quadrangular room, where he finds himself with his original three captors and a fourth being—also humanoid, with red hair and a beard that comes down to his waist—who seems to be their leader. He remembers afterward that all four have mouths that look like fishes’ mouths. The room is made of stone. Inside, on a low shelf seemingly fashioned out of stone, da Silva sees the bodies of four human men lying stretched out side by side. Naked, rigid, and positioned on their backs, the bodies bear no visible wounds, but it is obvious that they are dead. One is a well-built black man and another has light brown skin. Two others, more slightly built, are Caucasian, one of them very blond “like a foreigner.” The beings do not speak any Portuguese but, using pictures, the leader manages to convey to da Silva that they want him to be their guide and weapons provider for what he supposes is a subsequent invasion of Earth. He refuses, fingering his crucifix, which the angry leader rips from his hand. Out of nowhere, da Silva sees appear in front of him a human figure who stands motionless, gazing at him in a friendly fashion. The figure, about five and a half feet tall, is Caucasian, slender, bearded with long fair hair, and dressed in a friar’s cassock. Amazingly, the little men seem oblivious to his presence. Speaking in Portuguese, the figure gives da Silva certain “revelations” that he afterward insists on keeping secret. He apparently knows who the figure is but he does not reveal that either, saying only that he wasn’t Jesus. The figure vanishes, and the beings who have abducted him start quarreling among themselves. They carry da Silva back to their machine; there follows another flight, another landing. Da Silva awakens in the dawn of what turns out to be May 9, four and a half days after his abduction, some 300 miles to the east of the place where he had been abducted. He supposedly bears the physical marks of his ordeal— wounds on his neck, lameness in one leg—for days afterward.

May 11 — 2:00 a.m. Near the village of Chapeau, Quebec, on L’Isle-aux-Allumettes in the Ottawa River, farmer Leo Paul Chaput is awakened by his dog barking. He looks out the window and sees a brilliant light close to the ground. The light source seems to be a domed craft with a flat bottom (like a World War I helmet) about 500 feet away. He looks away briefly, and the object is gone, although he can hear the diminishing sound of a motor.

When Chaput gets up in the morning, he finds a large circular indentation in the ground, 600 feet from his house. The impression is 32 feet in diameter and is surrounded by a ring of scorched grass 2.5 feet wide. Inside, the vegetation is not damaged, but there are three holes that form a perfect equilateral triangle, 15 feet on a side. The holes are 8 inches in diameter and 3 inches deep. He finds a second, slightly smaller circle to the southwest, again with scorched grass and 3 indentations. A third ground marking, a semicircle, is near the second. (Donald E. Keyhoe and Gordon I. R.

May 12 — The DARPA Pandora Project committee discusses plans to move forward with eight human subjects who will be exposed to microwaves similar to the Moscow Signal and then given a full battery of medical and psychological tests. The committee recommends “gonadal protection be provided” to the male test subjects;

May 18–20 — Evening. A localized power blackout cuts off electricity at the Lester Kaiser farm near Rising Sun, Indiana, for 2 hours. The next night, George Kaiser watches a hairy, muscular, bipedal creature that flees upon being seen. It leaves tracks showing three toes and a big toe.

May 22 — 11:00 p.m. Graham Longey sees a large, brilliant, circular white object hovering a few feet off the ground at Glenorchy, Tasmania. Windows encircle its midsection. It begins to move rapidly upward, and by the time he dashes out of his house it is gone. On the site, Longey finds an elliptical area of burned grass 18 feet by 12 feet. A small tree nearby is scorched and has limbs broken. He notices an oily smell. (Clark III 1139)

May 23 — 6:35 p.m. A 13-year-old boy in Cloverdale, Western Australia, notices a moving light to the south and about 10° above the horizon. He calls his mother, who sees a steady red light on top of a more diffuse blue-white light darting haphazardly in a zigzag pattern but in general moving to the north until it disappears behind their house. The witnesses shift their position and can still see the light hovering in the northwest. The light is now seen as circular with hazy edges and about half the diameter of the full moon. At about 7:00 p.m. it moves at high speed to the north. The mother calls the radar station at Kalamunda, which simultaneously gets a request from Perth Airport to check out an unidentified echo on their meteorological radar. The Kalamunda operator sees a large echo some 9 miles away, which reappears for short durations on 5 further occasions and is last seen at 7:42 p.m. (Swords 397–398; Bill Chalker, “[1969: The Great UFO Daze of Oz,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://theozfiles.blogspot.com/2020/09/1969-great-ufo-daze-of-oz.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015389527&usg=AOvVaw3tOhvjPuAt6GKF6G-w00ky)” The Oz Files, September 19, 2020)

June 19 — 11:50 p.m. Arthur Hendry, 17, is getting ready to cycle home near Docking, Norfolk, England, when he hears a strange whistling noise above him that intensifies and becomes a powerful throbbing. His muscles feel frozen or paralyzed as if he is receiving a severe electric shock. After a few seconds the noise stops, and he feels normal again.

June 26 — 2:30 p.m. Sr. Benedito, a justice of the peace, is walking along a trail about 4 miles northwest of Ibiúna, São Paulo, Brazil, when he hears a humming noise like a swarm of bees. He sees an odd object rocking from side to side that suddenly drops into the brush out of sight. Thinking it is an accident, he approaches to within 20 feet and sees the landed object, which then ascends, hovers a moment, and takes off in a gentle climb. He hears the humming sound again and feels a blast of air as it moves away. The Brazilian Air Force investigates the landing, and UFO investigator Hans Bemelmans finds some scorched grass in the thickly tangled brush.

July — After a series of UFO sightings and landing traces are reported in the area around Ibiúna, São Paulo, Brazil, the Brazilian Air Force informs local officials who are investigating the reports that they must not “under any circumstances give any information on UFO activity to any press, radio, or television reporter or representative.

July 4 — 8:00 p.m. Two children, Mauricio Gnecco and Enrique Osorio, in Anolaima, Colombia, see a glowing object about 900 feet away. It approaches to within 180 feet and the children run over the hill to tell other children and adults. Thirteen people, including their father, return to see the object. Arcesio Bermúdez takes a flashlight with him and returns in terror after seeing a small person and a craft that lights up and flies away. Within 2 days, Bermúdez loses all appetite, his skin temperature drops, blue spots appear on his skin, and his stools become bloody. Within a week, two Bogotá physicians, unaware of his UFO experience, concludes he has gastroenteritis. Within hours of his exam, Bermúdez dies. His doctor claims he has previously been in good health. His injuries suggest a fatal whole-body ionizing radiation dose of 300–500 rems. Likely only X-rays, gamma rays, or neutrons could travel a distance of 45 feet through the air.

July 11 or 18 — 8:30 p.m. Economics student Tim Oliver is near a golf course on the outskirts of Beaufort, Victoria, Australia, when he sees a red “star” over a hill about a mile away. On closer inspection, it proves to be a hovering UFO. He quickly goes home, and by the time he returns with his mother in the family car, the UFO has been joined by another identical object. They are moving about 20 mph to the southeast, 50 feet in the air, 200 feet apart, and nearly parallel to some high-powered electrical lines. As they drive to right outside the golf course, both UFOs apparently respond to their presence by turning toward them but soon resumed their parallel course when Oliver turns the car engine off. Oliver walks to within 50 feet of the leading object. Each is about 30 feet in diameter, saucer-shaped, with an upper flat-topped cupola and about 24 square windows through which comes the bright red light. They are completely silent. Both he and his mother (who has watched from the golf course fence) see the UFOs disappear to the southeast, still flying parallel to the power lines.

July 13 — Early morning. Edgar Paquette and Mrs. Leo Edwards are driving near Petawawa, Ontario, when they see a bright star that lights up the Ottawa River next to them. Convinced the light is following them, Paquette turns off the headlights, which makes the object appear to hesitate. But he gets out of the car, causing the interior light to go on, and the object descends to within 60 feet of the ground. When he starts signaling it with a flashlight, it comes even closer, and Paquette sees that it is 8 feet in diameter with two legs beneath it. Both of them panic and drive home, dragging their teenage children out of bed to look at the light. Ontario police officers Jack McKay and Grant Chaplin follow the light for 38 minutes as it travels at a high altitude. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, pp. 83–84)

Mid-July — Bernard O’Brien is cutting grass in a field with his tractor near Manotick, Ontario, when a small cloud of smoke rises from the ground as he passes over a particular spot. He notifies the field’s owner, John Fox, who comes out for a look. Fox finds three near-perfect circles in the field, two together and the third nearly 150 feet away. Each of them are rings of affected grass 15–20 feet in diameter and about a foot wide. Grass is flattened inside the circle, but the rings themselves are dark and contain a crystalline substance.

Near the center of the circle, he finds three ground indentations, positioned so as to form the inside points of a triangle. Off to one side is the taller stand of tea tree, also bleached and dead. He remembers seeing this from afar three weeks earlier, arousing his curiosity. The dead scrubweed within the circle is still standing and undisturbed.

October — NICAP obtains a copy of a chapter of a textbook in use at the US Air Force Academy, Introductory Space Science, for the academy’s Physics 370 course. The last chapter is on “Unidentified Flying Objects” and concludes that the “UFO phenomenon appears to have been global in nature for almost 50,000 years” and considers the “unpleasant possibility of alien visitors to our planet, or at least of alien controlled UFO’s.” It recommends keeping an “open and skeptical mind.” (“[AF Academy Teaches Students UFOs Real,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%2520States/UFO%2520Research%2520Newsletter%2520(Lore)/UFO%2520Research%2520Newsletter%2520-%25201971%252004%2520-%2520Vol%252001%2520No%252001.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015413147&usg=AOvVaw2M3DumE-XxQunofCCKPerg)” UFO Research Newsletter 1, no. 1 (April 1971): 1; ClearIntent, [pp. 13–14](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/clearintentgover00fawc/page/12/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015413469&usg=AOvVaw3wqpmMb8-gJXkCi-vGQrtG); Good Need, [p. 230](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/needtoknow00good/page/230/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015413692&usg=AOvVaw2lg2A_QuYgHEUbvyUqEwNI))

October 3 — After 8:00 p.m. RCMP Constable S. B. Barrie and his wife Vivian are driving 5 miles west of Rennie, Manitoba, on a poor highway in bad weather. He stops to clean mud off the headlights and noticees a light to the east hanging just off Highway 44 and over the trees. He continues driving and he sees the light as a light-pink inverted saucer moving with a jerky motion. Now only 500 feet away, it seems to be 20 feet in diameter with an odd white tail that snakes toward the ground. Suddenly the car’s windshield wipers stop working, the headlights go out, and the engine stalls. Barrie gets out of the car and the object zooms silently to the southwest and is lost to sight. He senses the air has a strange, heavy odor, but he is able to get the car started again. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, pp. 81–82)

October 8 — A large area of St. Louis, Missouri, is blanketed by a pure-white, sticky substance ranging from dime-size to 10-foot-long streamers. The majority of it sublimates on ground contact. The Smithsonian concludes it is caused by ballooning spiders, even though only one spider specimen is found. When a sample is tested by Wayne E. Black of the St. Louis County Health Department, he finds the samples test negative for protein, the basic composition of spider web.

October 24 — 12:43 a.m. A Chilean Navy destroyer is moving north at 20 knots in the South Pacific Ocean about 350 miles south of Valparaiso, Chile. The radar officer reports a target rapidly approaching the ship, apparently moving 213 miles in one minute, which would indicate a speed of 12,780 mph. At 12:47 a.m., the target is only 12 miles away, and it suddenly breaks into six targets. The officer in charge and five other personnel can now see one massive and five smaller lighted objects approaching the ship. The large UFO looks like a big box with semicircles on the side, and it is bigger than the ship, which is 360 feet long. The five smaller objects are egg- shaped, bluish, and no more than 8 feet long and 5–6 feet wide. At about 6,000 feet from the ship, the smaller objects move away from the larger one, three to portside and two to starboard, and begin flying in ellipses between the ship and the large object. At 900 feet away, the officers can hear the object make a humming noise. The ship’s power and instruments go dead as the large object passes overhead. Bright red lights under the UFO seem to be moving back and forth inside the craft, visible through a half-circle on the bottom. “Corn cobs” with green or turquoise pulsating lights are on the side. When the UFO is 600 feet away, the power comes back on.

The smaller objects, never coming closer than 1,500–3,000 feet, fly around the ship and join up with the large object on the other side. All 6 objects vanish about 2 miles away. At least 8 minutes have passed, with three radar technicians tracking the UFOs. The ship’s commander orders everyone to keep silent about what they have seen. The sighting is deleted from the ship’s log. The six witnesses are debriefed for two days in Valparaiso by two Chilean Navy officers and four Americans who are allegedly naval attachés with the US Embassy.

October 24–27 — The Turkish Air Force is inundated with reports of UFOs over Ankara, Turkey. Jet fighters are scrambled from Mürted Air Base \[now closed\] northwest of the city and close to within 7.5 miles, but the objects always pull away and climb higher. Even the base commander, Ercüment Gökaydin, flies with the interceptors to 35,000 feet, but the UFO is at a height of 50,000 feet. It is a silvery, oval disc. The jets take gun-camera film, which has never been released. One pilot says the object has three round portholes.

October 30 — 10:00 a.m. Mr. and Mrs. Chapin are driving at their mine site near Redding, California, when they see a rattlesnake in the road. As they get out to go to the mine and kill the snake, they find the area oddly hot. They notice a disturbance in the brush some 60 feet away in a flattened area of mine tailings. An egg-shaped object rises noiselessly a few feet off the ground and takes off down the canyon, swaying but not striking small trees. Soon it zooms upward at a sharp angle and is out of sight in seconds. They find a shallow, oval, depressed spot less than 2 inches deep and 10 feet across in the mine tailings. A conical pile of unusual-looking sand is also discovered, and two days later they find a metallic glob about the size of a fist nearby. They have the material analyzed in 1977. Scattered about in the unusual sand pile are irregular bits of pale-green glass-like material made of nearly pure silicon. The metal glob is completely black on the outside and 77% copper in the interior, combined with tin and traces of silver, chromium, and other metals. Both are considered foreign to the geology of the mine site. (“The Redding, California CE II Case,” IUR 3, no. 3 (March 1978): insert)

December 28 — A man named Patric is driving from Midland to Windsor, Ontario, on heavily snowed roads after an accident has blocked the main highway. Suddenly, his car engine, headlights, and radio fails, and he crawls to a halt in front of a star-like glow with a prismatic, multi-colored aura 100 feet ahead. Inside the glow is a domed object.

1970 — The CIA is testing a small drone aircraft in the shape of a bird at Groom Lake, Nevada. Called Project Aquiline, the agency wants to fly a reconnaissance UAV over key intelligence targets, such as ICBM sites and nuclear test grounds in the Soviet Union and China, without detection. At least one of the prototypes is flown from Area 51 more than 20 times. The project is cancelled in 1971 before deployment and has never been declassified.

Early 1970 — 10:00 p.m. A peasant in the Taijiang(?) District of Fujian province, China, sees a metallic, pan-shaped object land behind a hill. It radiates a brilliant green light, and a strange musical tone emanates from it. After he reports it, the local army commander mobilizes hundreds of soldiers who attempt to surround the object. After about one hour, the object emits a bright white light and takes off vertically. (Wendelle Stevens and Paul Dong, UFOs over Modern China, UFO Photo Archive, 1983, p. 56)

Early 1970s — 2:30–3:00 a.m. Two young men in Furnace Creek, California, are followed by a red ball of light the size of a beach ball. They get scared and run ahead to their house, slamming and locking the door behind them. The ball stops at the edge of their yard, hovering and oscillating in size. After 4–5 minutes, the ball moves away and creates a vortex, causing stones to rise and circle in the air. They can hear the sound of the stones hitting together. Then the light blinks out, and the rocks crash down onto the road. (Michael D. Swords, “Timmermania: A Step Too Far into the Timmerman Files?” IUR 27, no. 4 (Winter 2002–2003): 9)

January 1 — 5:00 a.m. Registered nurse Doreen Kendall is looking out a window at the Cowichan District Hospital in Duncan, British Columbia, and sees a bright, Saturn-shaped object about 50 feet in diameter hovering one story above her, about 60 feet off the ground and 40 feet away. It has a row of lights around its middle. She can see two humanoid figures in dark, tight-fitting clothing and wearing headgear in the upper portion. One stands at an instrument panel, with the other behind it. The second being looks directly at Kendall, then touches the first being,

January 7 — 4:45 p.m. Two skiers, lumberjack Aarno Heinonen and farmer Esko Viljo, at Imjärvi, Finland, watch a disc- shaped, buzzing UFO approach them and hover. It is so close to Heinonen that he could touch it with his ski pole. From an opening in the center of the object’s bottom, a bright light beam is emitted, creating an illuminated area of 3 feet in diameter on the snow beneath it, edged with black. A red gray mist descends again; when it clears, both men can see, only 10 feet away, a 3-foot tall humanoid creature standing in the illuminated area, carrying in its hands a black box with a pulsating yellow light. Its arms and legs are very thin, its face pale like wax, and its nose hooked; it wears a light green coverall with darker green knee boots, white gauntlets, and a conical metallic helmet. Then the mist again descends, and long red, green, and purple sparks float out from the lighted area. A sort of flame rises from this spot and enters the UFO; then the mist and the UFO vanish. After this experience, Heinonen finds his right leg numb, and he vomits and passes black urine; Viljo also suffers severe physiological effects. Heinonen claims, two years later, a series of contacts with a female spacewoman.

March 28 — 11:00 p.m. About 30 UFO spotters gathered on Cradle Hill, just outside Warminster, Wiltshire, England, see a flashing purple light. One of their sensors buzzes, indicating a strong magnetic field, and one observer (Norman Foxwell) takes photos that appear in the July/August 1970 Flying Saucer Review. But the UFO is actually a light beam from a high-intensity purple spot-lamp operated by a group of UFO debunkers, among them physicist David

April 29–30 — Around midnight. Several independent groups of witnesses to the west of Lake Anten, Västra Götaland, Sweden, watch a red, glowing sphere fly around the lake and neighboring areas. It occasionally sends out a beam of light to the ground. Some of the observers get the impression that the beams originate on the ground rather than from the object. The next morning a few of the observers get into boats and sail to the spot where the sphere was seen hovering. In one corner of the garden of an isolated farmhouse named Enebacken, they find three round marks, one foot in diameter and 1.5 inches deep, burned into the ground in the shape of an equilateral triangle. A UFO group in Gothenburg, Sweden, takes soil samples to a laboratory for gamma-ray testing and finds significant non-background radiation at a peak that seems to derive from cesium-137, a radioactive isotope.

May 14 — 9:45 p.m. A graduate engineering student in Bangor, Maine, notices two nocturnal lights in the Ursa Major constellation moving in a counterclockwise circle around a common center at a constant velocity. They abruptly stop moving, leaving them in a north-south position. After a short time, they move away from each other, then the light moving south suddenly halts. The other light is moving slower than a meteor but faster than a jet aircraft. (J.

May 29 — John L. Acuff, an experienced manager but not a UFO researcher, becomes the new president of NICAP. He is the former executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers \[now the Society for Imaging Science and Technology\], which has cooperated with NICAP on photoanalysis but also has military and CIA connections. Acuff and G. Stuart Nixon dismantle the NICAP system of affiliates and state subcommittee system that have promoted the organization for years. Regional members are told to operate independently from one another; cooperation is discouraged. Criticism of the government’s UFO policy is no longer permitted and NICAP turns into a mere “sighting collection center.” Nixon is appointed executive director.

June — 12:45 a.m. A truck driver is approaching Emerald Beach, New South Wales, when he sees a bright light on he ocean side of the highway. A circular object rises from behind some woods 1,600 feet from the road. It hovers for 30 seconds at an altitude of 66 feet. Relative to the trees, the object appears to be about 33 feet in diameter, and flames seem to shoot from its base. It slowly returns to the ground, where it is partially obscured by trees, but it continues to emit beams of light from its top and sides. Fearful, the driver leaves the area.

Two humanoid figures are standing on the rim. After a while the object skims the surface of the water and takes off, lights flashing from the underside. Once airborne, the wife can clearly see the two occupants sitting inside. (UFOEv II 460; Brazil 128–130)

At the same time, their daughter Bonnie and a friend are at a swimming pool about one-half mile away when they see 3 silvery discs flying end-to-end in the direction of their home. The parents then see the discs as well. The cigar and the

July 4 — 3:00 a.m. A 33-year-old Port Monmouth, New Jersey, housewife wakes up and sees a “big round ball” with an “eerie white glow” hovering over the meadows across the street. She watches it bouncing back and forth for 15 minutes as a series of red lights flash in sequence across it. The size is about 25–30 feet wide. The streetlight has gone out and comes back on when the object leaves. Her son and brother-in-law later find three imprints 30–40 feet apart in the shape of a triangle in the meadow. They also find circles impressed in the grass, the largest 15–20 feet in diameter. Then they find tracks “going to the creek like they had dragged some small round thing into the ditch” as well as “two sets of a dozen imprints which were about two feet apart. They were curved like raindrops. It was very visible, the grass was all crushed down, there was mud on the banks of the creek, and there were signs of the tracks in the mud.” One week later, the light returns and crosses the field across the street. The family television, the car ignition, and the telephone behave strangely for days afterward. (Berthold E.

July 25 — 5:30 p.m. A witness comes across a landed domed disc, about 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet high with windows in the dome and portholes in its side, sitting on 4 legs near Jabreilles-les-Bordes, Haute-Vienne, France.

August — Day. A group of Russian hydrologists are conducting research on a motorboat on Kronotsky Lake, Kamchatka Krai, Russia. Suddenly, about a half-mile away a dome of water rises up and a gray-colored oval object rises up. It is roughly 165 feet in diameter, rises to about 500 feet, and hovers nearly overhead. The engine of the motorboat stalls. The team watches for another 90 seconds before they row away, but the object moves away at reat speed and disappears. The boat’s motor starts working again.

August 13 — 10:50 p.m. Police officer Evald Hansen Maarup is driving 5 miles south of Haderslev, Denmark, when he is surrounded by a bluish-white light. His engine stops and the car lights and radio go out. Heat inside the car increases. He sees a conical light coming from the bottom of a large, silent, gray object. After a few seconds, the light is drawn into the UFO, a process that takes about 5 minutes. It speeds away vertically.

August 14 — 8:45 p.m. Residents of Little Heart’s Ease and St. Jones Within on the Southwest Arm in Newfoundland watch a blood-red fireball 8–10 feet long with a trail of lighter color for about 5 minutes as it passes overhead to the northeast. It makes a rushing noise before it crashes into the water near the mouth of the harbor at Little Heart’s Ease. When the RCMP arrive to investigate, they go out in a boat but can find no submerged object. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August North, 2022, p. 102)

August 29 — 11:15 p.m. Several witnesses in Enebacken, Sweden, see a bright, round, red light maneuvering around the ground, emitting beams of yellow-white light. Three round landing marks in a triangular formation are found in the garden of Richard Johansson’s small farm near Lake Anten. Soil samples are taken and analyzed, with the results showing an increased level of gamma radiation in the test samples from one of the landing marks.

August 30 — 11:30 a.m. A 7-year-old girl in Vincennes, Indiana, sees a metallic disc in the east-northeast hovering over Wheatland Road. She tells her parents, and her father goes outside and sees it too. He re-enters the house to get his 7x50 binoculars. The object is about a quarter of a mile away and looks like a squared-off conning tower about 30 feet in diameter. They watch it for 90 seconds, after which it leaves in a swooping dive to the north-northeast.

September — 9:00 p.m. While walking home from a high school football game in Jessup, Pennsylvania, Frank Scassellati, 16, observes a glowing white, apparently metallic, silvery disc in the southeast sky moving from left to right.

Around the dome on top is a row of rectangular windows; three spheres and a flat circle are visible on the underside. The object moves out of sight behind local terrain. Though he does not report the sighting to any authorities, Scassellati says that a few nights later he notices a limousine parked outside of his house with four men in black suits and hats sitting in it. They reappear for several nights but he has no interaction with them.

September 8 — Dusk. A farmer near Zillah, Washington, is dismounting from his tractor when he sees a triangular object hovering in the air. Steel gray in color, it has a red light at each of its bottom corners and white lights in its center. It eventually moves upward and out of sight.

October 24 — 1:00 a.m. Gerald Adams and Donna Martin are parked on a dirt road 3–4 miles north and a half-mile west of MacGregor, Manitoba. They notice a bright light approaching from about a half-mile away. When it lands 150 feet from them, they notice it is an oblong object 8 feet in diameter with 9 “rods” and a red light on top. Adams takes Martin home but returns to the site. The object has moved farther away and is hovering above the ground. As he drives closer, he sees a humanoid entity about 4 feet tall dressed in a helmet and a silver metallic uniform crossing the road about 50 feet in front of him. He brakes, but the entity has gone. The UFO slowly lifts vertically from the ground and speeds away to the northwest. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, pp. 146–150, 160)

October 29 — 5:40 p.m. Reidar Salvesen is driving about 2 miles east of Helleland, Rogaland, Norway, when a dazzling light forces him to stop the car. He looks up and sees a globe about 60 feet in diameter approaching noiselessly. It stops about 18 feet in front of the car and hovers for 50 seconds about 30 feet up. Suddenly the object shoots straight up into the air, causing Salvesen to fall on the pavement. He hears a sharp crack caused by his front windshield shattering. About 3,200 feet in the air the globe changes to a fireball, which quickly disappears. After sweeping up the shards of windowpane glass, he drives on, but feels a numbness in his tongue a few minutes later. He also has an abrasion on his hand from falling down, but the skin sloughs off as if burned, and he has a redness around his eyes when he returns home. His travel clock starts keeping time badly.

November — The UFO Subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics publishes a formal statement in its journal Aeronautics and Astronautics. It recommends “a continuing, moderate-level effort with emphasis on improved data collection by objective means and on high-quality scientific analysis” as the “only promising approach” to solving the UFO problem, and sharply criticizes the Colorado project’s conclusion that studying the subject will not add to scientific knowledge.

November 5 — 9:00 p.m. Albert Formiller is fishing for bass in Cholla Bay, Sonora, Mexico, when he sees a light in the sky coming from a saucer-shaped object, which stops and hovers about 200–300 feet above the surface. A light

from a tube on the bottom illuminates a broad stretch of water about one half-mile wide. It changes from a broad floodlight to a sharp spot on the surface, apparently as it is raised or lowered. After a few minutes, a cloud forms around the object. After 5 minutes, the searchlight is turned off and a similar light appears on top of the UFO, illuminating the upper part of the cloud. The object then moves west and is visible for 20 minutes in all. (Carl W. Feindt, “Beam of Light into a Body of Water,” IUR 33, no. 3 (December 2010): 23)

November 1 — 10:30 p.m. Stewart Wilkinson and his wife are driving on the Trans-Canada Highway just west of Pense, Saskatchewan, when they see an disc-shaped object with a beam of light extending down to the road. It follows his car about 20 feet to the right at an altitude of 10–15 feet. At one point it moves ahead and hovers above a truck parked a half-mile away. When he comes alongside the truck, the object moves to the left side of his car about 30 feet away and almost on the ground. Wilkinson slows down and comes to a stop, and the object follows suit, hovering for another 10–15 seconds before disappearing into the lights of Moose Jaw to the west. It has followed his car for 12 minutes and 10 miles. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, pp.

November 29 — 6:30 p.m. A 17-year-old student at Oizumi High School is riding his bicycle home at Tatebayasi, Gunma Prefecture, Japan, when he sees 5–6 objects flying in formation on a straight path from northeast to southwest.

Seconds later, a solitary object appears to the north and approaches swiftly. The student parks his bicycle and runs up some steps to a raised enclosure for a better view. The single UFO changes course and circles several times, descending slowly. It then hovers, climbs, and disappears. The student gets back on his bike and sees a bright flash of white light to the southeast, which startles him and he pedals home quickly. The student returns the next day to the enclosure, which is actually a raised tombstone. He finds four circular patches of flattened grass.

January 3 — 6:15 a.m. Maun and Matta Talana are drinking coffee when they see a brilliant light approaching from the lake outside their home at Saapunki, Kuusano, Finland. It is about 33 feet in diameter and moving against the wind. Their electricity goes off briefly. Looking out the window, the Talalas see their whole yard bathed in light caused by a huge fireball about 60 feet away, which rises up and disappears after a few seconds. Around 8:30 a.m., their son Timo asks them what the marks are in the snow outside. He has noticed a spot of hard green ice that is not covered with snow. Mauno takes some green ice and melts it into dark green water. The melted area is about 20 feet long by 10 feet wide, in the middle of which are ice needles as big as fingers with a ball of ice on top and some soot.

January 23 — The Porto Alegre, Brazil, newspaper Correiro do Povo notes UFO sightings are recurring in a rural location close to the federal capital of Brasília. An unnamed local peasant is quoted as saying that the “state governor” shows up regularly and looks for “little stones” in the nearby woods.

February 5 — 3:00 p.m. Petter Aliranta and Esko Juhani Sneck are working in the woods around Kangaskylä, near Kinnula, Finland, when they see a 15-foot object descend to a clearing 50 feet away. As it lands, a small entity just under 3 feet tall glides to the ground from an opening on the underside. Through 3 windows on the UFO, three more entities can be seen. The entity approaches Aliranta, who turns on his chain saw. Suddenly, the being turns around and heads back to the UFO. As the humanoid is rising back up into the air, Aliranta grabs it by the heel of its boot with his bare hand. It burns him like a hot iron, and he has to let go. The burns are clearly visible 2 months later. The humanoid gets back inside, and the UFO takes off with a hum. Before the two men go back, they look at markings in the snow. At the end of each landing foot there had ben a round plate. These plates have penetrated the full depth of the snow (1.3 feet), leaving four round prints forming an even square 6.5 feet on each side. Circular footprints left by the entity are clearly visible, about 6 inches wide. Possible hoax.

February 23 — 7:00 p.m. Thousands of people in Turin and other places in Piedmont, Italy, observe a conspicuous red cloud in the western sky, just above the crest of the Alps, moving majestically and changing shape slowly.

Someone takes a photograph of it from Caluso. The following day, the French Office National d’Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales announces that the cloud was caused by a Tibere, an experimental three-stage rocket for atmospheric reentry tests.

May — 6:00 a.m. A 16-mm film is allegedly taken of retrieved UFOs at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, New Mexico. It supposedly shows “three disc-shaped craft,” one of which lands and the other two fly away. A door opens on the landed vehicle and three human-sized beings emerge with an odd, gray complexion and pronounced noses. They wear tight-fitting jump suits and thin headdresses that appear to be communication devices. In their hands they hold a “translator.” A Holloman base commander and other Air Force officials go out to meet them.

Griehl goes to retrieve some binoculars and misses most of the sighting. It is an incandescent dark orange in color and moving from east to west. It begins floating down with a rocking movement and approaches to within 230 feet. Suárez Marzal sees that it is revolving because of a small circular mark on its rim. A dense cloud issues from the object and surrounds it, turning it pearly gray with a faintly bluish sheen. As it gets closer, the circular mark seems to extend like a bronze-colored cylinder and has a handle-like protuberance on top. At one point it moves away to the northeast and disappears for 4 seconds but reappears even closer, only 130 feet away. It remains stationary for 10 seconds, and the cylinder seems deliberately pointed toward the short-wave antenna on the nearby central post office. He estimates it is 18–20 feet in diameter. It continues rocking and changes shape from a globe to a hat to an oval. Then after being visible for 90 seconds it takes off suddenly to the

Yeoman Third Class James M. Kopf is in the Communications Center monitoring messages on various teletypes. Suddenly all the messages begin coming in garbled and he hears that all ship communications are out, including the radar, compasses, and electrical systems. A signalman from the deck tells them over the intercom that something is hovering above the ship. Kopf and others rush topside and see a huge, pulsating, orangish sphere stationed silently above the ship at a 60°–70° angle. The object remains about 20 minutes, but Kopf sees it only one minute before General Quarters sounds and he needs to return to his battle stations. The two F-4 Phantom jets on high readiness alert cannot take off. Soon the messaging returns to normal and the crew stands down after 2 hours. Kopf thinks only about 18 men witnessed the object out of the 5,000 on the carrier, because everyone is exhausted from the exercise. He hears that commanding officer Capt. [Ferdinand B.

June 9 — Evening. Esther Clappison sees a light through her windows in Rosedale, Alberta, and goes out onto her porch and sees a rectangular object on the ground. One end of it is open, revealing a diffused, white light. Two human- like forms are moving about inside. A third figure is outside in a crouched position, picking up rocks.

June 29 — 3:00 a.m. A man is hiking in Delamere Forest east of Chester, England, when an “electric blue light” appears ahead and moves toward him, dancing erratically in and out of the trees. He walks toward it but before taking 20 steps he finds himself walking calmly back. The object then moves along a mud track and disappears into a small “garage” in the bushes.

July 7 — 6:00 p.m. Spanish physician Guillermo Arguello de la Motta is a guest of his friend Antonio Arocha at San Juan de los Morros, Guárico, Venezuela. They suddenly see two men dressed in black, both wearing red ties and black berets. They emerge from a brand-new red Ford Mustang, at a distance of 1,600 feet from the house. They stand there waiting for 5 minutes, then begin to put on orange belts, talking together animatedly. Suddenly a shining object appears in the sky, descends, and stops at a height of 2 feet from the ground. It is circular, bell-shaped underneath, and has a “turret” on the top. The object changes rapidly in color from orange to blue and to white.

Suddenly a small staircase is dropped from the object, enabling the two men from the Mustang to enter the UFO. The staircase is drawn in, then the object takes off at an impressive speed.

July 8 — 1:15 p.m. Miner Claude Girard is parked on the road near the bridge over the Hurricana River in Joutel, Quebec, when he sees a circle 15–20 feet in diameter on the surface of the water with a jet of water in the center reaching a height of 20 feet. When the water jet settles down, Girard can see a cylindrical object, 6–8 feet in length and rusty black in color, beneath the surface. It slowly begins to lean to one side and sinks in less than a minute. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, p. 103)

July 17 — 10:45 p.m. Tea planter Parl Abeywickrema, his two assistants Oswin de Alwis and Nimal Dunuwille, and the driver Sirisena Wijesinghe are driving between the Hope Estate in Rikillagaskada, Sri Lanka, and the Rockwood Estate in Hewaheta when they see a bright object larger than the full moon above the hilly horizon. Soon it

approaches the, and Abeywickrema orders the driver to stop. They watch the object, now hovering about one- quarter mile away at an altitude of 1,000 feet. After 10 minutes it silently swoops toward them at high speed and stops 300 feet away at a height of 100 feet. The object is about 25 feet in diameter with two “tapering wings” on either side and casts a fluorescent yellow glow. After a few more minutes, the UFO moves toward the southwest at a 45° angle after drawing its two wings inside the main body. Some 50 witnesses report the same or similar objects in the same area that night, and both Abeywickrema and Wijesinghe report seeing UFOs around 2:00– 3:00 a.m. after returning home.

July 29 — A CIA internal memo reports that a citizen named Vartorella has expressed the opinion that the CIA used the Colorado project as “whitewash to cover a CIA-initiated program begun prior to January 1953.” The writer runs through a brief history of the Robertson Panel and suggests the following response: “We’re sorry, but we have had no interest in the UFO matter for many years, have no files or persons knowledgeable on the subject, and hence are unable to respond to his charges and questions.” (ClearIntent, [p. 142](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/clearintentgover00fawc/page/142/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015499294&usg=AOvVaw1lY2Xg5YbWaIjxYS1jNXjw))

July 29 — Night. A woman living on a farm outside Saint Hyacinthe, Quebec, watches as two dark circular objects with red rotating lights hovering above her potato field. It quickly disappears. The next morning, her husband finds two 11-foot-wide circular patches of crushed and burned potatos where the UFO had hovered. Investigators estimated the object had burnes or irradiated the field from a height of 15 feet. (Yurko Bondarchuk, UFO Sightings, Landings, and Abductions, Methuen, 1979, p. 143)

September 4 —8:25 a.m. Pilot Omar Arias is flying a twin-engine Canadian Aero-Commander F680 at a height of 10,000 feet above Lago de Cote, Costa Rica, taking aerial photos as part of a preliminary study for future hydroelectric projects. On board are photographer Sergio Loaiza, a specialist in aerial photography, plus geographer Juan Bravo and topographer Francisco Reyes. Loaiza was using a R-M-K 15/23 camera, specially made for cartography and using high-resolution black-and-white film, strapped on the bottom of the aircraft and taking automatic photos with an intervalometer. No one sees a thing while they are up in the air, but when Loiaza reviews his images, he discovers in frame 300 what seems to be a huge metallic disc against the dark background of the lake.

September 12? —7:00 p.m. Juan Rodríguez Domínguez, 82, who goes by the nickname of Juan el de la Palmareña, is in his hut on the Los Lunarejos farm just over a mile from Aznalcóllar, Seville, Spain, when he sees a bus-sized object landing near an abandoned well 1,000 feet away. More than 50 “soldiers” in blue “uniforms” emerge. They march in formation into a hollow in the field and are lost to view. Juan can now see only five or six “chiefs” standing on a slope and staring in his direction. When they shine a light at him, he ducks behind the hut. A bit later he looks out again and they shine the light once more. Frightened, he flees to Aznalcóllar to inform his employers, who do not take him seriously. He later insists that the object and the “soldiers” have left marks in the ground, but police do not bother to follow up.

September 19 — 3:30 a.m. Arthur Honke, Alec Honke, and Gordon Campbell are driving north just outside Winnipeg, Manitoba, to do some hunting. They see a bright flash as something passes overhead and in front of the car. It now appears ahead of them on the right side of the road. Honke pulls alongside it and steps out of the car. They

can hear a low-pitched humming from the object only about 150–225 feet away. It is shaped like two saucers, one on top of the aother, and has flashing green and red lights and one white statonary light. The object hovers for 30 seconds, then starts moving slowly to the southeast. But as the men drive north again, the object begins following them at a distance for about 45 minutes.

Late September — 7:30 p.m. Chen Chu, a member of a People’s Liberation Army unit stationed in Dingzhou, Hebei, China, is on assignment in a small valley north of the city when he and other soldiers notice a ball-like object rising slowly to the north of their quarters. It is emitting mist, and after a few seconds it spurts out a large jet of smoke and rises in the air. It hovers a few more seconds then rises to a higher level. Soon it drops down toward the ground and disappears. The unit dispatches a motor vehicle to find the object, but due to the ruggedness of the mountain roads, it turns back after more than 3 miles.

October 5 — Early morning. While on the downwind leg of the pattern to runway 20L at the Santos Dumont Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, four pilots on board a single-engine Cessna airplane watch as a “huge star” approaches them on their starboard side. The object descends to their altitude and slows rapidly to their air speed, smoothly changing its direction to fly parallel with them at an estimated distance of 98 feet. It looks like an “inverted dish” with a small rounded protrusion centered on its upper surface that seems to contain oval windows. What appears to be the head of a person is seen in one window looking at them. The UFO is seen for about 85 seconds. The object descends at high velocity toward the water’s surface, turns sharply left without any hesitation and disappears from sight in several seconds. The reporting witness is Chief Flight Instructor José Américo C. Medeiros, 23, pilot of the Cessna. (Richard F. Haines, “Airplane Pacing in Rio,” IUR 34, no. 2 (Mar. 2012): 3–6, 26–29)

November 2 — 7:00 p.m. Ronald Johnson, 16, is tending sheep on his family’s farm at Delphos, Kansas, when he hears a rumbling sound and sees (75 feet away in a small grove of trees) an object become suddenly illuminated with a mass of blue, red, and orange colors. Nine feet in diameter and 10 feet high, the UFO is slightly domed at the top and is hovering 2 feet above the ground. He and his dog stare at the object while the sheep are bellowing. After several minutes, the glow at the base becomes more intense and the object takes off at an angle, clearing by no more than 4 feet a shed attached to the sheep pen. The rumbling is replaced by a high-pitched wail. Johnson is temporarily blinded but recovers his sight a few minutes later and sees the object still there. He runs into the house to tell his parents, and they also see the light in the southern sky moving off into the distance. At the site where the UFO has been is a glowing, gray-white circle where the soil seems to be crystallized. After the parents touch the soil, it turns their fingers numb, persisting for several weeks. Johnson takes a photo of the circle. Seven separate soil analyses are conducted. Soil samples taken from the ring so not absorb water, have a higher acid content, and contain more soluble salts and calcium. They also produce less seed growth than control samples and are coated with a hydrocarbon of low molecular weight that is difficult to remove. A second substance is also found that is composed of white, crystalline fibers.

January — Night. High school senior Donna Wilkins is driving in a rural area near Bartelso, Illinois, with a boyfriend when they see lights traveling back and forth in an odd pattern in the distance. Suddenly a luminous triangular object appears right next to them and they speed up. It maintains the same position above their car even though

The basis for seeking an injunction against Marchetti is the secrecy agreement which he signed when beginning employment at CIA. The agency presents the agreement and the parts of the draft article it considers in violation of the agreement, to Judge [Albert Vickers Bryan Jr.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Vickers_Bryan_Jr&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015517333&usg=AOvVaw2q2mQafxqlBs2OLDrp53RD) of the US District Court for Eastern Virginia, who grants a temporary restraining order in April. The case proceeds to trial, at which Bryan finds for the CIA and issues a permanent injunction requiring Marchetti to submit his writings to CIA for review prior to publication. Marchetti appeals the injunction to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upholds Bryan’s restraint but limits it

to classified material. The appeals court also finds that Marchetti is entitled to timely review of materials he submits to the CIA. Marchetti appeals again to the US Supreme Court, but SCOTUS rejects Marchetti’s appeal in December. Marchetti continues work on his book with a coauthor, [John D.

Knopf. In August 1973, they submit their manuscript to the CIA. After reviewing the manuscript, the agency responds with a list of 339 passages that it claims are classified information and demands their deletion. Marchetti and Marks reject the demand and indicate they will go to court to print the manuscript as written. The CIA then withdraws its objections to 171 of the items but stands firm on the remaining 168. The trial is held again before Judge Bryan. This time, however, he rejects all but 26 of the deletions requested by the CIA on the grounds that the information in them is not properly or provably classified. The CIA appeals Bryan’s ruling, and ultimately the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upholds all 168 of the deletions. The book is published by Knopf in 1974 as The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. It is printed with blanks for deleted passages and boldface type for the 171 deletions that CIA originally requested and later withdrew. It is the first book the federal government of the United States ever goes to court to censor before its publication.

March 19 — 10:00 p.m. A boy named Mario goes out onto his patio at Santa Maria Acuexcomac, Puebla, Mexico, to look for a broom when he sees a bluish light, which gets larger as if it is approaching the ground. He sees that the thing is descending into a vacant lot and, thinking it is a hot air balloon, runs towards it. When he reaches the lot, he sees the thing is a kind of luminous sphere giving off a blue light like that of a welding torch. Mario now becomes frightened and runs to call his mother. As he goes in the house, two neighbors, Zacarian Mendoza and Manuela Carlotta de Mendoza, also see the object. When Mario comes out again accompanied by his mother Josefina, the object, which has been on the ground for 7 minutes, begins to rise up, producing a hum and casting off more blue

sparks. Gradually the light and sound are lost in the sky. The next day, Mario goes to the site and finds four deep tracks, about 8 inches deep, separated exactly from each other in the form of a square of 8.2 feet. At an equidistant point in the center of the tracks there is a black burnt mark on the ground.

April 1 — 11:00 p.m. Two students are driving between Cacuso and Lucala, Angola, when suddenly their vehicle’s engine and lights fail. They check the batteries and fuses, which are all normal. Then they see two bright lights. Shortly afterward, they hear a whistling noise coming from an object about 130 feet away. It is about 130 feet across, partly lit up, and has three legs hanging from it. It rise to a height of 40 feet, where it hovers briefly, retracts its legs, whistles again, and turns on edge as it moves away. As soon as it leaves, the vehicle’s lights come back on and the engine returns to normal. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part Two,” IUR 34, no. 1 (Sept. 2011): 19)

The object has a dull sheen like dirty chrome and lights flashing around its rim. The UFO wobbles, tilts, and shudders, then shoots straight upward about 1,000 feet. It then takes off to the north on a zigzag course. The photo is blurry, but shows a disc. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, pp. 72–73, 152)

The electrician, radio operator, and one of the navigators see an elliptical object moving slowly through the cloudless sky at high altitude from north to south.

June 22 — 2:00 a.m. Javier Bosque, a seminarist of the order of St. Joseph Calasanz, is reading in bed at his room at the Colegio Escolapios in Logroño, La Rioja, Spain, when he notices a bright light outside through the half-closed shutters of his window. To his surprise, the window begins opening by itself and a 2-foot-long, football-shaped, metallic, luminous object enters his room and approaches the foot of his bed. His radio begins to emit a loud, continuous sound. He reaches over and turns on a cassette tape recorder. The object descends from about 6 feet above the floor to 15 inches above it. A beam of solid light extends from the object, touching the radio twice, retracts, then touches the cassette recorder. Bosque grabs the recorder and holds the microphone in his lap. The object ascends to about 6 feet above the floor and moves out the window and up. The radio sound weakens. The

8-minute sound recording is analyzed by laboratories in Spain, Brazil, France, and the US. It contains some pure tones at first, followed by modulations in amplitude. Robert H. Coddington finds, after an analysis of the tape, that it most likely is a recording of the chance reception of an ordinary test transmission from a terrestrial broadcast station and does not match Bosque’s narrative.

June 26 — 8:00 a.m. Bennie Smit, the new owner of Braeside Farm 9 miles from Fort Beaufort, Eastern Cape, South Africa, is alerted to a “fiery red ball hovering at tree-top level” by his hired hand Boer de Klerk. Its color changes to bright green and then to whitish yellow, with flames shooting out. Smit dashes home, grabs a rifle, and calls the police. He shoots at the object, but the bullets have little effect. At 10:30 a.m., police sergeant Piet C. Kitching and warrant officer P. R. van Rensburg arrive at the spot where the UFO is still hovering. As the object moves away, Smit fires at it an eighth time; this time he hears a thud, and the object moves up and down and stops changing colors. Smit and Kitchin fire at it some more, after which it disappears and reappears about 60 feet away looking gunmetal gray in color and somewhat oval-shaped. After they fire two final shots, the object moves away through the trees around noon. The next day, van Rensburg leads a team of police officers to the site, looking for evidence. They find nine circular imprints of its supposed landing gear found in damp clay soil. On June 28, Brig.

A. Vosloo, divisional commander of police for the Eastern Cape, takes soil samples and plaster casts of the imprints.

June 29 — 10:00 p.m. A dark, wedge-shaped UFO passes directly over several witnesses at 200–500 feet altitude in Buffalo, South Dakota, at a slow speed. About 100 feet long, it has two brilliant white lights at the front and two orange-white lights in the rear. It moves with the blunt edge forward and hovers intermittently for 40 minutes. It emits a sound like rushing air. (Glenn McWane and David Graham, The New UFO Sightings, Warner, 1974; Marler 85)

Quertemont, who are sitting around a campfire at Lamonriville, Malmédy, Belgium, to a triangle of white lights moving overhead. They watch the lights for 5 minutes. At 10:30 p.m., several witnesses at a bus stop in Liège view a triangle of bright globes of light moving slowly from west to east. They pass through a cloud bank, illuminating it. About the same time, other witnesses in the western suburbs see a similar display. At 10:31 p.m., a factory worker in Flawinne watches a triangle of three bright lights ascending vertically. At 10:40 p.m., a couple in Spy observe a triangular display of lights surrounded by bluish sparks. At 10:45 p.m. a farmer in Ellezelles notices three bluish beams of light shining down from a luminous cloud. (Marler 85–86)

July 19 — 10:35 p.m. Herbert and Mady Mathar and their two children are walking in Faymonville, Belgium, when they see a red-orange point of light slowly moving toward them. Closer, they see that it is hat-shaped. Mathar runs inside to get a camera and takes two photos before the object disappears. Ballester Olmos and van Utrecht conclude that the photos show the Moon setting in the southwest.

July 25 — 9:15 p.m. Maureen Puddy sees the same object she had seen on July 3 at almost the same spot. This time it seems to drain power from the car, causing it to stop, the car steering itself off the road. A voice in her head tells her, “All your tests will be negative. Tell media, do not panic. We mean no harm.” Several months later, she is “mentally” abducted into a room where she sees an entity. This event occurs while two other people are present with her, but they only report that Puddy lapses into unconsciousness. On a later occasion, the entity appears as she is driving the car.

With Swann in a Faraday cage, the SRI team conducts a series of what’s-in-the-box tests in which office supplies hidden inside a box are presented to Swann, who is asked to identify the objects inside. During a lunch break one of the CIA agents walks outside and collects a small brown moth, capturing it alive, and sealing it inside a box. When Swann looks at the box, he sees “something small, brown, and irregular, sort of like a leaf…. Except that it seems very much alive, like it’s even moving.” (Annie Jacobsen, Phenomena, Little, Brown, 2017, p. 136)

August 9 — 2:30 a.m. A married couple, both college professors, are camping out in a garden in the backyard of some friends’ home just off the road to Nîmes at Saint-Jean-du-Gard, Gard, France. The woman is walking outside and sees a shiny white ball the size of a small car sitting in a nearby parking lot. She hears footsteps behind her and sees a dark shape about 4 feet tall in the shape of a parallelepiped topped by an oval where a head would be. It has 2 white circles for eyes, but no visible arms or legs. It turns toward her and she feels an extraordinary fear. After a few seconds, she runs back inside the tent.

August 12 — 2:00 a.m.–5:00 a.m. About 30 young members of the Taizé Community in Taizé, Saône-et-Loire, France, are having a discussion in a rustic theatre circle to the northwest of the community buildings. Renata Faa is the first to see a star-like object come out of the sky in the west. It lands on the ground on a ridge facing them.

Eventually, after more yellow lights appear on the object, they see it as cigar-shaped and about 100 feet long. Five other white lights emit luminous beams that extend progressively across the ground. Two cupolas are visible on its left side. Three small white discs appear on the right side, apparently emerging from the main object, and

perform complex maneuvers. Some of the witnesses feel a tingling in their fingertips and knees. Faa and three of the other witnesses decide to walk through the fields and approach the object. Around 3:00 a.m., a multitude of red particles appear in the air around the approaching witnesses and in the ground around them. The lights on the object constantly change their patterns of display and movement. The four witnesses see a dark mass like a haystack on their left about 30 feet away. A small red light is moving haphazardly around it. When one of them shines a flashlight on the haystack, the beam travels horizontally for a bit then is directed perpendicularly upward. Finally, toward 5:00 a.m., the large object rises up and moves off to the south, following the terrain. (J.

August–October — Numerous UFO sightings are reported throughout rural areas of Puerto Rico, as well as in San Juan and Ponce. People travel to the small town of Adjuntas, where the objects are seen frequently. One Friday night, the mayor of Adjuntas is traveling with a group of people in three cars along a lonely stretch of road in Barrio Garzas when he sees three bright discs moving through the sky. Their light changes in color and intensity.

Sightings also center on the town of Utuado, where the Air National Guard has scrambled F-104s to chase the objects. A teacher at Utuado High School is driving back from town with his brother when they see a bright light off in the bush 300 feet from the road. They get out of the car and approach the light, which is sitting in a clearing. It is a flattened disc about the size of a small house and has a set of small, dark rectangles evenly spaced around its edge. It is brilliantly lit and its colors are constantly changing. They watch the object for a few minutes until it vanishes like “someone turning off a light.” (Salvador Freixedo, “[UFOs over the Caribbean,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/FSR-CH%25201973%2520N%252014.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015546725&usg=AOvVaw2hdlzqLilvzm3Wa_b6xh3b)” Flying Saucer Review Case Histories, no. 14 (April 1973): 9–10; Henry Cordova, “Encounter in Puerto Rico,” IUR 25, no. 1 (Spring 2000): 20–21)

Early September — Just after midnight. Vasile Cărăbuş, a night watchman at an agricultural cooperative in Valea Plopului, Romania, sees a yellow star with a trail crossing the sky. It then hovers and appears to land in an orchard on the Odaia hill about 1 mile away. A couple days later, Cărăbuş and other locals visit the orchard and find a circular area 15 feet in diameter where all the stems are broken off about 3 feet from the ground. In the center of the circle is a mound of earth about 2 feet in diameter and 15 inches high. In the middle of this is a round hole at least 6 feet deep, around which are three identical impresions 4.5 feet apart. Hundreds of curious onlookers visit the site, among them engineer [Justin Capră](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Capr%25C4%2583&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015547450&usg=AOvVaw1RygeoAWuS9d_XtLUKEX1v)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Capr%25C4%2583&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015547717&usg=AOvVaw3IQ6iNDp3lvLOPCgf5cnL3) who detects a substantial increase in gamma radiation in the center of the circle. Ufologist Călin Turcu notes that the vegetation on the mound of earth is completely absent for the next 4 years and frail after that. (Hobana and Weverbergh 276–279; Romania 34–35)

September — 8:00 p.m. While commuting home by train from nearby Debrecen, Hungary, workers see about 7 luminous, orange-colored ellipses floating high above Nyírábrány. The phenomena are still there as they are walking home from the train station. The lights are as bright as the full moon and remain in position in a formation of three rows. The spectacle lasts for 30 minutes. The display is seen for the next four evenings in a row in the same part of the sky west of the village. On the last night, one of the lights disappears but returns to the same position in the formation. (Karoli Hargitai, “The UFO Phenomenon in Hungary,” IUR 14, no. 2 (Mar./Apr. 1989): 13)

September 10 — 12:45 p.m. Greengrocer Allan James is checking a load on his truck prior to descending from the top of a hill west of Georges Creek, New South Wales. He notices a huge, cigar-shaped object with smaller objects emerging from each end. They group into an arrowhead formation before moving southeast. The large object then climbs at a high rate of speed and disappears. The duration is about 10 minutes.

September 14 — 4:20 a.m. An unidentified target is detected on radar at the Palm Beach (Florida) International Airport by FAA air traffic controller C. J. Fox. Fox describes the contact as a “good clear target.” The object is tracked for over an hour when at approximately 6:00 a.m., NORAD is alerted. Two F-106 jet fighters are dispatched from Homestead AFB \[now Homestead Air Reserve Base\] in Miami–Dade County to locate and identify the object.

The UFO disappears from radar scopes shortly before the jets arrive. At the airport, FAA watch supervisor George Morales views the object through binoculars and describes it as silver-white in color and cigar-shaped. Officials at Miami International Airport, which also tracks the strange object, report no aircraft are known to be in the area where the UFO was spotted.

September 14 — 8:00 p.m. A married couple in Houston, Missouri, watches an unusual bright object after their portable TV is disturbed by interference. It is larger than a star and persists for several minutes before it disappears in a burst of speed. At 3:00 a.m. they are awakened by their dogs barking at something in a nearby woods. They see a bright flash of light at ground level. The next morning, they find an evergreen tree about 300 feet from the house that is yellow on one side and normal-looking on the other. Next to it is a 20 feet x 14 feet oval area of depressed grass. In the center are three small imprints, each sowing an extension or “toe.” The imprints are about 2.5 inches long; one is 1.5 inches deep. A blackened area in the shape of a triangle is in the center of the imprints.

September 20 — 12:45 a.m. A man is driving near Rougemont, Quebec, when he sees a Saturn-shaped object about 100 feet in diameter moving with a pendulum motion toward Mont Rougemont. It climbs to the top of the hill and settles in for 4 minutes. He watches it increasingly brighten from a row of windows at the upper dome and glow pink on the bottom side. He flashes his lights at it, and it rises and dives at his car, passing just 30 feet above it. The engine stalls, the radio goes off, and the headlights dim. A wave of heat passes over him, then the UFO races away. ((Yurko Bondarchuk, UFO Sightings, Landings, and Abductions, Methuen, 1979, pp. 144–146; Michael D.

September 25 — 1:00–1:30 a.m. Near Anderstorp, Sweden, a witness is driving his Opel at 25 mph when the car radio stops working. A couple minutes later, a very bright blue-white light appears behind the car, enveloping the entire vehicle in light at the same time as all electrical equipment in the car ceases to work. The headlights go out and the engine and wipers stop. The light persists for 5 minutes, and the temperature inside the car rises. Suddenly the light is gone, and the electrical system works again. The car starts at the same time as the witness smells a strong odor of ammonia or ether. The witness drives home quickly, terrified. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part Two,” IUR 34, no. 1 (Sept. 2011): 19)

September 27 — 5:40 a.m. Teodoro Merlo, maintenance man for the Ika-Renault factory in Santa Isabel, Córdoba, Argentina, is making early rounds at the plant. He enters a previously locked washroom and sees a man sitting on one of the basins who is nearly 8 feet tall and wearing a close-fitting, dark-blue, one-piece garment tight at the wrists. It has a bald head with high, pointed ears, and very white skin. As Merlo approaches, the light by the janitor goes out and a light near the entity goes on spontaneously. Merlo hears a noise like “a metal object striking glass,” and the entity disappears. (Oscar A.

October — Harry Belil begins publishing Beyond Reality, a newsstand magazine devoted to parapsychology and (sometimes) UFOs, in New York City. It continues through November 1980 and publishes several special UFO issues.

October 1 — The CIA awards the Stanford Research Institute \[now SRI International\] in Menlo Park, California, a contract for $49,909 for an eight-month research project on remote viewing. It is given the name Biofield Measurements Program. (Annie Jacobsen, Phenomena, Little, Brown, 2017, pp. 136–137)

October 2 — A letter from the Canadian Department of National Defence states that UFO reports received by the Canadian military are passed on to the National Research Council to determine whether a scientific investigation is warranted. It notes that “certain reports suggest that they exhibit a unique scientific or advance technology that could possibly contribute to scientific or technical research.” (Good Above, [pp. 193](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/n201/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015555975&usg=AOvVaw0xdN6bji23WfmJjh4_VQdV)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/n201/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015556164&usg=AOvVaw0dNtzBNvserxUFL9Ocf7Uc) [467](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/B-001-014-055/page/466/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015556375&usg=AOvVaw12LhhHvW__6WpMScctritC))

October 8 — 12:00 midnight. Security guard John Byrne is patrolling Cairo Mill, an old factory at Waterhead, Lancashire, England, that has been converted to an electronics system testing facility for jet aircraft. Near the bicycle shed he hears a deep humming noise like a generator inside a closed room. The sound bores into his head. He looks up and sees a huge object parked at a height of 300 feet adjacent to the tower end of the mill. It resembles a glowing bell shape turned on end with the flat base vertical to the sheer wall of the tower. The object is giving off a blue, fluorescent glow that falls like a curtain of solid light. Byrne watches for several minutes until the object turns sharply on edge and moves straight up into the sky until it is only a blob of light.

October 9 — 7:30 p.m. Ralph and Grace Clapp are driving along Middle Country Road near Selden, New York, when they see a bright white light. It is joined by a red and a green light. They continue driving, and around 7:55 p.m. at the top of a hill west of Coram, the white light hovers into view above the treetops to heir left. Grace sees rectangular windows and no wings on a triangular object that is at least 100 feet across and moving slowly and continuously through the sky.

October 23 — 6:30 p.m. Capt. Daryle Brown and two copilots are flying a Wardair airliner at 22,000 feet some 180 miles northwest of Churchill, Manitoba, when they see a bright streak of light approaching from the west. As it comes closer, it appears to be a bullet-shaped object larger than a Boeing 727 and adorned with a cluster of multicolored pulsating lights. Brown notifies the 15 passengers aboard and turns out the interior lights so they can see the object better. Almost a dozen portholes are visible, while red and yellow lights are flashing on the top. At the rear of the object is a fog-like cloud and orange sparks. It takes up a position about 2,500 feet in front of the jet and on the same flight path. The object shines a beam of light at the airplane, bathing it in light that is bright enough to read to, and stops in mid-air directly in front of the jet. Before Brown can take evasive action, it moves off to the right. A dense fog engulfs the object as it disappears in the distance.

October 28 — 10:15 p.m. Cpl. Juan Fuentes Figueroa and four other Uruguayan Navy seamen are stationed at the lighthouse on Isla de Lobos, off Punta del Este, Uruguay. Fuentes goes to inspect the electrical generators and discovers some odd lights, which prompts him to retrieve a handgun from his room. When he returns, he notices an object in the shape of an inverted bowl with several white, yellow, and violet lights on top of a 20-foot terrace. An entity is next to the object and two others (one much taller) are descending from the UFO. They all notice Fuentes and face him from about 89 feet away. He raises his gun to shoot but feels strangely paralyzed and confused. The beings reenter the UFO, which moves straight up emitting a humming noise. When it reaches a height of 150 feet, it tilts, belches a bright fireball, and silently disappears at tremendous speed to the southeast.

November 10 — 11:00 p.m. A 19-year-old is riding his Yamaha 250cc Twin motorcycle near Heathfield, East Sussex, England, when suddenly the headlights dim and go out and the engine fails, emitting an “electrical arcing” odor. He looks up and sees a white blob about 100 feet away hovering above some trees. It is about 60 feet high, 30–40 feet in diameter, and glowing white but fuzzy in appearance.

November 12 — 8:00 p.m. Three soldiers (Petrus Nel, Fanie Rosseau, and Gerrie Buitendag) are guarding a petrol dump at Rosmead, East Cape, South Africa, when they see a red light moving in circles above the tennis court adjacent to the primary school. At nearby Middelburg police station, Sgt. John Goosen and Constable Koos Brazelle are looking towards Rosmead with binoculars and see an odd light above the town. School Principal Harold Truter sees the light moving vertically up from his home near the tennis court. The court is churned up with huge chunks of surface tar dug up, so he calls the Middelburg police about it. Goosen and Brazelle respond. There are 5 holes in the court, the largest 10 feet in diameter. Two spike holes are also found. The only entrances to the court are still locked up and there are no vehicle tracks inside or outside. A eucalyptus tree at the end of the court has suddenly begun to die and appears scorched. District Police Commandant Col. B. J. van Heerden unsuccessfully tries to duplicate the damage with shovels.

November 21 — Night. Four witnesses see four rockets shooting up from the water at Hermansverk, Vestland, Norway. They are silent and resemble small red balls of light. They are also seen the following day, and the Norwegian Navy fires an antisubmarine missile at the intruders.

November 28 — 2:00 p.m. A witness at Glenelg, Adelaide, South Australia, sees lengths of glistening material wrapped around a signpost and on looking up sees that more is falling from the sky. He collects a small sample of the thickest section, but the strands dissolve in his fingers. (Keith Basterfield, “Angel Hair: An Australian Perspective,” IUR 27, no. 1 (Spring 2002): 7)

November 30 — 11:15 p.m. A motor mechanic named Maxwell is out testing his vehicle in Murray Bridge, South Australia, when the engine dies and lights go out as he is coming over a rise in the road. The lights come back on but vary in intensity several times. He decides to stop the car. To his left he sees a “diamond shape with the top cut off” noiselessly sitting on the ground 148 feet away in a paddock. His car radio starts making a noise like a “computer on TV,” a constant rhythm. He tries the ignition key but nothing happens, not even the oil light comes on. He tries the wipers and the electric air horn but they do not work either. He locks all the doors and winds up the windows and just sits there for the next 45 minutes. After this time the object leaves, and he finds he can restart the car. An inspection of the vehicle the next day reveals no cause for the electrical problems. (Herbert S.

It traverses 50°–60° of horizon in 45–50 seconds and disappears among some trees. It is egg-shaped, a white-violet color as if wrapped in a cloud of bright light, and leaves a long trail behind, but it changes to red-orange before disappearing. Radar at the base tracks the object flying north to south at 3,700 mph at a height of 43 miles. (Romania 103)

December 2 — 11:30 p.m. Four witnesses in Hinojos, Huelva, Spain, see a fiery, square-shaped object flying close to the ground, lighting up the terrain. The headlights in two cars die. The car with a gasoline-powered engine also stalls, but the car with the diesel engine keeps running. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part Two,” IUR 34, no. 11 (Sept. 2011): 20)

December 13 — 7:04 p.m. Fritz Abbehusen is watching TV in Dias d’Ávila, Bahia, Brazil, when his set experiences some interference. He goes out on the porch and sees a huge, round luminous object descending to a hill approximately 3 miles from his home. After a while, he goes to get binoculars, and with these he can see that the luminous shape is hovering a several feet above the ground. Its lower part is glowing like a neon light, while the upper part has a row of orange-red portholes. His wife Margarida and servant join him to look at the display. Suddenly, three blinking lights emerge from the object. One of these lights slowly moves in the direction of his house. After 15 minutes, the moving light has arrived within 165 feet in back of the house. Three small beings emerge from it, wearing what appears to be a one-piece suit of whitish or light-gray color. The beings keep their elbows close to the body when walking, as if on tiptoe, raising their knees exaggeratedly at each step. They go away, but the big object remains on the hill until around midnight. At one time it emits a beam that sets the brush on fire.

December 24 — 3:00 a.m. The Romanian ship Moldoveanu is in the Labrador Sea off Labrador, Canada, when the crew notices a shiny object headed at high speed straight toward their vessel and flying low over the waves. It stops above the ship, changing its shape and color. After an hour, it shoots into the sky and disappears. (Hobana and Weverbergh 279)

December 24 — 9:40 a.m. L. J. Reeves is stationed at the PIN-1 Distant Early Warning site at Clinton Point, Northwest Territories, on the Amundsen Gulf. He sees an object like a bright star that moves west to east, stops, then continues on and fades into the distance after 5 minutes. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, p.73)

December 30 — A man driving on the A4155 from Henley to High Wycombe, England, rounds a bend and sees an object resembling a vertical cone. What seem to be fluorescent strip lights run down the side, and it emits an intense, high-pitched whistle. The next thing he knows, he is driving through Marlowe in total silence with no memory of how he got there. Some 90 minutes have vanished from his memory.

1973 — NORAD now has infrared sensor satellites covering 100% of the earth’s surface from geostationary orbits on a 24-hour basis. (Clark III 807)

1973 — Most Project MKUltra records are deliberately destroyed by order of CIA Director [Richard Helms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Helms&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015565936&usg=AOvVaw2btXmiScpvl_u2t9afdDE3). A cache of some 20,000 documents survives Helms’s purge, as they are incorrectly stored in a financial-records building and discovered following a FOIA request in 1977. These documents are fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977. HTLINGUAL and the NSA’s Minaret programs are shut down to avoid exposure during the Weathermen trial.

The public affairs officer at Homestead denounces the Bryant advertisement and “forbade its publication.” At the same time Bryant writes Gleason providing him with a draft affidavit. He asks Gleason to execute the affidavit so it can be used as part of a growing accumulation of evidence Bryant is collecting in preparation for taking the government to court to release all information on alien crash retrievals.

In his book Confessions of an Ex-Secret Service Agent he explains that not only can the president disappear, but it has happened. Venker states that in the exact year of the Homestead incident with Gleason, 1973, Nixon tries to cut his secret service protection. Venker also states that it was not uncommon for Nixon to try to elude his Secret Service detail. The agents working on the Nixon presidential detail were warned about it. Nixon is familiar with Homestead AFB, which is only minutes from his Biscayne Bay compound. There is no proof that Nixon escorted Jackie Gleason to view alien bodies at Homestead, but everything checked out indicates it could very well have happened. It would have been very easy in terms of distance for the Gleason/Nixon alien event to have occurred.

February 21 — Night. Clearwater High School basketball coach Reggie Bone and five players on his team are driving back to Clearwater after a game. On US Highway 60 near Ellsinore, Missouri, Bone notices a “bright shaft of light beaming down out of the sky.” A few miles later, near Brushy Creek, student Randal Holmes notices another light, and Bone pulls over for a closer look. They see lights about 600 feet away from the road hovering over an open field at about 400 feet altitude. The lights seem to be portholes, each a different color: red, green, amber, and white. According to student Cary Barks, they watch it for 10 minutes before the lights rise up noiselessly and disappear over a hill. Around 10:00 p.m., Edith Boatwright of nearby Mill Spring sees a similar object flying low near her farmhouse.

March 20 — 7:15 p.m. Lucie Vandervoort is looking out a window of her house in Tarcienne, Belgium, when she sees a bright light approaching. It passes over the roof of a nearby house, then banks, makes a 90° turn, and begins to blink as it disappears to the east. Similar objects appear every 10 minutes, continuing until 9:15 p.m. The objects’ slow speed allows her to take photos. At one point she looks through her late husband’s World War I trench periscope and sees a humanoid figure dressed in shiny, tight-fitting clothes and standing in the front of one of the objects. Only one photo turns out and shows a squarish light against a dark sky. Analysis suggests that the objects were probably aircraft taking off from the military base at Florennes a few miles away, the humanoid figure was imaginary, and the photo was a blurry streetlight.

March 24 — 7:30 a.m. Arthur de Weerdt is watching a distant airliner in Borgerhout, Belgium, when he notices another sunlit object pacing the aircraft at a higher altitude. Suddenly the object stops and remains motionless for about one minute, then moves at a greater speed, making an angle of 70° before coming to another wobbling halt for about 8 minutes.

April — Southeast Missouri State University physics professor [Harley Rutledge](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Rutledge&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015582511&usg=AOvVaw2Jrm9wKnNucPc96ib-ac-3) hears of numerous reports of unidentified lights in the sky around Piedmont, Missouri, and decides to subject these reports to scientific analysis. He puts together a team of 620 observers with college training in the physical sciences, including a large array of equipment at 158 different viewing stations: binoculars, RF spectrum analyzers, Questar telescopes, low-high frequency audio detectors, an electromagnetic frequency analyzer, cameras, sound recorders, Geiger counters, and a galvanometer to measure variations in the Earth’s gravitational field. The resulting Project Identification commences in April, logging several hundred hours of observation time and 157 documented sightings over the next 7 years. This is the first UFO scientific field study, able to monitor the phenomena in real-time, enabling Rutledge to calculate the objects’ actual velocity, course, position, distance, and size. Observation of the unclouded night sky often reveals “pseudostars”—stationary lights camouflaged by familiar constellations. Some objects appear to mimic the appearance of known aircraft; others violate the laws of physics. The most startling discovery is that on at least 32 recorded occasions, the movement of the lights synchronize with actions of the observers. They appear to respond to a light being switched on and off, and to verbal or radio messages. Rutledge publishes a final report, Project Identification, on his field research in 1981. (Harley D.

Not only will they have the military’s full cooperation, they will also have access to their files, including those of the Department of Defense. Upon arriving at Norton Air Force Base \[now San Bernardino, California, International Airport\] the two men are immediately taken to a “clean room used by the CIA,” designed so that “there was no way anyone could eavesdrop” on events taking place inside. Here the proposal takes place, including the promise of using 3,200 feet of a 1971 UFO landing footage at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, that shows several of the “alien visitors” and their meeting with the representatives from the US government. Paul Shartle, chief of requirements for the Norton AFB audiovisual program, promises to get the Holloman footage.

Emenegger is told that the military is monitoring signals from an alien group that their extraterrestrial visitors know nothing about. At the last minute, permission to use the film is withdrawn, though Emenegger and Sandler are encouraged to describe the Holloman landing as something that might happen in the future or could have happened. Emenegger goes to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio to talk to Weinbrenner, who while haranguing about the need to find out about Soviet Mig-25s, hands Emenegger a signed copy of [Hynek](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015588444&usg=AOvVaw0_5aozfJfvZnqKsYtCuwvf)’s The UFO Experience.

May 18 — Two men at Miliscola Beach, Bacoli, Naples, Italy, see a bright disc with a dome 165 feet away over the sea. It hovers at a height of 10 feet and then moves closer. Their car engine and lights fail. The dome is bright like a white neon light, and a red light is rotating around it. After 3–4 minutes, the object lifts off and the car can be restarted. (Herbert S. Taylor, “An Update on Vehicle Interference Reports, Part Two,” IUR 34, no. 1 (Sept. 2011): 20)

May 19 — Strange, nylon-like patterns are seen in the sky above Gawler, South Australia. After falling, they vaporize when touched. (Keith Basterfield, “Angel Hair: An Australian Perspective,” IUR 27, no. 1 (Spring 2002): 7)

May 22 — 3:00 a.m. Onilson Pátero, an organizer of public libraries for the State of São Paulo, Brazil, is just outside Catanduva, after giving a ride to a stranger. First his car radio gets static and the engine begins to fail. Suddenly he notices a blue circle of light about 8 inches in diameter moving around inside his car. It passes in front of the dashboard and he sees it is transparent. Then a beam of blue light shines on him from the top of the hill he is driving up. He pulls over to avoid a collision, but the light keeps coming toward him. Overcome by a sensation of heat and stuffiness, he steps out of the car and hears a buzzing noise. The UFO is a gray structure about 25 feet thick and 36 feet wide, resembling two soup plates attached rim to rim. A tube stretches out from its base toward the ground. Pátero panics and runs about 100 feet when something holds him back. Turning, he sees that a rod of blue light from the UFO is moving above his car. The light seems to make the car transparent, allowing him to see the contents of the trunk, the wheel gears, the engine, and the interior of the body. Pátero faints. An hour later, two young men drive by and see him lying on the ground in gushing rainwater. They speed on into Catanduva and return with a policeman, Clóvis Queiros. Turning Pátero over, he regains consciousness and they take him to the hospital, where he is soon released. However, the next day he feels an itchiness on his back and stomach. Irritated patches of his skin turn purplish blue. Later, these spots turn yellow and eventually disappear. Subsequent medical examinations show no cause for the discoloration, and Pátero seems in good mental health. He experiences another encounter on April 26, which some investigators think might be a fantasy.

May 24 — 9:20 p.m. Harley Rutledge and three other members of his Project Identification team at the municipal airport in Farmington, Missouri, see a configuration of four lights (white, red, red, white) flying silently overhead at an altitude of about 2,500 feet. Through binoculars, Rutledge can see the white lights reflecting off a metallic structure that could be anywhere from 368 to 2,600 feet across. The array moved quickly out of sight. (Harley D.

May 27 — 2:00 a.m. A Mrs. Geni, 57, is preparing some wedding cake at her home in São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. Through her balcony window she sees a reflection of some kind in her walled-in backyard. When she goes to her porch door, she sees a flying object hovering above the roof of one of the rented buildings on the ground floor in the back some 50 feet away. The object is white-metallic and luminous on the bottom, about 6.5–13 feet wide and 3–6 feet high, with a kind of credenza behind which three entities can be seen. They are small with large round heads, big eyes, protruding lips, dark brown skin, small ears, long flat noses, small arms, and wearing a cap with a ball in the center. Each holds a device like a flashlight that emits a beam of different colors: green on the left, red in the middle, and orange on the right. The object emits a noise like a motor as it sways above the building, then after a few minutes it moves away beyond the horizon. Mrs. Geni goes back to work, but she now has pains in her knees, legs, and head. She screams in pain, and the young woman who rents the building in the back arrives to help. She also has heard the motor noise and confirms that Mrs. Geni’s face is swollen with bloodshot eyes that last for 3 days. At about 5:00 a.m., Mrs. Geni suffers a prolapsed uterus, for which she has to undergo surgery on June 8. She gradually loses hearing in her right ear, her vision deteriorates, and spots appear on her skin. A clock in the kitchen begins to behave erratically. In the backyard, a dwarf coconut tree and a jabuticaba tree both lose their leaves prematurely.

June 4 — 2:00 a.m. Jill Cotmore wakes up in her home near Tyringham, New South Wales, with an uneasy feeling. She lights a cigarette and the room is immediately engulfed in a bright light, even though the windows have heavy curtains. It is so bright that she can’t even see a cupboard 3 feet away from her. Outside, her horse is going berserk. Suddenly, the light is gone. The next day, she finds the horse frothing, and it had apparently been running around the house during the night.

June 28 — 12:30 a.m. University of Missouri animal care technician James G. Richards, 41, and his daughter Vanea, 16, hear a loud, persistent, thrashing sound outside their house trailer in Columbia, Missouri. Richards moves to the window and sees two bright, silver-white light beams about 5 feet apart from each other and 50 feet away from his window. The beams disappear, and a glowing bright oval form appears, about 12–15 feet in diameter, lighting up the area. The thrashing sound is apparently made by trees moving as if blown by wind, and after the oval form

appears, this sound suddenly ceases. As Richards moves from window to window, he notices his dogs lying very still near the corner of the trailer that is nearest to the oval object. The dogs are large security animals that are not easily frightened. Richards thinks it strange they are not barking at all the noise and the bright lights. The object moves away to 200 feet from the window and hovers, and now, less bright to the eye, the witnesses can see a blue band of light and an orange glow extending around the outer edge of the oval. The oval moves back near its original position and disappears by growing smaller before police arrive at 1:45 a.m. Later searches uncover broken tree limbs, damaged foliage, scorched leaves up to a height of 35 feet, and impressions on the ground as deep as 2 feet.

He is then taken to another room and directed to sit on a chair as the UFO lands in the spot where he had been before. He then leaves the object and watches it take off. He picks up his camera and photographs the ground traces. (Paolo Fiorino, Gian Paolo Grassino, and Antonio Chiumiento, “Abductions in Italy,” IUR 14, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1989): 15)

August — 10:30 p.m. Three people are sitting in their front yard in West Seneca, New York, when they hear a low hum coming from an object above their garage. It is a silvery half-egg with glowing orange-and-blue overtones. It begins a slow descent toward the roof, and when it is only 5 feet away, one of the witnesses yells for it to stop. The object stops, hovers briefly, and shoots away straight upward. One of the witnesses hears the same hum at about the same time two days later, and the same object appears, moving down the street. The object is only 3–4 feet above the pavement and covers the width of the road. The witness approaches it, and it stops at the end of his driveway. He walks toward it and gets only 4–5 feet from it without feeling any heat. When his dog barks, he backs away. The object waits a moment, then slowly moves 20 feet down the street, quickly rises, and vanishes rapidly at a 45° angle. (Michael D. Swords, “Unusual Experiences from the Timmerman Files,” IUR 27, no. 2 (Summer 2002): 23–24)

Between August 3–6 — Night. A woman and her children are watching the stars in their backyard in San Antonio, Texas. Two “very perfect” cumulus clouds move into view low above them. A perfectly round sphere with a green glow

slowly emerges from the top of the cloud on the left. Soon they see lightning going back and forth from the two clouds but never toward the ground. One lightning bolt hits the sphere and red sparks fly out, whereupon the sphere slowly reenters the cloud. The clouds remain stationary for 35–40 minutes until the sphere disappears, then they float on. (Herbert S. Taylor, “Mystery Clouds and the UFO Connection,” IUR 29, no. 4 (July 2005): 18)

August 28 — 10:00 p.m. Journalists Titus Zăgrean and Ion Moise are driving near Budacu de Jos, Romania, when they see a big milky-white light in the sky approaching the road they are on. As it crosses the road, they see it is rotating and about 3 feet in diameter. Moving to the west, it veers sharply to the north, accelerates, changes color to yellow-orange then red, and departs at fantastic speed. (Romania 40)

September 17 — 9:00 p.m. Anne Taylor is walking to her farm in Romford, Essex, England, after walking her three dogs when she sees a green light near the cowshed. She continues watching the light, which starts moving toward her slowly. Her two terriers are whining and cringing. The light approaches to within a few feet of her, about 12 feet above the ground. It is completely silent. Her watch has stopped, and her spine begins to tingle. She hears a jet plane in the distance, and the light goes out. She hears an “electric whirring” and the green ball shoots straight up. Her dogs return to normal behavior, and her watch starts up again when she returns to the house.

September 23 — 5:00 a.m. A truck driver is driving to work near Tyler, Texas, when a small “cub airplane” seems to fly directly in front of another car on the highway, nearly causing a wreck. The plane flies up over the side of the road and hovers above some trees. Then it changes into a cigar shape with lights. The driver gets out of his truck to watch. The cigar moves off then returns with a new, round shape. It lights up with many multicolored lights and moves above a nearby house. It makes a low, “loop-loop-loop” thumping sound. Then a large, bright, square light descends and swings from the other object. It approaches the truck, then swings back and forth. He tries to jump back in the truck but apparently passes out. He later notices he has some marks on his hip and shoulder. He does remember seeing the UFO change from a round shape into a triangle, and then move out of sight. (Michael D.

Autumn — Late night. 1st Lt. Walter F. Billings is a deputy crew commander at the Francis E. Warren AFB Golf launch control capsule missile site northwest of Sidney, Nebraska. Over UHF radio, he hears the crew at LCC India, southwest of Sunol, Nebraska, order its security guards to investigate an alarm at one of India’s 10 launch sites. The guards find that the inner security alarm has also been triggered, meaning that something has penetrated the security fence surrounding the site. They find a large, bright UFO hovering above the site. One minute later, the UFO moves off slowly for several thousand feet then zooms off at a high rate of speed. All crews on duty that night are told not to say anything to the public or media about anything they heard on UHF radio that night. (Nukes 338–339)

October — Night. Sgt. Michael D. Jenkins of the 96th Security Police Squadron is stationed at Dyess AFB southwest of Abilene, Texas, when a major alert goes off at the base after a large ball of light is reported hovering 100–150 feet above igloo bunkers housing nuclear weapons. Twelve police with M-16s are sent to the Weapons Storage Area, and an incoming C-130 is asked to do a fly-by of the area to get a look at the object. Three K-9 teams that normally patrol the perimeter report that their dogs are afraid and acting up. An order to fire on the object comes from Strategic Air Command Headquarters Offutt AFB near Bellevue, Nebraska. Jenkins hears gunfire and sees a bluish-white streak as the object speeds off. As it leaves, it drops a trail of “angel hair” all the way from the weapons area to the southwest perimeter of the base. The angel hair hangs around on the area ropes and buildings for three days. On the third day it rains and the material dissolves, completely disappearing. (Robert L.

October 6 — 12:45 a.m. A couple strolling along a country road near St.-Mathias-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, see a bright light like a projector emanating from a nearby field. Later, at 11:30 a.m., the woman is hanging clothes on a line in her backyard when she notices a column of smoke rising from fields in the north. She calls over two workmen doing repairs at her home, and they see a yellowish object like a tent near the smoke. Soon a square, yellow object resembling a bulldozer emerges from the tent and travels about 180 feet to a small spring. Between the two objects, moving around in the field, are five “little people” about 4 feet tall performing various actions. Assuming them to be boy scouts, the witnesses notice they are wearing some kind of helmets and clothing that is the same color as the tent. The witnesses return to their work and 20 minutes later someone notices that the objects and figures have disappeared. The couple’s daughter returns in half an hour and goes to check the location. She finds a large, circular patch of burned and crushed grass about 45 feet in diameter, as well as two tracklike marks, each about 6 inches wide. Returning, the daughter feels ill with headache and nausea. A month later, UFO investigators arrive and find additional marks in the shape of a triangle.

October 8 — Evening. A police officer near Laurel, Mississippi, chases a yellow object shaped like a top and making “exhaust-like” noises for several miles. As he approaches within 200 feet, his car stalls and the radio and headlights die. When the object moves away, the lights and radio come back, but the engine will not start for several minutes.

October 10 — 7:00 p.m. A family in Niantic, Connecticut, watches two greenish discs and a white sphere maneuvering over a nearby lake. Odd clouds seem to be accompanying the two discs.

Both turn and are terrified to see a 10-foot-wide, 8-foot-high, glowing egg-shaped object with blue lights at its front hovering just above the ground about 40 feet from the riverbank. As the men, frozen with fright, watch, a door appears in the object and three strange beings float just above the river towards them. The two become numb and paralyzed as the entities carry them into the UFO. Some kind of “eye” device scans them before they are released 20 minutes later.

October 11 — 9:00 p.m. Larry Booth of Pascagoula, Mississippi, finishes watching TV and checks the front door. He sees a huge round object hovering 5–8 feet above a nearby streetlight. It has red lights that are moving in a clockwise motion around it. It slowly moves away. (Clark III 895)

October 12 — 4:00 a.m. A commercial pilot is flying a Piper PA-32 Cherokee Six near Mount Baldy, Arizona, at an altitude of 2,500 feet. He notices a red flashing light on the ground in a remote area, and circles around for a closer look. As he does so, the light begins moving too and reaches a speed about the same as his plane, 170 mph. It is flashing regularly at 2-second intervals. The object is skimming over the ground, apparently following undulations in the landscape. He changes course again to intercept the light, which accelerates instantaneously to 800 mph, moving up and over Mount Baldy, following its contours. The pilot follows it for a few minutes, about 50–60 miles. After about 5 minutes the light makes a right-angle turn and accelerates vertically. After 8–10 flashes, it disappears into the upper atmosphere. (Mark Rodeghier, “Out of the Past: An Incredible Light,” IUR 9, no. 1 (Jan./Feb. 1984): 7–8)

October 16 — 7:30 p.m. Upon arriving home at Albany, Ohio, Mary Geddis sees a “ghost-like” figure floating about 50 feet above the ground at 1,000 feet distance; it is about 4 feet tall and thin, “like a person draped in a close-fitting sheet.” It is seen only briefly when she notices a bright white object moving about, and approaches to within 200 feet before going away. The object is about 20 feet in diameter and about 25–30 feet off the ground. Later, as she is making supper, she sees a “little blue-green thing” about 2.5 feet tall and with a face with “spiky things at the tops and the sides of the head” looking in an open door; it has stumpy arms (she sees no legs) and quickly disappears from sight.

October 16 — 7:45 p.m. A 50-foot-wide bluish object hovers 2–3 feet above US Highway 82, seemingly suspended on a beam of light, near Eupora, Mississippi, 300 feet from a car. The engine and headlights fail as the object lands. Another object hovers about 60 feet above the first, illuminating it. A “catfish-like” creature emerges with flippers for hands, a wide mouth, and feathers on its back. It holds onto a handrail on the craft and never goes down to the ground. It gets back in and the object rises into the air. The driver restarts the car. (Columbus (Miss.)

October 16 — Night. William and Donna Hatchett are driving down a country road near Mannford, Oklahoma, when she sees a bright light coming from the south. They first think it is a security light on a pole, but then realize the object is pacing them and descending. When the Hatchetts stop the truck, the light also stops in front of them. As the object hovers, it gives off a blinding light and a penetrating low-pitched hum. They have a feeling that there are occupants who know everything they are thinking. Donna is so afraid that she twice leaves the truck cab and goes into the back. William manages to persuade her to return, and they set off, the object rising up in the opposite direction. (Kevin D. Randle, The UFO Casebook, Warner, 1989, pp. 143–144)

October 16 — Midnight. Single mother Pat Roach is dozing on the couch with her 5-year-old son Kent in an isolated house on the outskirts of Lehi, Utah. Suddenly, Kent wakes up screaming that he has seen a “skeleton.” Roach has a vague memory an intruder and a bright light. Suspecting a prowler, she phones a neighbor, who calls the police at 12:10 a.m. A few minutes later, officers arrive, talk to Roach, find nothing amiss, and leave. Roach then checks on her other children. Two of them, Bonnie and Debbie, tell her they had seen a spaceman who had come into the house and taken them on a spaceship. Debbie remembers being told not to tell anyone, as well as seeing a line of people waiting to go on board. Disturbed, Roach takes her children and spends the rest of the night at a friend’s house.

October 17 — Paul Brown is driving on US Highway 29 near Danielsville, Georgia, when his car radio suddenly goes wild with strange sounds. He sees a silver, oval-shaped object about 300 feet ahead on the road. He stops and sees two beings with red faces and white hair. Brown grabs a pistol and steps halfway out of his car, but the beings return to the object, which takes off with a whooshing sound. (Athens (Ga.)

October 17 — After 10:00 p.m. Falkville, Alabama, Police Chief Jeffrey Greenhaw responds to a phone call about a UFO on the outskirts of town. On a gravel road, he sees a 5-and-a-half-foot-tall, silver-suited figure in his headlights. He stops, gets out, and talks to the figure, all the while taking Polaroid photos of it. It steps towards him and Greenhaw turns on the red rotating police car light. The figure runs away and although Greenhaw pursues it in his car, it eludes him. The photos quickly become a national news story. NICAP investigator Marion Webb and others strongly suspect this is a hoax.

October 18 — 3:30 p.m. A witness in Hamilton, Illinois, sees a huge gray oval or oblong UFO. A second object appears that resembles the first but seems to be covered in “cobwebs” on its upper surface. About 15 minutes later, “cotton-like” material is found that when handled becomes a “small ball which melted as it was touched.” The next morning, a collected sample has totally sublimated. (Brian Boldman, “An Analysis of Angel Hair, 1947– 2000,” IUR 26, no. 3 (Fall 2001): 19)

October 18 — 11:00 p.m. Army Reserve Capt. [Lawrence J. Coyne](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29459297/lawrence-james-coyne&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015611752&usg=AOvVaw0jXxv1yYzFF9zbCYVrMavD) (with his crew 1st Lt. Arrigo Jezzi, Sgt. John Healey, and Spec5 Robert Yanacsek) is flying an Army Reserve UH-1 Huey helicopter at 1,200 feet from Columbus to Cleveland, Ohio. Healey notices a steady, southbound red light. It looks like the port-wing light of an aircraft but seems brighter and carries none of the other FAA-required lights. He watches it disappear behind the helicopter and doesn’t tell the others. A couple minutes later, Yanacsek sees a bright red light on the eastern horizon and watches it for 90 seconds, realizing it is pacing the helicopter. He mentions it to Coyne, who tells Healey to watch it. Soon the light turns and comes towards the helicopter. Coyne takes the controls from Jezzi and puts the helicopter into a descent. He calls Mansfield (Ohio) Approach Control but fails to get a response. The red light is now closing on them at a dangerous rate of speed, possibly 684 mph. Coyne pushes the stick down, forcing the helicopter to descend quickly. When he gets to an altitude of 650 feet above the treetops, Coyne looks up and sees the object covering the entire front windshield. The red light is on its nose and a white light is on the tail of this cigar-shaped, metallic structure. Under the tail, a green beam sweeps a 90° arc and shines through the windshield. It hovers above them for 10–12 seconds before accelerating and heading northwest. The bright white light just snaps out. Coyne looks at the altimeter and realizes they have been ascending and are now at 3,500 feet, but the stick is still down. He pulls the stick up and the helicopter levels out at 3,800 feet. Reviewing his instruments, Coyne notices that the magnetic compass is rotating slowly, while the Radio Magnetic Indicator is functioning normally. They make radio contact with Akron and fly on to Cleveland without further incident. Other witnesses on the ground have seen the incident.

October 18 — 11:30 p.m. A group of people in Wooster, Ohio, notices a bright, pulsing, triangular object with three colored lights at each apex, pulsating at different rates. When the object moves, the red light becomes brighter. It moves right, left, up, and down for 25 minutes. The UFO then dips down and shoots straight up into the sky. (Michael D. Swords, “Timmerman’s Triangles,” IUR 29, no. 2 (Summer 2004): 15)

October 20 — 1:00 a.m. Two women driving in a Volkswagen near Fort Smith, Arkansas, see a glowing object approach them from the south. It descends within 6 feet of their car, at which point the headlights, radio, and engine all fail. The object is about 8 feet in diameter, shaped like a disc, and emits a “computer-like” sound.

October 20 — 6:50 a.m. A conductor on a Louisville & Nashville Railroad train moving northeast out of Mount Vernon, Indiana, sees a bright white light coming out of the north and heading east. When they reach Caborn, Indiana, he notifies the rear conductors, who can now see a bright light (possibly another train) behind them. The train’s automatic blocking system is showing a red light, indicating there is a train to the rear. When the train reaches Belknap, the engine stops because a rear diesel unit has apparently overheated. The yardmaster in Evansville informs them that there never was any train behind them. The conductor hits a reset button and the train starts with no trouble. The light in the rear seems to be moving away, and the blocking system turns to an amber signal.

October 22 — June Margolin sees a shiny globe dropping web-like substance in large amounts over Sudbury, Massachusetts. It drapes over trees and telephone lines. She collects a sample and puts it in the refrigerator, but the substance still dissipates into strong white threads. The University of Massachusetts field station examines a sample. It is not spider web, but there is not enough of it for a chemical analysis. X-ray fluorescence and diffraction analysis indicates sodium, aluminum, silicon, sulfur, chorine, potassium, calcium, iron, nickel. The substance is 95% organic. Two other analyses indicate slightly different composition.

October 23 — Bonnie Collier observes two metallic cigar-shaped objects over Midway, Texas. She photographs one of them. About 20 minutes later, she notices monarch butterflies are getting entangled in “sheets of a web-like substance” falling to earth. She retrieves a grapefruit-sized sample from a mesquite tree and stores it in a box. Some 20 years later, the sample is analyzed by two engineering students at the University of Texas at Austin. A neutron activation survey indicates high concentrations of sodium, potassium, zinc, and lanthanum. Other tests indicate the sample is spider silk produced by a cribellate orb weaver spider.

October 25 — 7:15 p.m. Lt. Commander Moyer is traveling south from Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt, a restricted US National Security Agency station along Murat Road on North West Cape, north of Exmouth, Western Australia, when he sees a large, black object in the sky 5 miles to his west at an altitude of 2,000 feet. After about 20–25 seconds, the object accelerates at speed to the north. It is first seen at about 20° elevation, to the west. Moore estimates its angular size as half a degree. It is initially stationary and there is no associated noise

at any point, no trail or exhaust. It is last seen at 45°–50° elevation. At about 7:20 p.m., William Gordon Lynn, an Australian civilian and US Navy employee fire captain, notices a large, stationary, black object in the clear sky. It has a halo around the center, which appears to be either revolving or pulsating. He watches it for an estimated four minutes, after which it takes off speedily in a northerly direction and disappears after a few seconds.

October 25 — 9:00 p.m. A 22-year-old man and two 10-year-old boys allegedly see a bright-white, dome-shaped UFO about 100 feet in diameter land in a field near Uniontown, Pennsylvania. “Screaming sounds” emanate from somewhere nearby. The UFO makes a lawnmower-like sound. Suddenly they see two large apelike creatures with glowing green eyes walking along a fence, one in front of the other. The older witness fires a tracer slug with his rifle over the creatures’ heads, but they continue moving forward, seemingly communicating by making whining sounds. The tall and closer of the two, about 8 feet tall, is running its left hand along the fence, while the smaller one is struggling to keep up. The older witness fires three bullets into the larger creature’s chest. It whines and reaches toward the smaller creature. The UFO vanishes and the lawnmower sound ceases. The area where the UFO had been is now glowing brilliant white. The hairy creatures head toward the woods. A policeman arrives at 9:45 p.m. and finds the landing spot still glowing slightly. They hear something moving in the woods nearby and smell a sulfur-like odor. The officer and the witness panic and jump into the police car and drive about 150 feet.

October 28 — 1:15 a.m. Truck driver Dionisio Llanca is changing a tire along Highway 3 some 11 miles from Bahía Blanca, Argentina, when a UFO lands and three humanlike beings, two men and a woman, approach him. Nearly paralyzed by the light from the UFO, Llanca lets one of the beings take a blood sample and later remembers going on board the craft, whose occupants warn him that humans are headed towards disaster. He loses consciousness and wakes up in a railyard 5.5 miles away, then finds himself in a hospital. However, Argentine UFO investigators find major discrepancies and consider Llanca’s story an invention devised to make some money.

October 28 — 11:30 p.m. Karl Fichtinger watches an odd orange-yellow light to the south of Bad Traunstein, Austria, that projects two beams of light that creep slowly upward like a pair of snail feelers. After moving up a short distance, they begin curving outward. After 7–10 seconds when they reach a certain height they stop moving, the two tips turn green for 2–3 seconds, a green mist falls down sideways, and the beams disappear. After 2–5 seconds the process repeats again and again. Around 12:30 a.m. he wakes his friend Johann Pritz in another house and they continue to watch the display for several hours. At 2:00 a.m. the light emits a red “missile” that moves east, stops, turns yellow-orange, and produces a similar pattern of signals. Then they notice a third object in the west that looks more like a dark domed disc, and it is also sending thin feelers up light upward. Three more smaller lights join the one in the east. At 3:30 a.m., the missile in the east stops and takes off to the south but the others remain. The witnesses go home at 4:30, and all the objects are gone by 6:00 a.m. They estimate that the first object has given off 1,200 signals, the domed disc some 550, and the missile a minimum of 360.

November — 1:00 a.m. A witness in Sauk Village, Illinois, is sitting in her dark living room when a light outside causes it to get brighter. She sees a lighted domed disc hovering in the front yard. A central section is filled with alternating

blue and gold rectangular lights. It appears to be revolving, except for the dome, which is stationary. Her husband joins her and they continue watching it for 10 minutes. It quickly takes off straight up in 10 seconds.

November 2 — 2:45 a.m. Lyndia Morel, a masseuse in Manchester, New Hampshire, leaves work and begins driving on State Highway 114 to her home in nearby Goffstown. On the outskirts of Manchester, she sees an odd light in the sky that is flashing different colors. The light vanishes when she reaches Goffstown, but it reappears twice more, seemingly brighter and closer. She sees that it is an orange-and-gold globe covered with hexagons like a honeycomb, with an oval window on the upper left. The red, green, and blue flashes come from somewhere near the center of the object, and she hears a high-pitched sound. Suddenly she is unable to remove her hands from the steering wheel. She feels that the object is taking control of her and the car and pulling them in. Her car speeds up against her will as she passes Westlawn Cemetery. The object is now only a few hundred feet away, and through a window she sees a smallish humanoid figure standing behind a console. The figure has a round, grayish head, a wrinkled face, a downturned slit of a mouth, and two large eyes with dark pupils. She feels that he is sending her a telepathic message to be unafraid. Somehow, she slows the car and turns into the driveway of a house just past the cemetery. She jumps out and runs to the kitchen door of the house, ignoring a German shepherd dog that growls and barks at her. She pounds on the door and rings the bell and yells for help as the UFO moves to a position across the street, hovering and watching her, still emitting a high-pitched sound. The residents, Mr. and Mrs.

Beaudoin, come to the door and find a terrified woman who is covering her ears and claiming that a UFO is after her. The Beaudoins cannot see or hear anything, but Mrs. Beaudoin calls the police.

November 2 — Night. Police officers looking into reports of a “strange animal” seen in the area of Midland, Pennsylvania, spot a large, disc-shaped object in the sky overhead. At least 100 other people also see the object. (Clark III 556)

November 3 — Day. At the bottom of a gully in an isolated section of the woods near Midland, Pennsylvania, two hunters find a 42-foot ring impressed in the grass.

November 6 — 9:00 p.m. Off-duty patrolmen Gary Steinberg and Thomas Brown are sitting in an unmarked patrol car in Freeport, New York, facing east. They see a bright light in the sky that is not the helicopter they think it is at first. They watch it for 5–10 minutes before it moves away to the southeast. Steinberg tries to get closer in the patrol car, while Brown stays behind and directs him by radio. He gets to within 300–400 feet of it, as it is 700–800 feet in altitude. It now appears football-shaped and 100 feet long. He watches it for 10–15 minutes as it glows silvery blue with an occasional yellow-red pulsating tint. The object then moves off to the southwest, stopping occasionally. A smaller object comes up on his right and drifts up to the larger object and merges with it. The larger object dims in sections (about 16), one after the other, and it takes off to the southwest and disappears in a couple seconds.

November 16 — 7:00 p.m. Two 11-year old boys are outside in Lemon Grove, California, intending to play in a vacant lot or field in the neighborhood. When they arrive, there is a dark object hovering about 18 inches above the field. It seems inactive. One of the boys cautiously approaches and raps it with his flashlight, making a sound like metal on metal. Instantly, the object’s dome lights up in a brilliant red light that illuminates the entire area. It rises three or four more feet off the ground, and a row of green lights light up around its perimeter, flashing in sequence. The thing begins rotating and making a “woooo woooo woooo” sound. The object is easily visible now and appears as a domed disc. The dome is large and tall (about equal to half or more of the disc height) and glowing bright red, then flashing intermittent red. The boys are now frightened and start to run away as the object takes off toward the

November 18 — About 6:00 p.m. Four women are driving south from Tracy, Quebec, to Contrecoeur when they see a “watermelon-sized” ball of yellowish light suddenly appear above a pylon a quarter of a mile ahead of them. As they pass, it starts moving westward over the St. Lawrence River. The object seems to change shape as it flies, becoming alternately larger and smaller, dimming and growing in intensity. The light follows them as they weave in and out through wooded areas. Eventually the object is lost to sight as the women drive into Montreal. At one point they encounter a large volume of traffic that seems to be slowed by an odd pink cloud lying across the highway. They also see a small human figure standing in the middle of the road.

November 30 — 7:00 p.m. Pilot Riccardo Marano is about to land at Caselle Airport, Turin, Italy, in a Piper Navajo, when the controller notifies him that there is a UFO about 1,320 feet above the runway. He sees a luminous, multicolored ball of light changing from violet to blue to dark red. “When I got closer and had a better view, the object at once made off, flying in a most irregular fashion, maneuvering in a way I have seen no plane do, making fantastic lateral deviations, and sudden vast jumps to and fro, as if it enjoyed playing hide-and-seek. Its speed was as high as” 540 mph, Marano says. Col. Rustichelli, commandant of the Caselle military airfield, sees the UFO on his own radar screen. “It was something solid, lit up, like a plane on my radar.” Commander Tranquillo, pilot of an Alitalia Air Line DC-9 en route from Turin to Rome, calls to the control tower: “I see a shining thing giving out intermittent flashes of light, four miles from me. I dare not approach. I give way.” Commander Mezzalami in another Alitalia DC-9 reports: “I was able to observe the object … notified by the control tower just as I was about to touch down. I had a good view of it        I can offer no theories as to its significance and can only say that it

was something very strange indeed.” (NICAP, “[UFO Darts To and Fro, Observed from 3 Aircraft and Gnd](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/731130turin_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015634480&usg=AOvVaw2iYSvZ4wszI1-gwXpksyK9) [Radar](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/731130turin_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015634684&usg=AOvVaw2Bg6wLSKCW8cFPj5cQBB-E)”; Story, [p. 373](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofuf0000unse/page/372/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015634900&usg=AOvVaw0JOG_mi4UO54RrJM7Fcs85); F.

December — Kansas is quietly undergoing an epidemic of strange cattle deaths. The incidents first receive wide publicity in the December 22 Kansas City Times, which takes note of the fact that most of the deaths are Black Angus.

They have died within a few miles of US 81 in a dozen counties in north-central Kansas. Many show knife marks on the carcasses, including the apparent butchering of sex organs. The lack of blood and footprints is also puzzling. Sheriffs from the affected counties meet and decide that cultists are responsible. But according to the Kansas State University Veterinarian Laboratory in Manhattan, the animals have died of bloat and coyotes have eaten the soft parts. Many ranchers reject the explanation. Mystery helicopters are also linked to the mutilations.

If she could figure out what stars are on the map, she might be able to determine where the UFO came from.

Winter — 10:30 a.m. Harry Charlton and his wife have just driven east through Melrose, New Mexico, when they see two objects moving on their left at about 1,500 feet altitude. They have no wings, tail sections, or engine nodules.

Both are dull gray, like galvanized sheet iron. The larger one is in front, with a slightly smaller one about 600 feet behind. Charlton thinks they are about a half-mile away, but he can hear no noise or see any smoke. When the objects are about abreast of the car, a sliding door opens on the larger one near the front end. A large, shiny sphere (like polished aluminum) about 15–20 feet in diameter emerges, moves toward the smaller object, and enters it after a door opens near the rear end. After they move out of sight in a few minutes, Charlton sees two F-111s take off in their direction from Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis.

January 3 — 9:30 p.m. Two young student teachers are driving home near Leek, Staffordshire, England, when a green mass appears to follow them. The couple feels a presence. Despite being on a lonely road, they get out of the car to watch a dark mass low above their heads, with arcs of blue and green light encircling them. In terror, they head off over the moors, but moments later they run over a cattle grid, inexplicably finding themselves in Ilam 12 miles away. Seconds later there is another bump and they reach a developed area that turns out to be a town 20 miles to the north. They find a police station to report the incident and find that it is now 3:30 a.m. (Jenny Randles, “The Twelve UFOs of Christmas,” Fortean Times 374 (Christmas 2018): 29)

January 7 — 8:40 p.m. A man’s car suddenly dies as he is driving near Warneton, Belgium. He sees a landed domed disc with a flat bottom like a WWI helmet, 23–33 feet in diameter and 7–10 feet wide. It has a flange around its base and three legs. White and orange alternating bands are on the glowing object. Two humanoid beings approach him. They have broad shoulders, heads shaped like inverted pears, long arms, large eyes, and no noses. One is about 4 feet tall, the other somewhat taller; a third being remains near the craft. They wear internally lit cube- shaped helmets with the face visible, gray jumpsuits, and gloves. The taller being comes within 12–15 feet of the vehicle, then opens and closes its mouth. The witness feels a shock to the back of his head and hears a low- pitched sound. The two humanoids quickly return to the craft, which now pulses with an electric blue color, and departs. (MM.

He sees a display of aerial lights descending a short distance in front of him. The blinking lights are multicolored “like a rainbow.” Suddenly they blink out and are replaced by a blinding steady white light about 6 feet ahead of and 3 feet above the car. The light is coming from the inside of the object, where he can see a lighted room with a golden aisle and five occupants seated on the left-hand side in a straight row. Each seat is a different color, and the garments of the occupants match the color of the seat. Each has long brown hair that reaches the floor. The object departs suddenly, the interior blinking out and the colored lights reappearing. The car engine starts without difficulty. (Herbert S.

January 18 — 4:30 p.m. Giuseppe Cardelli is driving between Milan and Bologna, Italy, when he sees a “strange shining ball” in the sky. He stops his car, gets out, and photographs it. He submits the photo to NASA, which replies on June 18 that it has no explanation. A consultant wonders whether the photo shows a reflection in the car window and finds the “wiggly clouds to the right” interesting.

January 23 — 8:30 p.m. Witnesses at Llandrillo, northern Wales, see a bright object followed by a luminous tail and (according to one witness) a blinking blue light. The object is motionless for several minutes, during which time it dims then becomes very bright. It appears to crash around Cadair Bronwen mountain, east of the village. Many people hear a terrific explosion and a violent shaking of the ground recorded up to 60 miles away. Astronomers at Leicester University, England, record at least three fireball meteors this evening. The British Geological Survey identifies the source of the explosion as an earthquake. Police and a mountain rescue team from RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales, are in the area almost immediately and cordon off access to the supposed crash site on a barren hilltop. They find no trace of a crash the next day, but a nurse on the way to the crash site after being telephoned by police headquarters is on her way up the mountain with her daughters when she sees something sitting on the ground ahead of her. It seems to be intact and is large, circular, and glowing orange. The nurse and her daughters are within a few hundred feet when police and military forces show up and clearly tell her to leave the area.

They are instructed not to stop for anyone. Military personnel open the crates and Prescott sees two humanoid figures, apparently dead, about 5–6 ft tall, very thin, almost skeletal in nature with a covering skin. These are placed in decontamination suits. Other units supposedly transport live aliens from the crash site. At 10:00 p.m., a man watches a luminous sphere descend into the sea near the Dee Estuary about 25 miles north.

January 24 — While the RAF rescue team is still operating around Cadair Bronwen, three family members see a bright object in the sky near the mountain. Through field glasses, they see a disc-shaped object divided into red, green, yellow, and purple sections. After 10 minutes they call the police and the object disappears behind a cloud. ()

January 26 — 2:59 a.m. Capt. Lars Berglund and the crew of a Boeing 727 airliner flying near Lisbon, Portugal, see a V- formation of 10–15 luminous orange discs.

February 6 — Late evening. A woman watching TV in rural Fayette County near Uniontown, Pennsylvania, hears a “rattling of tin cans” on her porch. She grabs and loads a shotgun, turns on the porch light, and steps into the doorway of the porch, where she encounters a 7-foot-tall apelike creature with its hands raised in the air. She fires into his midsection and it “just disappeared in a flash of light.” Her son-in-law, who lives in a trailer 100 feet away, hears the shot, grabs a revolver, and heads for her house. Along the way, he sees “shadows of four or five hairy people” who approach him. They have “fire red eyes that glowed in total darkness.” About 1,500 feet away, a red, flashing light hovers above the trees. Investigating police arrive and find no tracks but notice that the animals seem terrified. The son-in-law tells investigator [Stan Gordon](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.stangordon.info/wp/stan-gordon/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015661607&usg=AOvVaw0LmQaKTHY2fhq4xGU58ZqM) that he had encountered a similar apelike

February 8 — 7:25 a.m. Ten girls from the orphanage school in Vălenii de Munte, Romania, watch two yellow-orange spheres above a hill to the southwest of town. After 10 seconds, they merge into one object and take the form of an elongated oval with an orange dome. It begins moving slowly toward the west-southwest, then accelerates and disappears behind the treeline after 40 seconds. Fresh marks are found in a plowed field at the site where the object was seen. (Romania 36–37)

February 8 — Sunset. Mullah Umar Siddiq, merchant Ibrahim Khaleb, and physician Muhammad Watif are standing on the roof of the Al-Hud Mosque in Al Mukalla, Yemen, when they see three large white discs gliding slowly downward. They gather some provisions, hire three camels, and head for the Wadi Jawlan 32 miles to the east, where they estimate the objects have landed. At dawn, they dismount to say prayers, and a vivid glow lights up the eastern sky above the Wadi Jawlan for a few seconds. The light is yellowish-white and comes from three beams that are stabbing upwards and fanning out into the sky. Although the light dies down, the beams are still visible, eventually growing paler. They find deep, clear-cut tracks of caterpillar-track vehicles all over the rugged area. At three places, about 325 feet apart, they find numerous scoop marks, about 33 inches wide, in an area in the form of a triangle with sides 17 feet wide. The rock has been fused and melted and the grass and thorn-scrub is burnt.

February 14 — 4:25 a.m. Two brothers are transporting their parents’ furniture in a U-Haul truck near Ely, Nevada, when they notice a round, orange object that paces them, then approaches. They feel as though they are “hit by a blast of wind or force field.” The engine and lights give out, the steering goes, and the truck seems to momentarily float, come back down, and coast to a stop. Ahead of them, just over a hill, they see a large, round object with a domed top and wings. The other object approaches again. One brother points a flashlight at it, whereupon they both get an intense feeling of isolation that lasts about 20 minutes. Since the truck appears to be damaged, they flag down a passing car and call for a tow truck. When the tow truck hauls it away, the rear wheels fall off. It needs new tires, a rear axle, outside housing, and gears.

March — About 9:00 p.m. A missile launch officer with the 564th Strategic Missile Squadron is on watch at the Malmstrom AFB Romeo Flight missile alert facility near Brady, Montana, when both the outer and inner alarms go off. A security alert team arrives and sees a large, brilliantly self-illuminated object hovering above the Romeo-29 launch facility. Suddenly, the missile starts a countdown. The officer quickly flips the inhibit switch, which puts the system offline. Then the system spontaneously restarts and the missile goes into launch mode again, followed by an inhibit order that does not work. But the launch code is false and the missile remains in its pad. Meanwhile, the UFO moves away straight up at high speed. An F-106 interceptor attempts unsuccessfully to reach it, and Malmstrom AFB radar tracks the UFO. Later he learns that the ground electronics in Romeo-29 are fried as if from a surge. (Nukes 353–355; Robert L.

March 23 — Night. A young man (pseudonym Harald Andersson) comes out of the parish house in Markim, Stockholm County, Sweden, when he hears a voice in his head telling him to follow a dark forest road. Just after passing a small cottage, he sees two runestones by the side of the path. Suddenly a blinding light knocks him to the ground where he lies unconscious for a while, then wakes up on the doorstep of his villa in Lindholmen, Vallentuna. His wife, disturbed by his condition (bleeding from his forehead and a burn on his cheek), takes him to Danderyds Hospital where hypnotherapist [Ture Arvidsson](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://esh-hypnosis.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ESH-Newsletter-2016-2.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015667549&usg=AOvVaw0pUplFf0jbPhLIEbDWwciz) regresses him to the time of the incident (twice, on April 1 and May 20).

At 11:30 p.m., the same witness watches three silver ships parked on the highway with a floodlight. He stops his engine as some figures approach. He runs and they follow. They are about 6.5 feet tall, with arms and legs, but he cannot see their faces. On March 27, the Guardia Civil investigate and find a hole in the ground.

March 27 — [Antoine](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98310233/antoine-t-betz&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015670381&usg=AOvVaw3HVTZyLNt_T7YjB7kxTDw4), Jerri, and Terry Betz investigate a small brush fire near their residence on Fort George Island, Florida, and come across a metal sphere the size of a bowling ball and weighing 22 pounds. They think the sphere could be a 16th-century cannonball and decide to take it home. Several days later, while Terry is playing the guitar, the sphere seems to react to the music and makes a throbbing noise. Later, the sphere rolls and stops on its own and changes direction. The sphere makes a noise when hit with a hammer, and Terry finds that it moves after being shaken and placed on the ground. In 2012, an analysis by Skeptoid indicates that the sphere is a ball check valve produced by the Bell & Howell company. Its size, weight, and metallurgical composition match those of the company’s check valves. The ball is almost perfectly balanced, and it takes only a small stimulus to make it move or change direction. New Mexico artist James Durling-Jones, who collects scrap metal for his sculptures, remembers loading ball check valves into the rooftop luggage rack of his Volkswagen van and driving through the Jacksonville, Florida, area around Easter of 1971. A few of the balls rolled off the luggage rack and were not retrieved. Skeptoid concludes that this is the sphere’s origin.

April — 3:00 a.m. A staff sergeant assigned to the 355th Security Police Squadron stationed at Incirlik Air Base, Adana, Turkey, witnesses a white, glowing UFO hovering silently over the nuclear storage area about 500 feet above the ground for one hour. It appears to be the size of a Volkswagen. At 4:00 a.m., the UFO suddenly and silently accelerates toward the city. The witness sees the object from the Security Police dormitory about 2 miles away. The next day, other security personnel tell him that the only measures taken are “to set up their M-60 machine guns, and that they were not to fire on the object unless it initiated a hostile act.” (Brian Vike, “[Sgt.

Early April — A couple driving on a country road in east Hancock County, Ohio, spot a low light in the northeastern sky.

They drive toward it, but it shoots up into the air so they can see its underside. As the man alerts people to the object on his CB radio, he sees the object lower a box, seemingly to take samples. Then the object approaches the couple and they drive away quickly, but it follows them for 47 miles. At 2:15 a.m., they pull into a Wigwam restaurant, where a man rushes up to them and asks them, “What did you see in the sky?” He denies having a CB radio, and talks in a strangely slow and choppy manner. The man continues to bother them, so they drive away from the Wigwam. Soon they are followed by some strange lights and an orange ball. They stop the car where the road ends and see a “little man on a little black object.” The lights follow them all the way home to Findlay, Ohio. (Clark III 731–733)

April 19 — About 9:30 p.m. Ruth Currie and her daughter Laurie see a bright light that seems to be only several hundred feet from their house in Altamont, New York. Curious, they walk toward it until they are within about 200 feet. An oval object is resting on the roadway. It appears to have large windows in the top half, from which comes a brilliant golden glow. Changes of contrast in this light give them the impression that something is moving around within. Currie sends her daughter to get a neighbor, Rose Curtis, and they return shortly. Currie then retreats to her home and phones her husband, who drops what he is doing and hurries over. He can see an object rising up. It shifts speeds and accelerates out of sight. During the bulk of this encounter, the neighborhood dogs are putting up a continuous volley of barking.

Outside they see a bell-shaped object or silhouette with a light tube in the center that seems to be waiting for them. Marian grabs a sports sword he keeps under the bed and goes outside, but the object is already moving away. He follows it around a corner of the house and the object is nowhere to be seen. Marian senses the object is still there somehow because he feels some kind of force field. Against his will he returns to his bedroom, the forcefield disappears, and he goes right back to sleep.

May — 3:30 a.m. US Army Pfc R. Jack Phillips is assigned to the 193rd Military Police Battalion guarding Area 3 of an Army Ordnance Depot \[now returned to Germany\] where surface-to-surface Pershing missiles are stored near Fischbach bei Dahn, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Suddenly waking up, he watches an extremely bright star above him for about 15 seconds. Suddenly it approaches very quickly and hovers just beyond the depot fence line about 300 feet away. The light now looks like a domed disc about 60 feet in diameter with a concave indentation on its underside. It is covered in a greenish glow and completely silent. After 5 seconds the object gets much brighter for a second then dims again. The security lights in the complex go out. Phillips tries to report this, but his field phone is out. The backup generators fail to turn on. Some 30 seconds later, the object takes off so swiftly that he can’t tell in which direction it leaves. The lights come back on and all the bunker alarms go off. A roving unit needs to come by to reset all the alarms manually. Phillips admits that most of the guards sleep on duty, and that is probably why no one else has seen the object. (Nukes 343–346)

May 20 — 7:00 p.m. A baker named Le Meur, with his wife and two children, is traveling on a small road toward Landévennec, Finistère, France, when they notice a powerful light ahead at ground level. It consists of a string of 7–8 spheres, each about one foot in diameter and arranged horizontally, about 3 feet above the road. Le Meur turns around and heads to the local Gendarmerie station in Telgruc-sur-Mer to report it. The police examine the site the next day and find a patch of ferns that appear abnormally wilted. They collect some plant and soil samples and send them to a lab in Paris for analysis. The wilted, brown ferns are found to be without chlorophyll and an unknown element (indicating pheophytins associated with the degradation of chlorophyll) shows up in the chromatography in ultraviolet light.

Summer — Late evening. A witness living southwest of Lodi, Wisconsin, sees an intensely bright light that is illuminating a hill on an adjacent golf course. It covers an area the size of a football field, but he cannot see a beam or light source. A few hours later, a couple driving on State Highway 113 south of Lodi observe a triangular object with red and blue circular lights suspended beneath it. The object passes silently less than 20 feet above their car, hovers momentarily, and resumes its slow pass overhead. It is twice the size of their car. They watch as the lights shut off and the object is gone. At 1:00 a.m., a man in Lodi sees what he thinks are headlights pulling into his driveway. He sees three bright points of light fixed horizontally in the black sky. He goes in to get his brother who has a telescope, and they attempt to spot the lights (only two now) with the scope. It takes a while, and when they

look straight up they see a large, triangular object right above them. No lights are visible, but its undersurface is clearly defined and metallic. It moves over the house, tips upward at a 45° angle, and shoots away. (Don Schmitt, “The Belleville Sightings, Part Two,” IUR 13, no. 1 (Jan./Feb. 1988): 17)

June 9 — Night. Maj. Shiro Kubota and Lt. Col. Toshio Nakamura are flying an F-4EJ Phantom II interceptor over the northern perimeter of Japan, apparently to intercept a Soviet aircraft. Ground control explains that they are to investigate a bright orange-red light reported by ground witnesses and tracked on radar. Leveling off at 30,000 feet, they see the light a few miles ahead. It appears to be about 33 feet in diameter, with square-shaped marks around its side. The object dips in a shallow turn as they approach. Suddenly the object reverses direction and shoots straight toward them. Nakamura forces the aircraft into a sudden dive to avoid it, missing the UFO by “inches.” The object then makes high-speed passes at the plane, drawing closer. Then, allegedly, the UFO strikes the F-4, forcing the two pilots to eject. Nakamura’s parachute catches fire and he falls to his death.

June 14 — 5:30 a.m. Santiago Pulido Romero is driving in Medellín, Badajoz, Spain, near the Castillo when he sees a pot- shaped object rapidly approaching him 300 feet above the ground. He turns off his car lights, but the object follows his car parallel to the road about 210 feet away to the right. When he switches his headlights back on, the object begins approaching again, so he switches them off and the object retreats. When he arrives at his father’s property, the object hovers over the barn, moving up and down, so he runs into the house. Later Pulido goes outside to check, and the object is still hovering, lighting up the entire area like daytime. Three humanoid beings are visible inside the object. Early the next morning at sunrise, the object abruptly speeds away. Other witnesses in separate locations also see a UFO.

June 15 — Mountain guide Keo Wha Unan is inspecting the outer perimeter of a rock formation near Mount Dhajar (apparently in the Bayan Har Mountains, Tibet) to make certain it is safe for the next day’s climb. He emerges from a cave and sees a silvery disc hovering about 4 feet above the ground behind a crest of high rocks. It is windowless and shiny with no protrusions. He sees three humanoid figures gathering snow and rocks and putting them inside the UFO. After 5 minutes, they climb a ladder into the craft. The object rises a few feet and shoots straight up like a flash.

June 25 — 1:15 a.m. A witness is up late in his trailer home at St.-Cyrille-de-Wendover, Quebec, when he hears a “bumm, bumm, bumm” sound, as if something very heavy has fallen onto the ground. He looks out the living room window and sees a UFO hovering low above a near field. It is a disc with a red domed area and an orangish lower area punctuated by oval windows from which comes white light. He sees a 6-foot-tall robot that has apparently emerged from the object and is now only 15 feet from his window. He and his wife see three more robots near the trailer next door. The observation lasts 3 hours as the couple peek out of the window periodically. At one point, they see 15 robots standing in line together close to a creek for 5 minutes. As if on command, they suddenly move together; when they look out again at 4:20 a.m., the craft and the robots are gone.

August 25 — After 10:00 p.m. A document is leaked to UFO researchers in the US and UK in 1992 and is apparently composed by someone within the US intelligence community who either personally knows about the case or who has run across top-secret documents. Now known as the “Deneb Report,” the document alleges that the following incident took place. Military radar at Corpus Christi, Texas, detects an unknown target moving toward the Texas Gulf coast. Traveling at a speed of 2,500 mph at an altitude of 75,000 feet, the UFO is first spotted over the Gulf of Mexico about 200 miles east of Corpus Christi. After going through maneuvers suggesting intelligent control, the object quickly turns south along the Texas coast, avoiding entry over land, and seems headed toward Brownsville. As the disc continues to hug the Texas coastline, it exhibits controlled descent, calculated turns, speed reductions, and other clear indications of control. The object descends from 75,000 feet to about 45,000 feet by the time it crosses over land into northern Mexico, about 40 miles south of Brownsville. Its speed is down to 2,000 mph and it is slowing very gradually. Zigzagging around mountain peaks that tower above 5,000 feet, the UFO continues to descend, although its speed is still near 2,000 mph at the time that it encounters another aircraft headed toward it on a collision course. Somewhere over a vast desert plain known as El Llano near Coyame, Chihuahua, Mexico, a mid-air collision occurs with a small aircraft flying from El Paso to Mexico City. Debris from the crash rains down on the desert plain below, and efforts are soon underway by both Mexico and the US to recover the remains. Mexican spotter planes first locate the wreckage of the aircraft, even as US electronic surveillance personnel listen in on the rescue activities from across the Texas border. The Americans hear the Mexican spotter planes say that the small craft is almost totally destroyed and that they have found a second crash site nearby with the remains of a nearly intact, shiny, silvery disc. The object is 16 feet, 5 inches in diameter, and equally convex on both upper and lower surfaces. There is an outer rim around the central circumference. The height is slightly less than 5 feet. They see no visible portholes, doors, or markings. In addition, no lights of any kind are apparent. There is also no obvious mechanism for propulsion. The external surface of the disc is like silvery polished steel. Mexican troops recover the crashed disc, winching it up onto the bed of a large military truck. They also retrieve fragments of the crashed civilian aircraft, although there is not much left of it.

September 1 — 11:00 a.m. While he is driving a swather to harvest his rapeseed crop near Langenburg, Saskatchewan, farmer Edwin Fuhr, 36, notices a metallic-appearing dome-shaped object about 50 feet away and stops to investigate. Walking to within 15 feet of it, Fuhr sees that it is spinning and swirling the grass beneath it. This frightens him and he backs away. Climbing back on the swather, he looks around and sees four more identical domes “like brushed stainless steel” arranged in a rough semicircle, all hovering and spinning about a foot above the ground. Whether from fear or an EM effect, Fuhr cannot get the throttle and steering wheel of the swather to respond. One object suddenly takes off, quickly followed by the other four, ascending in a step formation. At about 200 feet they stop, each emitting a puff of gray vapor from exhaust-like extensions at the base. The vapor extends about 6 feet, followed by a downward gust of wind which flattens the rapeseed in the immediate area. The objects then form a straight line, hover for a minute or two, then suddenly ascend into the low cloud cover and

disappear. Fuhr goes to the landing area and finds five rings of depressed grass swirled in a clockwise fashion. There is no evidence of heat or burning. Some additional circles are found in the area later that month. Fuhr later learns that cattle in a nearby field bellowed and broke through a fence about the time of the sighting. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Constable Ron Morier, quoted by Canadian Press, says: “Something was there and I doubt it was a hoax. There’s no indication anything had been wheeled in or out and Mr. Fuhr seemed genuinely scared.” Later Morier tells an investigator, “There is no way that this is a hoax. Whatever was in there, it came out of the air and departed the same way, as far as I could tell.” (Ted Phillips, [Physical Traces Associated with UFO](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cufos.org/books/Physical_Traces.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015701141&usg=AOvVaw3cmM9-KNyQK6kXR1RNfRZw) [Sightings](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cufos.org/books/Physical_Traces.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015701353&usg=AOvVaw21V7NMYqhrVVUjwvQBd2xV)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://cufos.org/books/Physical_Traces.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015701510&usg=AOvVaw27F9qSCdjmXuk-1RH62yMs) CUFOS, 1975, p. 104; Yurko Bondarchuk, UFO Sightings, Landings, and Abductions, Methuen, 1979,

September 9 — 8:30 p.m. Professor Andrei Antalffy and his wife are in their summer cottage near Târgu Mureş, Romania, when she notices a silvery-white light behind the house. They go outside and see a rectangular “wall of opaque light” about 82 feet long and 550 away from them. In front of the wall on the ground are four orange spheres about 18 inhes in diameter and grouped two-by-two. They continue to watch the display from inside the cottage until midnight when they retire for the night. (Romania 41)

September 16 — Around 9:30 p.m. Mrs. A. Richards is driving a 1968 Toyota a few miles northwest of St. Helens, Tasmania, with her two children. The car radio suddenly turns to static as she is passing over a bridge and the sky ahead lights up. The car then loses power as it travels up an incline, and everything goes dead—car lights, radio, heater, and engine. The landscape is lit up by a bright area of light ahead. The mother tries to start the car without success. A deafening vibrating noise then seems to envelop the car. About the same time all three of them feel electric shocks like vibrations for one minute, and a choking smell fills the car so that they leap from the car and flee the scene, leaving the car and the glow in the sky behind. After nearly 2 miles, they reach a house whose resident gives them a ride back to the car to see what is wrong. The hood is warm, but the car starts up and there is no sign of a light. A check at the local garage finds water in the radiator low, otherwise both radio and electrical systems are in working order. The mother suffers from swollen arms and fingers the following day. The right side of her face is numb and she has red marks above her right eyebrow.

September 21 — 10:00 p.m. A Swedish army officer is driving with his family near Knutby, Uppsala County, Sweden, when a blinding light approaches the car from the right at an altitude of about 30 feet. The car stops and the radio and headlights go out. The UFO passes the road ahead and then lands on the left side about 250 feet from the road. A large area is lit up by the blinding, green-shimmering light from the object. The witnesses hear a sound like a swarm of bees. Through binoculars, the officer sees an egg-shaped structure some 33 feet long and around 10 feet high. The car engine still does not work. He gets out of the car, then hears a deafening roar. The UFO is taking off vertically with a rocking motion. It flies off slowly at about 100 feet altitude for a few hundred yards, then takes off and disappears in a fraction of a second. He gets back in the car and the radio is playing music and the car starts easily.

September 26 — 9:30–10:00 p.m. More than 100 people in north Zealand, Denmark, watch unusual objects and lights in the sky. One driver is suddenly surrounded by a dazzling red light that illuminates the area. The engine, lights, and radio fail. After several attempts, he restarts the car and turns on the lights. A cone of white neon light descends toward the car. A bumping noise and a sound like broken glass is heard on the roof, and then a foot-long spurt of flame erupts from the car radio. The engine and lights fail again. After about 6 seconds a distinct “click” is heard, and everything works normally again. The car engine and radio are undamaged. (Herbert S.

September 30 — Newsweek brings the issue of cattle mutilations to a national audience. Noting that “more than 100 cattle have been found dead and gruesomely mutilated in Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa,” it lists possible culprits: witchcraft cultists, UFOs, helicopter-borne rustlers, marijuana smugglers, and predators. In months and years to come, the scare spreads from the Midwest to the West to the South. (Clark III 133)

Autumn — 10:00 a.m. A metallic disc some 300 feet across approaches a South Korean antiaircraft shore battery. The commander launches an MIM-23 Hawk guided missile which is immediately shot down by a “white ray” from the UFO. The second ray is directed at the battery, melting the remaining two Hawk missiles into an unrecognizable mass.

October 10 — 10:10 p.m. John Breen, a Canadian armed forces pilot, is paced by a UFO over Grand Falls, Newfoundland, in his Cessna 172, en route from Deer Lake to Gander. A passenger first notices a strange light following the plane when they are 50 miles away from Gander. Every time Breen looks at the light it seems to turn off, but finally he gets a better view: “It seems to be sort of a triangle—or delta-shaped, luminescent greenish light following us.” It stays on for 3–4 seconds, then goes off for a bit, then on again. Gradually it remains steady. About 25–30 miles from Gander, Breen radios the airport, which has no traffic in the area. The object’s reflection is clearly visible in the water of Gander Lake. Breen says: “I started a right turn and then cut hard left. Gander then picked up the object for two or three sweeps, which would have been about 10–12 seconds. When we turned around, I just saw it going off the other way and then I lost it because of the back of the airplane.” (Gregory M.

Carl Higdon Jr. is hunting elk on the northern edge of Medicine Bow National

Forest southeast of Rawlins, Wyoming, when he sees five elk standing motionless. He attempts to shoot one, but the bullet falls about 50 feet from him as if hitting an invisible obstruction. He goes to pick it up, then hears a twig snap and sees a humanoid being (more than 6 feet tall) under a tree about 50 feet away. Its hair is sticking up “like wheat straw,” it is bow-legged, and it is wearing a black coverall suit and black shoes. Two belts cross its chest, and another is wrapped around its waist. The being asks Higdon how he is doing and whether he is hungry, after which it tosses him a package of pills. It tells him to take one, saying it will last for four days. Higdon looks up the hill and sees a transparent, lighted cubicle. Suddenly he finds himself inside it, strapped to a seat with a helmet on his head. Two humanoids are also inside, as well as four seats, a control panel, a mirror, a map, and several elk, frozen in a cage. The craft takes him to what seems to be another planet with a mushroom-shaped tower, 100 feet tall. He and one of the humanoids float to the tower, go down an elevator, pass down a corridor, and go into a room with a platform. After being screened by a “glassy shield,” Higdon is told he is “not any good for what we need” and is taken back to the original location, where he rolls down a hill, hurting his head, neck, and shoulder. Around 6:30 p.m., Higdon radios his boss, Roy Fleming of the AM Well Service in Rawlins, with his location and asks for assistance. At 11:40 p.m., Higdon is found by a rescue party, which includes Fleming, the Carbon County sheriff, a deputy, and three other men in several four-wheel-drive pickup trucks.

November — 8:00 p.m. Claire Haser, on an isolated ranch northeast of Goldendale, Washington, sees a yellowish-white glow in the sky on the ground to the north. At 11:00 p.m., as visitors are leaving, she steps outside and sees it again, closer and more intense. Suspended in the air only 10 feet away from the porch and 15 feet above the ground is a “cylinder” about 3 feet long and 14 inches in diameter, standing with its end pointed toward the ground. Projecting from the object is a long, narrow, beam of light about 2 inches in diameter and 3 feet long. The end of the beam is diffuse, and it is slowly rotating clockwise. She watches it for 10 minutes. Not wanting to approach the object, everyone goes back inside. The object is gone 30 minutes later.

November — Night. A witness is traveling in his 1971 Mitshubishi Colt near the Sideling hill in northeastern Tasmania when he notices a huge flame-colored glow lighting up the bush to the north. It looka larger than a house. The headlights, radio, and motor of his car all cut out and he is left watching the glow for several minutes. He notices his luminous watch dial has become brighter and that the car’s clock is running 2 minutes slower after the sighting. The mass of light moves back and forth, rises up and away from the witness, and disappears. The witness then able to start his car and continue on his journey. Afterward, the front left mudguard changes color from red to more of an orange.

Carr says there are three witnesses, but they must remain unnamed. He says that the US government will end the coverup, admit that UFOs are really spacecraft from other worlds, and it will happen soon—before the end of the year. Curt Collins writes, “Part of the reason Carr’s story took hold was that it was so familiar, people wanted something like it to be true, and that it seemed to come from an authority figure, a university professor with official governments contacts and sources It also struck a chord with the public, capitalizing on their distrust of the government following the Vietnam war and Watergate scandal.” (“[UFOs and 12 Little Men,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/96732653/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015712471&usg=AOvVaw1vE5oDNHK-padIwMjuh0pF)” Fort Lauderdale (Fla.)

November 7 — 3:00 p.m. Two schoolgirls are biking home from school in Waterford, Connecticut, when they see a ball of fire in the sky. They ride to one of their homes and go out in a car, hoping to take a photo. When they get to the shore of Niantic Bay, they see it again with several other people who have stopped. The object is now shaped like a triangular space capsule with rounded corners. Flames shoot from the back as it performs elaborate rolls and maneuvers. Then it takes off. (Michael D.

November 11 — Night. Police officers Zachary Space and Lester Nagle watch an object hovering level with high-tension wires east of Madison, Ohio. It comes down above the wires for 15–20 seconds, rises up slowly out of sight, then appears again. Along with a deputy sheriff, they watch the object for 20 minutes. It leaves like a flash.

Mid-November — 5;30 p.m. Giovanna Sensoli is attending to her animals by her farmhouse near Castelleale, Romagna, Italy, when she notices her chickens and rabbits seem terrified. She notices a man seated on a box that is suspended in the air above her house, rocking to and fro, and only about 12 feet from her. He seems to be about 6 feet 6 inches tall and dressed in a shiny, one-piece garment with green, red, and white markings, and a pair of ski boots with square toes and heels. A helmet covers his face, but he seems to be looking for something. The box has a control rod with colored stripes. The man moves a bit further away to the east on his box. Sensoli sees a bright light to the north and she is overcome by heat. The house is lit up for a few seconds. Sensoli follows the man, trying to understand his gesticulations, but he departs to the east, followed by the light. The incident has lasted 15 minutes.

November 17 — 9:00 a.m. A businessman is taking a walk along the shore of Nørresø in Viborg, Denmark, when he notices an object above the eastern bank of the lake. He snaps a photo of it as it hovers in the air about 1,600– 3,300 feet away. He looks around to see if there are other witnesses, but when he looks back the object is gone. The photo shows a circular object with an estimated diameter of about 65 feet with some cloudy filaments hanging from its base. Investigators suspect it may be a rare instance of a small cumulus cloud that has developed from a black smoke ring.

November 22 — 7:30 p.m. At two-minute intervals, three bright red lights are seen climbing very quickly from the horizon at Madeira, Canary Islands, after which they create brilliant concentric circles. A reporter in Funchal takes a few photos. The lights are probably Poseidon missiles launched by the submarine [USS Mariano G.

November 28 — 11:43 a.m. Hugo W. Feugen is flying his own Aeronca Champion aircraft on a bright day over Shabbona, Illinois, and he is checking his position on the aeronautical map to determine if he was still on course. When he looks up, he notices that the magnetic compass is rotating counterclockwise at a rate of four revolutions per minute. He looks to his right side and sees nothing but the town below him. When he turns to his left, he sees a disc or ellipse flying parallel to his aircraft at the same speed (75–80 mph) and altitude, pacing him at 120° at an estimated one-quarter of a mile distance. He estimates its size as 120 feet long and 30 feet thick. After pacing him for 8–10 seconds, the object tips slightly and he sees that it is not an ellipse but round in shape. As it tips up at an angle, it accelerates to a fantastic speed toward the east and is out of sight in less than one second.

It is a disc-shaped UFO, the bottom half obscured by the fog. But what holds his attention is something inside the object’s “curved front of glass.” Inside stands a figure with its arms raised above its head. He thinks the figure is as scared as he is because its eyes are protruding. It is generally human in shape, but its body is covered in dark tan fur except on the face and chin. Its head hair seems to be swept back, and the calf-like ears stretch out about 3 inches. The mouth and nose seem flat. Bosak speeds past the object and his car lights suddenly go dim.

The act also provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amend their records, and it sets forth various agency record-keeping requirements. Each agency must file an annual report on its FOIA requests to Congress. Citizens can also petition

courts to render decisions on whether or not to release documents from agencies. FOIA soon disproves the longstanding denial of interest in UFOs by the CIA, FBI, and military agencies.

December 31 — Night. Dave Percy and two other security guards at the Pickering, Ontario, Nuclear Generating Station are preparing to greet the new year when they see a cluster of bright red spheres over Lake Ontario to the south. One of them moves closer and hovers over the Number 3 and 4 reactor buildings. It is about 30 feet across. The object hovers for 6–7 minutes, then after a bright flash it takes off.

It combines these accounts with his theories about UFOs and various paranormal phenomena, ultimately connecting them to the collapse of the Silver Bridge across the Ohio River on December 15, 1967. (Official investigations in 1971 determine it was caused

by stress corrosion cracking in an eye bar in a suspension chain.) Other entities that Keel chronicles are not-quite- human individuals (men in black) who intimidate witnesses and seem linked with UFOs. Sometimes, he writes, they threaten witnesses who have not told anyone else about their sightings. Usually they wear dark suits, sometimes with turtle-neck sweaters, and have dark complexions and Oriental features. Others are pale and bug- eyed. Their behavior is frequently odd, as if they are operating in an environment alien to them. In many cases they drive black Cadillacs or other limousine-like vehicles. (John A.

He stops the car and all four get out and watch a bright yellow object just above the ground some 1,300 feet away where the light has fallen. It has the form of a truncated cone and emits white jets of light toward the ground. The light goes out suddenly and four others appear in a straight line, lighting up in succession.

January 2 — 2:45 p.m. Michael Lindstrom and his wife are relaxing on the beach near the Kauai Sands Hotel on the east side of the island of Maui, Hawaii. His wife notices a strange object moving southward over the beach toward her, and she runs to tell her husband, who is walking nearby. It is soundless, has a square shape, its center is white or silver, and it has a black stripe along its perimeter. A row of lights is visible along the lower edge. He estimates that it is flying at 5,000 feet altitude traveling diagonally to the direction of the wind, and is about one mile away. Before it disappears to the southwest after two minutes, Lindstrom takes three photographs (slides), which show a spherical object bisected by a black square and topped by five bright dots.

He revives inside a UFO where three greenish, 6-foot-tall creatures, are plucking hair from his head and body. Diaz faints and wakes up in the afternoon in Buenos Aires some 400 miles away, where someone takes him to the Hospital Ferroviario. However, an extensive investigation by ufologist Roberto Enrique Banchs uncovers numerous discrepancies that strongly indicate a hoax. (Roberto Enrique Banchs and Richard W.

January 12 — 2:45 a.m. George O’Barski is driving home through North Hudson Park, New Jersey, when he hears static on his CB radio. Through the window he sees a dark, round object with brightly lit windows hovering over the ground about 100 feet away. Ten small (3.5-feet tall), helmeted figures dressed in coveralls emerge from the

January 31 — Night. Mike McKenna, security guard at the Pickering, Ontario, Nuclear Generating Station, sees 6 balls of light from his position at the east gate. They vary in color from bright red to almost white and remain in the area for nearly 2 hours. Two move in from Lake Ontario and hover above the plant’s service center. After remaining motionless for 30 minutes, they take off straight up at a rocket-like speed. (Yurko Bondarchuk, UFO Sightings, Landings, and Abductions, Methuen, 1979, pp. 120–121)

January 31 —10:20 p.m. Alan Lott is walking his dog in Caversham, Berkshire, England, when he sees a group of bright lights to the east. He calls his wife, Clarice, and they both view the lights through binoculars. They are moving slowly and silently in a straight line from east to west and are now directly above the Lotts’ house. The three brightest lights are orange-yellow and arranged in an equilateral triangle formation. There are two smaller lights, one red and another white. After 5 minutes, the formation vanishes behind houses and trees.

February —Domestic birds, ducks, goats, rabbits, geese, cattle, pigs, and sheep are found dead throughout Puerto Rico with what one veterinarian characterizes as “strange wounds.” The deaths typically occur in the early morning hours and are caused by a sharp instrument that can punch through flesh and bone, usually in the neck region. Around this time and through July, some Puerto Ricans see large, unidentified birds, as well as UFOs.

This leads to an unlikely adventure involving Swann’s remote viewing of a secret extraterrestrial base on the hidden side of the Moon and his “shocking” experience with a

* * *

sexy, scantily dressed female alien in a Los Angeles, California, supermarket. He concludes that extraterrestrials are living on Earth in humanoid bodies. Swann deduces that there are many extraterrestrials, that many are “bio- androids,” and that they are aware their only foes on Earth are psychics. Later, Swann and Mr. Axelrod take a flight to an unknown northerly destination, deduced by Swann as possibly Alaska. Along with two twin bodyguards, Swann and Axelrod attempt to secretly watch a recurrent UFO appear and suck up the water of a lake. Axelrod discloses that the silent, growing, oscillating triangle is simultaneously scanning the area and eliminating any animals, and that the silent beams emanating from the object are “blasting deer or porcupines from the woods or something.” The bodyguards realize they are discovered and the group is attacked by the UFO. Swann is thrown to safety by his colleagues and sustains a minor injury.

Early February — Night. A farmer is walking to his barn north of Lundar, Manitoba, when a red ball of light, 14–16 inches in diameter, swoops low over his head. As he gazes up at it, he feels as if hot plastic is being poured on his head. He suffocates and cannot think clearly while it is above him.

February 4 — Night. Three Pickering, Ontario, ambulance drivers, a Durham regional police constable, and Andy Parks, music director of radio station CHOO in Agincourt, watch pulsing, multicolored objects maneuvering above the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. Parks says they are “floating around, zipping this way and that.” (Yurko Bondarchuk, UFO Sightings, Landings, and Abductions, Methuen, 1979, pp. 121–122)

February 10 — 7:00 p.m. Two 15-year-old boys in Annadale, Staten Island, New York, see a glowing ball, 20 feet in diameter, hovering about 400 feet away above some trees near a frozen pond. The brilliant orange mass compresses itself from football-shaped to basketball-shaped over a period of 10 minutes then suddenly disappears. Another witness who is walking a German shepherd dog around the same time reports that the dog reacted very nervously to something in the woods. The boys return early the next morning and find that some trees, ranging 5– 20 feet in height, have been sheared off and some are coated with a carbon-like substance. NICAP investigators have dirt and wood samples analyzed at a scientific laboratory and find that the trees are only superficially burned on their bark but that the fire is oil-based. They suspect the glowing object is a low-temperature fuel fire.

February 14 — 12:05 p.m. Antoine Séverin, 21, is on the slope of Piton du Calvaire, a hill outside Petite Île on the southern coast of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, when he hears a deafening beeping sound, feels a blast of heat, and sees a bright metallic object hovering about 5 feet above the ground. A ladder with three steps appears on the underside, and a small being like the “Michelin man” emerges. He is holding a shining object. Two other beings emerge, all with antennae on their heads. A fourth is visible through a porthole. Then Séverin is hurled onto his back by a powerful flash of light. The beings run up the ladder and withdraw it, then the UFO takes off, emitting a loud whistle. For several days he has blurred vision, impaired speech, and a medical diagnosis of shock. The Gendarmerie investigate the case and judge him to be mentally sound. (Lt.-Col.

February 17 — 9:00 p.m. Wheatland County Sheriff Richard Egebakken sees a bright, round object hovering about 500 feet near the Malmstrom AFB K-01 Minuteman missile alert facility 1.7 miles east-northeast of Harlowton, Montana. When Deputy Larry Clifford drives to a point about one mile from the site, the object suddenly shoots up to 2,000 feet, stops, and hovers again.

Deputy Herb Lynn stops his pickup truck a few miles out of town to watch and sees it flitting around the sky in all sorts of crazy directions. Deputy Russ Mill, within a mile of K-01, describes a blue object bobbing up and down. Radar at Malmstrom AFB does not track anything. (UFOEv II 45–46)

February 23 — Night. Glenn E. Bradley sees two large cylindrical objects like grain silos floating above Matachewan, Ontario. Both are shining white floodlights downward to the ground and have bright lights at the top. They are traveling to the west at about 30 mph. Bradley begins following them in his pickup truck. Outside the lights of the town he notices that the two silos are accompanied by smaller UFOs about 50 feet in diameter, all darting about at high speed. They appear to be entering and exit the larger silos.

February 26 — 8:45 p.m. A former RAAF crewman and a companion are on a fishing trip to Lake Sorell, Tasmania, when they see three glowing objects in the northeast sky, one smaller than the other two. Two of the UFOs move closer and hover, then recede, intermittently obscured by clouds. Each has a pulsing red light on its base. The main larger object is an elongated disc with a row of twinkling red lights around the rim. After a bank of clouds go through with a passing storm, the object reappears, glows brightly, and suddenly zooms toward the witnesses at “phenomenal speed.” It stops abruptly about 2,900 feet away at a height of 490 feet, its lights dimming. It projects a brilliant, cone-shaped light beam toward the lake and sweeps it toward the terrain, illuminating the side of a mountain. Then it sweeps back across the lake beneath the object and fades out. The lake’s surface glows a fluorescent blue-white. The object then shoots away to the northeast. A second object, which has been hovering to the north toward Mount Penny, speeds off in the same direction.

March 2 — A police officer in Phillips, Wisconsin, hears odd noises on his patrol car radio, then he sees a disc-shaped object with a rounded hump on its top and bottom, along with red and orange lights on the bottom edge. He estimates the object is 30 feet in diameter. When he directs his spotlight on it, the object rapidly ascends. (Richard F. Haines, CE-5: Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind, Sourcebooks, 1998, p. 109)

March 2 — 10:30 p.m. A couple and their daughter see a large, yellowish, egg-shaped light moving erratically in short spurts outside their home in the Great Swamp Management Area near West Kingston, Rhode Island. It then stops and hovers for 5 minutes. They then see two orange-white, ball-shaped objects drop from the large UFO and move northward at the approximate speed of an aircraft, disappearing over the horizon. The large object again moves erratically toward the southeast, gradually picking up speed.

March 18 — 1:30 p.m. Pat McCarthy, 19, is in a quarry off Ontario Highway 5 near Waterdown, Ontario, trying to take photos of hawks. He is about to leave when he sees a dark object resembling a Frisbee. It is moving swiftly, and he takes four photos of it, capturing the object 3 times. He estimates the object is twice as long as a DC-8. He takes the camera to the Hamilton Spectator, which processes the film in its darkroom. (Hamilton (Ont.)

March 22 — 10:30 p.m. Two young men and three girls are driving along the Mount Flora to Dingo Beach Road about 50 miles from Nebo, Queensland, when they see a strange light in a gravel storage area to the left of the road. The object is a box-like mass, 8 feet high and 9 feet wide, with a row of flashing white-to-yellow lights about 3 feet above the ground and a circular mass above it. As they stop the car, the object emits a tremendous bang like a shotgun. They are startled and drive on, feeling that the circular mass is watching them, then they return to the original location, but the girls in the back seat are terrified. They drive 9 miles further and find a road construction crew and tell them about the UFO. The two men convince one of the workers to return to the spot, but the object is gone and they find unusual ground marks. On March 25, two investigating officers from RAAF Base Townsville examine three oval-shaped areas, one roughly circular area, and one rectangular area, all apparently recent and produced by a heavy weight or pressure.

April 3–9 — Some 57 separate UFO sightings involving triangular or delta-shaped UFOs occur in the area around Lumberton, North Carolina. Many cases involve an object hovering silently at low altitude, accelerating instantly, and turning without banking. They are often seen at treetop level and with a bright and maneuverable spotlight.

Among the witnesses are 48 police officers.

April 20 — Night. Stationary beams of light are seen at San José de Jáchal, San Juan, Argentina. In a remote area, three imprints are found forming a 12-foot equilateral triangle surrounding a large smoke blot. Nearby plants are burned and stones are blackened. Some footprints are noted. Seven mushrooms nearly 8 inches tall are found growing there the following day. (Fred Merritt, “A Preliminary Classification of Some Reports of UFOs,” IUR 28, no. 3 (Fall 2003): 9)

May 3 — 1:34 p.m. Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel is flying a Piper PA-24 Comanche from Zihuatenejo, Guerrero, Mexico, to Mexico City at about 15,000 feet. While passing over Laguna de Tequesquitengo in Jojutla, Morelos, he feels a strange vibration in his airplane. Then he sees to the right, pacing alongside, a 10-to 12-foot-diameter disc with a dome on top. Another appears to the left of the plane, and a third disc approaches head-on, dropping beneath the plane. Carlos feels a jolt as if the object has impacted. He pulls the landing gear lever, but it fails to operate. The plane feels as if it is pulled or lifted, and the controls refuse to respond. Although badly shaken, Carlos notifies Mexico City by radio, describing what is happening. At the same time, air control radar is showing unexplained objects near his plane that are capable of sharp turns, unlike normal aircraft. Finally, their blips merge on the radar screen and speed away toward Popocatépetl volcano. After the objects leave, Montiel is able to lower his landing gear manually and land safely. Aviation personnel who know him testify to his sobriety and trustworthiness. A week later, de los Santos is invited to discuss the sighting on a TV talk show. As he drives to the interview, a large black Cadillac limousine pulls in front of him on the freeway. An identical car appears behind, forcing him to the side of the road. Four tall, broad-shouldered, pale-skinned men in dark suits jump out and approach him, still in his car. Speaking Spanish in a mechanical tone, one warns him to keep quiet about the sighting “if you value your life and your family’s too.” He breaks his appointment, and does so a month later after another visit by the men in black before an interview with [J.

May 3 — 9:15 p.m. Alois Olenick, 48, is driving west on Mogford Road south of San Antonio, Texas, when an amber- colored object rises up from a grove of trees. The object approaches him quickly, the light on its front changing from amber to red. When it hovers over his pickup for 10–20 seconds, the lights go out and the engine goes dead. He can see two occupants through a clear dome on the top of the UFO. They are bald with long prominent ears and long noses. The bottom of the object is “highly polished metal” that casts a reddish glow. Olenick hears no engine noise, only a shriek of wind. The object takes off straight up and vanishes instantly.

May 6 — Day. A pilot testing some new equipment in his airplane southeast of Wright-Patterson AFB near Dayton, Ohio, sees three silvery UFOs with portholes flying in formation ahead and closing in on his aircraft. The pilot descends to 1,000 feet, but they keep pace, one on each wingtip, the third above the plane. The pilot levels off and climbs quickly to 3,000 feet, but the objects match his maneuvers for another 60 minutes. All the control panel instruments go haywire, and the pilot loses all sense of time. The UFOs are confirmed by base radar. (Stringfield, Situation Red, Fawcett Crest, 1977, pp. 145–146)

May 12 — 11:30 p.m. Lyle Carson is in his farmhouse 2.5 miles east of Peesane, Saskatchewan, when he and his wife observe a green light for 10–15 minutes.

May 13–14 — 11:30 p.m. Multiple witnesses see a bright light a few miles north of Carman, Manitoba, where it has been appearing so frequently since April 10 that it has been nicknamed “Charlie Redstar.” CKY-TV station employees Bill Kendricks and Allen Kerr see a light on the western horizon that rises up, moves slowly south, flashes brilliantly, then shoots straight up. Newspaper editor Howard Bennett and others see a smoky red light above some tall trees. Bennett leads investigators to a potential landing site. Using a radiation survey meter, they find a few radioactive hot spots about 255 feet apart, each with a radius of 25 feet.

May 16 — Three men wander away from a party on the shore of Stephenfield Lake, Manitoba, when they see a “moon- shaped” object hovering over a dam on the far shore. As they watch, a beam of light shoots from the object to the surface of the lake. A glowing object appears underneath the surface and begins moving toward the witnesses.

When it is about 20 feet away, one of them throws a rock at it. It appears to break into pieces and return to its original location, and the beam goes out. (Chris Rutkowski, Visitations?

June 20 — 11:10 p.m. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police constable patrolling on Grand Valley Road northwest of Brandon, Manitoba, notices a bright white light to the northwest, apparently in the area of Kirkham’s Bridge. Another RCMP in the bridge area sees the light 10 minutes later, apparently 220–300 feet above the ground. One officer attempts to close with the light unsuccessfully until he is 3 miles southeast of Hamiota. It flashes red and disappears at 12:15 a.m. (Patrick Gross, “[Files Obtained from the National Archives of Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/offica02.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015778570&usg=AOvVaw25gP7eWrwvxpF9PQqSib--)”)

July — 2:00 a.m. Margareta Ivanciov is walking from the train station in Teremia Mare, Romania, when she sees a bright yellow-orange globe nearly 2 feet in diameter floating about 90 feet in front of her and 7 feet above the pavement. It speeds up when she approaches it, keeping the same distance. She notices that it is composed of thousands of bright dots emanating the same color light. It disappears around a corner, anticipating her route, and follows her home, where it hovers briefly before moving into a neighbor’s yard. (Romania 41–42)

July — 9:30 p.m. A family of four is driving home along the Tasman Highway near Hobart Airport, Cambridge, Tasmania. The interior of the car becomes hot, the engine stalls, and they roll to a stop. Although there is no smell in the air, the family feels that they can taste something like gasoline. Then they see an object hovering above the road ahead of them. It seems 650–980 feet distant and 65 feet in the air. It looks round, is colored a metallic grayish-white, and has its own irridescence or glow. The diameter is close to the width of the road, perhaps 16 feet. They stare at the object for 2 minutes. Suddenly, in a spiraling take-off, the object speeds away to the south. The husband is a car mechanic, and he finds nothing wrong with the car. He gets back in, starts the car, and they go home without further incident, although the object still is visible several more minutes as a diminishing light.

July 1 — Day. A Dutch couple on vacation snap a photo of the panoramic landscape of the Pyrenees mountains just after leaving El Pas de la Casa, Andorra. They have the roll developed in Calafell, Catalonia, Spain, and are surprised to see a strange, yellow-and-orange object in motion in the foreground and casting a distinct shadow.

Investigators from the Netherlands UFO group NOBOVO determine that the object is really a road sign photographed directly from their slow-moving vehicle (the speed of the car was estimated to be no more than 22 mph).

July 22 — 5:00 p.m. A young boy on holiday with his family in Wales wanders by himself to the top of Wylfa Hill, south of Machynlleth, Powys, Wales. At the top he sees an apparently landed object. About 40 feet wide, it is comprised of a 7-foot round base and surmounted by a clear plastic–like, hemispherical dome. Large round lights about 5 feet in diameter are spaced evenly around the base, about 7 of which are visible, shining in strange colors. Each seems to be recessed into the silvery, metallic base. Clearly seen within the dome is a 7-foot-tall, 15-foot-wide, metallic unit, Two “jelly-like” entities are seen next to it, one on each side. They are approximately 7 feet tall, a whitish-translucent color, amorphous, and constantly changing shape. Inside each entity are hundreds of 6-inch, white, disc-like forms, similar to doughnuts. When another of these entities floats toward the object, the boy flees the scene and unsuccessfully tries to persuade his father to take a look. Returning alone, the boy sees the object carrying the entities disappear by pulsing in and out and changing color rapidly to match those of the surrounding sky and grass. It then “merges” into them. Immediately afterward, the boy suffers acute shock and what a doctor diagnoses as hysterical blindness in one eye that persists for months.

It seems to be made of “some sort of metal, not unlike aluminum,” is dull gray in color, and resembles an inverted soup plate. The strange contraption is approximately 50 feet in diameter and appears to be suspended over the small village of Zwischbergen, Valais, Switzerland, some 328–1,640 feet away.

July 31 — 7:30 a.m. Farmer Danie van Graan goes to inspect his sheep enclosure at Loxton, Northern Cape, South Africa, and sees a silvery disc with prong-like legs. He approaches to within 15 feet of it. Through a large window he can see 4 people, one standing near a panel of flashing colored lights, the other three apparently looking at some device. The entities are about 5 feet tall, thin and pale, and are wearing whitish coveralls with hoods hanging down around their necks. They have fair-colored hair, slanted eyes, and sharp, pointed chins. They all suddenly look up at him, and van Graan hears a “tick” noise as a light beam hits him in the face. Ill and confused, he tries to avoid the beam. His nose bleeds and he starts vomiting. The humming increases to a sharp whine, and the object takes off at a sharp angle. Later investigation reveals 4 marks on the outside perimeter of a circle 30 feet in diameter impressed in the ground, with crisscrossed central markings. A deposit of small, green granules is found near the center; analysis shows this to be carbon dust, grit, shale with feldspar inclusions, and thaumasite. Nothing grows in the affected area later.

Late July or early August — 9:00 p.m. A married couple and their small son are driving in the country near Pittsburg, Kansas, when the wife notices an object moving quickly toward them. It comes across the highway at about telephone pole height. The object is round and glowing intensely, with even more intense, small panels inset all around it. It is as wide as the highway and remains hovering. The man pulls the car over and the UFO begins to pull away. They continue following it, but the object changes its motion frequently. Finally it picks up speed and blinks out. (Michael D. Swords, “Unusual Experiences from the Timmerman Files,” IUR 27, no. 2 (Summer 2002): 21–22)

August 13 — 1:15 a.m. Sgt. Charles L. Moody, stationed at Holloman AFB, is out in the desert near Alamogordo, New Mexico, awaiting a meteor shower. He sees a metallic disc drop from the sky some 300 feet in front of him. It is about 50 feet long, 20 feet wide, and faintly luminous. It stops descending at 20 feet altitude and begins approaching Moody. Uneasy, he gets in his car and turns the ignition on, but the engine is dead. Moody can see an oblong window in the UFO and shadow figures moving within. He hears a high-pitched sound like a dental drill for a short time, then he feels numb. The next thing he knows, the UFO is ascending and disappears from sight within seconds.

Suddenly, air traffic controller Joe Savage sees flashing lights closing in on him in a collision course. When he advises Riddle to take evasive action, the object turns orange and shoots up to 5,000 feet, where it hovers. Riddle looks behind him and sees another light trailing him a mile or so away. When he swings around, he sees it shimmering like a diamond and as big as a jetliner. Two blue beams come out from the sides.

August 20 — Evening. Police stations in the area of Albany, New York, receive numerous calls about UFO sightings. State Trooper Michael Morgan is dispatched to the scene of one of the sightings, where a police detective is observing a blimp-sized object hovering at 500 feet over Lake Saratoga. As the reddish, glowing UFO flashes on and off, two smaller objects approach and merge with it. Air traffic controllers at Albany Airport locate the object on a radar scanner. After a few minutes, the two smaller objects break away and leave in the direction from which they had come. The first object moves toward the two policemen who see a brilliant white light shining from the center of its base as it passes over them. Silently, the craft turns and moves away slowly. Suddenly, the UFO disappears. After tracking the target for 45 minutes, the radar operators lose contact with it. However, within a

short time, they receive a call from the pilot of a military airplane who warns them that he has just seen a red fireball 1,000 feet above him headed toward the airport. The controllers locate the object just as it enters the 50- mile range of one of their radarscopes. The anti-clutter device is thrown to ascertain whether or not the blip is a radar angel, but the image still comes through clearly. The controllers estimate its speed to be 3,000 mph. About five miles outside Albany, the target vanishes. The controllers speculate that it has either accelerated to a speed of 5,000 mph or has executed a seemingly impossible vertical maneuver at high speed. During the same time as the Albany sightings, large discs and bright lights are seen at low altitude less than 50 miles north over the South Glens Falls area and as far north as Lake George.

August 26 — 3:15 a.m. Terry O’Leary, his girlfriend Jackie Larson, and Jackie’s mother Sandy Larson leave Fargo, North Dakota for Bismarck, which they plan to reach around 7:00 a.m. Forty-five miles into their trip on Interstate 94, they see a brilliant flash of light and sounds like thunder. About 50 yards away on their left, they watch 8–10 orange, glowing objects heading south to east. One is distinctly larger than the others. The lights descend in a straight line at a 30° angle until they stop over a grove of trees. Suddenly one of the objects splits in half and others shoot away. At this point, the witnesses feel peculiar sensations of being unable to move. Jackie finds herself sitting in the back seat (she had been in the front seat with the others) and the lights are gone. The witnesses drive on to Tower City, North Dakota, where Sandy notes the time is 5:23 a.m., an hour later than it should have been.

Sprinkle conducts three hypnotic sessions with Sandy and Jackie Larson on December 4–6. Sandy remembers a 6-foot-tall entity that looks like a mummy, various medical procedures, and a journey to a place with sand. She has further regressions with Sprinkle in January and February 1976, and she describes an otherworldly journey with three beings on a UFO. Clark writes: “What makes the Larson story interesting, in retrospect, however, is its anticipation of many abduction motifs which, though barely noted or entirely unknown in 1975, had become repeatedly demonstrated aspects of the experience by the late 1980s.

He is flying at 3,500 feet and is already on the landing approach to Jerez, when he receives a call from the Seville air traffic center asking him if he can see any aircraft over Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Cádiz, where they have a radar target.

The crew is seeing a “round light, brilliant red in color and with yellowish edges” in the area, so they are ordered to get closer. When they are 4–5 miles from Sanlúcar, the red ball ascends vertically from 1,000 feet to some 10,000–20,000 feet. Numerous residents of Sanlúcar also see the object from cafes. An F-5A fighter is scrambled from Morón Air Base in Seville province, which also spotted the object, and the Grumman returns to Jerez after viewing the light for an estimated 45 minutes. (Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, “Spanish Military UFO Encounter,” IUR 28, no. 1 (Spring 2003): 7–9)

September 3 — 8:00 p.m. Three witnesses in Tujunga, California, see two helicopters following a UFO. The top of the object is a vibrant blue green, the middle portion white, and the bottom part red. It appears to change to a saucer shape and zigzags around the sky. Shortly before 11:00 p.m., the witnesses see the lights go on at a nearby Nike missile base in the mountains. Afterward, the witnesses’ eyes turn red and painful.

Fall — A married couple and the husband’s business partner purchase an abandoned ranch property in a remote rural area of western Colorado, hoping to turn it into a working cattle ranch.

Fall — Evening. Two soldiers of a Chinese People’s Liberation Army unit stationed in Jianshui County, Yunnan, China, encounter a huge saucer-shaped object circling above their heads and emitting beams of soft orange-colored light. One of the men runs into the camp to sound an alarm, while the other stays to watch it. A few minutes later, the camp commandant and about a dozen armed men run up to the barracks entrance and find no trace of the soldier who had stayed behind. The commandant orders all officers and enlisted men to search, but they do not find him. A few hours later, four soldiers taking over sentry duty suddenly hear the sound of someone moaning behind them. They see the missing man, who has reappeared. His eyebrows, beard, and hair have grown extremely long. When he fully regains consciousness, his memory is completely gone. His wristwatch shows that it had stopped long ago. His weapons and watch are found to be slightly magnetized.

Fall — 4:00 a.m. A couple driving east toward Toppenish, Washington, see a bright white light that appears overhead and slightly ahead of them. At first they think it might be a helicopter with a searchlight, but then an area about one mile in diameter lights up around their car, their radio becomes noisy, and their headlights dim. The flood-lit area suddenly goes out and the light speeds up in the sky and disappears. When they reach Ahtanum, Washington, about 25 miles from the first incident, the bright light again appears overhead briefly, then streaks away and disappears. (W. J.

October 7 — 8:00 p.m. After his sister calls and alerts him to a “fiery glow” near his barn on Three Mile Lake Road north of Bracebridge, Ontario, Robert Suffern, 27, drives to the spot and finds no fire. However, when he starts going back to his sister’s house he finds a large disc-shaped object resting in his path. The UFO quickly ascends and is lost to sight. When he turns around and starts heading to his own home, a small figure wearing a helmet and silver-gray walks in an “ape-like fashion” in front of his car, causing him to hit the brakes. It runs into a field.

Suffern gets out and puts his hands on a post and he seemingly becomes weightless, making it easy to jump over the fence. Later that night he sees an “orange fluorescent light” in the pasture of his property. Moments later, he receives two phone calls telling him not to interfere. On October 12 at 3:00 a.m. Suffern receives a phone call from a “Lt. Colin Hunter” from the White House and leaves a number to call him back. He calls the number later and talks to a military officer claiming to be Lt. Col. Waters. A month later, he and his wife are given a thorough examination by Canadian military doctors.

October 18 — 12:30 a.m. John Struble is driving his truck 25 miles northwest of Helena, Montana, when he notices a large object, 50 feet in diameter and 25–30 feet in the air. The object passes over his truck from the rear and then stops and hovers about 300 feet ahead of him. It directs a very bright light at him, causing the truck’s lights and engine to go out. The UFO remains for about 5 minutes before it moves away. The object makes a noise like a big jet and then rockets straight up into the sky and moves away to the east at an incredible speed. When the UFO disappears the truck’s lights and engine come back on. Struble notices that his nonelectric watch has stopped for 5 minutes, the duration of the sighting.

Late October — 2:45 a.m. James D. Appleman of Bensalem, Pennsylvania, sees two large condensation trails making a giant X just above the moon. For several nights he has been noticing two unusual stars forming different shapes, and he thinks this might be related. He grabs his camera and takes three black-and-white photos. Two of the photos show two irregular light blobs, which he does not remember seeing when he exposed the film. In 1980, he sends a copy of the photos to the Center for UFO Studies because they resemble the lights in two undated photos taken from an airplane by J.

Late October — Near 12:00 midnight. An incident occurs near Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, the home of the National Combat Operations Center, that triggers a Security Option 5 Alert. According to an informant at the center interviewed by [Francis Ridge](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/whoswho/ridge.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015805070&usg=AOvVaw0pGePf4MDAEZ1XkQG-5tbd)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/whoswho/ridge.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015805238&usg=AOvVaw0lqlljIZfOBN307dtmdkSR) nobody is allowed to enter the base, except cleared, high-ranking officers or cleared security patrols. No one is to leave. Those personnel on base who have just completed duty are rolled out of bed. Jet interceptors are scrambled. Unidentified targets are tracked on radar for at least 20 minutes. In fact, everything they put in the air for an attack on the US is airborne. The base stays on alert through 6:00 a.m. (NICAP, “[Security Option 5 Alert at NORAD](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nicap.org/7510XXnorad_dir.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015805468&usg=AOvVaw38HIw9Uw4UpFit2YnRSQ8y)”)

October 27 — 3:00 a.m. Factory workers David Stephens and Glen Gray are sitting in a trailer they share in Norway, Maine, when they hear something explode outside. Briefly puzzled, they decide to go for a drive to nearby Thompson Lake. A short distance down the road, their vehicle abruptly turns onto a back road leading into Oxford, Maine. Gray no longer has control of the steering. Two minutes later, they pass through Oxford, a trip that normally takes 10 minutes, and down the eastern side of Thompson Lake. A mile south of Oxford, they see a herd of cows resting on the ground and shaking their heads from side to side. A few seconds later, they see two white lights on their left in a cornfield. The lights suddenly rise into the air. Gray stops the car, rolls down the windows and listen for the sounds of an engine, but the lights are soundless. Now they have a good view of a huge, cylinder-shaped object 20–30 feet away. Around its body are green, blue, and yellow lights that suddenly go out when the object ascends above a row of trees. Gray starts the car and roars down the road, followed by the UFO. The next thing they know, they are a mile farther down the road, the car stopped. Their eyes feel like they are on fire and appear orange. The UFO is visible in the eastern sky. They drive into West Poland, Maine, turn around, and go back the way they came. After a few minutes the UFO disappears, and they decide to go south again. For no reason, Gray turns onto a gravel road leading to Tripp Pond, where the engine stalls and the radio goes out. They can see the cylinder-shaped UFO in the sky about 500 feet away, which moves farther away as soon as they notice it. Some 45 minutes later, two disc-shaped objects with colored lights appear, and a thick fog rises out of Tripp Pond, engulfing the car. The radio abruptly turns on, and as they drive further, they receive a mental impression indicating that “We’re not done with you yet. We are coming back for you.” It is now 6:30

a.m. At 7:00 a.m., they arrive at Stephens’s parents’ house in Oxford, suffering from burning eyes, sore throats, and aching teeth. They are not speaking coherently. Gray has some hallucinations later in the day while watching TV.

He conducts eight hypnosis sessions between December 1975 and March 1976. Gray becomes upset early in the investigation, so only Stephens’s testimony is complete.

It has a red navigation light and a white strobe light. The craft enters the perimeter

of the base. In the control tower, S/Sgt. [James P. Sampley](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/208914490/james-paul-sampley&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015809551&usg=AOvVaw0Nz6u3qNgCqCjUddW1xGyb) of the 2192nd Communications Squadron is on radar duty and gets a return from an unknown target 10–13 miles east-northeast of Loring. Sampley makes numerous attempts by radio on all available communications bands, civilian and military, to contact the craft, but he gets no response. The unidentified craft circles and comes within 300 yards of the restricted nuclear storage area at a low altitude of 150 feet. Back at the weapons dump, Lewis notifies his Command Post at the 42 Bomb Wing that an unknown aircraft has penetrated the base perimeter. The base is immediately put on major alert status, a Security Option 3, and Security contacts the tower. (ClearIntent, [pp. 16–26](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/clearintentgover00fawc/page/16/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015809858&usg=AOvVaw0uYBYAs5qfBUieFmM38j3p); Nukes 361–363, 369–371)

October 27 — 8:45 p.m. Sgt. Grover K. Eggleston of the 2192nd Communications Squadron is on duty at the Loring AFB \[now Loring International Airport\] tower near Limestone, Maine, when the call from the Command Post comes in. He observes the unknown target. Six minutes later, Eggleston notes that the target appears to be circling approximately 10 miles east-northeast of the base. This action lasts for 40 minutes when, suddenly, it disappears from the screen. Either the object has landed or it has dropped below the radar coverage. The Wing Commander arrives at the weapons storage area 7 minutes after the initial sighting. Immediately other units of the 42nd Police begin pouring into the area. Security vehicles with blue flashing lights are converging from all over the base.

Through the Loring Command Post, the Wing Commander requests fighter coverage from the 21st NORAD Region at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base, Syracuse, New York, and the 22nd NORAD Region at North Bay, Ontario. However, fighter support is denied by both regions. The Wing Commander then increases local security posture and requests assistance from the Maine State Police in trying to identify the unknown craft, which they presume is a helicopter. They make a call to local flight services for possible identification, without results. The 42nd Security Police conduct a sweep of the weapons storage perimeter inside and out. An additional sweep is made of the areas that the craft has flown over. All actions produce no results. The craft breaks the circling pattern and begins flying toward Grand Falls, New Brunswick. Radar contact is lost in the vicinity of Grand Falls, 12 miles from Loring. Canadian authorities are not notified.

Blakeslee and Sgt. William J. Long, again spots the lights of an unidentified aircraft approaching Loring AFB near Limestone, Maine, from the north at an altitude of about 3,000 feet. It approaches to within about 3 miles of the base perimeter and is seen to have a flashing white light and an amber or orange light. Lewis reports the sighting to his Command Post, and the Wing Commander comes out to the weapons storage area to see for himself. He reports seeing an object whose speed and motion are similar to that of a helicopter. The craft is also observed on radar and observed over the flight line by Sgt. Steven Eichner, Sgt. R. Jones, and others. They see an orange and red object shaped like a stretched-out football hovering in mid-air. It turns out its lights and then reappears making jerky motions, then hovers about 150 feet over the end of the runway. It is about four car- lengths long, solid, reddish-orange, with no doors or windows, and with no visible propellers or engines. It is completely silent. The base goes on full alert and a sweep is made by security, but the object turns off its lights and is not seen again. Radar picks up a target moving in the direction of Grand Falls, New Brunswick. SAC Headquarters is again notified. ()

October 29 — 1:00 a.m. Another unidentified helicopter is seen near the weapons storage area at Loring AFB, Maine. October 29 or 30 — 4:00 p.m. A radar-visual UFO sighting takes place at Wurtsmith AFB \[now Oscoda-Wurtsmith

Early November — 8:00–9:00 p.m. Bill Jackson, a reporter for the Sterling (Colo.) Advocate, his wife Cheryl, and their young child are driving on State Highway 61 halfway between Otis and Sterling, Colorado, when they see a red light in the sky ahead of them. As it approaches, they see it is a huge object (as big as a 747) with a dozen rows of multicolored lights, perhaps hundreds of them. It passes slowly over their car, so close that Jackson thinks he can hit it with a stone. They drive at high speed the rest of the way to Sterling.

November 2 — Night. Witnesses in Medford, Minnesota, including Helen Kay, see a brilliant orange-red light go behind a building, where they suspect it has landed. At the location, they find a bare spot, 12 feet square, of burned grass and ashy residue. At some distance away they see a red ball of light above the trees and try to catch up with it by car but it eludes them. Soil samples from the alleged landing site are submitted to geologist [Edward J.

November 3 — 5:45 a.m. Ontario Police constables in Haileybury, Ontario, see a round object with fingers of white light emanating from it hovering northeast of town. Another object to the north of it has red, green, and white lights. After about 1 hour both objects begin moving slowly south and gaining altitude. They are still visible at 7:00 a.m. (Patrick Gross, “[Files Obtained from the National Archives of Canada](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/offica03.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015814284&usg=AOvVaw3r9m34Btd9SbAh3exsIEEP)”)

November 5 — 12:30 a.m. Jim Divall is driving north of Redwater, Alberta, when he comes upon a large, black, revolving object in the road ahead. He has to drive his vehicle into a ditch to avoid hitting it. The object is 40 feet in diameter. He gets out to watch it for a few minutes as it makes a rushing sound, then it disappears.

November 5 — Just after 6:00 p.m. [Travis Walton](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ufocongress.com/travis-walton/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015815053&usg=AOvVaw3dpKmmPUcaGd95uhlBGoG4) and six fellow log cutters finish a long day of thinning undergrowth in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest near Snowflake, Arizona. Heading up Mogollon Rim Road, Walton soon notices something shining among the branches off to the right. The others see it too. They turn up Old Verde Road toward Turkey Springs. The spaces between the trees flash by too quickly to make out what the object is, but a clearing reveals a yellowish glow that washes across the road in front of them. The driver speeds up to get a closer look. They reach the clearing, and about 110 feet away a glowing disc hangs in the air, making a high- pitched buzz and floating motionless between the trees, only 15 feet off the ground. The truck slams to a halt and Walton opens his door to get a better look. There is no sound. One of the cutters shouts: “My God! It’s a flying saucer!” Walton then steps out of the cab and walks toward the object. The others beg him to get back in the truck, but he feels compelled to get a close-up look. He approaches the craft cautiously, glancing back to the truck now and then as his friends continue to plead with him. Coming within 6 feet, Walton stops and stares up at its glowing underside. Suddenly, the silence gives way to what Walton later describes as the thunderous swell of a turbine engine. A narrow beam of light fires from the bottom of the disc and strikes Walton in the chest. It lifts him up, then knocks him unconscious to the ground like a thunderbolt. In a panic, the rest of the crew speeds away toward the main road, terrified. When the men regain their senses, they return to the clearing to rescue Walton, but the craft is gone and so is Walton. Despite a thorough search of the area, they find no trace of him and drive home. When they report what happened, the authorities discount the men’s tale as a ridiculous attempt to cover up a murder and launch an extensive search for Walton’s body. They search for several days and find nothing. Walton reappears outside Heber, Arizona, on November 10 and corroborates their story, with the addition of what happened aboard the spacecraft. Walton awakes in a hospital-like room, observed by three short, bald creatures. He fights with them until a human wearing a helmet leads him to another room, where he blacks out as three other humans put a clear plastic mask over his face. He remembers nothing else until he finds himself walking along a highway, with the UFO departing above him. In the days following, The National Enquirer awards Walton and his coworkers a $5,000 prize for “best UFO case of the year” after they pass polygraph

tests administered by Cy Gilson of the Arizona state police (repeated in 1993), the Enquirer, and APRO. A private investigator named John McCarthy tests Walton using an outdated procedure with a polygraph in 1975

November 7 — 3:00 p.m.–November 8, 9:53 p.m. Remote electronic sensors trigger an alarm at Malmstrom AFB, Great Falls, Montana, indicating that something is violating security at several missile launch sites. Underground, in the launch control facility, two officers note the signal, but there is no TV surveillance topside. A missile security helicopter checks the area and Sabotage Alert Teams consisting of 4–6 men are ordered to proceed to the areas. One SAT team drives down the highway and onto a dirt road that leads to the K-7 area near Judith Gap, Montana. About a mile away, the team sees an orange, glowing object. As they close to within half a mile, they can see that the object is tremendous in size. They radio to the launch control facility that, from their location, they are viewing a brightly glowing, orange, football field-sized disc that illuminates the missile site. The SAT team is ordered to proceed into the K-7 site. However, they refuse to go any farther, clearly fearful of the intimidating appearance of the object. It begins to rise, and at about 1,000 feet, NORAD picks up the UFO on radar. Two F- 106 jet interceptors are launched from Great Falls and head toward the K-7 site. The UFO continues to rise. At about 200,000 feet, it disappears from NORAD’s radar. The F-106s are never able to get a clear sighting of the several UFOs, which play cat-and-mouse with the aircraft, extinguishing their illumination when they approach, and re-illuminating after the fighters return to base. All members of the SAT team are directed to the base hospital, where they are psychologically tested. No one can identify the object, but the members of the SAT team obviously have been through a traumatic experience. Targeting teams, along with computer specialists, are brought to the launch site to examine the missile and the computer in the warhead. When the computer is checked, they find that the tape has mysteriously changed target numbers. The reentry vehicle is then taken from the silo and brought back to the base. Eventually the entire missile is changed out. Radar and visual sightings continue for the next 31 hours.

November 11 — A Montana Fish and Game Department employee at Freezeout Lake, Montana, sees a light flying directly behind a B-52 bomber. Using his rifle scope to get a better look, he notes that the strange object seems to be pacing the aircraft. The object then briefly attaches itself to the B-52, detaches, and climbs out of sight. The sighting is reported to Sheriff Pete Howard of Choteau County. Howard conducts follow-up interviews with military personnel and learns that as the object attaches itself to the B-52, the plane’s radar equipment goes out.

November 11 — A confidential NORAD communication reveals that Air Guard helicopters, Strategic Air Command helicopters, and NORAD F-106s are scrambled during the recent UFO sightings over Northern Tier military bases. They fail to produce positive identifications. In a priority message sent from SAC headquarters in Offutt AFB near Bellevue, Nebraska, to numerous Air Force bases during the same month, the Air Force reveals its continuation of a policy to deny USAF interest in the subject: “News media queries concerning such unidentified overflights are properly the concern of the Air Defense Command, and queries should be referred to CINC- NORAD/OI… Remarks should be confined to personal experiences and care should be taken to avoid speculation or to imply Air Force interest beyond security of the installation.” (Margaret Sachs, The UFO Encyclopedia,

November 17 — 7:00 p.m. Suzanne Erenberger and Dave Vardeman are driving on US Highway 30 about one-quarter mile west of Mount Vernon, Iowa, when they see white lights in the southwestern sky. They stop the car and get out to watch for a while. Frightened, they drive into town to notify the police. The police chief describes Erenberger as “terrified, nearly hysterical.” An officer accompanies the two students back to the location but sees nothing unusual. Erenberger tells a reporter from the Cedar Rapids Gazette that they were only 30 feet away from one of the lights, which was only 25 feet off the ground. She makes a drawing of a domed object for a high-school newspaper. UFO investigator [Kevin D.

November 30 — Unit One of the Leningrad \[now St. Petersburg\], Russia, nuclear power plant is being brought back online after scheduled maintenance when it begins to run out of control. A partial meltdown occurs, destroying or damaging 32 fuel assemblies and releasing radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. The official line is that a manufacturing defect caused the destruction of only one fuel channel, but the accident is really caused by an uncontrollable increase in the steam void coefficient.

December 12 — Robert Suffern and his wife meet with two military officers, one Canadian, the other American, at his home near Bracebridge, Ontario. They tell him the October 7 incident was a “mistake” caused by the malfunctioning of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The officers show him close-up photos of UFOs and say that their governments have been cooperating with aliens since 1943. (Clark III 358)

December 14 — Late evening. A man is driving his truck on a gravel road along Toppenish Ridge in the Yakama Indian Reservation in Washington State when he sees a cow and two calves running toward him as if fleeing from something. Moments later he sees three figures in the ditch. One jumps up on the road, covering 15 feet in a single slow-motion leap, its arms above its head. The witness describes it as a skinny, 7-foot-tall man with a narrow, pale face and long, pointed nose. It is dressed in close-fitting black clothing and boots. On its chest there is a white trapezoid insignia. The entity is carrying something purple it its left hand that has a wire on it that runs down its arm. The other two creatures remain on the side of the road. The witness speeds up, swerving around the figure. A few moments later, a bright, elongated UFO appears behind him. The interior of the truck is flooded with light. Suddenly he becomes aware of a “shadow” in the passenger seat. From the shape of the head and coat, the man “knows” it is a friend of his. The friend looks at him, leans forward and looks up at the light, falls back, wipes his eyes, and vanishes. At that moment, the light disappears. The next morning, he learns that his friend has been killed in a shooting. (Greg Long, Examining the Earthlight Theory: The Yakima UFO Microcosm, CUFOS, 1990, pp. 56–60; Clark III 281)

1976 — 9:30 p.m. A man who lives on a hill overlooking the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, notices lights hovering above the building at the south end of the plant. Suddenly the lights shoot straight up in the air and move to the north end of the plant, dropping down and hovering again. It then makes a quick arc and hovers about 900 feet above the witness’s house. The object is circular with a curved low top, sides that slope inward, silent, and a continuous row of windows separated every 10–15 feet by thin vertical supports. A yellow or amber light is at the top. It is about 50 feet in diameter and 12–15 feet high. He can see 3–4 images moving back and forth inside the craft.

January 4 — A technician driving home is stuck in rush hour traffic at Sale, heading toward Altrincham, Cheshire, England. Suddenly his radio begins to hiss and crackle, and flashes of light spark out, dancing across the windshield. As he looks out through the steady rain, two angular, ice-blue lights pass slowly across his field of view. Moments later they are gone, the sparking stops, and the radio works again.

January 6 — 11:15 p.m. Mona Stafford and two friends, Louise Smith and Elaine Thomas, are driving southwest on Highway 78 between Stanford and Hustonville, Kentucky, when they see an intense red glow in the east. It grows larger, then descends rapidly to the right of the car at tree-top level. As it hovers, they can see a disc shape with round windows with rotating, blinking red lights around each of them; yellow lights stretch below these, and a luminous blue dome is on top of the object. The UFO moves closer, flips on its side, and shines three beams of bluish-white light on the road, and another into their vehicle. Smith, apparently dazed, gets out of the car, but Stafford pulls her back in. There is a “dead silence,” their skin tingles, and they start getting severe headaches.

They find the car has started back up on its own and is moving at 85 mph with no help from Smith. Stafford feels

January 21 — Before 3:55 a.m. Security police see two UFOs near the flight line at Cannon AFB, southwest of Clovis, New Mexico. The objects are 75 feet in diameter, gold or silver in color, with a blue light on top, a hole in the middle, and a red light on the bottom. An Air Force officer calls the UFO Education Center in Wisconsin to report he “had a very close sighting and was able to witness a type of vehicle that did maneuver and that was unlike any type aircraft he has ever seen.” One observer claims to see a dozen UFOs through a Starlight Scope from the flight tower. A Clovis policeman sees a cigar-shaped object with pulsating red, white, and blue lights.

February — Night. A married couple living near the Tasman Highway in Tasmania have retired for the evening. The woman is already asleep and the man has just turned off the light when he sees three 7–8 feet tall entities passing through the closed door of the bedroom. One touches the man’s leg and he goes numb to the waist. He lets them attach some kind of glowing sack to his body, but when they start to approach his wife, he lashes out with one arm that hasn’t gone numb. His wife wakes up and starts struggling too. The entities exit through some kind of orange portal outside the closed window and disappear. (Michael D. Swords, “A Trick of the Light,” IUR 31, no. 2 (June 2007): 11)

Late February — 1:00 a.m. A man in Kettering, Tasmania, is awake tending to a child when he looks outside to his east and sees what he thinks is an aircraft descending at 45°. After watching for a couple of minutes, he goes outside. The object comes down behind a small bank on the far side of a sports field opposite his house. He crosses the field, climbs the bank, and sees from about 82 feet away, a dome-shaped object emitting a bright-white to yellow light from three or four windows. When he looks through the object’s windows he can see a tall cylinder (that he likens to a ship’s compass mounting), motionless gray shapes (like car seats with headrests seen from the rear), and perhaps entities. He hears a humming noise. The object takes off to the east with the noise increasing in volume. It climbs away at 60° and recedes to a point source and disappears. The total duration is 6–7 minutes. The next day he returns to the spot and notes the rough grass beyond the sports field has been scorched in a circular patch. This grass later dies. On October 24, 1977, the Tasmanian UFO Information Centre takes soil samples of

Claude Bosc, a student pilot flying a French Air Force T-33 on a training mission at 19,500 feet, sees a rapidly approaching bright light in the distance near Tours, Indre-et-Loire, France. In 1–2 seconds, the object speeds toward him and his plane is surrounded by a green phosphorescent light that illuminates the aircraft for several seconds.

March 22 — 5:42 a.m. A couple are stopped in their car outside a hotel in Nemingha, New South Wales, deciding on directions. Suddenly a bright, greenish-yellow light descends and completely envelops a nearby white car, which drifts to the wrong side of the road, wrapped in a thick ball of white haze. Its headlights go out. After 2 minutes the haze dissipates, and a woman gets out of the car and wipes a white substance off the windshield with a yellow cloth. She is about to get back in when its lights come back on by themselves. She throws the cloth on the roadside, drives a short way, and the yellow cloth bursts into flame.

April 2 — 1:50 a.m. Detective Sgt. Norman Collinson is driving home along the M62 and M66 motorways near Bury, Greater Manchester, England. As he turns north onto the M66 he observes a white disc of light moving very fast, crossing the path he is traveling. The object is heading toward Knoll Hill, east of Bury. The UFO makes a right- angle turn onto a south-southeast heading. Puzzled, the officer stops his vehicle and gets out to look at the light. As he does so, the light stops and hovers nearby. It then begins to perform a series of spectacular right-angle box turns, after which it moves off in the direction of Heywood, with Collinson following it in his car. The object stops a second time and again repeats the angular movements before streaking away at a tremendous speed. The

April 3 — 4:30 a.m. Several residents of Quixadá, Ceará, Brazil, during an outdoor physical education session, see a large disc-shaped object that glides silently a few feet from the ground emitting an intense light. At about the same time in another part of the city, Luis Barroso Fernandes is preparing to travel to a site a few kilometers away on his donkey cart. He soon hears a buzzing sound, and a flying object 10 feet in diameter positions itself above him. It slowly descends in front of his cart about 100 feet away. The device emits a beam of light that strikes the donkey and Barroso, who immediately become paralyzed. A door opens on the UFO and two small beings emerge. One holds something like a flashlight and aims a beam that strikes Barroso in the face, causing him to lose consciousness. He wakes up in a different spot, dizzy and suffering from a burning sensation on his face, and a headache. The left side of his body is reddish, and he has difficulty getting into his cart and getting it moving. He asks his wife to take him to Dr. Antônio Moreira Magalhães, who prescribes a tranquilizer. He continues to feel sick, his eyes burn continuously, and the left side of his body is red. A few days later, his hair turns gray and he suffers memory lapses. After his symptoms worsen and other doctors fail to help, his family checks him into a psychiatric hospital in Fortaleza. His condition deteriorates, and he dies in April 1993.

April 14 — A heavily redacted CIA memo shows a reference to someone’s having sought “guidance from CIA UFO experts as to material in his report that should remain classified.” (ClearIntent, [p. 143](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/details/clearintentgover00fawc/page/142/mode/2up&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015853931&usg=AOvVaw1R8z70uFPg-U-MLjyRfbyD))

April 17 — June and Vicky Melling, on vacation in Mawnan, Cornwall, England, see a large winged creature hovering above the tower of St. Mawnan and St. Stephen’s Church. They are so frightened by the sight of a large “feathered bird-man” that their father Dan Melling cuts short the vacation.

Medway notes that witnesses claiming encounters with the legendary monster “were either Doc Shiels, or friends of Doc Shiels, or relatives of Doc Shiels, or reported their sightings to Doc Shiels (and to no one else), or else wrote letters describing what they had seen to newspapers and were never interviewed by anyone.” (Wikipedia, “[Owlman](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owlman&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015855514&usg=AOvVaw3X4R_i-cxydAo3kjFU8bh5)”; Robert J.

April 22 — 1:45 a.m. RCMP Constable Bill Toffan sees an apparent vehicle with its lights flashing ahead of him as he is driving on Canada Highway 16 west of Terrace, British Columbia. As he rounds a curve, he sees it is actually in the air 300 feet above the trees. Suddenly there is a blinding flash and he nearly loses control of his car.

April 22 — 11:00 p.m. Police officer George Wheeler, on duty at Elmwood, Wisconsin, notices a glow at the top of Tuttle Hill. He drives closer and sees an object as high as a two-story house and 250 feet across with an orange-white light at the top and six bluish-white lights on the side. It is 500 feet away and about 100 feet off the ground. He thinks he can see, though an open side panel, something moving inside it. The object has several partially extended legs and a long, black, hose-like appendage. Suddenly the object rises straight up. He sees some kind of flash and his car lights go out, the motor stops, the radio goes dead, and he becomes dazed. A second police car arrives, noticing that the car door is open, and takes the witness to a hospital, from which he is released four days later. Some people in the area have difficulty with TV reception at the same time as the encounter.

April 23 — 2:40 a.m. A 1st Lt. is on communications duty aboard a US Navy destroyer in the Atlantic southwest of Bermuda. The lookout calls his attention to a green light dead ahead through light fog three miles away at 10° above the horizon. Radar reports no target and the sonar room hears no engines. The crew watches the green light dip to 30–40 feet above the surface and approach the ship. The lieutenant orders a course change to starboard, and the green light becomes much larger, making a comparable turn to port in order to pace the ship. The ship and the object both make subsequent turns, with the light now only 50-60 feet away. Suddenly a large blip appears on the radar scope. The destroyer returns to its original heading and the light stations itself on the port beam. When the captain comes on deck, the light circles the ship twice. Then once again off to port, it becomes a brighter green, tilts at an angle, and submerges. The next day the captain tells the crew not to discuss the incident. (Donald R.

June 11 — 1:15 a.m. Hélène Guiliana is driving through Chatuzange-le-Goubet, Drôme, France, when her car engine misfires and stalls and the headlights go out. Some 80 feet away near the Pont du Martinet bridge she sees an orange light in the form of a “dome.” She experiences fear and covers her face with her hands. After what seems a few seconds, the light disappears. Driving home upset and afraid, she misses a familiar sign and drives a mile out of her way. When she arrives home, it is 4:00 a.m. Under hypnosis on July 22 (repeated on August 18), she tells of meeting two waist-high dwarves with large eyes, dressed in black overalls. They carry her toward the light, which she enters through an iron door. Inside a high, round room, they place her on a table, putting handcuffs on er hands and feet. After an examination, she is returned outside and the craft departs straight up noiselessly.

June 21 — 12:40 a.m. Police officer Th. Brandt-Jensen sees a bright, blue-white light cross the road behind him in Ringsted, Zealand, Denmark. He thinks it might be an airplane in trouble. He speeds up to 90 mph toward a crossroad where he can pull off the highway. The object catches up to within 165–250 feet and its light strikes his car, the engine and lights going out immediately. He guides the coasting vehicle to the road shoulder, gets out, and catches a glimpse of the object as it disappears behind the horizon. It resembles a glider with a ray of light coming from it that swings back and forth as it passes his car. It makes a slight whistling sound and appears to be about 50 feet long.

June 22 — 9:27 p.m. Dr. Don Francisco-Julio Padrón León and Santiago del Pino are traveling in a taxi when they see a gigantic ball of light 200 feet ahead of them between Gáldar and Agaete, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands. The taxi radio cuts out. Inside the light, which is actually like a transparent soap bubble, they see some panels and two enormous beings on a platform. The humanoids are some 9–10 feet tall, wear black diving helmets and red tight- fitting coveralls, and are moving levers about. Their hands are enclosed in black cones. The backs of their heads are disproportionately large, and their legs are short. The taxi driver switches the headlights on, and the UFO rises as a bluish gas is emitted from a tube and expands the size of the sphere to a 20-story building. The driver turns the car around and goes to a nearby house. The inhabitants say their TV set just blacked out. They continue watching through a window. When the sphere stops expanding, they hear a high-pitched whistle and the object speeds off to the northwest. (J. M.

June 23 — 11:30 p.m. Paulo Coutinho, 18, is returning home from a night class in Aricanduva, São Paulo, Brazil, when he sees a light in the sky moving westward. Suddenly he feels paralyzed as the light approaches and descends about 25 feet away. A short being emerges with a big head, large eyes, pointed ears, small mouth, and an upturned nose like a pig. It is bald, has no eyebrows, and wears a tight one-piece bluish-gray suit with an emblem on its chest. Coutinho rises into the air toward a huge cigar-shaped object, in which he undergoes an abduction experience. Coutinho is still missing the next morning. A friend finds his books and notebooks scattered on the street and brings them to his parents. A police search fails to find him. In the evening of June 24, Coutinho is discovered lying on the steps of the garden door in a semiconscious state. He is cold as if he has been there some time. He is later revived at a nearby hospital. The police officer who carries him to the ambulance later feels a strong irritation in his arms. Ballpoint pens in Coutinho’s pockets are radioactive.

There is an international exchange of data. Maybe when this group of nations acquires more precise and definite information, it will be possible to release the news to the world.” He says the Spanish Air Ministry investigates UFO cases, including those involving pilots. He admits that he has watched a UFO for more than an hour at his ranch. It remains stationery for that length of time, then shoots off towards Ejea de los Caballeros, Zaragoza, covering 12.5 miles in less than 2 seconds.

July 11 — Two Indian Air Force MiG 21 jets are scrambled near the Pakistani border to intercept what appears initially on radar to be a Pakistani jet. But the object is moving at 2,600 mph, and the two pilots see the target is an amber- colored disc that pulls away before they can catch up to it.

July 28 — 3:45 p.m. Adult counselor Ira Leifer and 13 teenage boys are resting from a hike in the woods at Camp Delaware \[now Greenwood Trails\] west of Winsted, Connecticut, when they hear a high-pitched whine. They see a silvery, flat-bottomed UFO 15–25 feet in diameter through a clearing in the trees. A purple haze surrounds it and on top they see a red glow. The object is hovering at a steep angle. After 15–25 seconds the whine returns, and the object takes off and is lost to sight in a second or two.

July 30 — 9:00 p.m. A British Airways Trident 2E piloted by Capt. Dennis Wood is flying at 29,000 feet over the North Atlantic about 40 miles south of Lisbon, Portugal, when air traffic control radios a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar that is flying near them and asks for a confirmation of a radar target. Wood and his crew look up and see a stationary bright light. They announce the sighting to their passengers. After several minutes watching the light, two cigar- shaped objects appear below and to the right of the light. A Portuguese airliner in the vicinity also observes the objects. Wood confirms the sighting, saying, “There is no way this is a star or planet.” Fighters are immediately scrambled from Lisbon.

August — Day. A man is working on his mobile home in the forested hills near Medford, Oregon, when he sees two intensely bright lights “like burning magnesium” silently move across the sky, side by side. They appear to be discs, curved on the top and flat on the bottom, and in between them is a third object, which seems to be a World War II–era bomber. The tips of each wing appear to be resting on the discs, and its propellors are not turning. The three objects pass overhead and move beyond the hill behind him. (Michael D. Swords, “Timmermania: A Step Too Far into the Timmerman Files?” IUR 27, no. 4 (Winter 2002–2003): 8)

August — A. Troitsky and six others observe a silvery disc over the Pirogovskoye Reservoir north of Moscow, Russia. It is about 8 times the apparent size of the full moon and is moving slowly at an altitude of perhaps 120 feet. The object has two revolving stripes along its side and a black hatch on its underside from which a small cylinder protrudes, its lower portion rotating.

August 6 — 10:00 a.m. A family is driving in Gaspésie National Park, Quebec, when a beam of red light penetrates the fog and creates a six-inch circle on the road ahead. The beam paces ahead of them for several miles, then collapses and withdraws upwards. A dazzling white light then approaches and stops ahead. Strong heat builds up in the car, so the father stops the vehicle. The headlights and radio fail, and the engine dies. All four get out and walk toward the object, which now appears as a scallop-shaped craft on landing legs, stretching across the road. The wife notices a massive “face” looking at them. Two 7-foot tall beings are apparently floating near the UFO, dressed in close-fitting, khaki-brown suits. The witnesses flee back into the car. The object moves away in a flash of light and burst of heat. The car starts again. All four suffer from itching for the next 10 hours.

August 10 — 5:00 a.m. Teresa de Tejero wakes up suddenly in her room at the Hotel Da Balaia in Albufeira, Portugal, and sees a vivid luminous rectangle on the window curtains. She wakes up her husband Francisco, who goes to the window and sees an object with six reddish lights that appears to be on another wing of the hotel. One of its lights seems to be directed straight into their bedroom. They go back to sleep. In the morning, Francisco looks out the window and finds there is no hotel wing where he thought the UFO was. He realizes that the object must have been huge to masquerade as two floors of the hotel.

August 11 — 11:00 p.m. Two boys aged 13 and 14 are standing on the beach in La Linea de Concepción, Spain, facing the Strait of Gibraltar when they see a yellowish-white UFO approaching from over the Mediterranean. It seems to have an axis that bisects it. The object climbs rapidly, changing color to whitish and then a vivid yellow. It approaches another, larger object and enters it. While they watch it, the light of a nearby lighthouse goes out temporarily. The larger object remains in place.

August 13 — 8:30 a.m. The pilot of a Piper Arrow PA-28 is flying at 3,500 feet between Diepholz and Petershagen, Germany, when he notices a strange light approaching from the northeast. After 3–5 minutes, the object comes closer and takes a fixed position off the left wing. The object is oval-shaped and very bright yellow in its center with an indistinct flame-orange boundary. Suddenly the Piper goes into two rapid 360° clockwise rolls from which the pilot must recover manually. He discovers that he has dropped about 500 feet during the roll-and- recovery maneuver. When he next checks his instrument panel, he discovers that his magnetic compass is spinning in a clockwise direction so fast that he can’t read the number in its square window. Looking outside again, he sees that the UFO is still behind him, suggesting that he has lost the same amount of altitude. The pilot climbs back to his cruise altitude and calls on the radio to flight control at Hannover airport. The air traffic controller tells him that the radar shows both his airplane and another object nearby. The controller says that an aircraft will be sent to investigate. Little more than 4 minutes later, two USAF F-4 Phantom jets arrive on either side of him travelling 400–500 mph. The jet on the right side is slightly lower, closer, and ahead of the jet on the left. The pilot is certain they are American planes. Just as the jets arrive, the UFO accelerates forward and then upward at about a 30° angle above the horizontal and turns right, passing in front of his aircraft. It quickly outdistances its pursuers and is out of sight in a matter of seconds. The compass eventually returns to normal operation after the UFO departs. The pilot is interrogated after his landing by “military men.” (Richard F. Haines, “An Aircraft/UFO Encounter over Germany in 1976,” IUR 24, no. 4 (Winter 1999): 3–6)

August 15 — 3:00 a.m. A distant bright light appears above El Real de la Jara, Seville, Spain, as 20 automobiles stop on the highway to watch it. Taxi driver Pablo Garcia García blinks his lights at it, and the object appears to approach much closer. García stops signaling, but the other drivers panic and drive away rapidly.

August 20 — Brothers Jim and Jack Weiner, with friends Charles Foltz and Charles Rak, claim they are abducted by aliens during a camping trip near Allagash, Maine. According to the four men, hypnotic regression allows them to recall being taken aboard a circular UFO and being “probed and tested by four-fingered beings with almond- shaped eyes and languid limbs.” In a later interview by the St. John Valley Times, Charles Rak changes his story, saying he did see strange lights during the camping trip, but the abduction part of the story is a total fabrication, and he went along with the narrative for financial gain. The other three members of the group stand by the abduction story. According to Jim Weiner, “Jack, Charlie, and I, after all these years, are still in agreement with

the Eagle Lake event as we (three) remember it. We also accept the results of the hypnotic regression sessions and subsequent polygraph tests as supportive of an abduction scenario.” (Raymond E.

Early September — Three men watch a dense white cloud hover low above Rua Cajati in São Paulo, Brazil. It dissipates, revealing a disc-shaped object that emits light beams of various colors. When policemen arrive and draw their weapons, they become paralyzed like statues. The smoke cloud reappears and envelops the disc, which takes off.

September 1 — 10:35 a.m. A witness is walking with her dog in a field off Larimer County Road 76H northwest of Larimer, Colorado. She looks up and sees a large (100 feet long), silver-colored, silent cylinder flying at about 50 mph to the south. It is only 200–250 feet in altitude and has two rings around it towards each end.

September 1 — Day. A retired science teacher watches a circular glowing object while walking on a beach near Aguada, Puerto Rico. The object moves slowly, hovers, then falls abruptly, tumbling over and over, until it nearly enters the ocean. It then rights itself and moves slowly westward. It has a dull gray finish and appears to be quite distant. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 1, no. 1 (November 1976): 2)

September 3 — Early morning. A witness in Bethel, Alaska, hears a high-pitched whine and looks out at the tundra where a small (2.5–3-inch diameter) white beach ball seems to be moving just above the ground. After a while it tilts so that she can see it is a disc with a rotating “platinum-shiny” area in the middle. The object arcs upward, then back down, and seems to disappear into the ground, whereupon the whine stops. She can find no ground markings. (Michael D. Swords, “Unusual Experiences from the Timmerman Files,” IUR 27, no. 2 (Summer 2002): 24)

September 3 — 7:00 p.m. Farm laborer João Romeu Klein, 19, returns home to Brusque, Santa Catarina, Brazil, after visiting a friend. As he approaches the house, he spots a flying object in the shape of a deep dish that rotates slowly counterclockwise. The upper part of the object is flattened, and a luminous light on top varies according to the speed of the craft’s movement and vacillates from red (high speed) to orange, from yellow to light green, and finally to white. When the craft is still, the intensity of the light diminishes. The object itself is gray in color and nearly 10 feet in diameter. The UFO moves toward Klein, passes 33 feet above his head, and then hovers in front of him about 16 feet from the ground. A bright, red light shines from the center of its base, through which three small beings about 3 feet tall slowly descend. The humanoids form a line across the entire width of the road and prevent him from passing as the UFO moves behind him some 33 feet away and 26 feet above the ground, close to some trees. The beings open their arms in an apparent blocking gesture, communicating with each other in an unfamiliar language. Klein draws his knife and tosses it toward the beings; it whizzes through the air, but at one point appears to float before falling to another spot. Each being wears a staff at its waist. The crew member in the center reacts by waving his staff toward Klein. The staff fires a beam of bluish-white light that hits Klein in the left thigh. He faints on being struck and is later found by his neighbors. His leg is paralyzed, so he goes to Azambuja hospital in Brusque, where doctors find no sign of injury. He recovers after a few days.

September 3 — 9:00 p.m. Two women, one 63 and the other an 18-year-old relative, are returning from a family visit in Fence Houses, Durham, England, when they see a peculiar object resting on a mound of earth in a section of

* * *

mining wasteland. They walk toward it, feeling a sort of attraction, and see that it is an oval object about 3 feet high and 5 feet long and standing on chrome or steel runners. The main compartment is glasslike with an orange section on top. When they reach the object, they sense the wind and traffic noise have stopped. The older woman touches the glassy side, which feels warm. At this point two strange entities are seen within the craft with long white hair parted down the middle, large eyes, and claw-like hands. They are both the size of a large doll, perhaps 1–1.5 feet tall. Frightened, the two women hurry away, noting that the street noise has returned. The object then takes off at great speed, making a humming noise. (William D.

September 8 — Leoncio Torres and Elena Bedjara are driving a truck on the road between Ollachea and Ayaviri, Peru, when a UFO lands 90 feet in front of them. Two strange creatures about 6 feet tall approach the blocked truck with flashlights. The creatures touch the couple’s backs and they feel a burning sensation.

September 9 — About 2:00 a.m. Farmer Hermelindo da Silva is making his way home from the bar he owns in Vargem Grande, Minas Gerais, Brazil, when his dog grows agitated. A flash of light illuminates the area, followed by a strange buzzing sound. He sees a bright object about 4 feet in diameter above him. The dog begins barking nonstop until it receives some type of shock, apparently from the craft, and flees in terror. The light goes out, and da Silva runs back to the bar and flattens himself against the outside wall. The object lights up again, scaring him, so he picks up a piece of wood and throws it at the object. The light goes out again and the buzzing ceases, only to be replaced by a hiss. He feels a blow to his shoulder and falls to the ground, then he runs toward his house with the object 10 feet above him. Cables and hooks descend from the UFO, accompanied by a small creature about 3 feet tall. Da Silva hits its shoulder, causing it to jump and fall, then gets into a fight with it for 15 minutes. Finally, the creature loops a cable around da Silva’s ankle and hoists him screaming into an opening on the craft. His brother-in-law hears him and sees him ascending. Da Silva manages to get loose from the cable and falls 20 feet into a plant. He runs to the house, bruised. (Clark III 1220–1221; Brazil 198–200)

September 9–10 — Around 3:00 p.m. A worker at the Liangshan Cotton Mill south of Longwangmiao, Shandong, China, sees a spherical object at 45° elevation about 9,800–13,000 feet away. The upper part is bright silver, and the lower part is dark gray. It moves in the direction of the sun. It reappears on September 10, although it seems larger. It shrinks in size toward 12:00 noon and finally appears like a twinkling star in the daytime. It reverts to its former size in the afternoon, and then in front of more than 1,000 witnesses it flies away and disappears around 5:00 p.m. (Wendelle Stevens and Paul Dong, UFOs over Modern China, UFO Photo Archives, 1983, p. 88)

September 10 — 12:54 a.m. Bill Pecha Jr. is watching TV in his home 3 miles southwest of Colusa, California, when suddenly the picture crackles, fades, and blacks out, and the air conditioner dies. He goes outside to check on the circuit breaker and feels an electrical sensation. He looks up and sees an object 85 feet in diameter hovering above a TV antenna near the barn about 50 feet away. The main body of the craft is a disc shape, which appears to be rotating in a clockwise direction, with a large dome that remains stationary on top. The object makes little or no sound, and is silver or gray in color, except for the very bottom, which has a “porcelain” look about it. Two hook- like cables are hanging down. Pecha approaches until he is just under one edge. The UFO moves slowly away and retracts its cables. Two hatches open on either end, revealing a “spotlight.” He goes inside and wakes up his wife Lenda, who also sees the object. Pecha can now see two other objects over high-tension power lines a mile to the west, emitting light beams at the tops of the transmission towers. The first UFO is moving closer and passes over a neighbor’s house, shining a light on it. Frightened, Pecha grabs his two children and he and his wife speed away in their pickup. They stop at a friends’ house and draw their attention to the distant light. The encounter ends at 1:03 a.m. (Paul Cerny, “[UFO Hovers over California Farm,](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ufohistoryfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/270C.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015891702&usg=AOvVaw0L-e1cw4HlC4Min6uzeaau)” MUFON UFO Journal, no. 197 (October 1976): 3– 8; Center for UFO Studies, \[[case files](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ufohistoryfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/270C.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015891996&usg=AOvVaw0GFqnI4-i-7LFruH1jpWkW)\]; “The UFO Finalist,” IUR 2, no. 1 (January 1977): 6–8; Clark III 294–296; Micah Hanks, “[Tentacles and Telephone Lines: The Colusa, California, UFO Incident of 1976,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2019/02/tentacles-and-telephone-lines-the-colusa-california-ufo-incident-of-1976/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015892353&usg=AOvVaw3jqbApF_j0vJeEEnvFZ2OW)” Mysterious Universe, February 22, 2019)

September 10 — 6:00–7:00 p.m. British European Airways Flight 831 from Moscow to London is cruising at 33,000 feet over Lithuania when a blinding, stationary light is seen on the starboard side of the airliner, apparently 10–15 miles away and 5,000–6,000 feet below. The light resembles a yellowish sodium vapor lamp and is too intense to view directly. It lights up the top of the cloud layer below. The pilot asks the Soviet authorities to identify the source, but they come back with a negative response, saying he should not ask questions. The light is visible for 10–15 minutes.

consents, telling him to come right over. As soon as he switches on the back light, he sees a man in dark clothing walking up the porch stairs. Hopkins unthinkingly opens the door right away. The stranger is wearing a black derby, black jacket, black tie, white shirt, gray gloves, black trousers, and black shoes. The crease in his pants is razor sharp. The man never introduces himself but sits down and removes his hat. He is completely hairless, devoid of eyebrows and eyelashes, but his lips are a vivid red. The stranger speaks in a monotone. After Hopkins discusses what he knows about the David Stephens case, the man remarks, “That’s just what I thought,” and abruptly changes the subject. “You have two coins in your left pocket,” he says. Hopkins acknowledges he has a dime and a penny. The stranger tells him to take one out and hold it in his palm. He does and is shocked to find that its color has changed to bright silver, then light blue. It grows blurry and fuzzy and finally fades away in a vapor. The stranger says that no one else “on this plane will ever see that coin again.” The stranger then asks if he knew why [Barney Hill](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_and_Betty_Hill&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015893612&usg=AOvVaw0ERqEoVrrgKtpCvLscxTXk) died, saying “He died because he knew too much. He died because he had no heart, just as you have no coin.” He orders Hopkins to destroy all the audiotapes of Stephens’s hypnosis sessions, as well as any other UFO literature he has sitting around, or he will suffer the same fate as Barney Hill. The stranger gets up, speaking slowly, and says his energy is running low. He gets up slowly and walks down the porch steps one foot at a time. Hopkins sees a bright light outside, rushes to the kitchen window, and sees the light and the man are gone. About 90 minutes later, Mrs. Hopkins and two of their sons arrive home from a movie. He tells them what happened, and one of the sons finds a series of marks in the narrow driveway that look like a small tractor tread.

They are gone the next day. Hopkins burns all his tapes, correspondence, and literature at the urging of his family.

September 18–19 — 10:30 p.m. Residents of the northeast portion of the city of Tehran, Iran, watch a multicolored aircraft hovering a few thousand feet in the air. Some of them call the nearby Mehrabad Airport, reaching night supervisor Houssain Pirouzi, who goes outside at 11:15 p.m. to look. With his binoculars, he sees a bright object flashing colored lights and changing positions at an altitude of 6,000 feet. Around 12:30 a.m., Pirouzi alerts the Iranian Air Force command post. Deputy Gen. Nader Yousefi also sees the object and scrambles an Air Force F-4 Phantom II interceptor piloted by Capt. Aziz Khani and 1stLt. Hossein Shokri from Shahrokhi Airbase \[now Hamadan Airbase\] to the west at 1:30 a.m. They close in on the object, but the jet’s radio and instruments give out. Only when Khani pulls away does functionality return. Squadron Cmdr. Parviz Jafari takes off in a second jet with 1stLt. Jalal Damirian in pursuit at 1:40 a.m. Some 27 miles from the UFO, Jafari picks the object up on radar, the return indicating something the size of a Boeing 707. Visually, it is flashing like a strobe with intense red, green, orange, and blue lights (in a diamond shape) so bright that Jafari cannot see its body. He approaches within 70 miles, then the object jumps 10° to the right, then twice again the same amount. Suddenly a smaller round object comes out of the large object and heads straight toward the interceptor at a high rate of speed. Jafari tries to fire an AIM-9 heat-seeking missile at it, but his weapons control panel malfunctions, as well as his radio and instruments. Jafari turns to the left to avoid an impact with the small object, which approaches to 4 miles distance, then stops. It returns to the large object, which emits another smaller object. Jafari is ordered back to the base, but the light follows him. During final approach, another object (a thin rectangle with three lights) appears at

low altitude in front of his plane. Gen. Yousefi then orders Jafari to approach the light and get a look. When he is within 4 miles, the radio and instrument panel go out again. The light disappears from view after Jafari lands.

Base Commander Gen. Abdulah Azerbarzin claims the complete investigation records are turned over to the US Air Force, which insists it only has one memo from USAF Lt. Col. Olin R.

September 19 — A TAP Air Portugal Boeing 707 nearly collides with a UFO shortly after takeoff at Lisbon, Portugal.

The oval object is glowing blue with a horizontal row of red and white lights. It is also seen by an air traffic controller who says that the object does not show up on radar.

September 22 — 10:30 p.m. A 10-year-old-boy in Regal, Minnesota, sees a 3.5-foot-tall creature with a large bald head, large red eyes, and green skin floating outside his bedroom window. A couple minutes later, the creature floats down to a cube-shaped craft, which he enters. (“Case 1-1-27,” IUR 1, no. 1 (November 1976): 5)

September 24 — 2:30 a.m. A conservation officer and his wife watch a dark object fly over Lake Red Rock near Otley, Iowa. It moves noiselessly at 40 mph and about 600 feet altitude.

The conversation is uncomfortable and strange but does not involve UFOs. (Clark III 864–865)

September 25 — Night. Vera White and three others traveling by car between farms in the Karawinna area to the west of Mildura, Victoria, Australia, notice a strange object on the ground in a paddock. It takes off vertically and hovers silently for about 5 minutes. They return to the site in the daytime and find a circle of flattened, discolored grass about 30 feet in diameter.

Autumn —2:00 a.m. Missile Combat Crew Commander Bruce Fenstermacher is on alert duty at one of the underground launch capsules at Francis E. Warren AFB near Cheyenne, Wyoming, with another crewman, when the officer-in- charge at the launch facility asks two security guards to report anything that seems unusual. A few seconds later, one of them reports seeing a pulsating white object in the sky. He can see flashing red and blue lights between the pulsations. It is about 10 miles north of their position and close to the launch control facility itself. The UFO is hovering about 100 feet above the building and looks like a “fat cigar” about 50–60 feet long. It begins to move away but stops close to one of the missile silos. Over the next 2 hours or so, the UFO hovers near several more missile silos. The security guards are terrified and refuse to approach any missile site that has the UFO over it.

Sometime around 4:30 a.m., the object zooms away and disappears in seconds. (Nukes 340–343)

October — The head of the UFO desk at the Swedish National Defence Research Institute, [Sture Wickerts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ufo.se/index.php/fakta/lexikon/1025-wickerts-sture-1925-1999&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015903246&usg=AOvVaw3AF_ggXJmDGYKms7vrxPbv), travels to Målilla, Kalmar County, Sweden, to conduct a search for an unknown object thought to have crashed in the woods.

October — George J. Myers and his wife are traveling 3 miles southeast of Winnebago, Nebraska, on US Highway 73 \[now US 75\] when they notice a large patch of cornfield with no corn growing. It is on sloping ground and in the shape of a perfect circle 100 feet in diameter. They learn from local farmers that it had appeared earlier in the year while the corn was still quite short, killing off growth later in the summer. A light “like lightning” was seen shortly before the damaged area was noticed. Myers takes photographs of the circle and soil samples, which are later taken to the University of Nebraska and show evidence of a chemical spill.

October 12 — 7:30 p.m. Multiple independent witnesses in Sonora, California, are drawn outside by a loud noise like “six jets.” They see a large red oblong UFO hovering with a wobbling motion. After 5 minutes, the UFO shoots upward and disappears. The next day, angel hair strands are found and sent to David Miletich at the University of Chicago. They are found to be “whitish, fibrous material of uniform composition being quite fine with frequent branching.” The primary constituents are carbon and nitrogen, but it is not spider web. A sample tested at the Michael Reese Hospital Microbiology Lab shows it to be contaminated with a low level of radioactive tritium.

October 17 — 10:40 a.m. A brilliant golden disc hovers south of Akita Airport, Japan, for 5 minutes. Kenichi Waga, telecommunications officer in the control tower, says “It was disc-shaped, larger than a car, but smaller than an airplane.” Capt. Masara Saito, 34, Toa Airlines \[now Japan Air System\] pilot, is preparing to take off when he notices “a strange looking disc-shaped object 5,000 feet from the ground.” Tazawa Takumi, air traffic controller on duty, who observes the object through binoculars, says it looks like “two plates placed together, with the top one inverted.” The unidentified object finally flies away toward the sea.

October 19 — An object like a silver, luminous mercury lamp is seen over Paso de Los Toros, Durazno, Uruguay. The UFO allegedly causes the deformation of a metal refrigerator, the discharge of three car batteries, and the bursting of a refreshment bottle. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 3 (March 1977): 2)

October 19 — 9:35 p.m. A group of people at the southwest end of Lake Harriet in Minneapolis, Minnesota, watch a yellow cone of light with a row of windows at the bottom hover below the cloud cover for 2 minutes, disappear, and reappear in a new location. This repeats 4–5 times before the object shoots up into the clouds. (“Case 1-2-20,” IUR 1, no. 2 (December 1976): 11)

October 22 — 1:20 a.m. Paul Thompson is driving home from his job on Interstate 494 where the highway turns to the northeast in Woodbury, Minnesota. He sees yellow and red lights about 2 miles ahead on the north side of the road. As he moves closer, he finds that the lights are actually two objects suspended in the air above a marshy area behind some woods about 300–400 feet north of the interstate. They are soft rounded triangles with red glows at the tip of the triangle and yellow pulsating lights protruding from the blunter ends. The objects are apparently metallic, about 20–25 feet in their longer dimension, and hover without making a sound. Thompson gets out of his car to watch. A truck approaches and one object rises vertically and zooms away. As the truck is abreast of his position, the second object ascends and flies directly over them. A CUFOS investigator examines the marshy area two days later and finds an oblong area, 40 feet by 20 feet, devoid of cattails and heavy grass. Inside the oblong is a smaller, irregular area where he finds exposed soil is and a few round holes the size of a quarter. He takes soil samples, which are sent to University of Kansas geologist [Edward J.

Late October — 7:30 p.m. Four physicians and a diplomat in an undeveloped region of Algeria south of Algiers watch a bright oval light on the horizon heading toward them. The object casts a faint beam downward, sweeping the ground, as it darts around the sky silently. It is bright when in motion, but faint when it stops. After an hour it fades, leaving a glowing space in the dark sky. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 4 (April 1977): 2)

October 23 — 4:00 p.m. Three men—Nicholas Flaskas, Frank Zonaras, and Bill Zonaras—waiting to film a solar eclipse at Taola Point in Ben Boyd National Park, New South Wales, notice two unusual objects on the horizon close to the ocean. The UFOs alternately move toward and away from them. The men take both motion picture and still photos, showing one bell-shaped object and another discoid in shape. They turn their attention to the eclipse and when it is over, the objects are gone.

November 4 — 8:30 p.m. A married couple in Martinsburg, Ohio, see two irregularly shaped objects, rounded on the bottom, hovering low near their car. One descends, flying over some woods, while the other is seen above the telephone wires by the road. Both have a red light on top, a whiter flashing light on the bottom, and a revolving red light. Around 9:30 p.m., three similar objects are seen by a woman 4 miles away, slowly changing formation for 5 minutes in the east. (“Case 1-2-62,” IUR 1, no. 2 (December 1976): 11)

November 5 — 8:08 p.m. A young woman is watching television at her home in Rives, Isère, France. She sees a bright light outside and calls her father. From their balcony they watch an intense white light speed across the sky from northwest to southeast and disappear in the mountains. The father thinks the light is spinning. At the same time a French physicist is driving 7 miles away near Voreppe. He sees a luminous disc brighter than the full moon and stops his car to watch it. The object is white in the center, bluish-white at the periphery, and is surrounded by an intense green halo. It is moving silently southeast but stops for a few seconds before moving off 30° from its previous course at a much greater speed. It passes in front of the Massif du Taillefer before it disappears behind Mont Néron. The sighting lasts 20–25 seconds.

November 10 — 8:20 p.m. A teenage girl driving alone near Putnam, Connecticut, passes underneath two dark metallic objects about 50 feet in diameter, one flying at an angle behind the other. Both objects have a red light in front, two on the sides, and a blue light in the back, all blinking. One banks slightly before it goes out of view, revealing a row of illuminated windows around the circular edge and a smaller circle like a “hatch” underneath.

November 14 — 9:00 p.m. Joyce Bowles and Ted Pratt are driving down the A272 near Winchester, England, when their car starts to jolt and shake and then veers off the road into a grass verge by the roadside. The car is subject to electrical interference as the engine roars, and the lights seem to shine brighter than usual. They spot what appears to be an orange, cigar-shaped craft, 15 feet in length, with three entities behind a window. As they watch, a bearded humanoid wearing a silver suit comes out of the object, walks to the car, and looks in on the witnesses.

He then disappears and the couple are able to drive off.

Early December — Afternoon. Eero Lammi is on his way home from school in Oulu, Finland, when he sees a 15-foot ball of light move across toward him from across the Gulf of Bothnia and land in a nearby field. When he approaches it, the object shoots out a beam of light that hits him in the chest. He feels a searing pain and blacks out. His parents think it is a prank until a doctor finds slight burns on his chest and back. The case is investigated by the Swedish Military High Command.

December 5 — 2:30 p.m. Several witnesses at Sollefteå, Västernorrland, Sweden, observe an elongated object (an estimated 148 feet long) with round openings along the fuselage. A blue-green light is shining from the openings, a red light at the front, and a diffuse orange glow from the underside. The object hovers above a military base built into the mountainside at an elevation of about 165 feet. After a while, the object moves on and hovers above a nearby power station. Then it moves jerkily sideways, jumping rapidly between different positions. After hovering for 15 minutes, it tilts up and rapidly speeds upwards and out of sight, disappearing at 3:30 p.m. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 4 (April 1977): 2)

zigzaging, and attached to each other by a faint connection. The object appears to be landing silently in a field to the east of the road, but it stops about 6–10 feet from the ground and 100–150 feet away. Barker takes a few steps toward it, but it takes off and moves north. He gets in his truck again to turn around and the object follows him, again as a white light. He speeds up to 75 mph and outdistances it. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August North, pp. 185–187)

December 15 — 9:20 p.m. A driver in Holland, Massachusetts, sees a cigar-shaped object twice the width of the moon hovering low in the east about 500 feet away.

At 2:45 p.m., he sees it again, arching overhead toward the west. Both incidents are timed by stopwatch at 12 seconds. Dave Bower, at the Scotia nickel mine about 50 miles to the north, sees a UFO drifting slowly westward at about 1,000 feet altitude. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 3 (March 1977): 2)

December 18 — 12:55 a.m. On Wood Canyon Road east of Soda Springs, Idaho, police officer Dennis Abrams has a close encounter with a 30-foot diameter, oval-shaped UFO. It lacks any seams or windows and has the bulk of three to four cars. It emits a light green light and hovers only 60 feet away. It makes no sound when hovering but makes a whistling “wind” sound when in motion. (“CE-I Seen by Independent Policemen in Idaho,” IUR 2, no. 2 (February 1977): 6–7)

December 18 — A Flugfélag Íslands \[now Air Iceland Connect\] airliner in flight from Akureyi to Reykjavik, Iceland, picks up a clear radar target at 18,000 feet over the Mælifell volcano.

December 19 — The first KH-11 Kennen reconnaissance satellite (codenamed Key Hole) is launched by the US National Reconnaissance Office. It is the first American spy satellite to use electro-optical digital imaging that offers real- time optical observations. The capabilities of the KH-11 are highly classified, as are images they produce. The satellites are believed to have been the source of some imagery of the Soviet Union and China made public in 1997; images of Sudan and Afghanistan made public in 1998 related to the response to the 1998 US embassy bombings; and a 2019 photo, revealed by President [Donald Trump](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015921941&usg=AOvVaw0voNLDKahpBcxPhzVSGXUV), of a failed Iranian rocket launch.

December 19 — 6:20 p.m. A witness in Concord, California, sees a silent, star-like light moving northward in an erratic fashion: zigzagging, up and down, in circles, backing up, speeding up for 1 minute. Then it speeds up and moves downward in a curve, zooming out of sight in 1 second. (“Case 2-2-13,” IUR 2, no. 2 (February 1977): 5)

December 19 — Night. Neil Brennan and Dean Gibbs step outside when they hear a whirring noise near Aquinas College, Salter Point, Western Australia. Brennan sees a bright disc, 2 feet in diameter, hovering 30 feet in the air behind his house. It then disappears toward the west. (Perth News (W.A.)

December 29 — Mr. and Mrs. Chapin, who had the previous experience in October 1969, again notice that their mine site near Redding, California, is unseasonably warm. Chapin walks carefully down toward the creek as his wife remains in the car. When he shouts and tells her to bring the gun, she observes a similar object to the one they had seen seven years earlier, except more pock-mocked on the surface, some 175–200 feet away from Mr. Chapin. It moves rapidly in the air and zaps both of them, knocking them to the ground. Chapin hits his head against the canyon wall and his wife falls to the road. They remain unconscious for about 15 minutes. (“The Redding, California CE II Case,” IUR 3, no. 3 (March 1978): insert)

After the experiment, carried out by student volunteers, Lawson declares that the imaginary accounts are all but identical to the real accounts. He then formulates a Birth Memories Hypothesis, which argues that abductions are nonphysical, archetypal fantasies in which the witness’s birth memories play a central role. However, Lawson’s methodology and results are later critiqued severely. (Alvin H.

1977 — An Australian soldier is traveling on the Nullabor Plain in South Australia when he and a companion, an American soldier, watch the descent of a purple-green fireball. They drive to the impact site and see a crashed UFO. The Australian goes inside and sees two aliens, one dead and the other making a squealing sound. They are about 5 feet tall and pot-bellied, with long, thin arms and large, black eyes. When he comes out again, he finds that military personnel have arrived. They arrest him and his friend and keep him in custody for two weeks.

1977 — Maj. Gen. Hideki Komura, an adviser to Japan’s Cabinet Research Office, admits that UFO investigations are carried out at a top level. He says that in the 1950s, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force encouraged reports from the public, but they had too many reports to analyze. Now he admits they cooperate closely with the US government’s Foreign Technology Division.

January 1 — 8:00 p.m. François Perez and his wife are chased in their car by a 33-foot long oval object in Valence, Drôme, France. They retrace their route one hour later after telling police. They see the oval object again, about 1,200 feet from them in a field. It appears to be 90–120 feet in diameter and surrounded by a halo of white light. After 10 minutes, the object begins flashing and rises up into the air at a 45° angle. They complain of eye pain and conjunctivitis for 48 hours afterward, and Perez’s watch stops working.

January 6 — 1:15 a.m. Florida Malboeuf is sitting at her window at 6420 Casgrain Avenue in Montreal, Quebec, when she sees an oyster-shaped, flat-bottomed metallic object with a row of white lights around its base. It flies in from the north and lands on the rooftop of a three-story apartment building across the street from her only 60 feet away. Immediately two figures appear on the roof; they are over six feet tall and thin, with long arms. They are wearing white one-piece uniforms with their heads covered with tight “bath helmets.” They stand looking at the street, then at the sky, then they apparently return to the object. A moment later they disappear, and the UFO rises from the roof about 20 feet and flies off to the east. Her son André goes over to the rooftop in question and finds a large, elliptical-shaped crust of ice, about 18 feet in diameter, on top of the snow. He also finds four small footprints only 6.5 inches long.

January 10 — 12:00 noon. Horse farmer [William McCarthy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fosters.com/article/20081009/GJNEWS_01/710096205&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015931918&usg=AOvVaw2P9uJEEaPQBury_IlHA6ex) is looking out his window at the falling snow when he is surprised to see a hole in his pond in the town of Wakefield, New Hampshire. The pond, 105 by 75 feet, was frozen solid just the day before. He goes outside for a closer look. The hole is perfectly round and cuts smoothly through 14 inches of ice. Eight inches of slush surrounds the hole. Peering into the hole, McCarthy sees something that looks like a one-foot-square box. He races back to the house and brings family members over for a look. Then he goes to the barn to pick up a rake, hoe, and pole. Back at the pond, McCarthy sees that the box has sunk three feet into the muck at the bottom. Frustrated in his attempt to retrieve the object, he calls a friend, Bob Palmer, who arrives around 2:30 p.m. Concerned that they might be dealing with radioactive satellite or aircraft debris, Palmer notifies the police, who soon arrive in the company of a local Civil Defense representative. The Geiger counter indicates a reading alarmingly above normal (3 roentgens per hour versus normal background radiation of .001 roentgen). The McCarthys are warned to stay away from the water, and the CD man and the police leave to inform their superiors. By 4:00 p.m. the circle of slush has expanded to 10 feet. When McCarthy observes the pond in the morning, he discovers a second hole, this one about 50 feet from the original. Not long afterwards, someone from the attorney general’s office warns McCarthy not to let his animals drink from the pond; he reappears later in the day to express concern about possible water seepage. He also directs McCarthy and his family not to discuss the affair with anyone else until the official investigation is completed. The next day the pond is frozen over again. Disregarding warnings, McCarthy walks out on it and looks down through the clear ice where the hole has been and to the pool bottom. A fresh 6-inch-wide trench stretches from beneath the first hole all the way to the second. To all appearances, the object that entered via the former has left via the latter. State police escort all but the officially connected off the farm. Investigators try unsuccessfully to drain the pond, then see a 6-by-3-foot opening where the original hole had been. Distant observers think they see the searchers retrieve a black object and place it inside a van, which quickly leaves the area. By the end of the day, a statement from the governor’s office declares that more sophisticated equipment has found no abnormal radioactivity in the pond and the surrounding area. The black object, the authorities contend, is a container filled with soil and stone samples collected for analysis. (“[What’s Going On? N.H.

Mid-January — 3:00 a.m. Eino Maki is out grooming the ski slopes at the Briar Mountain Lodge near Norway, Michigan. He notices that a nocturnal light UFO (seen frequently in the area since November 1976) is keeping pace with him as he moves up and down the slopes, edging closer. At first it is about 2 miles away at treetop level; now he can see red lights on the object. A bit unnerved, Maki goes back to the lodge and positions himself behind it. The light moves out of sight, and Maki goes back to work about 15 minutes later. Soon the light returns and it is below him on the same ski run, shining brightly. He decides to go home in his pickup truck. One week later, around 11:00 p.m., the same thing starts happening again, but Maki decides to run home right away.

January 21 — 3:15 p.m. An observer in Aspen, Colorado, watches a stationary object for more than an hour. Through binoculars it looks like a 3:1 rectangle with rounded corners of blue-green light. It fades from view in the same position. (“Case 2-3-12,” IUR 2, no. 3 (March 1977): 5)

January 21 — 4:45 p.m. Three female factory workers in Bridlington, Yorkshire, England, are walking to work on Bessingby Way when they see a hazy oval object hovering above the Britax PMG factory roof just before it begins moving to the right and stopping again. Almost immediately they spot another hazy object hovering above the adjacent K. B. Dixon woodyard. It begins moving forward at a slow pace then stops above a ventilation pipe in the Dixon factory wall. As it hovers the haze disappears, and the object’s features become more distinct. It is larger than a double-decker bus and shaped like a rugby ball. All three are able to see through a row of windows on the side that reveal a corridor inside. On one end is a tube-like structure or pole. Soon it moves over some community gardens and hovers briefly at about 6 feet altitude, lowers its “pole,” and appears to suck up a polythene bag. Both objects now move off to the west. The sighting duration is 5–10 minutes. The witnesses are terrified during the event, experiencing a cold sensation sweeping over them and a prickly irritation in their eyes. They develop sore throats and colds.

January 21 — 8:45 p.m. Robert Melerine and Irwin Menesses are doing some hunting along a dike canal about one mile northeast of Yscloskey, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, one in a boat and the other walking along the shore.

Melerine sees a bright red light in the sky. Suddenly the light seems right around him as the boat is engulfed in the glow, which extends to the surrounding landscape. There is no noise, and the light flies away into the woods.

Menesses is already back at camp and has not seen the light. They both get into the boat and move down the dike canal, using the outboard motor. The light reappears and moves closer to them. Although the motor is running the boat is not moving, seemingly held in place. Then the light quickly leaves and the boat lurches forward with great force, causing both men to fall. The light again flies at low level into the trees and continues on until they lose it. They estimate that the light is about 15–25 feet in diameter, roughly circular, faceted, and strikingly fast when it moves toward them. Both men report nausea, stomach aches, and fever for 2 days after the incident (it is flu season). (“Mysterious Hovering Light Observed by Yscloskey Men,” St. Bernard (La.)

January 27 — 1:05 a.m. A 19-year-old trucker is driving on State Highway 329 southeast of Prospect, Kentucky, when he spots a rectangular, orange-red object coming down near his jeep. His radio fails 15 seconds into the sighting. He feels compelled to watch the object, which stays in the vicinity only a short time. When he arrives home, he discovers that it has taken 45 minutes to complete a 7-minute trip. Later under hypnosis, he relates being taken inside the object and examined by three strange creatures who are shaped like machines (looking like a giant one- armed tombstone, a 7-foot teletype machine, and a man-sized Coke machine).

February 4 — Around 12:00 noon. Fifteen children, mostly 10-year-old boys, at Broad Haven Primary School in Pembroke, Wales, are playing football when they see a silvery cigar-shaped UFO in a field behind the building, partially hidden by trees and shrubs. Two in the group say it has a silver dome with a flashing light at the top. Six of them claim to see a silver man with pointed ears next to the craft. The school’s headteacher Ralph Llewellyn asks them to draw the UFO and is amazed at how similar the drawings are.

February 11 — 8:40 p.m. Health service cook Slavka Gorsek and her two children see an intense beam of light come through a bedroom window in their home in Gaberke, Slovenia. It illuminates the room briefly then goes out. The light is coming from an egg-shaped object about 8–11 feet wide that has landed only about 50 feet away behind a chicken coop. It is bright white with a green or blue center. For 2–3 minutes they can see and hear nothing, until the object flashes again and takes off. Three days later Gorsek notices a “glimmering dust” at the landing site and the marks of five landing gear. An analysis is performed but with ambiguous results.

Mid-February — 10:30 p.m. Another nocturnal light mimics Eino Maki’s movements as he grooms the ski slopes at Brian Mountain Lodge near Norway, Michigan. After going away once, it reappears right over him, illuminating him and a large area around him. He races his tractor at top speed (15 mph), maneuvering under struts and wires so it can’t get at him. Assistant Manager Jake Malone hears the tractor gearing up outside and sees a huge brilliantly lit object the “size of a boxcar” following Maki up the slope. When he reaches the top, the UFO hovers, silently bouncing up and down, about 500 feet from the lodge. Maki estimates the object is about 60–80 feet long. Some 10–15 people exiting the lodge begin to see the display as well. (Kenneth Schellhase, “UFOs on the Ski Slopes of Northern Michigan,” IUR 7, no. 2 (March 1982): 10–11)

February 16 — Morning. Four boys and one adult at Penlee Secondary School in Plymouth, Devon, England, independently see a cigar-shaped object flying horizontally above the school playground before it climbs into a cloud and disappears. (David Clarke, “Close Encounters of the Playground Kind,” Fortean Times 357 (September 2017): 16)

February 16 — Afternoon. Nine children, age 8–11, are playing netball with their teacher, Mair Williams, at Rhosybol School in Anglesey, North Wales, when they see an object flying north. It has a black dome on top and a silver, cigar-shaped base. It remains in sight for 3 minutes, goes behind the only cloud in the sky, reappears for one minute, then disappears. The teacher takes them back inside, separates them, and tells them to draw what they have seen. The sighting is reported to RAF Valley in Anglesey, which can offer no positive identification. (David Clarke, “Close Encounters of the Playground Kind,” Fortean Times 357 (September 2017): 16)

February 16 — 9:00 p.m. A commercial pilot standing outside his truck in Canton, Mississippi, watches a cylindrical object about 40 feet long pass alongside him a few hundred feet away at 30 mph. It has one steady white light in front and makes a noise like a wheezing turbine. It recedes into the west after 5 minutes. (“Case 2-4-6,” IUR 2, no. 4 (April 1977): 5)

February 16 — 9:15 p.m. A woman in Utica, Michigan, watches for 2 minutes a vertical cylinder of white light that is pointed at the top. It is stationary, silent, shrouded in white haze, and about 10 times as long as the full moon. (“Case 2-4-7,” IUR 2, no. 4 (April 1977): 5)

February 20 — 10:15 p.m. A domed disc is seen for 1–2 minutes by a man and his son in Victorville, California. It is silver in color with three windows, three legs or wheels, and two hooks at both ends. It hovers above houses 3–4 blocks away, then recedes toward the northwest after attaching itself to the top of a second object to form a sphere. (“Case 2-4-15,” IUR 2, no. 4 (April 1977): 5)

February 22 — 9:30 p.m. Antonio Serena, his wife Francesca Castellanos, and their three children are followed by a bright light for one hour and a distance of about 25 miles. The light is first spotted as they are driving northwest of Llíria in Valencia province, Spain, and follows them through the town of Vilamarxant. The car experiences some engine and light problems and des not seem to be able to accelerate. When they approach the village of Cheste, the light seems to move ahead of them, get much closer, and extend some legs in preparation for landing. One of the daughters gets sick from anxiety. The object moves away when a second auto approaches from the opposite direction. Despite the seeming drama of the incident, the light seems to have been Venus and the engine problems are due to a drained battery, as [Ian Ridpath](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Ridpath&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1674890015941233&usg=AOvVaw1V3SJpThczKwYP1l6GI0I4) points out.

February 25 — 7:45 p.m. A 16-year-old bicycling near Cyprus College in California is followed by a star-like object that appears in the west, 45° up. The light enlarges to a thin cigar-shape, 4–5 times the width of the moon, after rushing toward him in 5 seconds. He cycles away, frightened, and has to be driven home in tears by friends. His friends and family see the object as a “star” that sets in the west in 25 minutes. Possibly Jupiter. (“Case 2-4-19,” IUR 2, no. 4 (April 1977): 5)

February 26 — 9:00 p.m. An accident investigator in Ontario, California, sees a white triangle with rounded sides as big as the full moon. It moves silently and slowly from overhead toward the east, 45° up. It changes course twice in the next 4–5 minutes before it disappears in the distance. (“Case 2-4-21,” IUR 2, no. 4 (April 1977): 6)

March 4 — 6:00 a.m. Ludwig Siegal is driving on Provincial Road 201 about 4 miles west of Sundown, Manitoba. He sees a shimmering oval object ahead of him and silently hovering about 15 feet above the highway. It is yellowish cream around the outer edge, darkening to more yellowish in the middle. He passes directly underneath the object, which does not appear to be solid. Two miles further, Siegal sees three entities, 5 feet tall and shaped like bowling pins, in the glare of his headlights. They are arranged in a row along the left side of the road and have bulbous heads, narrow necks, and flared bodies. Unable to stop in time, he crashes into the group but feels no impact.

They simply disappear as they touch the car’s bumper. Looking in his rear-view mirror, he sees all three of them reappear behind his car, shrink to a small size, and vanish. Siegal calls the RCMP from a nearby friend’s house. They find skid marks, but no traces of blood or any impact marks on Siegal’s car.

March 7 — 8:34 p.m. French Air Force pilot Maj. René Giraud and navigator Capt. Jean-Paul Abraham, flying a Dassault Mirage IV supersonic bomber over Chaumont, Haute-Marne, France, see a huge UFO. The light appears bigger and bigger as it approaches their aircraft from the rear right. The pilot is flying at Mach 0.98 and makes a turn to the right and then to the left to make sure the light is not a reflection of some sort in the cockpit. As he does these maneuvers, both crew members can distinguish that the light is on the front of a dark, solid object. Despite the evasive maneuver, the unidentified object manages to stay exactly behind them for a few seconds, a very dangerous situation if the unknown object is hostile. Then the object makes a turn to the northwest at an estimated speed of Mach 2, and flies away to the left of the Mirage IV.

March 8 — 7:30 p.m. Eleven witnesses in six groups (including Thelma Lowe, Harold Wilson, Sara Green, Mrs. Everett Miller, Mrs. W. E. Runge II, and Robert Smyth) watch a red ball of fire the size of the full moon drift over their houses and alight on the ground south of Gatchellville, Pennsylvania. It leaves a large patch of burning grass (100 feet long by 30 feet wide), with a mysteriously unscathed area delineated by three holes at the vertices.

March 9 — 12:34 a.m. Captain Assapa, Flight Officer Berehan, and Flight Engineer Negassa of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET-701 are flying near Qarun Lake, Egypt, when they see a formation of eight lights, with two larger ones in the lead, flying southeast. They are the color of “arc welding.” (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 5 (May 1977): 2)

March 9 — 3:10 a.m. Brian Grimshaw and his friend Jeff are driving to a textile factory in Nelson, Lancashire, England, when they see a cigar-shaped, metallic object in the sky. They stop the car for a better look. The UFO has lights at either end that are changing color, and the entire object is surrounded by a gray mist. The witnesses hear a sound they describe as like the tide coming in and going out. As the object comes closer, the car engine stops and the headlights dim. After five minutes, the object flies off and the car restarts. Both witnesses come down with headaches shortly afterward.

March 9 — 10:40 p.m. Four adult witnesses in Long Grove, Illinois, are attracted outside by a loud crackling noise.

Searching around with a powerful spotlight, they see an object 60° up in the northern sky about 1,000 feet up. It is a white, tapered rectangle with a black silhouette behind it about the size of the full moon. They watch it maneuver within the spotlight beam and watch it sporadically for 30 minutes until it vanishes within the beam; the noise stops immediately.

March 10 — 7:40 p.m. Ten crew members of two oil tankers anchored one mile apart at the Arjuna Oil Field in the Java Sea, Indonesia, see an object the apparent size of the full moon. It is primarily dark with a red light in the middle and emits beams of yellowish-white light in two directions. It is only about 1,000 feet above the surface of the water. Coming from the west, it circles the offshore oil field twice and then speeds off to the east after 5 minutes. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 2 (February 1978): 2)

March 11 — Rancher B. T. Bray discovers a 14-foot diameter, circular ring in a paddock at Brayfield Station, southwest of Port Neill, South Australia. No UFO is seen. The topsoil, soft everywhere else, is surprisingly hard in the ring, with the grass in the center undisturbed. (Adelaide (S.A.)

March 12 — 9:05 p.m. United Airlines Flight 94 is flying south of Syracuse, New York, on a course toward Boston’s Logan Airport in Massachusetts. Suddenly the airplane starts a gradual, smooth (15° bank angle) turn to the left by itself. Within 5–10 seconds both captain Neil Daniels, 57, and the flight officer turn and look to their left side and see an “extremely bright white light at about their own altitude.” It is perfectly round and almost 3° arc in apparent diameter. Daniels estimates its distance to be about 3,000 feet and probably as big or bigger than a DC- 10 in size. Its intensity is like that of a flashbulb. Boston Center calls them and asks, “United 94, where are you going?” Daniels replies, “Well, let me figure this out. I’ll let you know.” Then they notice that “the three compasses were all displaying different readings. The FO’s compass was within 20° arc of the compass in front of the captain and was not rotating. It was then that the FO uncoupled the autopilot and flew the airplane manually.” Meanwhile, the UAP “followed right along with us” for about 4–5 more minutes then “it took off and picked up speed very rapidly and just disappeared, over about 15 seconds, back towards our 8:00 o’clock position and slightly upward.” Daniels asked ATC if they have any radar traffic in the area and they reply, “no.” Later, ATC tells Daniels, “So whatever it was, we don’t know. But it did cause a disruption in the magnetic field around the aircraft to the point where it did pull the aircraft off course.” (Richard F.

Mid-March — Observers at Mehrabad Airport in Tehran, Iran, see 20–25 UFOs flying from the desert toward the city. The pilots and passengers of an Iranian airliner flying at more than 6 miles altitude about 87 miles from the city describe them as yellow in color. A Japanese pilot the same distance south of Tehran switches on all his lights when he sees a huge object in front of his plane. He claims 15–20 smaller objects fly out of the large one directly toward the pilot, who changes course and heads for Mehrabad.

Mid-March — Around 11:00 p.m. James Ferguson and Tom Patton are in the desert about 2 miles west of Tucson, Arizona, preparing to take night photographs of saguaro cacti using flash-lighting effects. As they are getting ready to take a photo, the floor of the desert around them suddenly brightens. They see a large mass of light rise from behind a distant range of hills and hover for many minutes just above the horizon. Quickly, they turn the camera on its tripod toward the light and take a time exposure. Several minutes pass and suddenly the light moves rapidly to the north and disappears in the distance. The trail of light on the photo shows the light’s departure.

April 5 — 9:00 p.m. A young couple and others in Lincolnton, North Carolina, see 5–6 red-orange lights hovering 200 feet away. (“Case 2-5-52,” IUR 2, no. 6 (June 1977): wrap)

April 8 — 2:00 a.m. A domed disc-shaped object flies around two witnesses in Cedar Springs, Michigan, hovering and flashing over some nearby trees. Ring ground marks are later found. (“Case 2-5-57,” IUR 2, no. 5 (May 1977): wrap)

April 8 — 8:08 p.m. A teenager and his mother in St. Louis, Missouri, watch a flat disc four times the width of the moon silhouetted against the clouds. It has three steady white lights around its edges and moves silently from a high angle in the east to a low angle in the west. (“Case 2-5-58,” IUR 2, no. 6 (June 1977): wrap)

April 8 — 10:35 p.m. A cigar-shaped object glowing red at each end darts north to south across Interstate 64 in Lexington, Kentucky, several times. (“Case 2-5-80,” IUR 2, no. 6 (June 1977): wrap)

April 10 — 2:30 a.m. Martha and Olof Eriksson watch a yellow light with a red “textile-like” appendage hanging below it at Flykälen, Jämtland, Sweden. It is 100 feet in diameter and moving from south to north. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 8 (August 1977): 2)

April 14 — 2:00 a.m. Captain Scherrer, Senior First Officer Schmid, and hostess Rothenhofer are on board Swissair Flight SR-798 near Maastricht, Netherlands. Schmid notices the first of four “lightning-like lights” in an otherwise clear sky. Ground radar calls the plane’s attention to a target 15 miles away at their 1 o’clock position. The crew sees two targets briefly at that position but only on radar. Then all three of them see another flash.

Maastricht radar watches the target fall back east of the plane and rush at high speed back to a 1 or 2 o’clock position only 3 miles away. There is still no visual contact. A few minutes later, a third silent lightning-like flash is seen just in front of the airliner. Maastricht radar watches the target playing with the plane behind its tail and right wing, where the fourth flash is seen. A military radar places the speed of the target when moving fast at Mach 4 or 5. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 6 (June 1977): 2)

April 17 — 4:00 p.m. A woman in La Louvière, Hainaut, Belgium, watches a flat cylinder with faceted sides move from the southwest to northeast. The object is dark, seems solid, and emits no smoke or trail. It moves in a straight line with an oscillation in the same direction as the wind. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 8 (August 1977): 2)

April 18 — About 12:05 a.m. George Thrupp and Margaret Mancour of the weather office at Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia have just gotten off their shift when they see a “blue flash” over the airport. It appears in the south sky above Richmond. The light is coming from a cigar-shaped object larger than a Boeing 747 jumbo jet that is orange on the top half and blue on the bottom half with dark portholes along the side.

April 19 — Santiago Laco Ozano, 32, is milking cows in Rocha, Uruguay, when he hears a strange noise as the area around him is illuminated. Looking up, he sees a small object giving off a powerful beam of light. He faints, and on recovering about 5 minutes later, notices his hair is slightly burned. He is admitted to a nearby hospital, whose personnel verify the singeing and that his scalp has no lesions. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 3, no. 1 (January 1978): 2)

April 19 — Early morning. Rosa Granville, proprietor of the Haven Fort Hotel in Little Haven, Pembroke, Wales, is disturbed by a strange humming noise. She looks out a window and sees an oval-shaped object “like the moon falling down” land behind her home. Two tall humanoids appear in front of the UFO, which is about the size of a minibus. They have blank faces and pointed heads and are wearing white outfits like boiler suits. They appear to “take measurements or gather things” and climb a grassy bank in a field. When she returns to the window after calling other family members, the object and the figures have vanished.

April 21 — 7:15 p.m. A couple in Towson, Maryland, sees a gray capsule with short, stubby wings, two yellow headlights, and no windows. Several times the full moon, the object flies silently from low in the east to above their car in 4 minutes. (“Case 2-6-5,” IUR 2, no. 6 (June 1977): 3)

April 22 — 3:10 a.m. Three witnesses in Washburn, Wisconsin, see a flat, round object with five white lights on its rim and two red lights on its bottom. It pursues their car for three-quarters of a mile, even around curves and driving at 90 mph. The object overshoots them, slows down, and moves only 30 feet in front of them. After 4 minutes it accelerates in a steep climb toward the southwest. (“Case 4-22-77,” IUR 2, no. 6 (June 1977): 3)

April 23 — 9:30 p.m. Pilot William Sorum and copilot Richard Drzal are flying a DC-10, Northwest Orient Flight 27, from Seattle, Washington, to Anchorage, Alaska. About 50 miles east of Middleton Island, Alaska, they see a bright white star moving smoothly from the southern horizon across their field of view to the northern horizon for about 40 seconds. It passes in front of them at a 45° above them at their altitude of 39,000 feet. Radar Approach Controller Terry Siegrist and others at Anchorage International Airport see a linear flight of four separate unidentifiable blips suddenly appear on radar screens at 30 miles distance from the city, covering 10 miles in 6–12 seconds (3,600 mph). Correlation between the two observations is not established. (“Radar/Visual in Alaska,” IUR 2, no. 7 (July 1977): 4)

April 25 — 3:45 a.m. Eight soldiers camped on a military patrol 3 miles from Putre, Arica y Parinacota, Chile, suddenly see two bright violet lights nearby. The soldiers’ dog and horses remain still while the lights hover nearby. The leader of the group, Corporal Armando Valdés Garrido, orders the other soldiers to put out their campfire. The two large lights are about a half-mile away and hovering close to the ground. Valdés approaches the lights, ordering them to identify themselves. At this point a bright light envelops Valdés and he apparently vanishes in a mist in plain view of the others. The soldiers frantically begin searching for him but are unable to find him. At around 4:15 a.m., Valdés suddenly reappears. He has a strange look on his face and he gives out a sinister laugh, asking several times where his mother is. Then he says, again in a very sinister sounding voice, “You will never know who we are and where we come from.” The others notice that he appears to have a week’s growth of beard, whereas he had been clean-shaven just an hour ago, and his digital watch indicates the impossible date of April

30\. He is almost in hysterics and one of the soldiers has to slap him, at which point Valdés faints. One of the other soldiers, Raúl Salinas, who has been standing a few feet in back of the others, notices a strange humanoid creature behind some nearby rocks. He describes it as half animal and half human; no facial features are visible, but it seems to be wearing a helmet and is carrying a red light. Salinas is stunned to see the creature appear at several places simultaneously. He thinks that there might be several humanoids. He does not mention this to the others at the time, since they are already scared, but the others do not see the humanoid or humanoids. When Valdés wakes up he cannot remember where he has been. In 2013, Valdés, now an evangelical pastor, admits that no one on the patrol saw aliens—only that they saw something that frightened them. He claims he only left the group to go urinate. Many ufologists now feel that the Chilean government encouraged the abduction scenario to mask the presence of troops and horses in northern Chile in the event of a war with Argentina or a regional conflict.

April 26 — Pauline Coombes reports seeing a luminous silver figure 7–8 feet tall looking into her window at Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales, for an hour. She doesn’t say anything until her son notices it too. Humanoid in form, the figure’s face is black and featureless; it vanishes when a neighbor drives up. Two weeks earlier, a yellow sphere had chased her car; she accelerated to 80 mph to escape it. (“Foreign Forum,” IUR 2, no. 8 (August 1977): 2)

April 29 — Manuel Lopez, the pilot of a single-engine plane, is allegedly blinded in flight by a UFO near Bogotá, Colombia. Circling in the air for 2 hours, Lopez’s calls for help are recorded and played on a local radio station: “I’ve lost my sight; I don’t know what to do!” Four aircraft surround him and talk him down to a safe landing at El Dorado International Airport by radio. He is rushed to a military hospital suffering from shock.
