Jan. 7, 1947                            Portland, OR. _Los Angeles Examiner_. **SKY OBJECT A MYSTERY ROCKET?** A laboratory analysis of the cylindrical object which fell in Portland
                                        yesterday from a clear sky established the presence of aluminum,
                                        titanium, magnesium, calcium, chrome, and zircon. Dr. John E. Allen,
                                        chief geologist of the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, said it gives a reasonable basis for the hypothesis that it
                                        could have been used in rocket construction. The largest portion of the
                                        object has been taken over by an Army investigator for examination.
                                        The object was found when a mysterious ice shower occurred Saturday, confined
                                        to a fifteen-foot square area of Hill Military Academy.

Jul. 8, 1947                            Abadan, Iran. **IRAN REPORTS BORDER EXPLOSIONS.** Strong, starlike bodies were seen at this point and also at
                                        Shosef and Saebishheh, near the Afghan frontier. After cavorting
                                        about the sky, the objects exploded loudly, leaving only a cloud
                                        of smoke.

Jul. 9, 1947                            Boise, Idaho. **THEY MOVE INTO IDAHO.** Dave Johnson, aviation director of the _Idaho Stateman_, while flying at
                                        14,000 feet, west of Boise, saw a circular object bank in front of
                                        a cloud formation for 45 seconds. It rose sharply and jerkily
                                        toward the top of a towering bank of clouds, then turned  its edge
                                        toward him, appearing as a straight black line, and shot straight
                                        up. It moved fast, and was very large. Three Idaho National Guardsmen
                                        had seen a similar object in the same area as Johnson.

Jul. 9, 1947                            Phoenix, Arizona. _The Arizona Republic_. **ARIZONA PHOTOGRAPHS THEM.** The first clearly recorded photograph of what is believed to be a
                                        flying disk was taken today by an amateur Phoenix photographer,
                                        William Rhodes, as it circled north of the city. Rhodes shot the
                                        picture as the slow-flying object was approaching him. As it
                                        banked to make a right turn, he obtained this picture, showing clearly
                                        the shape of the disk. Rhodes said the object then shot away at high speed.

Jul. 10, 1947                           Morristown, New Jersey. **THEY TRY NEW JERSEY NEXT.** John H. Janssen, driving to Morristown Airport at 10 am, saw
10:00                                   four objects in the sky and got out of his car to photograph them.
                                        They seemed to be about 10,000 feet in the air, flying rapidly in
                                        formation toward New York City. Three of the saucers were silvery
                                        white and the fourth was a dull, metallic color. As they disappeared,
                                        they put on a burst of speed far in excess of any jet plane Janssen
                                        had ever seen. Censorship the next day kept his photo out of most
                                        of the nation's dailies.

Aug., 1947                              Burbank, California. **COLLINS WON'T REPORT HIS TO PRESS.** Tom Collins, of Port Chester, N.Y., saw flying saucers over Burbank,
                                        California, where he was visiting his wife in the hospital having
                                        their third child. He told his wife about the sighting, but never
                                        reported seeing them because the press was making such saucer-sighters
                                        look ridiculous.
7.
Aug. 6, 1947                            Robert Lee, Texas. **TEXAS SEES ONE CHANGE IN SHAPE?** Mr. and Mrs. Jim Reid, Owen Fletcher, Dock Mennington and Bob
                                        Patterson saw an object in the sky at about 10 p.m. in the shape
                                        of an luminous disk. It was larger and faster than a plane. It
                                        maneuvered in the sky for twenty minutes and then took off in the
                                        direction of San Angelo. In fifteen minutes it returned, this
                                        time in the shape of a long log. The sky was clear with no clouds.
                                        The nearest searchlight was 100 miles away. It continued its capers
                                        for more than half an hour. Finally, it took off on the shape of a long
                                        cigar with a thin smokey trail and vanished in the distance.

Aug. 8, 1947                            Upton, Wyoming. **WOMAN WATCHES ONE DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR.** Mrs. Jay Engel saw a flying disk at sundown. She saw a flash
                                        darting across the sky, then another flash. It disappeared for
                                        a few seconds, then reappeared further away. It was traveling at
                                        a great rate of speed and was not particularly bright, appearing
                                        to be an orange-colored glow.

Aug. 12, 1947                           Boise, ID. **SHANGLES' PHOTO SHOWS LITTLE.** Charles Shangle - likely Charles W. Shangle Jr. - was watching the sky when he saw a luminous object
                                        traveling slowly through the air at great height. He photographed
                                        it. It is visible in the upper left-hand corner of the
                                        photo as a faint gray dot surrounded by a slight halo effect.
                                        The reproduction is poor, showing almost nothing but the truck in
                                        the foreground.

Sep. 13, 1947                           Bellingham, Washington. **SAUCER SHINES LIKE DISHPAN.** E. L. Lynn, 1040 Knox Ave., saw a large black object the size of
                                        the moon. It turned from very black to light yellow, then a pale
                                        pink. Finally, it began to shine like a very bright tin pan. It
                                        was about 20 miles distant and two miles high, was in view for
                                        five or six seconds and traveled about five times as fast as an
                                        ordinary airplane.

Sep. 14, 1947                           Toronto, CA. _Toronto Globe_. **CANADA TRIED PHOTOGRAPHING THEM.**
                                        A photo of a supposed flying saucer is given front-page coverage
                                        on the _Globe_, taken by Raymond Johnson of Toronto. Disk was yellow
                                        with a tail, the time of passage was fifteen seconds. An extremely
                                        poor reproduction shows a ship in the foreground with a saucer
                                        resembling a faint comet in the background.

Oct. 25, 1947                           Hymers, Canada. **50 WITNESSES SEE ONE IN CANADA.** More than 50 townspeople saw a strange object swoop into sight from
                                        the south, remain stationary for fifteen minutes, then flash back
                                        in the direction from which it had come. It was described as a
                                        long streak of fire with heat waves emanating from it and something
                                        that looked like an electric light waves.
13
Nov. 5, 1947                            Persian Gulf. **FOUR SEE ONE ABOVE PERSIAN GULF.** Richard Carruthers, Jr., aboard the tanker _Chipola_, saw eight round
                                        objects flying in a group, pass within half a mile of the ship, make
                                        a climbing turn in echelon formation, and pass out of sight. Four
                                        persons saw the light, but opinions varied as to whether they were
                                        white or blue.

Feb. 20, 1948                           Boise, Idaho. _The Emmet Messenger_. **THEODOLITE MEASURES ONE NEAR BOISE.** E.G. Hall of Boise made a theodolite observation of a flying saucer,
                                        estimating its size as that of a small plane. Along its back edge
                                        was no trail, but there was a fuzziness there. The craft was
                                        silent, even when coming closer than 2000 feet to the ground. This
                                        is the first known theodolite-measured and gauged reported viewing.
15
Feb. 21, 1948                           West Beach, Florida. **ONE SEEN BY PALM BEACH EDITOR.** Charles Francis Coe, editor of the _Palm Beach Times_, saw a ray or
                                        blob of lights sweeping in from the southwest over West Palm
                                        Beach at 2 PM. It curved over the Atlantic and headed northeast,
                                        in a wide arc, as though following the curve of the earth.
16
May. 17, 1948                           Seattle, Washington. **AIRFIELD TECHNICIAN SPOTS ONE.** Fred Granger, aircraft communicator stationed at the Seattle-Tacoma
                                        Airfield spotted what appeared to be four stars or lights with
                                        red and green flashes, approximately 25 degrees above the horizon.
17
May. 26, 1948                           VALLEY CITY, NORTH DAKOTA. **CLERGYMAN AND EDITOR BOTH REPORT DAKOTA SIGHTING.** Rev. L.S. Eberly and his wife noticed a bright light which turned
                                        out to be a spheroid, dark in the center and radiating light rays
                                        near the outer rings. It was observed for an hour. On the following
                                        morning, a similar object appeared and Rev. Eberly called
                                        Robert Downs of the _Times-Record_ who also observed the phenomenon.
18
Jul. 27, 1948                           Mobile, Alabama. **TWELVE REPORT ONE IN ALABAMA AT 900 MPH.** At 9:15 p.m. at least twelve persons saw a oval ball of fire,
21:15                                   followed by about 400 feet of bluish-white flame. It seemed to be
                                        about half as big as the moon and some observers saw it as a
                                        cigar-shaped object with a red flame flaring into white at the
                                        tail. A Brookley Air Force base pilot estimated its speed as
                                        between 800 and 900 mph.
19
Summer, 1948                            Newton, Connecticut. **BILLY ROSE REPORTS ONE FROM BROADWAY.** Billy Rose, newspaper columnist, visiting playwright Paul Osbourne
22:00                                   in Newton, Connecticut, with Mr. and Mrs. Joshua Logan and Mr. and Mrs.
                                        John Hersey, noticed three searchlights poking into the air around
                                        10:00 p.m. A few minutes later three objects appeared, about 200 ft.
                                        in diameter and flying at an altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The
                                        mysterious craft gave off a ghostly glow, dull bluish-white.
20
Sep. 23, 1948                           Boise, Idaho. **IDAHO REPORTS ONE HIDING BETWEEN CLOUDS.** Mr. and Mrs A.F. Kaus, of Carolina Beach, NC saw a huge ball
                                        of intense white light while traveling from Mountain Home to Boise,
                                        Idaho. The object was between two layers of clouds at approximately
                                        2,000 ft. It flared twice, held steady for a few seconds, then
                                        disappeared. The light was round in shape with jagged edges.
21
Oct. 9, 1948                            Osage, Wyoming. **WYOMING SEES ONE DIVIDE IN TWO.** Larry Griffin and Homer Grey of Osage, saw a huge shining object,
                                        luminous and shaped like a disk. It remained in view for two seconds,
                                        then divided into two parts and disappeared.
22
Feb. 1, 1949                            Tucson, AZ. _Tucson Daily Citizen_. **B-29 FAILS TO CATCH FLYING SAUCER OVER TUCSON.** Cannonballing through the sky some 30,000 feet above the earth,
                                        a fiery object shot westward so fast it was impossible to gain
                                        any clear impression of its shape or size. It hovered over the city
                                        for a few moments and then shot off again with tremendous velocity.
                                        First Lt. Roy L. Jones gave chase in a B-29, but soon left
                                        behind as the craft sped toward California. Dr. Edwin F. Carpenter,
                                        head of the University of Arizona's department of astronomy, said he
                                        was certain the object was not a meteor or other natural phenomenon.
23
Feb. 22, 1949                           Boca Chica Naval Air Station, Key West, Fla. **RADAR PICKS UP SAUCER ABOVE KEY WEST.**
                                        Two glowing objects were seen above the Naval Air Station, flying
                                        at great height. One plane was sent up to investigate, but was
                                        hopelessly outdistanced. Radarmen tracked the objects as they
                                        hovered for a moment above Key West. After a few seconds, the
                                        objects accelerated at high speed and streaked off.
24
Feb. 29, 1949                           Chicago, Illinois. **ILLINOIS SEES ONE DISINTEGRATE.** Ben Cole, Jr. of Northbrook, Illinois saw a flaming object hurtle
06:11                                   out of the east at 6:11 a.m. and disintegrate in a fiery shower
                                        south of Chicago. At the same time, 40 miles away, Ed Maher of
                                        Chicago, saw a rocket half a block long speeding from east east to
                                        south. The front was shaped like a rocket, the tail seemed to
                                        fall to pieces as it dived into a large cloud. The craft made no noise.
25
Mar. 25, 1949                           Bend, Oregon. **COMBAT PILOT COMPARES SIZE TO WASHTUBS.** Residents of Bend saw two flying saucers reflecting the rays of

                                        by observers. World War II flyer, Vernon Leverett, estimated their
                                        height as over 10,000 feet and their size about that of a large
                                        washtub.

Apr. 11, 1949                           White Sands Proving Grounds. **WHITE SANDS SEES ONE WHILE CHECKING WEATHER BALLOON.** Scientists, reported by Commander Robert B. McLaughlin, USN, were
                                        tracking a balloon 57 miles northwest of the grounds, A
                                        strange object crossed above the balloon and was tracked with a
                                        theodolite. It was saucer-shaped, 105 feet in diameter and flying
                                        50 miles above the earth at around 5 miles per second. Suddenly,
                                        it swerved, shooting upward at an angle of five degrees, climbing
                                        an additional 25 miles in almost 10 seconds. No exhaust trail, no lights, no sound.

Apr. 11, 1949                           Portland, OR. **Project Saucer**/**Project Sign**: **PROSPECTOR SPOTS FIVE IN OREGON.** Fred M. Johnson, Portland prospector, told authorities he noticed a
                                        strange reflection in the sky and saw five or six discs about 30 ft.
                                        in diameter. He watched them through a telescope for about 30 seconds
                                        as they banked in the sun. He described them as being round with
                                        tails making no noise.

Aug. 1947                               Bethell, Ala. From the Air Material Command, Wright Field's **Project Saucer**/**Project Sign** Report: Two pilots for a Bethel, Ala.
                                        flying service told investigators they spotted a
                                        huge black object, bigger than a C-54, silhouetted
                                        against the brilliant evening sky. In order to
                                        avoid collision, they said they pulled up to 1,200
                                        feet and watched the object cross their path at
                                        right angles. The two pilots told of swinging in
                                        behind the object and following it to 170 mph
                                        until it outdistanced them and disappeared four
                                        minutes later. It was described as having no motors,
                                        wings, or visible means of propulsion, being
                                        smooth-surfaced and streamlined.

Aug. 1947                               Fort Richardson, Alaska. From the Air Material Command, Wright Field's **Project Saucer**/**Project Sign** Report:
                                        Two officers told of seeing a spherical object about 10
                                        feet in diameter flying through the air at tremendous
                                        speed, leaving no vapor trail.

Jan. 7, 1948                            Oklahoma City, OK. From the Air Material Command, Wright Field's **Project Saucer**/**Project Sign** Report:
                                        An Oklahoma City man reported
                                        spotting a saucer "seeming to be the bulk of six
                                        B-29's." The observer, who holds a private pilot's
                                        license, spotted the objects from the ground. It was
                                        perfectly round and flat with no protrusions. He
                                        reported the speed of the soundless craft as "probably
                                        three times that of a jet."

Jan. 7, 1948                            Lockbourne Air Force Base, Columbus, Ohio. From the Air Material Command, Wright Field's **Project Saucer**/**Project Sign** Report:
                                        Several observers reported a sky phenomenon
                                        described as "round or oval, larger than a C-47, and
                                        traveling in level flight faster than 500 mph."

Apr. 28, 1949                           Gary, Indiana. **INDIANA SEES ONE DEFY PERSPECTIVE LAW.**
                                        Leon Faber of Sandwich, Ill., sighted a bright shining object
                                        moving east while he was flying up at an elevation of 6,000 feet over
                                        the Gary-Michigan City area. It seemed to be about 10,000 feet
                                        away and about the size of a basketball. It suddenly disappeared
                                        without getting any smaller.

May. 7, 1949                            Oakland, California. **CALIFORNIA SEES THEM AS 'SQUARES'.**
                                        Benjamin F. Smith of Oakland saw two rows of square objects flying
                                        in the regular airliner levels traveling from north to south,
                                        moving soundlessly at tremendous speed.
35
May. 1949                               White Sands Proving Grounds. **COMMANDER CONFIRMS SIGHTING.**
                                        Commander Robert B. McLaughlin, USN, in a further report said that
                                        an object, white in color, proceeding slowly westward was sighted.
                                        It picked up speed, passed overhead and disappeared over the Organ
                                        Mountains. When first sighted, the object had been going at about
                                        one mile per second at a height of 25 miles, but when it accelerated
                                        it did so at a rate far beyond the capabilities of any present-day
                                        rocket. Passing within 5 degrees of the sun, it remained visible,
                                        showing no discernible method of propulsion.

Jun. 1949                               Union City, Michigan. **KLINE CATCHES A LITTLE ONE.**
                                        Clifford M. Kline, Union City, was just leaving his barn on a clear
                                        evening at 7:40 when approximately 200 feet away, and nearly 6 feet off
                                        the ground, an oval object about 5ft by 4ft sped from northeast to
                                        southwest in a perfectly straight line with no noise and disappeared
                                        behind a fence row of shrubbery nearly a quarter of a mile away.
                                        The object was reddish-brown and fringed with white. Kline's
                                        observation was similar to a procession of hat-crown-shaped objects
                                        observed soaring over Skening, Sweden, May 1818, which were
                                        described as brown and caused the sun to turn brick-red.

Jun. 17, 1949                           Battle Creek Michigan. **MICHIGAN PHOTOGRAPHS TRIANGLES.**
                                        Lloyd Sanders, Rt 1, Took a photo of a strange triangular object
                                        which was going at a tremendous rate of speed and glowed like the
                                        sun. There was a high-pitched, whining sound.
38
Jun. 18, 1949                           Kent, England. **ENGLANG SEES THEM AS 'BLOBS'.**
                                        Two farmers reported they saw tailess blobs of light spinning
                                        across the heavens.

Jul. 9, 1949                            Alexandria, Virgina. **VIRGINIA SEES SAUCER DOING THE REFLECTING.**
                                        C.S. Dupree saw a light reflected on the sidewalk, and on looking
                                        up saw a fast-moving, saucer-shaped object. It was not bright, but
                                        easily visible. Other sightings in the same vicinity were reported.

Jul. 10, 1949                           Tacony, Pennsylvania. **NINE WHIZ OVER PENNSYLVANIA.**
                                        Mr. and Mrs. George C. Wunsch of Tacony, Pennsylvania, and Mr. and Mrs.
                                        Barry McGuigan of West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, saw nine strange disks
                                        with a dull illumination visible beneath the evening's cloud cover.
                                        They moved faster than an airliner but were clearly visible.

Jul. 24, 1949                           Montgomery, AL. _Los Angeles Herald Express_. **HUGE MYSTERY PLANE OVER U.S.**
                                        Two Eastern Airline pilots, Capt. Cas Childs and Co-pilot J.B.
                                        Whitted, said they met a wingless two-deck plane early today southwest
                                        of Montgomery, Alabama. They said the strange ship with a
                                        blue glow underneath the fuselage and shooting red flames passed
                                        the EAL ship at 5,000 feet and headed towards New Orleans.
42
Jul. 24, 1949                           Boise, Idaho. **V-SHAPED OBJECTS OVER IDAHO.** A Boise aviator saw seven V-shaped objects flying within 1,500 or
                                        2,000 feet of his plane. The objects, estimated to be about the
                                        size of fighter planes, flew at a tremendous rate of speed in a
                                        tight, but unfamiliar formation. They were in the shape of a 'V'
                                        with a solid, circular body under the nose of the 'V'. There was
                                        no evidence of any means of propulsion. They were observed for
                                        about two minutes.
43
Jul. 26, 1949                           Mitchell, Nebraska. **THEY FLY UPSIDE DOWN IN NEBRASKA.**
                                        Dr. H.G. Lauback saw a saucer flying on a southwesterly course at
                                        3:10 p.m., resembling an upside-down saucer whirling as it moved
                                        through the sky, occasionally tipping sideways at an altitude of
                                        between 5,000 and 7,000 feet. It was estimated to be about 25 feet
                                        in diameter and traveled about 25 ground miles in three minutes.

Aug. 15, 1949                           Deer Lodge, Montana. **MONTANA NOTES THEIR SILENCE.**
                                        Edgar Thompson saw a bright silver disk-shaped object heading
                                        towards Butte at a terrific speed. It traveled noiselessly in a
                                        straight line.
45
Nov. 7, 1949                            Osborne, Kansas. **KANSAS OBSERVES THEIR 'FLIP'.**
                                        Delmar Remick and Erwin Legg of Osborne, saw a flying saucer in
                                        the air, a mile up and moving northwest, rapidly takin six or
                                        seven seconds to get out of sight. It moved with a little flip
                                        every half second.

Jan. 12, 1950                           Kvalleposten, Malmo, Sweden. **MAJORITY BELIEVE IN FLYING SAUCERS.**
                                        More than 61 percent of Americans believe in flying saucers,
                                        according to a poll of opinion taken by Galaxy, the science-fiction
                                        magazine. Another 17 percent didn't believe they exist, while
                                        32 percent were uncertain. The younger age group was more inclined
                                        to believe in saucers than older people.

Jan. 21, 1950                           New England. _The New York Times_. **BOSTON PITCHES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION.**
                                        The Aero Club of New England, a 49-year-old organization dating back
                                        to the ballooning days, has asked the Air Force to reopen its investigation
                                        into "flying saucers" and other unknown aircraft. A letter
                                        to Thomas K. Finletter, Air Force Secretary, made public today, termed
                                        the discontinuance of the "saucer" investigation as "premature and regrettable."

                                        Walsh, telephone company electrician and Navy veteran, reported
                                        seeing a tear-shaped object, bright as a fluorescent light, for
                                        twelve seconds before it headed out to sea in an arch-like flight at
                                        incredible speed.

Feb. 1950                               Korea. _Fate Magazine_. **NAVY DOES NOT SWALLOW OWN LINE.**
                                        A few months before the Navy spokesman,  Dr. Brener Liddell issued his
                                        report that flying saucers were all balloons. _Naval Aviation News_,
                                        an official Navy magazine, reported the sighting of two mysterious
                                        smoke-trailing objects by an American airship off Korea. The
                                        incident occurred in December of 1949, and personnel aboard the
                                        seaplane tender _Gardiners Bay_ reported that the two objects struck
                                        the water at tremendous speed off the ship's port bow while it was
                                        steaming up the channel from Inchon. Under the title "Sighting
                                        Flying Disks Again?", the Navy magazine reported: "Two huge
                                        columns of smoke rose to about 100 feet in height at the point of contact.
                                        No aircraft could be sighted by radar, or visually overhead, although
                                        the ceiling was unlimited. Identification remains a great mystery."

Feb. 23, 1950                           Santiago, Chile. **CHILE STILL HOARDS ITS PIX.**. Commander Augusto Vars Orrego, head of the Chilean Antarctic Base
                                        of Arthur Prat, saw, on several occasions during the Antarctic night,
                                        flying saucers, one above the other, turning at tremendous speeds.
                                        Photographs were taken.

                                        "It is concluded," the most recent official Air Force report
                                        states, "that there are sufficient psychological explanations
                                        for the reports of unidentified flying objects to provide
                                        plausible explanations not otherwise explainable. These errors
                                        in identifying real stimuli result chiefly from the inability to
                                        estimate speed, distance, and size."

Mar. 2, 1950                            Mexico City. **MEXICAN OBSERVATORY PHOTOGRAPHS ONE.**
                                        Luis Enrique Erro, head of the Tonantzintla Observatory near Puebla,
                                        reports an object flew through space and crossed the field of his
                                        Schmidt telescope. Luis Munch, fellow astronomer, photographed
                                        the object, which showed as a broad white streak diagonally across
                                        a jet black field. The craft appeared to be about the diameter of
                                        the moon and at least as bright.

                                        F. Arnold Richards, civic employee, saw objects with a bluish-white
                                        flame shooting out of the wide end. He reported three in all.

                                        Robert Antorena, Amilcar Lopez Sousa and Manuel Espejo, customs
                                        and border officials, saw a top-like disk traveling high in the
                                        sky and headed towards El Paso.

Mar. 11, 1950                           Juarez, Mexico. **NEW AND OLD MEXICO REPORT SIGHTINGS THE SAME DAY.**
                                        Luis Herrera, travel agency owner, saw a strange, disk-shaped
                                        object over the city for fifteen minutes. At the same time, John
                                        E. Baird of El Paso saw an object shaped like a globe, near
                                        Deming, New Mexico.

Mar. 13, 1950                           Mexico City, D.F.} **AIRPORT WEATHER EXPERT SEES FOUR IN MEXICO.**
                                        Santiago Smith, chief weather observer for the Mexico City Airport
                                        trained a telescope at an object shaped like a half-moon, one of
                                        four flying bodies crossing the airport at 35,000 to 45,000 feet.

Mar. 13, 1950                           Monterey, Mexico. **MONTEREY SEES ONE MAKE QUICK TURNS.**
                                        Francisco Martinez Soto, government airport inspector, saw an
                                        object moving in a straight line and changing its altitude by
                                        one and a half degrees in three minutes.
58
Mar. 16, 1950                           Delhi, Ontario. **ONTARIO REPORTS ONE PLAYING TAG.**
                                        Paul Repai, Mr. and Mrs. Andre Hertal and Steve Fodor saw a
                                        flying saucer at 4 am moving in jerks as if controlled, faster
                                        than a jet. It seemed bigger and duller when moving, smaller
                                        and brighter when still. It swished from side to side and hovered
                                        up and down, then it suddenly rose sharply and disappeared.

Mar. 16, 1950                           Miraflores, Peru. **SWISS IN PERU REPORTS ONE TAKE 5-MINUTE REST.**
                                        Julian Guardiola, Swiss Engineer, saw a disk flying from the south
                                        giving off a red and yellow glow. It stopped directly above them
                                        at about 4500 feet and remained for about five minutes. It then
                                        flew southward at tremendous velocity.

Mar. 16, 1950                           San Jose Purua, Mexico. **LANSING M.D. FILMS ONE ONE IN MEXICO.**
                                        Dr. W.C. Behen, of Lansing, Michigan, made both photographs and
                                        movies of a double truncated cone, silver in color, and eight or
                                        nine thousand feet in the air. The object disappeared from time
                                        to time, but would reappear to hover over one area for several
                                        minutes.

Mar. 18, 1950                           Altoona, Pennsylvania. **PENNSY M.D. SKETCHES HOW HIS OPERATED.**
                                        UP -- Dr. Craig Hunter, 47 of Berkeley Springs, WV, made a rough
                                        sketch of a flying saucer he saw at dusk Wednesday in the hope that
                                        it might help clear up the mysterious phenomena. The object appeared
                                        to be about 50 to 100 feet in diameter and was about 25 to 30
                                        feet thick in the center. A streamer about 200 feet long and 10
                                        inches wide trailed. The disk seemed to be constructed in three
                                        concentric partitions. The outer edge, which was 10 feet wide,
                                        appeared to be stationary and had slits covering about one-third of
                                        the area visible to him. Immediately in from the leading edge
                                        were two apertures about 4 and a half feet square. The second circle
                                        seemed to be the only part of the thing moving and it rotated with
                                        a great hissing whistle. Inner and largest part of the disk was
                                        also stationary. It was a dirty metallic color and definitely
                                        not an airplane.

Mar. 23, 1950                           Laguna Beach, California. **8 FLYING SAUCERS SPOTTED OVER LAGUNA.**
                                        UP -- Flying saucers have been spotted again, this time along
                                        the California coast by Dudley Gourley, 26, an Army aircraft
                                        observer for nearly three years. He said he saw the saucers
                                        moving slowly out to sea as he drove past El Moro on the coast
                                        highway.

Mar. 25, 1950                           Minnesota. **PICARD FORMS LIDDEL OF BALLOONATIC FRINGE.**
                                        Dr. Jean Picard, University of Minnesota scientist and pioneer in
                                        balloon ascent work, suggested in an interview with United Press
                                        that some "flying saucers" may be experimental balloons being
                                        sent up into the stratosphere by General Mills in cooperation with
                                        several universities and under contract with the Navy.

Mar. 27, 1950                           Washington, D.C.} **FLYING SAUCER NEAR PENTAGON.**
                                        UP -- A flying saucer has been reported almost in the backyard
                                        of the Air Force, the service that says the mysterious disks don't
                                        exist. Bertram A. Totten, a veteran private pilot, said he sighted
                                        an aluminum-colored disk about 40 feet in diameter and 10 feet
                                        thick while he was flying over Fairfax County, Virginia, on the
                                        outskirts of Washington.

Mar. 27, 1950                           Tulsa, Oklahoma. **TULSA CHECKS IN WITH 25.**
                                        C.W. Hughes, 1338 N. Boston Place, Tulsa, sighted at 6:16 am,
                                        25 flying saucers. The objects were silver-colored and flying at
                                        an elevation of 1000 feet.
66
Mar. 31, 1950                           Little Rock, Arkansas. **VETERAN PILOTS RATE THEM SUPERSONIC.**
                                        Capt. Jack Adams, and co-pilot G.W. Anderson, Jr., veterans of
                                        7000 and 6000 flying hours for the Chicago and Southern Air Lines,
                                        en route in their DC-3 from Memphis to Little Rock were within
                                        forty miles of Little Rock at 2,000 feet, they saw a lighted,
                                        fast-moving object about 1,000 feet above the DC-3 half a mile away
                                        and moving at a terrific speed: 700 to 1,000 m.p.h. They saw no
                                        reflection, exhaust, or vapor trail. It traveled in an arc, flashing
                                        a strong blue-white light.
67
Mar. 25, 1950                           Rome, Italy. **HITLER STILL FLYING AROUND IN ONE?**
                                        Professor Giuseppe Belluzzo, a 73-year-old Italian turbine engineer,
                                        said today that designs for flying saucers were prepared for Hitler
                                        and Mussolini in 1942. Belluzzo said: "It has crossed my mind that
                                        some great power is experimenting with flying disks—without explosives
                                        or atomic bombs. There is nothing supernatural or Martian about flying
                                        disks. It's just the most rational use of recently-evolved techniques."
                                        Belluzzo personally drafted plans for a "flying disk" 32 feet in
                                        diameter, but claimed they disappeared with Benito Mussolini when he
                                        fled to northern Italy in 1943.

Mar. 31, 1950                           Jalapa, Mexico, El Universal. **MEXICO SEES THEM SET AT SUNDOWN.**
                                        300 flying disks were reported flying above the city. They began
                                        to disappear about sundown.

Apr. 7, 1950                            Grenoble and Chambéry, France. **FRANCE SIGHTS SAUCERS, TOO.**
                                        Flying saucers were reported to have been seen in two localities
                                        of France. Residents of Grenoble reported a metallic object
                                        which appeared to remain stationary high in the sky. Inhabitants
                                        of Chambéry reported a saucer-like object which left a stream
                                        of vapor.

Apr. 19, 1950                           St. Paul, Minnesota} _St. Paul's Dispatch_. **AIRMAN SEES BANANAS WITH SAUCERS.**
                                        Fort Worth AP: Ira Maxey, a veteran of 3,600 flying hours in the
                                        United States Air Force, said he saw six flying "bananas" plus a
                                        flying saucer. They were moving slowly and appeared to be six or
                                        seven miles away. He described the air objects as without tails
                                        or noses, not like a saucer but more like a banana. The pictures
                                        Maxey took showed they left vapor trails.
71
Apr. 27, 1950                           South Bend, Indiana. **TWA PILOTS SEE ONE GO BY ON EXPRESS LANE.**
                                        Capt. Robert Adickes and First Officer Robert Manning, TWA pilots,
                                        saw a round glowing mass in the air as they flew over South Bend.
                                        The object was in sight for six or seven minutes as it overtook
                                        their plane at 2,000 feet. It was round with no irregular features
                                        and about one-tenth as thick as it was round. They gave chase
                                        but were soon outdistanced.

Apr. 30, 1950                           Mount Joy, Illinois. **IOWA REPORTS ONE EXPLODING.**
                                        Louis and Wilfred Wedemyer of Mount Joy saw a round flat saucer-shaped
                                        object spinning across the sky. Suddenly it exploded in
                                        the air like a firework display. It seemed to disintegrate.
                                        No noise for a few seconds, then a low rumble that lasted half a
                                        minute. The same phenomenon was observed in Burlington and Muscatibe, Iowa.

                                        A U.S. Air Force Reserve Colonel, Frank A. Flynn, talked in detail
                                        today of his encounter with a flight of more than a dozen "flying
                                        saucers". He said he is convinced that the objects he saw near
                                        Mount Diablo while flying his own plane from San Francisco to
                                        Sacramento in April of 1948, were controlled, experimental,
                                        American aircraft.

May. 7, 1950                            Colonna, Rome. _Los Angeles Examiner_. **WHEN IN ROME THEY FLY AS ROMANS.**
                                        Hundreds of persons on their way to work stopped to watch two
                                        flashing objects high over Rome's central piazza, Colonna. The
                                        two objects seemed to be a mile or more high and moved slowly.
                                        They appeared to be revolving on an axis and flashing at regular
                                        intervals, like smaller air beacons.

May. 11, 1950                           McMinnville, Oregon. **OREGONIAN GETS TWO ON FILM.**
                                        Paul Trent, Route 3, McMinnville, captured two photos of flying
                                        saucers in the backyard of his farm. The two pictures were taken
                                        about 50 seconds apart.

May. 24, 1950                           Montrose, Colorado. **FIFTEEN WITNESSES CONFIRM MRS. SEEVERS' SIGHTING.**
                                        Mrs. Clyde Seevers, one of sixteen Montrose ranchers who saw two
                                        sky objects as broad as large airplane's wings, said the craft
                                        was absolutely round and smooth without windows, motors, or tail
                                        assembly. They flew soundlessly and seemed to float along, then
                                        suddenly soared up swiftly and disappeared. Her report was corroborated
                                        by fifteen other ranchers in the vicinity.

Jun. 7, 1950                            London, England. **RAF PILOT REPORTS SIGHTING, RADAR A 'BLIP'.**
                                        An RAF pilot radioed his base: "Strange object seen. Looks like
                                        a flying saucer." Radar operators at the base picked up a strong
                                        "blip" on their screens. The air ministry withheld all information.

                                        The UP said a "disk-shaped object" roaring at an estimated speed
                                        of 1000 to 1500 mph. made five passes near Hamilton Air Force

Jun. 25, 1950                           Baker, New Mexico. **UNITED AIRLINES CREW SEES ONE 4 MILES UP.**
                                        Captain E. L. Remlin, First Officer David Stewart, and Observer Sam
                                        B. Wiper noticed a mysterious object while flying their UAL Main-liner
                                        at 14,000 feet between Las Vegas and Silver Lake about
                                        eight miles north of Baker, New Mexico. The craft had a bluish
                                        center with a bright orange tint and was flying horizontally at
                                        about 20,000 feet, faster than the plane, and about 20 miles away.

Jun. 29, 1950                           Fort Collins, Colorado. **POSTMAN SPOTS ONE WITH SATERN RING.**
                                        Hubert Hutt, a post office worker at Fort Collins, saw an object
                                        in the sky at 9:40 a.m. which appeared simultaneously with an
                                        airliner at about 3,000 feet elevation. It was at about 4,500 feet,
                                        traveling northwest, and resembled a silver snowball, circled
                                        by some kind of a ring. It was extremely maneuverable.

Jul. 29, 1950                           Springfield, Illinois. **CHIEF PILOT COLLIDES WITH ONE, UNHURT.**
                                        Jim Graham, chief pilot for Capital Aviation Co. of Springfield
                                        reported his plane was struck by a mysterious object resembling
                                        a blue streak with a tail of red flames. It was soundless and
                                        did not damage his plane."

Aug. 8, 1950                            North of Orange County, CA. _Los Angeles Daily News_. **FOUR COUNTIES POLLED ON THIS ONE.**
                                        A strange, green light the center of which seemed to be just north
                                        of Orange County in California, was seen over four counties: Los
                                        Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Riverside. Its light
                                        covered the greater part of Southern California south of the city
                                        of Los Angeles and north as far as Santa Monica Bay. Observers
                                        at San Diego reported that the whole sky was alight like a giant
                                        flash bulb. There was no sound.

Aug. 12, 1950                           Denver, Colorado. **YUMA SIGHTING QUITS AT SIGHT OF DRUGSTORE.**
                                        William Schocke, Yuma, saw, along with dozens of others, a dark,
                                        disk-shaped object with a dim glow around its rim. When it reached
                                        a point just above a drugstore, it abruptly ceased lateral flight
                                        and slices straight upwards, disappearing behind low-hanging
                                        clouds.

Sep. 10, 1950                           Mitchell Field, New York. **TW JET PILOTS LOSE in 30 MILE CHASE.**
                                        Lt. Wilbert S. Rogers and Capt. Edward Ballard, Mitchell Field
                                        Air Force jet pilots, chased a mysterious round flying object
                                        for thirty miles and couldn't catch it. They estimated its speed
                                        at 900 mph. They sighted the object over Sandy Hook, New Jersey,
                                        while on a routine flight. It was silvery-white and about the size
                                        of a fighter plane traveling at 20,000 feet.

Sep. 1950                               Venice, California. **BOY ASTRONOMER PHOTOGRAPHS ONE BY ACCIDENT.**
                                        Ivan Courtright, 14-year-old amateur astronomer set his camera at
                                        a six-hour exposure to photograph sky trails and accidentally
                                        obtained two photos. One of a saucer, when he clicked the shutter
                                        too soon, and the other a saucer trail taken on a longer exposure.
                                        The photo of the saucer coming right at the camera shows clearly
                                        the illuminated cloud surrounding it.

Sep. 1950                               Saw Bill Bay, Minnesota. **SAWBILLIES WATCH ONE LAND ON BAY.**
                                        F. A. Halstead of Duluth, Minn., and Ben Eyton, Editor of the
                                        _Steep Rocket Echo_, Ontario, reported the experience of a miner living
                                        in Antikokan who saw a flying saucer and a live crew in a cove of
                                        Sawbill Bay. They gave full details and told that they went back
                                        later with a camera and after a few days caught another saucer
                                        which spotted them and took off in a flash of green. There was
                                        There was a terrific high-pitched whine almost a blast, they explained, and
                                        then it was gone. One little figure that had been near the water's
                                        edge was only about halfway back when it took off. "Our impression
                                        was that something fell off when the saucer was about halfway
                                        down the bay. For some reason, our motor took a fit of not wanting
                                        to start. After we did get it going, it began to run hot,
                                        which ruined our chances of pursuing the object."

Sep. 21, 1950                           Hollywood, California. _Citizens-News_. **MYSTERY SHIPS OVER COLORADO.**
                                        Hundreds of witnesses reported strange objects which hurtled
                                        across Colorado last night just east of the Rocky Mountains.
                                        Astronomy students and Air Force officials said they were not
                                        meteorites. All reports said the objects moved horizontally,
                                        unlike meteorites, and most trained observers placed their
                                        altitude at 3,000 feet. The CAA control tower at Peublo estimated
                                        their speed at about 1,000 mph. The speed of the objects was
                                        so fast that reports along the 200 mile path were almost simultaneous.

Oct. 7, 1950                            Denver, Col. **'SAUCER' OVER ATOM CENTER.**
                                        UP - A Los Angeles construction worker has reported
                                        that a strange "blinking object" soared over a highly
                                        restricted area of the big atomic energy center last month. The
                                        object, which appeared to be at an altitude of 20,000 feet,
                                        flashed alternately bright and then black at intervals of two
                                        seconds. It was visible for three minutes and forty seconds.

Oct. 23, 1950                           North of Hancock Field. _Syracuse Post-Standard_. **TWO SIGHT SAUCER AT AIRPORT.**
                                        Allen Snyder and a companion, a city operations employee,
                                        who declined the use of his name, reported sighting a flying saucer
                                        three or four miles north of Hancock Field at an altitude of
                                        2,500 feet. Snyder, a veteran airplane observer and employee of
                                        Northwest Airlines, said it seemed larger than a conventional
                                        plane and was traveling at a good rate. It was colorless, but
                                        the shape was not discernible. No flame or exhaust was
                                        observed.

Nov. 1950                               Miami, FL. _Syracuse Herald-Journal_. **LIFE INDICATED ON OTHER PLANETS.**
                                        AP - Dr. Harold C. Urey, internationally known physicist
                                        and Nobel Prize winner in chemistry who helped develop the
                                        Atom bomb, told science students at the University of Miami
                                        that his study of the universe "leaves little doubt that life
                                        has occurred on other planets." He said he doubted that the
                                        human race was the most intelligent form of life.

Nov. 5, 1950                            Heathrow, England. **ENGLAND REPORTS ONE, SPEED 1000 MPH.**
                                        Four Pan-American Airways employees saw a brilliantly lighted
                                        object flying east to west in a straight line. Its speed was
                                        estimated at 1,000 mph, and the object was described as a bright
                                        white light, metallic colored, elongated, but as it went out of sight, spherical.

Nov. 12, 1950                           Barrow-in-Furness, England. **CIGAR-SHAPED OBJECT LOAFS OVER ENGLISH TOWN.**
                                        Edward Leslie Docker, wholesale fruit dealer in Hindpool-Road,
                                        saw a huge disc-shaped object from the window of his office.
                                        aluminum in color, flying at about 4,000 feet and around 80 mph.
                                        It seemed to be at least 100 feet long.

Nov. 12, 1950                           Didsbury, Manchester, England. **C.E. SPOTS ONE OVER MANCHESTER TOWN?**
                                        P.D. Bell, a civil engineer saw a strange circular aircraft fly
                                        overhead at great speed. It was noiseless with a bright light
                                        on the underside.

Nov. 21, 1950                           Rasco, Washington. **SCRIBES SEE CIGAR-SHAPOED ONE OVER WASHINGTON.**
                                        Perry Torbergson and Jack Anderson, both on the editorial staff
                                        of the _Columbia Basin News_, watched an object in the sky for
                                        eight minutes. It was shining, cigar-shaped, and glistened
                                        brightly. It stopped and hung in the air over the Hanford
                                        atomic plant and then disappeared on a southwesterly course.

Dec. 2, 1950                            Fairbanks, Alaska. **ALASKAN PILOT OBSERVES ONE BLOW UP.**
                                        G.C. Kelly, Reeves Airway pilot, approaching an airfield eight
                                        miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, saw an object overhead
                                        traveling at 100 miles per hour, so bright it was impossible
                                        to look at. Then there was an explosion and the object vanished.

Nov. 8, 1950                            Jarrow in Burgess, Britain. _The New York Times_. **FLYING SAUCER OVER HUNGRY BRITAIN.**
                                        A mysterious "flying sausage" was reported over Jarrow-in-Burgess
                                        Tuesday. Two men, one a reputable businessman, described the object
                                        as a "flying sausage with a dark outline and a transparent
                                        center." The object was traveling north at a fair speed both declared,
                                        and agreed there was no sound of motors.

Nov. 10, 1950                           Pacific Ocean off Southern CA. _San Diego Union_. **NAVY DESTROYER CHASES MYSTERIOUS OBJECT.**
                                        The United States destroyer, _Blue_, searched the Pacific Ocean off
                                        Southern California trying to track down a mysterious "unidentified
                                        object." A Navy report said the _Blue_ picked up the object on its
                                        radar screen and was trying to close in on it to identify it. No
                                        mention was made of what, when, how, or where the contact was made.

Dec. 7, 1950                            Rangely, Colorado. **OIL WORKERS WATCH ONE OVER RANGELY.**
                                        A shining aluminum-colored object hovered for more than a minute
                                        over the Rangely Oil Basin, then moved rapidly eastward. It was
                                        flat, disc-like in appearance, with a dome-like structure on top.
                                        It seemed to rotate as it hovered, emitting a flash of light at
                                        regular intervals. Its altitude was approximately 2,000 feet.

Dec. 23, 1950                           Amory, Mississippi. **MISSISSIPPI WATCHES ONE TURN OTHER CHEEK.**
                                        James Q. Tate of 2629 Avenue North, Birmingham, Ala., saw a red
                                        ball in the bright clear sky over Armory, Miss. He described it
                                        as being deeper red in the center than at the perimeter. On
                                        second look he saw that the red ball had turned over and appeared
                                        to be flat. The red color might have been because of the sun's
                                        reflection. It was one to one and a half miles above the town,
                                        approximately thirty feet in diameter, and moving at a terrific
                                        speed before it disappeared towards the northwest. Tate was
                                        about three miles away driving into town.

Jan. 1951                               Belgian Congo, Africa. **TWO LOOK FOR URANIUM IN AFRICA.**
                                        Two disks were sighted hanging over the Uranium mining pits and
                                        were pursued by planes. The object flew in a peculiar zig-zag
                                        course. A Spitfire came close enough to see a whirling rim on
                                        one of the saucers, but was easily and quickly outdistanced.

Jan. 1951                               Washington, DC. **OLSON GUESSES THEIR SPEED AT 10,000 MPH.**
                                        Robert Olson, 3708 35th St., NW, Washington, D.C., took a picture
                                        of seven or eight saucers flying over Washington in early January.
                                        A shot was taken from someone's back porch, and a double exposure
                                        resulted when the silvery saucers were sighted. Olson says: "I
                                        assure you, noting on that porch, not even the lighting cord
                                        that you can see hanging down is responsible for the images of the
                                        bright circles. Calculate how fast the object would have to
                                        be going to make such long streak in 1/50 of a second, assuming
                                        the saucers are 36 feet in diameter. I'd say between 2,000 and
                                        10,000 mph."

Jan. 16, 1951                           Kansas City, Mo. **AIR FORCE IMITATION DOESN'T FOOL THESE GIRLS.**
                                        Betty McCarty and Judy Royles of Kansas City sighted a huge red
                                        light with a green flickering light in the center. It appeared
                                        and disappeared several times. Betty and Judy, and Betty's
                                        husband, drove up onto the Cliff drive, and saw it hanging in the
                                        air over North Kansas City. It soared slowly around, down over
                                        Fairfax Airport, and searchlights were turned on it. It disappeared
                                        again but came back ten minutes later, appearing to be a green
                                        ball of light with a red trail. It was now very high in the sky
                                        and the only shape recognizable was that of a green sphere. The
                                        next day, the Air Force rigged up a plane with green lights and
                                        flew it around the city. The Air Force plane had a recognizable
                                        shape and a loud droning motor besides.

Jan. 20, 1951                           US. **TWO PILOTS DENY THIS ONE AS KNOWN AIRCRAFT.**
                                        Capt. Larry M. Vinther and co-pilot James R. Bachmeier, flying
                                        a Mid-Continent Airline plane, saw a straight-sided object, with
                                        no exhaust glow, jet pods, or engines. It performed maneuvers and
                                        turns at speeds impossible to known aircraft, according to
                                        Vinther.

Feb. 14, 1951                           Dayton, Ohio. **TWO CAPTAINS CAN'T GO ALONG WITH LIDDEL'S BALLOON THEORY.**
                                        Capr. J.E. Cocker and Capt. E. W. Spradley of Wright-Patterson Air
                                        Force Base, while tracking a large weather balloon, saw an
                                        object hovering at 50 to 60 thousand feet. Flat milky color
                                        made it resemble a dime. It gave three brilliant flashes and
                                        then disappeared from sight.
106
Feb. 19, 1951                           Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa. **THIS ONE POSES 17 MINUTES FOR PHOTOGRAPHS.**
                                        Two pilots and nine passengers of a regular plane flight from
                                        Nairobi to Mombasi, Africa, saw a huge cigar-shaped vessel, at
                                        first quite stationary over the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro, then
                                        as the plane drew near, rising rapidly at an estimated 100 mph
                                        and disappearing at 44,000 feet. The vessel was judged to be 200
                                        feet long, brilliantly polished except for four duller bars which
                                        ran vertically down its body. It had a huge fin or paddle-rudder
                                        at the stern, no exhaust. It remained in view for 17 minutes,
                                        long enough for three passengers to obtain photographs of the
                                        object.

Feb. 19, 1951                           San Diego Union. **MYSTERIOUS MISSILE ATTACKS NAVY SHIP.**
                                        The Navy reported today that one of its ships was attacked recently
                                        off the western shore of Korea by a powerful "mysterious" missile that
                                        kicked up a 100-foot column of water. According to the report appearing
                                        in the _Naval Aviation News_, the _USS Gardiner's Bay_ was steaming
                                        through the channel off Inchon when two "mysterious missiles, trailing
                                        long, white smoke plumes", plunged from the sky and landed off the
                                        ship's port bow. "No aircraft could be sighted by radar or visually
                                        overhead," the article added, "although the ceiling was unlimited."
                                        Identification of the missile remains a great mystery.

Feb. 26, 1951                           US. _Newsweek Magazine_. **"SAUCERS? NO! SKYHOOKS!" SAYS BALLOONATIC FRINGE.**
                                        Ever since the summer of 1947, when an Idaho businessman spotted the
                                        first flying saucer, excited people all over the country reported
                                        seeing the flat shiny disks flashing across the sky. Three pilots
                                        died pursuing the strange objects. So fantastic did the rumors and
                                        the resulting legend become that "little men from Mars" were said to
                                        have landed in the Mexican Desert in a spaceship, provoking the best
                                        seller _Behind The Flying Saucers_ by Frank Scully. Air Force officials
                                        were understandably annoyed last week to find the Navy making front-page
                                        headlines with a story long since buried in their files. Dr.
                                        Urner Liddel, chief of nuclear-physics at the Office of Naval Research
                                        told _Look Magazine_ that the saucers were actually huge plastic balloons
                                        carrying delicate instruments to study cosmic rays. Scully when asked
                                        for comment consigned Dr. Liddel "to the balloonatic fringe."

Jan. 27, 1951                           Carnoustle, Forfarshire. _London Weekly Overseas Mail_. **FIVE TRADESMEN TRADE EXPERIENCES.**
                                        live tradesmen in Carnoustle, Forfarshire, claim to have seen a flying
                                        saucer. It was glowing with a bright light "Just like a huge
                                        electric-light bowl," said Edward Thompson. The five men were working
                                        on a roof on Queen-Street when just after 2 p.m. they sighted the
                                        saucer moving through a cloudy patch. All watched the object for
                                        about 30 minutes. Occasionally a bright spark fell from it, as it
                                        moved through the sky. It was estimated as being "enormous".

Feb. 26, 1951                           Chicago, IL. _Chicago Daily News_. **SAUCERS MORE THAN JUST BALLOONS, SCIENTIST SAYS.**
                                        Dr. Anthony O. Mirachi, a former Air Force Scientist, brushed
                                        aside the idea that flying saucers are just balloons and urged
                                        a full-scale investigation. He said that as an assistant chief
                                        of a branch of the geophysical research organization, he conducted
                                        an investigation and recommended a considerable appropriation to
                                        press for the study of the strange phenomena. When asked to comment
                                        an Air Force spokesman said "In over 500 investigations, we have
                                        yet to find one concrete bit of evidence to back up these flying
                                        saucers."

Feb. 26, 1951                           Maquoketa, Iowa. _Syracuse Post-Standard_ **COPS, BOTH ON AND OFF DUTY, SEE THIS ONE.**
                                        A flying saucer was seen west-northwest of Maquoketa, Iowa, dropping
                                        toward the horizon. Chief operator at the state police radio station,
                                        off duty, and the man on duty, Jim Wheeler, both saw it plainly.
                                        It hovered and seemed to be orange or dull red. Then a second one,
                                        very bright white, came from the north, slightly lower, and on
                                        nearing the first, came up to its altitude. Both disappeared soon
                                        afterward.

                                        UP -- A strange object that looked like a crystal ball darted
                                        about the sky over Rainy Lake "just like a hummingbird," residents
                                        of the area reported today. Witnesses said the object streaked
                                        across the eastern end of the lake with a tremendous burst of
                                        speed, stopped suddenly, and hung apparently motionless in the
                                        sky for several minutes.

                                        speed of nearly 2,000 mph." "It was nearly 5,000 feet up," Varma
                                        said, "and made no sound." Varma mentioned 20 fellow Indian pilots also
                                        noticed the sudden appearance of a white streak approaching from the
                                        north headed by a cigar-shaped projectile. The object went in a straight
                                        line, he said, then began making loops and disappeared in a southwesterly
                                        direction.

                                        Rev. Milton Nothdurft, pastor of the First Methodist Church of Maquoketa,
                                        Iowa, reported that two saucers were seen this day from 10:20 to
                                        10:45 p.m. The next night, an operator of the state police radio reported
                                        another saucer in approximately the same area. Station WMT at
                                        Cedar Rapids reported that two saucers took off in a blinding flash on
                                        May 22 in broad daylight near Coggin.

                                        Officer Sweeter, on duty at the state police radio station, saw
                                        a moving light, west-northwest, but being a newcomer among saucer
                                        enthusiasts, hesitated to say anything more.

May. 22, 1951                           Maquoketa, Iowa. **STUDENTS SPOT ONE TAKE OFF.**
                                        High school students reported seeing a saucer "take off" in
                                        a blinding flash of speed near Coggan, Iowa, north of Cedar
                                        Rapids, and west-northwest of Maquoketa.

                                        AP - An American Airlines pilot said today he saw what
                                        appeared to be a bluish-white star moving back and forth at
                                        high speed in the Southwest today. Captain W.R. Hunt said he
                                        saw the object about 100 miles south of Dodge City. The object
                                        traveled at speeds from 500 to 1000 m.p.h. and after playing tag with
                                        the airplane, descended to four or three thousand feet.

                                        A letter brought Bill Roberta of WMT, Cedar Rapids, new bureau,
                                        on a 60-mile drive on the 23rd to investigate sightings at
                                        Maquoketa. He had kept a record of the stories since 1947. He
                                        mentioned that the mysterious phenomena had been seen by quite
                                        a few people on a lake near International Falls, Minnesota, and that
                                        a pilot in Kansas City had also reported a strange moving light.

May. 31, 1951                           Galesburg, Illinois. **GALESBURG COPS LOSE TRAIL.**
                                        City police south of Galesburg heard on short wave from Monmouth
                                        Ill., police talking about a strange moving light traveling toward
                                        the northwest. They were trying to get the others to see if it
                                        was observed from there, but evidently it was not.

                                        George Fawcett, a Mount Airy, NC senior at Lunchburg College
                                        has been a collector of information on flying saucers since
                                        1947. He was crossing the campus on the morning of June 5, when
                                        he saw an orange-colored disk high in the sky. He reports the
                                        disk zig-zagged, then settled down to a straight course and
                                        moved off to the west.

May. 31, 1951                           Kentucky. _Lexington Herald_. **MAGNETIC SCIENTIST EXPOSES "BALLOONATIC FRINGE".**
                                        US Navy Electronics Engineer Milan Rafayko - 1916-2000, formerly Milan Rafajko - took issue with the
                                        Lexington Herald for playing up Dr. Urner Liddel's explanation that flying saucers were
                                        balloons. "If all saucers were balloons at high altitudes," he wrote, "then what were those saucers
                                        sighted at low altitudes?" He wanted to know how a balloon could outmaneuver an F-51 fighter plane. The
                                        editor denied his paper was being "used" by the government to further any special theory. Rafayko
                                        charged it was an obviously fabricated story.

                                        Roger Shinkfield of 49 Magill ROad, St. Peters, Adelaide, sighting a
                                        white circular object directly over heasd and traveling south. It
                                        took seven seconds to reach the horizon. He estimated the height
                                        to be between 20,000 and 30,000 feet. No sound could be heard.

23:00                                   Portlanders abuzz with curiosity. Several persons who saw the
                                        thing about 11 pm described it as a long streak of light
                                        traveling slowly from east to west. Some said it resembled
                                        a meteor except that it was traveling too slowly. One man
                                        said it was followed by a trail of white smoke.

                                        A fireball was seen over Dayton, hovering in midair. It seemed
                                        to have two powerful beams of lights streaming down from the
                                        underside.

1947                                    Buffalo, New York. **BUFFALO MAN REPORTS ONE FOUR YEARS LATER.**
                                        Jolin S. Sarick of Buffalo, on July 22, 1951, describes a sighting of his in 1947:
                                        "I saw twin lights coming down and when I saw them they were
                                        already quite close to the ground. They were steady and the
                                        color was blue or green. The lights seemed about a mile
                                        away and in the direction of our airport which is 7 miles away.
                                        We have never before or since seen any lights from airplanes
                                        coming down or going up from the airport."

Jun. 9, 1951                            Richmond, VA. _The Kansas City Star_. **TOP SECRET: MAGNETIC STORM CAUSES MASS JET CRASH.**
                                        Air Force officials were tight-lipped today as they investigated the
                                        cause of the crash of eight F-84 jet fighters, the largest mass crash
                                        in jet aviation history. Three pilots of the eight ill-fated jets
                                        were killed, and two were injured as the planes tumbled out of the sky near
                                        Richmond yesterday. No one could explain what occurred to cause eight
                                        planes to crash from a formation of 34 at the same time. The Air Force quickly
                                        dropped a curtain of secrecy over its investigation, and all personnel
                                        were ordered "to give out absolutely no information regarding
                                        the plane crashes."

Jun. 29, 1951                           Los Angeles, CA. **ROWBOATS IN THE SKY.**
                                        By Matt Weinstock in _LA Times_. A man we know, a skeptic by the way, observed a strange object while
                                        sitting on the patio of his home near La Brea and Adams, Los Angeles,
                                        Saturday night (June 29, 1951) at 7:20 p.m. Its estimated height was
                                        5,000 feet. Several friends were present, one of whom observed it
                                        through binoculars. It looked like the bottom of a rowboat, except it
                                        was a perfect ellipse with a ring of red lights around the edges. In
                                        about five minutes, the object shot up at a tremendous speed and disappeared.

                                        **BALL OF FIRE FLIES ACROSS LA SKIES.**
                                        Police last night received dozens of telephone calls from persons
                                        reporting a "ball of red fire" moving across the southwestern
                                        skies. The object was said to be traveling low on the horizon
                                        in an erratic fashion and was visible for about 10 minutes.
                                        Griffith Park Observatory said it had no explanation other than
                                        that the object may have been an airplane or the planet Venus.

                                        Engineering Department and Dr. A. G. Bert, professor of chemical
                                        engineering, and Dr. W. I. Robinson, professor of geology, all
                                        saw two strange formations hurtling through the sky over Lubbock,
                                        Texas from horizon to horizon in three seconds. No shock waves
                                        were felt, indicating the craft to be in the stratosphere, 50,000
                                        feet or higher. Speed was 1,800 mph. if at one mile high,
                                        18,000 if 50,000 feet high. Shape could not be determined, but
                                        each object gave off a glow of light.

Sep. 11, 1951                           Mitchell Field, New York. **AIR FORCE PILOTS CLOCKS THEM AS TOO FAST FOR F-86'S.**
                                        Two Air Force jet pilots reported today that they chased a mysterious
                                        round flying object at 900mph, for thirty minnutes. Lt. Wilbert
                                        S. Rogers of Columbia, PA, pilot of the plane said: "We couldn't
                                        have caught it in an F-86." (The US's fastest jet fighter.)

Aug. 30, 1951                           Lubbock, Texas. **LUBBOCK LIGHTS ON FILM CONFIRMED.**
                                        Carl Hart Jr. of Lubbock, Texas, took several photographs today of
                                        18 saucers flying in formation. An Air Force Intelligence team, now admitted
                                        to be continuing flying saucer investigations, said, "These photos are
                                        legitimate." In one, a larger mother-ship could be seen off to one
                                        side, apparently controlling the mass flight of the saucers which
                                        were in an inverted V formation. Hart released the photographs to
                                        Acme and the Air Force.

                                        Mrs. Betty McCarty reported seeing two groups of circular objects
                                        one slightly above the other, about 12 miles east of Kansas
                                        City. She estimated the lower group of contained at least 150 and
                                        the upper group about 50. She said that they changed color and
                                        position with no visible effort and she heard no motor noise.

Sep. 6, 1951                            Matador, Texas. _The Matador Tribune_. **MATADOR GENERATIONS BACK UP LUBBOCK.**
                                        Three generations of the Tilson family, Mrs. Tilson, her daughter,
                                        and her granddaughter, all of Matador, saw at close range something
                                        strange in the sky which might have been a flying saucer.
                                        They were not mistaken, nor were they excited. The sighting
                                        over Lubbock occurred the same day.

Sep. 24, 1951                           White Sands, New Mexico. **TWO MORE REFUSE TO JOIN MIDDEL'S BALLOONATIC FRINGE.**
                                        AP -- J. Gorden Vaeth, US Navy Aeronautical engineer and
                                        Charles B. Moore, Jr., an aerologist engineer, saw a white object
                                        which was not their balloon. Moore turned the telescope on it
                                        and saw an ellipsoid about two and a half times as long as it
                                        was wide. It was gleaming white, but didn't have any metallic
                                        shine. It was travelling too fast to get a clear focus in the
                                        telescope.

                                        Four northern New York residents claimed today to have seen a
                                        fantastic flying ball, powered by a motor driven propeller, land
                                        near St. Regis and Hogansburg, and then take off and vanish
                                        over Massena. Alex LaFrance, Peter Philips and Francis Arquette
                                        told police they saw it land in a field near the Canadian border.
                                        They said the sphere took off with a humming noise at about 25
                                        mph. Mrs. Angus Cook said the ball landed about 200 yards
                                        from her home. Also see: https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-post-star-report-balloon-lands-soar/132051701/

19:15                                   Mrs. Betty McCarty reported seeing a large bright object flashing
                                        red, green, and white. It was visible from 7:15 until 11:20.
                                        While under her observation, the object, unlike a star, moved
                                        from south to east.

                                        Two CAA employees say they saw an oval object fly over Terre Haute
                                        yesterday at a speed they estimated at 18,000 mph. The object
                                        appeared at an altitude of about 3,000 feet and disappeared quickly
                                        in the sunlight cloudless sky.

                                        **HUMAN TRIANGULATION MEASURES THIS ONE.**
                                        The flying saucers, long grounded insofar as Colorado is concerned,
                                        were aloft again in the lonely skies of Northern Weld County.
                                        M. G. Foster, operator of a ranch 11 miles northeast of Grover, Colorado,
                                        reported two members of his family observed a strange object flying low
                                        in the sky near sunset on September 27. The cigar-shaped object traveled
                                        in a perpendicular position northward until it disappeared in the
                                        cloudless skies of Wyoming. The object was also seen by Foster's son,
                                        who was several miles away, and by an unrelated man in Hereford, Colorado,
                                        12 miles away.

                                        Mr. and Mrs. Robert Greenwood of Chicago, snapped pictures of
                                        what seems to be a flying saucer while vacationing in Cody, WY.
                                        They had noticed nothing unusual in the sky nor had they heard
                                        the road of any airplane motors. They found the strange object
                                        in the top top center of the picture only after they returned home
                                        and had their firm processed.

                                        AP -- Authorities were undecided tonight whether the flash
                                        of light seen over Sugarloaf mountain in Western Arizona this
                                        morning was a burning plane or a meteorite. Some persons said
                                        they saw a flaming silver plane crash into the mountain. Others
                                        reported seeing a flash of light, but said they didn't believe
                                        it was a plane. A CAA spokesman said no plane had been known to
                                        be flying in the area at the same of the reported crash.

Nov. 7, 1951                            Oklahoma City, OK. _Kansas City Star_. **A FIRE STREAK IN THE SKY - EARLY.**
                                        An AP dispatch from Oklahoma City reported a meteorite which sounded
                                        like "someone running across the porch." It startled Oklahoma
                                        residents this morning before it apparently disintegrated. Reports
                                        from surrounding communities told of the ball of fire that flashed
                                        through the heavens about 7:20 am. Enid residents reported a
                                        ball of fire that flashed blue, purple, red, and silver. At Waco
                                        where four people reported seeing the flash, Dr. Walter J. Williams,
                                        astronomer at Baylow University, said the meteor was apparently
                                        one of the Leonides which fall about November 19. Today's visitor
                                        must have been an early one.

                                        **FIERY TRAIL IN THE SKY.**
                                        AP -- Scores of New Yorkers reported seeing
                                        a strange light streaking across the sky late this afternoon.
                                        Reports described it as a "ball of fire", a "reddish streak of
                                        fire", and a "pink streak" high in the sky. It took a few minutes
                                        to pass from horizon to horizon, moving westward. The phenomenon
                                        was observed over a 20-mile area from Middletown to Port Jervis,
                                        where police said an object with a bright head leaving a trail was
                                        seen for about 3 minutes, vanishing in the direction of
                                        Scranton, PA. Meteorological and aeronautical sources in New
                                        York had no explanation.

Nov. 9, 1951                            Albuquerque, NM.  _Kansas City Star_. **BAFFLED BY SKY BLAZES.**
                                        AP -- Twin fireballs blazed across the New
                                        Mexico sky near the Mexican border yesterday. Ground observers
                                        and fliers, some blinded momentarily, viewed the phenomena from
                                        points 350 miles apart. One eyewitness report came from nearly
                                        100 miles south of the border, in Chihuahua, Mexico. There were
                                        widely conflicting estimates of where the objects crashed to
                                        earth. A ranking authority on meteors said recent frequency
                                        of the fireballs is "without parallel in the whole of recorded
                                        history."

                                        Ralph Richer of Cedarvale Road reported that at exactly 8:42
                                        something that looked like a low-flying rocket flashed from east
                                        to west across the sky. He said it had a blue head, a yellow
                                        tail and was trailed by red sparks. An unidentified Westvale
                                        woman said she was driving home and stopped at the corner of
                                        Salisbury and Orchard roads to watch an unusual cloud formation
                                        when three round white spheres suddenly appeared in the sky,
                                        two of them traveling at terrific speed while the remaining
                                        one seemed motionlessly suspended in the air.

                                        a motorist. All agreed three streaks of light, spinning counter-clockwise,
                                        passed rapidly through the sky toward Philadelphia.

                                        are going to become ocean-hopping passenger ships. They will be the
                                        express ships of the air, and bring American and Europe within one
                                        or two hours of flight."

                                        Guy B. Marquand, Jr., a carpenter, photographed a saucer from a
                                        mountain highway southeast of Riverside. He said the object
                                        swept noiselessly by, "moving fast like a jet plane". He got
                                        his camera, and snapped the picture when the object flew in
                                        front of it a second time. Two friends were with him at the
                                        time.

17:15                                   Mrs. L. E. Hewitt and her husband reported seeing a saucer on
                                        Nov. 24, along the coast road just above Santa Barbara, at
                                        about 5:15 pm. The object was shaped like a ball and seemed
                                        to be suspended in air when it suddenly moved rapidly to the North.

Dec. 7, 1951                            Kansas City, MO. **COP SPOTS ONE ABOVE; 'NO BALLOON', HE'S TOLD.**
                                        A Kansas City policeman sighted a flying saucer directly above
                                        him. He called the airport and asked if there was a weather
                                        balloon up. They said no, because the wind was too strong. He
                                        told them of his sighting. "If this was a balloon it would
                                        be going about 70 mph due northwest and most certainly
                                        couldn't be going into such a strong wind", was the airport's
                                        opinion.
153
Dec. 8, 1951                            San Francisco, CA. L.W. Clopton and J. Junkurth sighted a strange object, circular
                                        to elliptical of a brilliance very similar to that of the moon
                                        which was seen at the same time. The craft was either close at
                                        hand and moving slowly or distant and fast. The latter seems
                                        to be true due to color and relative brilliance. A northwest
                                        wind about 15 or 20 mph was blowing. The saucer traveled in
                                        an apparent level arc W SW of the Sun.

                                        Mr. and Mrs. Hank Fine, former Air Force Intelligence Major, of
                                        Hollywood California, saw a brilliant flash with a green tail
                                        traveling horizontally across the sky. The night was clear and
                                        brilliantly starlit.

Jan. 1, 1952                            North Bay, Ontario. W. J. Yeo, a master telecommunications superintendent, and Sgt. D.
                                        V. Crandell, an instrument technician, reported sighting a saucer
                                        over the air base. The object appeared to be at great height,
                                        probably outside the earth's atmosphere and moved at supersonic
                                        speed. It was visible for 8 min. 43 sec. and moved roughly
                                        parallel to the earth although changing directions slightly at
                                        times, zig-zagging, climbing and diving. The object was reddish-orange
                                        in color and Yeo said it definitely was not a meteor,
                                        balloon or ordinary aircraft.

                                        A cigar-shaped object with a tail resembling a string of lighted beads
                                        raced across the sky here and looked for a time as if it was going
                                        to crash in the city, police said today. Sheriff's deputies Al Bolman
                                        and Jim Mattney, who spotted the thing early yesterday, said they
                                        thought originally it was a flaming airplane. They stated it threw
                                        sparks and flame out both ends and cruised along at about 1,000 feet.
                                        It appeared under control.

                                        Capt. Claf Rudbeck of the War Pilot School in Ljungbuhed, spotted
                                        a clearly lit and unfamilar object flying at great altitude over
                                        Northern Skane, Thursday night. He chased the object until it
                                        disappeared over the coast. A pursuit plane from the Skanske
                                        Air Fleet joined the case but couldn't spot the saucer. No observation balloons

                                        flying saucer Captain Rudbuck chased over Skane yesterday was
                                        a meteorological balloon released from the Physical Institute
                                        at Lund, though Captain Rudbuck insists the object was lit and
                                        was observed at night, two factors not common to balloons.

                                        Objects, globe or disk-shaped, bright orange in color and emitting
                                        occasional flashes of blueish light, were seen by crew members of
                                        two B-29's at widely separated points around midnight, Jan. 29.
                                        One sighting was over Wonsan, the other over Sunchon. Two crew
                                        members in each plane made the sighting and confirmed each other's
                                        observations. The Sunchon disks flew parallel to the B-29 for
                                        one minute -- The Wonson objects flew alongside for five minutes.
                                        Both crews believes the objects to be globular.

                                        from his back window. He saw an orange globe emitting blue
                                        flames traveling approximately 180 mph, 15 feet off the
                                        ground and about the size of a basketball.

                                        seeing a strange red object moving across the sky on Feb. 11.
                                        They say it zig-zagged across the sky, but continued on a
                                        definite course.

                                        A resident, who wanted her identity kept secret, saw a white
                                        streak in the southwest sky. It was about 6 or 7 feet long and
                                        about a foot wide at the end closest to earth. It did not
                                        move, then widened to about two feet wide and 12 or 14 feet
                                        long. It looked like a mass of tiny stars and stayed in the
                                        same position. Then it closed up to its original size and
                                        was gone in about three or four minutes. This report can be
                                        found at the weather office of Lulu Island.

                                        Four persons observed a star-like, silvery object shortly before
                                        midnight. It moved toward the observers from the south about
                                        45 degrees over the horizon, then turned eastward. It looked
                                        like a huge silvery star except that it shimmered. Observers
                                        were not able to tell its size, height, or speed, as they had
                                        nothing to compare it with. It flashed out of sight, and about
                                        a minute higher. Then it made a sharp right angle turn and
                                        headed south. Before the object disappeared it seemed to make
                                        3 sharp jumps up and down. It made no sound and was in sight for
                                        a total of about four minutes.

                                        Charles T. Earley heard wind in his back yard and saw an object
                                        shining like chrome stop about 1,500 feet overhead and hover.
                                        It was a big, whirling ring, about 30 feet across. It shot sky-ward
                                        and vanished at unbelievable speed.

Apr. 4, 1952                            Benson, AZ. _Los Angeles Times_. **AIR FORCE MEN SIGHT HUGE FLYING SAUCER.**
                                        Two Air Force pilots said today that they
                                        watched for an hour a huge, oval-shaped object, five or six times
                                        the size of a B-29 bomber, which hovered about 55,000 feet
                                        above them. The object had no wings. Chick Logan, veteran
                                        flight commander from Marana Air Base, tried to investigate,
                                        but could go no higher than 14,000 feet because of lack of
                                        oxygen. The object was bright and shone like polished aluminum.
                                        Flight instructor Paul Wilkerson said it was too large for a
                                        weather balloon.

                                        The same observers who sighted an object over
                                        Hammond on March 14 reported a similar sighting. A star-like
                                        object appeared in the southern sky (the same place where the
                                        other had occurred) about 10:30 pm. The color was green and
                                        turned orange-amber as it came closer. It seemed to be closer
                                        than its predecessor. It made sharp turns, seemed to stop, then
                                        turned bright red and became ovalish in shape. When it headed
                                        toward the horizon, it turned back to amber, then faint green
                                        and silvery white as it disappeared. No sound was heard.

                                        A full-page advertisement by Life magazine raised the question:
                                        "Are these visitors from space?" featured today's _LA Times_ and other
                                        metropolitan dailies throughout the country. Beneath a reproduction of Carl
                                        Hart's "Lubbock Lights", was the simple, declarative statement in bold-faced
                                        type: "There **is** a case for interplanetary saucers." The ad copy went on to
                                        declare that the existence of flying saucers was no longer being pooh-poohed by
                                        the Air Force, that the flying saucers and fireballs, such as those pictured in
                                        the advertised feature, were no psychological phenomena, not products of U.S.
                                        research, not Russian developments, and not mirages. A reproduction of Marilyn Monroe as
                                        seen on the cover of _Life's_ April 7, 1952 issue, was inserted in the lower
                                        right-hand corner of the ad.

Apr. 8, 1952                            Los Angeles, California. **THEORY ON FLYING SAUCERS EXPLAINED.**
                                        Spokesmen for the University of Social Research sought to convince
                                        newsmen that they have solved the flying saucer mystery.
                                        Substance of the discovery credited to Inventor Townsend
                                        Brown is that saucers operate in a field of electro-gravity
                                        that acts like a wave, with the negative pole at the top and
                                        the positive pole at the bottom. The saucer travels like a
                                        surfboard on the incline of a wave that is kept moving by
                                        the saucer's electro-gravitational generator. All three men
                                        are convinced that flying saucers are real, controlled by an
                                        intelligence rather than a pilot and capable of speeds up to
                                        186,000 mps. They say that space travel will be possible in
                                        10 years. When asked if he had a degree, Bradford Shank replied:
                                        "No, I'm free of those encumbrances. That's why I
                                        find it so easy to talk in these new terms."

                                        years now, but since _Life_ and _Colliers_ have now given credence
                                        openly in articles to the theory that saucers are from outer
                                        space, we feel it is time for the public to know. Electricity
                                        and magnetism have been coupled, which then creates a magnetic
                                        field to propel an object with no machinery.

                                        the General Mills balloon experimentation project said the objects--
                                        neither balloons, airplanes, or stars--were sighted in a spectacular
                                        series of aerobatics. J. J. Kaliszewski, supervisor of balloon manufacture
                                        for the Aeronautical Research Laboratories, said he first saw the
                                        objects on October 10, 1951, while in an experimental balloon aloft.
                                        This object, showing a "peculiar glow," came toward them in a shallow
                                        dive, then leveled off and slowed down. It hovered momentarily, made
                                        a sharp left turn, climbed with tremendous acceleration, and disappeared.

                                        A green fireball was seen over Hammond BC, the same area
                                        which reported previous sightings this month. It moved in from
                                        the south but clouds interfered and further observation was not
                                        possible. The observer thought that the light operates on a
                                        steady schedule.

Apr. 11, 1952                           Temiskaming, Ontario, Canada. _North Bay Daily Nugget_.
                                        **SAUCERS IGHT-SEE OVER CANADIAN TOWN.**
                                        Villi Lefebvre reported seeing six saucer-shaped objects diving
                                        up and down over Temiskaming, Ontario. He said they made no
                                        noise and were not conventional aircraft, although they left
                                        vapor trails in their wake.

                                        **ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD BUT COULD BE SAUCER.**
                                        E. H. Russell, a veteran airman with 13 years in the service
                                        and Flight Sgt. Reg McRae said they spotted a bright amber disk
                                        in the sky over the airfield at North Bay, Ontario around 8:30 pm.
                                        The object came from the southwest, moved across the field, stopped,
                                        an then took off in the reverse direction. It climbed at
                                        an angle of 30 degrees at terrific speed and disappeared.

                                        **FLYING SAUCERS COULD BE REAL, ADMIT TOP CANADIAN SCIENTISTS.**
                                        No longer scoffing, RCAF Intelligence and top Canadian scientists
                                        today went on record as believing that "flying saucers" could
                                        not be laughed off as optical illusions. Theirs was the complete
                                        change of attitude from that of three years ago when flying
                                        saucer, mysterious disks and fireballs speeding through North
                                        American skies were regarded as something close to a joke. The
                                        RCAF said its intelligence was investigating as a bona fide
                                        phenomenon, the case of the flying saucers. Dr. O.M. Solandt,
                                        Chairman of the Defence Research Board said: "We are as mystified
                                        as anyone else.. are are keeping an open mind."

Apr. 16, 1952                           Hamilton, Ontario. **SAUCER 'OUT OF THIS WORLD'.**
                                        45 persons said they saw what appeared to be an unusual form of
                                        blimp hanging motionless above Milton for about 15 minutes. A
                                        woman reported the thing with 4 other persons, who were with her
                                        during the time of the observation, and said that the main body
                                        looked black, but there was a halo-like fringe of color around it.
                                        The object looked like something out of this world, she said.

Apr. 17, 1952                           Lake Ontario, Canada. _Toronto Daily Star_. **SAUCER MISHAP?**
                                        Lifesavers and police searched Lake Ontario for an object reported
                                        to have plunged in flames more than a mile off Scarborough Bluffs.
                                        Nothing could be found and there were no aircraft missing. Several
                                        residents reported seeing an object trailing black smoke
                                        shoot downward from the sky and then a puff of slow rising smoke
                                        that lingered in the sky for a considerable time afterward. A
                                        woman saw a ball of fire with a black tail of smoke.

                                        **DISK SPEEDS OVER NORTH BAY.**
                                        A resident of North Bay, Miss Bernice Byers reported a noiseless,
                                        round object traveling "quite fast and high" over the district
                                        at 11 a.m. The object passed from west to east leaving a vapor
                                        trail.

Apr. 17, 1952                           North Bay, Ontario, Canada. _North Bay Daily Nugget_.
                                        **FIREBALL OVER NORTH BAY.**
                                        A glowing fireball was observed by at least 15 people in two
                                        sections of the town. A group of young people and crews in the
                                        ONR YARDS made the sighting and the two reports were identical.
                                        It was a multicolored object, swooping and climbing at high
                                        speed. Both groups spotted the object at about 10:00 p.m.
                                        It is interesting to note that the Canadian Atomic Research
                                        Center at Chalk River is only about 130 miles northeast of North Bay,
                                        where the highest activity of strange objects is reported.

Apr. 17, 1952                           Ottawa, Canada.  _Ottawa Evening Journal_. **FLYING SAUCER THEORY STUMPS DEFENSE RESEARCH BOARD.**
                                        The Defense Research Board this afternoon opened its file on
                                        investigations made into the mystery of the Flying Saucers. The
                                        Board disclosed it had 30 different reports of strange objects
                                        scudding through the upper atmosphere. In the great majority
                                        of cases, the Board frankly admitted, it was baffled. It
                                        cautioned that the reports could not simply be dismissed as
                                        imaginative nonsense. Among the 30 cases the Board was able to
                                        specifically find the cause or source of a "few" of the phenomena.
                                        But the rest, the Board openly confessed, cannot be explained.

Apr. 18, 1952                           Montreal. **MANY SEE ONE OVER MONTREAL.**
                                        A Montreal trainman saw a flying saucer over the city shortly
                                        after 7 a.m. The object was very shiny, like a mirror with the
                                        sun on it and the reflection was constant. He could see the
                                        object for a good 15 to 30 seconds.

                                        Hammond BC. -- A bluish object, spherical in shape, was observed
                                        by Mrs. Walter Ritchie near Alouette River. It was shimmering and
                                        stood still. Time of observation: 11:30 a.m. Sky, clear and
                                        cloudless.

Apr. 20, 1952                           Toronto, CA.  _Toronto Telegram_. **50 VISIT TORONTO.**
                                        A Wychwood resident reported seeing a collection of about 50
                                        lights in V formation moving rapidly from southeast to northwest
                                        around 10:30 p.m. He said the lights were dim orange in color
                                        and appeared to be at a great height. He could hear no sound, but
                                        was able to observe an arc of approximately 30 degrees in the sky
                                        and the collection of lights appearing and disappearing over the
                                        distance in approximately 6 seconds. The observer conceded he
                                        was shaken by the experience.
                                        Several radio stations broadcasted this report and said that
                                        the objects were picked up on Canadian and American radar, but
                                        this never appeared in the newspapers.

Apr. 21, 1952                           Browerville, Minn. **SAUCERIANS JOIN BALL GAME?**
                                        "It was on a farm 3 miles east of Long Prairie, Minn., about 2:30 in
                                        the afternoon, April 21, 1952. I was playing 'catch' with my cousin
                                        when a dirty grayish saucer began hovering above us," reported Ronny
                                        Gmyrek of Browerville, Minn. "We ran to get my cousin's binoculars,
                                        and both could see it had a definite hump in the middle with another
                                        smaller one behind this. It made no sound, except when it left, and
                                        then only a hum. I have seen many balloons but in the 3 minutes we
                                        watched this one, I know it couldn't have been a balloon."

Apr. 21, 1952                           London, Ontario, Canada. **MYSTERY CRAFT REPORTED FLYING AT 1,000 MPH.**
                                        Widely separated reports of an unidentified craft high in the skies,
                                        leaving a vapor trail and traveling at a speed of more than 1,000 mph,
                                        were received last night from western Ontario points. Canadian Air
                                        Force reserve fighters here were ordered to intercept the mysterious
                                        craft. The pilots reported they could not come anywhere near the source
                                        of the vapor trail, although they pushed their planes to more than
                                        450 miles an hour. Air Force Officials said no high-speed, high-flying
                                        jet aircraft were aloft at the time.

Apr. 20, 1952                           London, ON. _Toronto Daily Star_. **SAUCER OUTDISTANCES MUSTANG.**
                                        A "mystery plane" was reported over Toronto, London, and other
                                        places in southern Ontario. The object could not be seen, but
                                        it left a vapor trail in the sky. Over London, it was chased by
                                        a Mustang fighter plane (450 mph), and the pilot of this plane
                                        said it seemed as though he were standing still in comparison
                                        with the speed of the object. He was positive that it was not
                                        an ordinary aircraft. In London the speed of the mystery "plane"
                                        was estimated at 2,000 mph or more. The RCAF explained it
                                        as the new British Canberra jet bomber (speed about 600 or 700 mph).

Apr. 21, 1952                           Moplson, Man. **MULTICOLORED DISK OVER MOSLON.**
                                        Several persons reported a whirling object that gave off light.
                                        The sparkling disk kept changing color as it streaked across
                                        the sky.

Apr. 22, 1952                           Winnipeg, Canada.  _Winnipeg Free Press_. **MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS OVER CITY.**
                                        Residents reported strange lights and objects over the city,
                                        between 10 and 11 p.m. The lights changed color from orange
                                        and red to green and black. Brilliant white lights were also
                                        reported. The lights or objects make sharp turns and were
                                        judged to be moving slower and higher than ordinary aircraft.
                                        They came from the north, stopped, and then went back the same way.
                                        Traffic control at Stevenson Field reported normal activity.

                                        objects flying in two V-formations at 7:30 p.m. Five orange-colored
                                        objects with bluish glow at their rear, formed the first "V."
                                        Three formed a smaller V inside the first. They came at
                                        terrific speed from the south and at their northern end of the sweep
                                        they shot sharply upward and disappeared.

                                        Mrs. N. Gataint of Regina, Saskatchewan, said she awakened during the
                                        night and saw a strange object moving in the sky in a southwesterly
                                        direction. The object, she reported, stood still for a few
                                        seconds, then shot out spurts of fire and moved on. It had a
                                        dark tail like a kite and was shaped like a dinner plate.

Apr. 26, 1952                           North Bay, Ontario. **'FLYING BASEBALL' OVER LAKE WILCOX.**
                                        Three persons reported a saucer five miles west of Lake Wilcox
                                        which was bright and hazy, about the size of a baseball. Visible
                                        for six seconds it flashed across the observers' view from south
                                        to north. The object hovered for a while and suddenly shot upward
                                        with tremendous velocity. When it turned on its side, it
                                        appeared to be flat.

Apr. 24, 1952                           Austin, Texas. **GLOWING OBJECTS IN SKY REPORTED IN TEXAS.**
                                        Strings of glowing pink objects, all of them moving northward, were
                                        reported in the skies over Austin Wednesday night. Sightings were
                                        reported from widely scattered parts of town shortly after 8 p.m.
                                        However, both the U.S. Weather Bureau and the Airport Control Tower,
                                        where a 24-hour watch of the skies is maintained, reported no unusual
                                        phenomena. Reports of the strange glowing objects were also received
                                        in Fort Worth.

May. 1, 1952                            Ottawa, Ontario. **OTTAWA SPOTS GREEN ONE.**
                                        A silvery green disk was reported by several persons at 9:22 p.m.
                                        It was described as huge and traveling at a tremendous speed.
                                        The object was in view for less than one minute, and the reports
                                        from different places checked. One observer said, "There appeared
                                        to be an eerie strange fluorescence of bluish-white tinge or delicate
                                        green-like halo surrounding it and there was no sound."

                                        Three persons saw a long cigar-shaped form, coming
                                        down at a terrific rate of speed. The object was silvery in
                                        color; it paused for a moment and then suddenly whirled over on
                                        its side, returning in the same direction where it came from.
                                        The observers said that it was not a jet plane or any other
                                        man-constructed machine. They were on the top of Mount Royal
                                        (in the middle of the city) during the observation.

                                        Secretary of the Navy Dan Kimball, en route from Pearl Harbor to
                                        Guam, said the pilot of his ship and his co-pilot came back to
                                        the cabin and reported a flying saucer had appeared and had
                                        flown abeam the Secretary's plane for some distance, then
                                        vanished. A following plane was notified and reported that
                                        a saucer had flown along his wing also, and then disappeared.

                                        A dozen people reported they saw a flying saucer over the Sydney area
                                        and at Pearkes, a town 180 miles west of here. The witnesses described
                                        the object as a cigar-shaped, well-lighted and silent in its
                                        operations. They reported it flew at an altitude of about 4,000 feet
                                        and at an estimated speed of 500 miles per hour.

                                        Photographers Ed Keffel and Joao Martins shot five pictures of
                                        a saucer as it came in over the sea, losing altitude as it
                                        approached. They said it passed several hundred feet over their
                                        heads and appeared to be rocking like a slowly falling leaf. It
                                        seemed larger than a commercial airplane and was round and wingless.

                                        The military attache at the United States Embassy in Rio de
                                        Janeiro examined today negatives of five photographs of a
                                        flying saucer sighted over Rio Wednesday and called them the
                                        best he had ever seen of the phenomenon. Col. Jack Werely
                                        Hughes and several Brazilian Air Force officers visited the
                                        office of the newspaper _O Cruzeiro_ to study the photographs
                                        shot by the paper's cameramen, Ed Keffel and Joao Martains.
                                        Following publication, the pictures will be made available to
                                        the United States Embassy for study by the American Air Force.

May. 12, 1952                           Seattle, WA. _Los Angeles Herald & Express_. **SEATTLE SKY EXPLOSION, SAUCER OR METEOR?**
                                        Responsible observers believed today that a blinding blast which
                                        rocked the city of 500,000 persons may have been an exploding
                                        meteor, but talk of flying saucers or guided missiles could be
                                        heard on any street corner. An intelligence officer at McChord
                                        Air Base near Tacoma said an official statement may be released
                                        later today. Residents were awakened at 1:30am yesterday
                                        by the blast, which "rumbled like a freight train". The eerie
                                        blue-white light was seen at an estimated elevation of 2,000
                                        feet and was visible 60 miles away. The explosion occurred over
                                        North Seattle, and was witnessed by many, including Northwestern
                                        Airlines pilot Bert Carlson. He sighted the object as he
                                        prepared to land at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
                                        "It was at about 7,000 feet when it suddenly shattered into
                                        eight pieces which looked like chain lightening. Fireballs
                                        trailed to the earth", he said.

                                        Mr. Albert Ditman reports a flying saucer over Far Horizons in
                                        the early morning with such a brilliant light that it lit up
                                        the mountain range for miles.

                                        Fireballs in the sky and flashing elliptical bathtubs thought to
                                        be meteorites, were visible over many parts of the city shortly
                                        after midnight today. Police switchboards reported numerous
                                        calls from persons who said the phenomena resembled a greenish-red
                                        streak of light.

                                        Two Soviet authors and two popular science magazines were taken to
                                        task for spreading pseudo-scientific theories that the famous Tunguska
                                        meteorite, which fell in Siberia in 1908, was actually an atomic-powered
                                        spaceship from Mars. In the Provinces, some teachers and lecturers,
                                        having absorbed this material uncritically, began presenting it as the
                                        latest word in science. Editorial offices of papers that reprinted the
                                        sketches were showered with letters containing questions such as the
                                        time when one could expect the next arrival of Martians.

                                        **"TOP SECRET" PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE 50 YEARS.**
                                        William A. Reuben ridiculed the contention of U.S. Attorney Myles Lane that the
                                        Rosenbergs had given Soviet Russia some of our top secrets, "including a project
                                        for a platform 3,000 miles in space." Reuben pointed out that K. Tsiolkovsky
                                        sketched this in 1903 in "The Rocket In Cosmic Space." So did Hermann Oberth in
                                        1922 in "The Rocket Into Interplanetary Space," and as late as 1948, Secretary
                                        of Defense Forrestal referred in his annual report to an "earth satellite
                                        vehicle program." A New York Times science editor scoffed at Forrestal's project
                                        being secret, pointing out it was obviously derived from Oberth.

Jun. 21, 1952                           WASHINGTON, DC. **LIGHT TREATMENT FOR LIGHT SUBJECT.**
                                        A single saucer swooped over the Capitol dome in Washington, D.C. 
                                        today. One motorist who noticed this accidentally ran his car off 
                                        the road and smashed into a tree. Ignoring his car, he proceeded to 
                                        the nearest telephone and called the C.A.A. to report the unidentified 
                                        object. They took his story in a light vein and said that it was most 
                                        probably a light reflection or one of the many low-flying aircraft in 
                                        that area. They thought the car and the tree might be real, though.

                                        and former air force pilot, standing on the porch of his apartment, 
                                        at 758 Avenue B, Redondo Beach, shortly before 7 a.m., spotted 
                                        what he believed to be an airplane over the water. It was about 
                                        15 miles out and 5 to 8 degrees above the horizon. "It didn't 
                                        take me long to realize that it wasn't an airplane because it 
                                        would be too small to be visible at that distance."

night                                   **PUEBLO SEES THE LIGHT.**
                                        A slow-moving white light, described as a "definite object"
                                        traveled in from the north, hung over midtown Pueblo and then
                                        moved south over the steel mills. One observer said the craft
                                        made a figure eight and moved north again. The object, which
                                        sometimes took on a reddish hue, hovered over the city fifteen
                                        to twenty minutes before slowly disappearing into the night.

                                        **IT WAS A FLYING SAUCER TO HIM.**
                                        A refugee from the Russian occupied zone said today that he saw 
                                        a flying saucer take off from a forest clearing in Thuringia, 
                                        East Germany. Herr Oskar Linke, reported that he came upon the 
                                        flying saucer three miles from the U.S. zone and saw crew members 
                                        of its crew. He said, "My 11-year-old daughter and I glimpsed
                                        something white through the trees. We crept near and we saw 
                                        a huge oval disk about 25 feet across lying on the ground. It 
                                        looked like an enormous phosphorescent warming pan without a 
                                        handle. We saw two figures wearing metallic overalls. My
                                        daughter screamed in fright and the two climbed hastily into the 
                                        disk which had circular portholes around the edges. The 
                                        upper works retracted and the saucer began to rise -- slowly at 
                                        first -- into the air. We felt the swish of air it made. It 
                                        hovered at 100 feet and then sped out of sight." Linz is 
                                        an ex-mayor of a East German town, who fled from Communist persecution.
                                        In London last night, Kenneth Gatland, Fellow of the British 
                                        Interplanetary Society said, "Such a contraption must come 
                                        from outside this earth. Nothing like it is known here."

                                        Armed with a special camera suggested by a Los Angeles scientist, 
                                        the Air Force has launched a study to determine if there really are 
                                        flying saucers and if so, what are they? Using these specially built 
                                        cameras, 200 of which are being distributed at atomic and military
                                        installations, a picture of a flying saucer might be obtained. The AF feels the
                                        final solution will be one of the following: 1) Misinterpretation of known objects. 2) Reflected light from the earth. 
                                        3) Man-made vehicles, most possibly Russian. 4) Spaceships or interplanetary missiles.

                                        feet above the Hanford Atomic Plant at Richland. They described
                                        it as being a "perfectly round disk, white in color, and almost 
                                        transparent with small vapor trails off it like the tentacles of an

                                        **VICKERS AIRCRAFT DESIGNER SAYS SAUCER STORY PLAUSIBLE.**
                                        Mr. George Edwards, Chief Designer for Vickers Aircraft had
                                        this to say concerning the East Zone Saucer last night: "Believe 
                                        in saucers? I don't know. There is little wrong with the
                                        idea of a circular wing. Before and during the First World War,
                                        Britain developed a circular wing aircraft, and it flew. We 
                                        called it the "flying doughnut". There is little to stop us
                                        developing a flying saucer -- except the money and the need.
                                        If Herr Linke's description is accurate it may be that the
                                        machine is designed as a military hover plane. It would appear
                                        from his comment on its 'glow' that it houses a jet plane
                                        designed to provide vertical take-off. The cylinder would obviously
                                        have to retract into the body to prevent resistance. Metallic
                                        suits are possible, too -- they could be a form of protective
                                        clothing for use in high altitudes. There is nothing impossible
                                        about the story, although to believe in the saucers, I would 
                                        have to be shown one myself".

                                        **SAUCER SPOTTER BACKS DOWN - A LITTLE.**
                                        Dr. Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet Pluto, has agreed 
                                        that he is the scientist at White Sands, NM who was quoted as 
                                        being certain he saw a saucer. But Tombaugh was not nearly so 
                                        positive about the identity of the object he saw scoot across 
                                        the sky above him as was the British authority on space travel
                                        who quoted him, Arthur C. Clarke. He added cautiously that 
                                        he had not seen anything like a saucer. The American scholar 
                                        did admit, however, that he saw an object above Las Cruces,
                                        NM in the summer of 1948. It whizzed silently overhead from
                                        south to north, too fast for a plane and too slow for a meteor. 
                                        He was careful to point out to reporters that he was not 
                                        prepared to say for certain whether flying saucers were real.

                                        Scientist Arthur C. Clarke, one of England's leading authorities on 
                                        space travel, believes flying saucers are more than mirages or myths. 
                                        Clarke said he based his belief on new data on saucers supplied him by 
                                        scientists at the U.S. Rocket Testing Base at White Sands, NM. He 
                                        was not ready to guarantee the disks are real, but said, "a noted 
                                        American scientist told me at White Sands that he is certain he has seen one."

                                        Ten workmen watched a huge silver object which emitted a haze of smoke from its
                                        edges as it hovered high over the B.F. Goodrich rubber plant at Miami for 15
                                        minutes Wednesday before it skimmed away to the south at "terrific speed." The
                                        object, matching previous flying saucer descriptions, was spotted by R. D.
                                        McCarthy, an electrician working atop the plant. He summoned other nearby
                                        workmen who said they observed the strange craft for a quarter-hour.

                                        Authorities followed a cold trail Monday in the disappearance of an 
                                        aircraft scientist engaged in government work and his wife expressed 
                                        fears he had met with foul play at the hands of foreign agents. Albert 
                                        Clark Reed, engaged in secret aeronautical research (Project "Vortex") at 
                                        the California Institute of Technology here, disappeared from his home 
                                        last Monday evening. His wife, Florence, told officers he was to meet 
                                        that day with military authorities in connection with his work, "that was 
                                        so secret he wouldn't even discuss it with me."

                                        like red hot coals and traveling 1000 mph passed directly 
                                        beneath their plane. The Air Force said it has made a preliminary report to Dayton, Ohio.

                                        AP -- Several Yrekans reported seeing seeing a lighted, cigar-shaped 
                                        object colored purple, pink, and green and leaving a vapor trail. 
                                        Residents of Medford, Oregon also reported seeing the object.

                                        sighted strange flying objects in an early morning flight over 
                                        Colorado. The craft had a yellow tinge and were traveling 
                                        about 3000 mph at an altitude of 23,000 to 30,000 feet.

                                        said he had received about 1000 reports of Flying Saucers and

                                        report flying saucers and said some of the unexplainable objects 
                                        traveling at speeds up to 2,000 mph have been tracked by radar. 
                                        This statement of Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, head of Operation Blue Book, the 
                                        AF group studying reports of unidentified objects. Ruppelt said jet 
                                        fighters with the very latest radar have been sent aloft to make 
                                        contact, but all efforts to catch the objects failed. Of 1,000 investigated 
                                        reports, Ruppelt said, 38% were meteors or other heavenly bodies, 
                                        13% were balloons, 22% birds or aircraft, 2% hoaxes, and 25% 
                                        were unexplained.

                                        Rains of the past year have wiped out two sets of footprints which 
                                        were left by a young couple who landed their small plane and walked 
                                        away never to be seen again. Klaus Martens, 28, a scientist who had 
                                        worked on phases of the hydrogen bomb project, and Marajune Walker, 23, 
                                        took off from Pasadena, Calif., and landed a few hours later, on the
                                        desert 35 miles southeast of here on June 15, 1951. The plane was 
                                        found 15 days later in perfect condition with a note left in the cockpit 
                                        saying they were heading west. Their tracks veered occasionally, but 
                                        went towards the Black Head mountain range then turned southward toward 
                                        the Mexican border and disappeared. Officials are puzzled over their 
                                        disappearance because they certainly weren't lost! They crossed two 
                                        highways on the journey before disappearing completely.

                                        were sighted by Captain Paul L. Carpenter of American Airlines and his 
                                        crew. The objects had a yellow tinge. They were traveling at about 3,000 
                                        miles an hour at an altitude of 23,000 to 30,000 feet. An Air Force 
                                        officer at Dayton, Ohio, assigned to the investigation said he had 
                                        received about 1,000 reports of flying saucers, and 15% could not be explained.

02:00                                   **DISKS FOLLOW ORDERS**. At 2:00 a.m., radio engineer Elmer Chambers looked up at the sky. 
                                        Here's what he says he saw: "Six or seven bright orange disks were 
                                        streaking through the sky, in single file. The saucers sped along 
                                        for about five seconds and then each, in turn, veered sharply upward 
                                        and disappeared." Chambers, 41, is chief engineer at the WRC Radio 
                                        Station transmitter in the Washington suburbs.

                                        Seven objects between Washington and Martinsburg, WV were 
                                        reported by Capital Airlines, Flight 807 at 2:15 a.m. Capital 
                                        Airlines, Flight 610 reported a light following it from Herndon 
                                        Ga. to within four miles of National Airport. Citizens of
                                        Burlington, VT, South Portland, ME, and Staten Island, N.Y. 
                                        reported flying saucers overhead. The Air Force said it was 
                                        receiving flying saucer reports this summer at a rate higher than 
                                        at any time since the initial flood of sightings in 1947, the 
                                        current average being 100 sightings a month.

                                        A carpenter, Frank Bartko, of 9644 Aperson Ave., Tujunga told
                                        police he saw four saucers last night around 7 o'clock. He was 
                                        standing in front of his house when he looked up and saw 
                                        aircraft hovering at a high altitude. He watched them disappear
                                        in the direction of Lockheed Air Terminal.

                                        saucer at approximately 11:30 a.m. The circular-shaped craft 
                                        alternated in flight between several tight circles and straight 
                                        level courses. Circles were accomplished several to the second in 
                                        a tortuous west-to-east level flight.

                                        **MORE FROM THE BALLOONATIC FRINGE.**
                                        Air Force officers at Mitchell AFB, N.Y., said yesterday that weather 
                                        balloons released there four times daily might provide the answer to 
                                        local reports of flying saucers over parts of Long Island. Balloons 
                                        are sent up at 5 & 11 p.m. and also 5 & 11 a.m. by the weather detachment. 
                                        Each balloon also carries a small battery-powered light underneath 
                                        its surface that illuminates the balloon in flight so that it may 
                                        be tracked from the ground. At about 100 feet off the ground at night
                                        the balloon might easily be mistaken for a flying saucer.

                                        Space travel is here, assert Drs. Konrad J.K. Buettner and Heinz 
                                        Haber, UCLA experts on upper air research. They point out that men in 
                                        "space suits" and "space craft" already have risen to altitudes where 
                                        96% of the earth's atmosphere lies below them. Furthermore, an unmanned 
                                        two-stage rocket has climbed to 255 miles where, for all practical purposes, 
                                        you are in a vacuum. These physicists point out that in these 
                                        regions only three terrestrial factors make such an environment different 
                                        from that of interplanetary space: 1. The bulk of the earth which keeps 
                                        50% of meteors and cosmic ray particles at a distance. 2. The magnetic 
                                        field of the earth that deflects certain cosmic ray particles. 3. The heat 
                                        radiation reflected and emitted by this earth and its atmosphere.

                                        object glowing with a greenish light which seemingly gave 
                                        birth to three little saucerettes, all of which vanished in the 
                                        evening sky, leaving vapor trails behind them.

                                        authorities mentioned the fact that these "skyhook" balloons

                                        can't possibly be vehicles of inter-planetary travel because
                                        "the engineering problem is too difficult". Man is certainly a
                                        stuck-up, self-centered creature. Because he can't figure out

                                        not breath the air, let us say, of Mars, nobody else could.
                                        Because he has made a few faltering steps in knowledge, he
                                        takes it for granted that no one anywhere in space can

                                        Several scientists, still stumped for an explanation of flying saucers, 
                                        were convinced Monday that the mysterious objects really exist. "I 
                                        definitely believe the objects sighted over Washington were not a figment 
                                        of someone's imagination," said R.L. Farnsworth, president of 
                                        the U.S. Rocket Society. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer at Ohio 
                                        State University, said he was convinced these persons saw something, 
                                        "some type of object or phenomena." But Hynek said it is "highly improbable" 
                                        that the saucers come from another planet. One scientist 
                                        who asked that his name be withheld, speculated that the saucers might 
                                        be experimental aircraft developed by the U.S. "If this be the case," 
                                        he said, "it's time the government quit playing jokes on the people."

                                        including police and military personnel, over south central Indiana 
                                        early today. The objects appeared to have a "dogfight" over Franklin 
                                        and disappeared as dawn approached. Troopers from three state police 
                                        posts—Indianapolis, Seymour, and Connersville—kept a running check 
                                        on the saucers for more than four hours.

20:30                                   AP -- The Air Force said today jet fighter planes had made an 
                                        effort to intercept unknown objects in the sky over Washington 
                                        last night after CAA radar specialists had spotted between 
                                        four and twelve objects on their radarscopes. At 8:30 P.M. 
                                        the Air Route Traffic Control Center called in jet fighter planes
                                        from Newcastle, Del., approximately 90 miles away and guided
                                        them to the mystery objects. The pilots reported nothing 
                                        except an occasional light, once a "steady, white light" 
                                        which disappeared after about one minute.

                                        The Air Force revealed today jet pilots 
                                        have been placed on 24-hour nationwide alert against flying 
                                        saucers with orders to shoot them down if they refuse to land.
                                        It was learned pilots have gone aloft on several occasions in 
                                        an effort to shoot the mysterious objects to the ground, but 
                                        never came close enough to use their guns. The Air Force 
                                        expressed the belief that the unidentified flying objects are
                                        not a threat to the US and stated also that they are not a 
                                        secret U.S. military development.

                                        The Air Force said tonight that the current series of flying saucer 
                                        reports had brought no change in its 24-hour-a-day program to
                                        challenge unidentified and potentially hostile objects in the
                                        skies over the US. The 2-hour delay in sending up jet interceptors 
                                        after radar watchers reported recent saucer sightings was
                                        explained by the Air Force. The report was sent by mistake to
                                        a flight center in Middletown, PA, instead of through the
                                        Air Force base ar Newcastle, Del.

                                        The sightings were reported to the Defense Force Filter Center 
                                        at White Plains by Post Supervisor Joseph Pulsoni and two

                                        immediately agree whether or not this was the first time that 
                                        radar had picked up such objects.

Jul. 29, 1952                           Key West, FL. **NAVY CHECKS FIERY STREAK.**
                                        Navy officials said Tuesday, "we're investigating thoroughly" reports 
                                        of a fiery object that streaked across the sky at 8:45 p.m. Saturday. 
                                        The _U.S.S. Greenwood_, a destroyer escort, was sent to sea, but officers 
                                        would not elaborate. Hundreds of sailors reported seeing the object 
                                        Saturday night while watching an outdoor movie. One witness described 
                                        it as a 40-foot solid white light zooming across the sky from north to 
                                        south, making no sound. A week ago, a Navy man said four persons reported 
                                        seeing a fiery ball in the sky over Key West that stopped and 
                                        started several times before it disappeared.

                                        Capt. J. Murray, Constellation pilot, today reported sighting a 
                                        strange, bright green object flashing horizontally, east to west across 
                                        the night sky south of Darwin. Saying it changed in color to red and 
                                        then to gold as it disappeared, he added: "The object I saw Saturday was 
                                        not a shooting star or comet because of its horizontal flight, 
                                        brilliance, and color."

                                        Dr. Harlow Shapley, director of the Harvard Observatory, said
                                        flying saucers are a lot of complete nonsense and dismissed the 
                                        more than 1000 reports made in the last five years as traceable 
                                        to 1. hallucinations, 2. fireballs or meteorites, 3. high-altitude balloons, and 4. high-flying planes.
                                        His opponents assigned Dr. Shapley to the balloonatic fringe.

                                        The Air Force today advanced the theory that flying saucers are 
                                        apparently natural phenomena, but at the same time announced 
                                        it was establishing a battery of more than 200 cameras to trap
                                        the objects on film, according to Darrel Garwood, INS Washington
                                        correspondent. Maj. Gen. John A. Samford, Chief of Air Intelligence,
                                        headed a big force of top scientific brains to work on the fantastic
                                        puzzle. The Air Force is continuing its 24 hour alert for
                                        all jet pilots to chase and shoot down any such objects which 
                                        ignore orders to land.

Jul. 30, 1952                           Enid, OK. **SAUCER BUZZES KANSAN.**
                                        Sid Eubanks, a photographic supply salesman, told police he was 
                                        almost swept off the highway last night by a low flying saucer 
                                        which swooped low at terrific speed. Eubanks said the mystery
                                        object, appearing as a "yellow-green, then yellow-brown streak
                                        about 400 feet long, completely reversed its direction over US 
                                        highway 81 and disappeared into the west". He said the tremendous 
                                        pressure nearly threw his car off the road.

                                        Asked for his candid opinion on whether or not flying saucers
                                        are real, Albert Einstein wrote Rev. Louis A. Gardner of Los 
                                        Angeles: "Those people have seen something. What it is I do
                                        not know and I am not curious to know."

                                        Maj. Gen. John A. Samford said that the objects being caught on
                                        radar screens for as long as five hours yesterday appeared to
                                        be layers of cold air. He discounted any theory that the Washington
                                        area is being menaced by unknown aerial vehicles from
                                        abroad or from other worlds. Tuesday was the third time in
                                        10  days that radar had picked up "whatzits" flying through pre-dawn
                                        black skies. CAA radar operators said as many as 12 objects
                                        were picked up at one time Tuesday. (Saucer partisans said
                                        Gen. Samford apparently doesn't know hot air from cold air. The 
                                        story was supported by a three column picture of the general 
                                        hamming it up for the photographers. -FS)

                                        An enterprising St. Petersburg Fla. restaurant proprietor, stirred
                                        by reports of saucers in the south Florida skies, painted this
                                        sign on the roof of his establishment - "COFFEEE FREE -- WELCOME SAUCERS!" 
                                        Meanwhile the latest flying saucer report came from 
                                        Albuquerque, NM where Doyle Kline, a newspaperman said he saw
                                        10 flying saucers "going like a bat out of hell" Tuesday night.
                                        He said they "made a believer" out of him. The Air Force asked
                                        him for a report.

                                        Mrs. Lem Arnold, 1125 Hackberry St., Nachodoches, Texas, witnessed 
                                        a flying saucer Tuesday night and described it in detail. "It looked 
                                        to be the shape and size of a dinner plate and was traveling south 
                                        at a terrific speed. The center of it seemed to blink continuously," 
                                        she said. Mrs. Arnold was in bed when she first saw the flying object 
                                        and believes she watched it for perhaps a minute before it sped out 
                                        of sight.

                                        The flying saucer saga is ablaze again. The spark that set it off 
                                        is radar. Even the skeptics are taking another look. They had been 
                                        able to scoff at the aberrations of the human eye, but the uncanny 
                                        see-all and tell-all eye of radar is less easily fooled. Chicago 
                                        experts who know radar best say it will only bounce off solid objects. 
                                        Washington wasn't recording clouds, or solidified air, in the opinion 
                                        of Dr. Robert Tobey, Armour Research Foundation. Dr. Harvey Ross,
                                        microwave researcher at Motorola, supported this statement: "The 
                                        speed and maneuverability of the blips cannot be accounted for by 
                                        slow-moving clouds or other atmospheric conditions."

                                        resembled pictures they had seen of comets, but without tails.

                                        An Air Force spokesman said today that the queries on the flying 
                                        saucers had affected their regular work. So far this year they
                                        have received 432 written reports on sightings. They said one 
                                        man works full time on the queries and has had to turn over 
                                        many of the questions to the Directorate of Military Intelligence 
                                        for reply. That office has turned to the Air Technical Center at
                                        Dayton, Ohio, for help.

                                        it was nothing unusual for radar, "a tricky gadget", to pick 
                                        up rain squalls, birds, water spouts, and even surf spray.

                                        sightings have been confirmed by official radar observers. This 
                                        happened twice under almost identical circumstances on two successive 
                                        Saturday nights. This new chapter in the weird flying saucer story 
                                        was written in the skies over Washington for six hours before dawn

                                        known to the human race. This amazing revelation 
                                        will neither make anyone rich nor do anyone harm."

                                        Under the AP dateline from Washington the Coast Guard released 
                                        a photo taken at 9:35 a.m. on July 16, by Shell R. Alpert, 21, 
                                        an station photographer attached to the Coast Guard at
                                        Salem, Mass. The photo shows clearly four round objects. Each 
                                        saucer appears to have two identical shafts of light extending 
                                        across its center and protruding at the forward and rear ends.

                                        **FLYING SAUCERS SEEN IN CITY AREA.**
                                        At least three people reported seeing round or silvery objects 
                                        in the sky over Muscoy and the South part of San Bernardino. One 
                                        report said a large silver object swooped down on him and 
                                        several other witnesses, then shot upward, hovering over them 
                                        for several seconds before disappearing.

                                        Flying saucers are bad enough, but combine them with a phantom sniper's 
                                        bullet, and you've got something. Jordan M. Reifel and his wife 
                                        were entertaining neighbors last night in their backyard when 
                                        suddenly they heard what sounded like "a .22 caliber rifle shot and 
                                        the whine of a bullet". A few minutes later, the worried Reifels 
                                        said, everybody in the patio observed a formation of white things 
                                        zooming overhead in the sky. All of this would have been discounted 
                                        by Pasadena police, but there were several other reports which mentioned 
                                        saucers and sniper bullets as well.

Aug. 2, 1952                            Palmdale, CA. _Los Angeles Times._ **FLYING DISKS AGAIN IN LOS ANGELES AREA.**
                                        Two flying saucers flew over Southern California yesterday and reports 
                                        from witnesses flooded various media with accounts. The Lancaster 
                                        Sheriff's substation said it received six calls describing the objects
                                        which hovered at about 1,000 ft. In Palmdale, C.A.A. operations 
                                        specialists, Don Benson and Ray Hollings, observed two saucers for 
                                        about 30 minutes and reported them to George AFB but no jet interceptors 
                                        were sent aloft. Another report came from Jack Roff, game 
                                        warden, who spotted similar objects over Lake Hughes. And in Burbank,
                                        a silver, oblong object was observed just meandering over the city 
                                        at about 8:30 a.m. by Mrs. Dick Turpin.

                                        tension with a bit of levity. The question he asks of the 
                                        Air Force seems to cover a lot of ground: "With all the men in 
                                        the sky in the last world war, no flying saucers were reported 
                                        before 1947. Were optical illusions and weather changes 
                                        invented in 1947?"

                                        Dan Lundberg on KTTV interviewed interviewed a 21-year-old ex-Air Force 
                                        sergeant who shot a picture of a flying saucer a year ago, which
                                        was just recently released. He was, too. He's an old hand 
                                        at balloons and says that regardless what his superior say
                                        this was not a balloon.

Aug. 3, 1952                            Pasadena, California. _San Bernadino Sun_. **BALLOON TURNS OUT TO BE SAUCER.**
                                        AP - T.L. Fox, a Carlsbad contractor, saw an 
                                        object gliding from the north at about 6:30 in the morning. He
                                        thought it was a balloon and started for his car to go after it.
                                        Before he could get to the car the thing had grown to many times
                                        its size and had leveling off. It then maneuvered and shot
                                        toward Carlsbad Airport "with a burst of speed which has never
                                        been equalled by any jet I know of and no plane with wings
                                        attached could have made that sharp a turn".

                                        Two flying saucers were observed by a woman supervisor at the Indio 
                                        Ground Observation Post, Col. O.S. Dresher reported yesterday. He 
                                        released a copy of a report made by Mrs. Pauline Watts, who made
                                        the same report to the USAF. She said she saw the saucers at 2:40
                                        p.m. on July 14, near two B-36 bombers. "These two round disks were
                                        stationary in the sky, very metallic and shiny, much brighter than
                                        any plane I have seen. They looked to be about one-third the size
                                        of the bombers if seen at the same height. Finally they took off in
                                        a straight up direction as one bomber approached closer towards them
                                        and in seconds they were gone."

                                        The flying saucers "just ain't there" said Dr. Jessie Sprowls, 
                                        abnormal professor of abnormal psychology at the University of
                                        Maryland. Apologizing for his emphasis-aimed lapse in grammar, 
                                        the professor attributed the nationwide deluge of reports on
                                        strange objects in the upper atmosphere to "primarily to hallucinations." 
                                        In stating: "The American people are victims of mob psychology 
                                        and not one in a thousand is capanle of independent thought",
                                        Dr. Sprowls slavishly repeats the official Pentagonian party line.

                                        Grant C. Hinton of Huntington Park told deputies at the Sheriff's 
                                        station that he and his family and neighbors saw two distinct 
                                        objects in the sky Saturday. He said the disks seemed to change
                                        color, and remained on the horizon for 15 minutes. 
                                        Merl Clausen of Downey reported he saw an "arrow-like object"
                                        remain stationary over his home for half an hour and then head
                                        due east.\nA student from the University of Southern California reported 
                                        from Burbank that he had seen two flying saucers over Universal 
                                        Studios in North Hollywood. He said they were large and blue 
                                        colored, with lights that blinked off and on.

19:30                                   A preacher's son, along with the administrative assistant of an 
                                        evangelist, reported seeing an egg-shaped flying saucer streak
                                        across the New Orleans sky about 7:30 pm Monday. In a telephone 
                                        report the two young men described the object as a white light 
                                        which materialized and then vanished as it hurtled in a southeasterly 
                                        direction, all in the space of about 40 seconds. At first they 
                                        thought it was a falling star but they added, "it couldn't have been
                                        because it followed a horizontal line of flight."

Aug. 4, 1952                            Ent AFB, CO, Japan and Korea. _Racine Journal_. **SAUCERS OBSERVING 'POLICE ACTION'.**
                                        Imaginary or real, those flying saucers have popped up in Korea 
                                        and in Japan, and are keeping pilots of the Air Defense Command in 
                                        constant alert across the US. Headquarters of the ADC at Ent AFB, 
                                        Colo., said "there has been a flurry of reports on saucers for the
                                        past two weeks, keeping their pilots busy." In Korea, Commanders of 
                                        the Far East Naval forces and the 5th Air Force disclosed that a 
                                        Canadian destroyer recently recorded two such objects on its radar. 
                                        A Navy report said officers and men aboard the _Crusader_ saw the
                                        saucer on the night of July 10. Radar placed the objects two miles
                                        high and seven miles away. A report issued a day or two later dismissed 
                                        the radar find as the planet Jupiter.

                                        **THEY ASKED FOR THEM!**
                                        Reports continued to roll into Air Force filter-centers at Pasadena 
                                        and Santa Ana yesterday. Descriptions of the objects sighted were
                                        varying but the Air Force announced it will continue to study them.
                                        Two sky watchers at Laguna Beach reported seeing an airborne object
                                        moving past their post at about 11:20 a.m. Tuesday, but the Air Force 
                                        stamped it as secret until yesterday. The disk-shaped thing sparked
                                        brilliantly in the southwest sky, reversed its direction of travel and 
                                        then disappeared, according to the sky watcher. Other reports came
                                        in from Pasadena, Huntington Park, Universal City, North Hollywood
                                        and Los Angeles.

                                        The newspaper _Yomiuri_ said Monday it had received more than 150
                                        letters from persons reporting they saw flying saucers over Japan 
                                        on Friday night. Japanese astronomers, however, unanimously agreed the
                                        objects were meteors. In Taipeh, Formosa, newspapers quoted a 
                                        Chinese man and wife as saying they saw two shiny circular objects Saturday
                                        morning streak eastward across the city at 10-minute intervals. 
                                        The couple described them as going faster than a jet but slower than
                                        a meteor.

Aug. 5, 1952                            Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas. **SAUCER PEEKS AT LACKLAND AFB.**
                                        Seven NCO's from the 3731st and 3732nd Basic Military Training Squadrons,
                                        Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas, sighted an object they all believed 
                                        to be a flying saucer and reported the sighting to S. Sgt. Jerrold E. 
                                        Baker. A/2C Peter D'Angelo, first noticed the silver, saucer-shaped 
                                        object high in the sky and called its attention to other NCOs present. 
                                        Descriptions from all those who witnessing the phenomenon confirmed 
                                        "it was something I never saw before." Subsequently, phone calls were made to the 
                                        weather bureau at Kelly and Randolph AFB and neither had released any 
                                        balloons previous to the sighting. This was the only object all
                                        agreed it could possibly have been before the calls were made.

Aug. 4, 1952                            Washington DC. _Los Angeles Examiner_. **AIR FORCE DENIES SAUCERS OURS.**
                                        Major General Roger H. Ramey said today that saucers could not 
                                        be Soviet built because the Russians have no ability to produce 
                                        an object that uses such a tremendous source of power that 
                                        it can't be traced by radar. He further stated that the saucers 
                                        definitely were not our own, the Air Force experts have dismissed
                                        80 percent of the 1,500 saucer reports as "natural and considers
                                        the interplanetary origin explanation for the saucers as only a 
                                        possibility."

Aug. 6, 1952                            US. **'SPACE-SAUCER' WOULD HAVE LONG FLIGHT.**
                                        Frank Carey, an AP Science reporter, in a syndicated column says that 
                                        roundtrip travel to the earth from Mars and Venus would involve
                                        nearly three years for the Martians, just over two years for 
                                        the Venusians. Carey backs up this statement with computations 
                                        dealing with spaceships which travel at a snail-like 25,000 mph.
                                        However, Carey does concede that Saucerians must have licked the
                                        interplanetary fuel consumption problem if they can afford to do
                                        all the nocturnal cruising around the Earth that has been credited
                                        to them.

                                        Next spotters of strange aerial craft will be asked to fill out
                                        an Air Force form which will eventually be processed by the 
                                        27th Air Division intelligence officer at Norton Air Base. The 
                                        Air Force, however, refused to comment on what they will do with
                                        the forms. The form has 25 questions concerning a description of 
                                        the object, its surroundings and the time it was spotted. There 
                                        is one loaded question, "Did you get any fragments?"

                                        Springer newspaperman Ed Guthman and his wife spotted a flying
                                        saucer while driving to Los Vegas NM. He got such a good look at 
                                        it that he's converted from a skeptic to a believer in the
                                        things. Guthman said it looked like it was about a mile away
                                        and if it was, it had to be around 100 feet in diameter. Just
                                        ahead of a seeming vane there was a dark spot in the body which
                                        could have been an observation port.

Aug. 6, 1952                            Fort Bragg, Hamilton Field. **FORT BRAGG BRIEFS HAMILTON FIELD ON LANDED SAUCER.**
                                        First Lt. William Clopton of the Air Force reported that in the 
                                        summer of 1950 an article from a Fort Bragg newspaper was posted 
                                        on the Hamilton Field bulletin board, revealing that the minister 
                                        of a church had been permitted by Air Force Intelligence to view
                                        a saucer, that had crashed with two small men on it, both dead.
                                        They were described as fair, with blue eyes, beardless with 
                                        beautiful undecayed teeth and wore skin-tight blue uniforms made
                                        of heavy metallic thread with a broad waste belt. Their provisions
                                        consisted of very heavy water, large wafers which when analyzed
                                        contained vitamins and minerals similar to ours. Half of the pilots 
                                        viewed this report scepticism, the other half believed it 
                                        might possibly have occurred. (rg - Is this MO41?)

Aug. 6, 1952                            Gainesville, Texas. **EVEN MAYORS CAN SEE 'EM.**
                                        A former Grainesville mayor who is a member of the Board of Education has joined
                                        the ranks of the "I-saw-a-flying-saucer-society." H.A. Latham accompanied by his
                                        brother and son spotted the thing in the sky Tuesday night while fishing in a
                                        lake about 10 miles south of here. "I'd been skeptical up to then of all these
                                        flying saucers," the former mayor said, "all three of us saw the same object
                                        at the same time." He described the object as cylindrical in shape, moving in an
                                        arc, first slowly and then rapidly to the west. Latham said he was sure it was
                                        not an airplane nor a shooting star or a reflection.

                                        Patrons of Hollywood's famous Ranch Market were surprised today
                                        with a new attraction. A silvery object that looked like a B-29 
                                        without wings hovered over the Vine Street store. The bluish-gray 
                                        cigar-shaped object, sporting four triangular-shaped 
                                        appendages on one side, played hide and seek among the Hollywood
                                        clouds.

                                        Jean Logan and her daughter, watching a Navy Blimp fly over
                                        their home, noticed a glittering something in the sky a long way
                                        up. It was bright red and as it turned and caught the sun, it
                                        changed to silver and then back to red. They called the police
                                        who gave them a Sycamore number in Pasadena. This number said
                                        many calls had come in, and that no weather balloon or any 
                                        other kind known were in the neighborhood except the Navy Blimp
                                        and they were considering it a flying saucer. The _L.A. Times_ 
                                        insisted the next day it was something the Air Force was
                                        experimenting with.

                                        The _Sun-Telegram_ runs a daily comic strip called _Twin Earths_. 
                                        It deals with a planet equal in size and composition to Earth and 
                                        equal distance away from the sun. It revolves in the Earth's 
                                        orbit, but on the other side of the sun, this never visible until 
                                        someone perfects a space ship capable of flying around the sun.
                                        Authors Oskar Lebeck and A. McWilliams keep up with the times
                                        by having flying disks the main method of transportation on
                                        the other earth, outdating Buck Rogers' rocketships.

                                        AP -- An unidentified object was seen last night 
                                        racing through the sky near the mouth of the Niagara River and 
                                        then hovering for some time over the Holland Canal which connects 
                                        Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. The object was described as being
                                        a brilliant mass of colored lights flashing on and off in various 
                                        combinations.

                                        University wrote: "Neither revelation, the common teaching of
                                        the Fathers, tradition, nor the solumn pronouncements of the 
                                        Popes rule out the possibility of life, perhaps similar to ours
                                        on another planet." He added that if they possessed the 
                                        immortality once enjoyed by Adam and Eve "it would be foolish
                                        for our superjet or rocket pilots to attempt to shoot them.
                                        They would be unkillable."

                                        Robert B. Coles of Hayden Planetarium predicted here that flying
                                        saucers would be reported in great numbers this week if the
                                        weather was good. They will just be reports, Mr. Coles hastened
                                        to add and will be based on sightings of the annual celestial
                                        display of Perseid meteors which begins tonight. The meteors 
                                        will be visible in the night skies until the next Wednesday night
                                        as a fiery shower of radiant particles which seem to originate
                                        in the constellation Perseus. They will reach their peak
                                        between midnight Tuesday and dawn Wednesday. Mr. Coles suggested
                                        no explanation for saucer sightings occuring the other 11 months
                                        of the year.

                                        engineers Roland Gillespie and Winthrop K. Coxe explained
                                        flying saucers as the result of an electromagnetic vortex in the

                                        dating back 100 years ago, before the age of airplanes or Skyhook
                                        balloons. "Were observers subject then, as now to the
                                        same hallucinations?" asks Byle. (Odds were laid that Considine

                                        Everybody thinks turtles don't fly -- so what was the thing Mrs. 
                                        Flora Rogers saw paddlying through the air over her West Texas
                                        ranch? "It was shaped like a turtle," she said. But Mrs. Rogers
                                        figured the object was really some sort of radar machine taking
                                        pictures of the land beneath. The turtle emitted a blue flame,
                                        made no sound, lacked windows and doors, and flew about 20 feet 
                                        high across the road in front of her. The turtle didn't frighten
                                        her until it zoomed straight up and disappeared in seconds. "I was
                                        so scared," she said, "that I had to lift my feet into the car. I
                                        drove the 18 miles to the Sheriff's office and didn't stop for a

                                        Civil Aeronautics officials in Raleigh, North Carolina, reported that
                                        orange-red objects have been sighted streaking across the skies for the past
                                        two nights. Included among the list of those who fancy illusions
                                        was a professor at North Carolina State College (requested his name 
                                        be withheld) claiming to see seven or eight objects traveling at a
                                        high altitude and a tremendous speed.

                                        **MRS. ALLENDORE SEES IT THROUGH.**
                                        Mrs. Lee Allendorf of 6229 Montgomery Rd., Pleasant Ridge, Ohio, 
                                        rebuffed by metropolitan dailies, reported to _The Reporter_ that she 
                                        and her family were awakened last Thursday, August 7, 1952, at dawn 
                                        by a steady, rumbling, whirring noise. They glanced out their second-story 
                                        window to see a large metal object, oval in shape, and looking 
                                        "like the lower half of a dirigible hovering 80-90 feet over the 
                                        Monte Vista Theatre." The noise from the craft was penetrating and 
                                        "seemed to shake the whole house," she said. The three viewers resented 
                                        the fact that the daily papers had treated their report in a 
                                        light vein and hoped something might be done in the way of a thorough 
                                        investigation. All were agreed they saw something which did not come 
                                        under the conventional rocket or aircraft classification. When last 
                                        seen, the saucer was headed in the direction of Norwood. _The Reporter_ 
                                        gave the story a full front-page streamer headline.

                                        Capt. Max M. Jacoby, who has been flying for 16 years, disclosed 
                                        Thursday that he chased a big, orange light, apparently not of earthly 
                                        origin, Wednesday night in a transport plane. The light was of the 
                                        type generally put in the flying saucer category, but Jacoby declined 
                                        to call it more than a "light" for fear he would be ridiculed or 
                                        laughed at. He never did catch the light.

                                        Two bright lights sighted in the overcast above Lake Michigan last 
                                        Sunday night have been officially reported to U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters 
                                        in Chicago, it was learned today. The fireballs first sighted 
                                        by Edward Langenfeld Jr. on his father's farm were called to the attention 
                                        of the family and friends. All watched the lights for 30 minutes, one 
                                        above the other. One would disappear for minutes and reappear, then 
                                        the other would repeat the process. This alternating began at 9 p.m. 
                                        and continued until 11:30 p.m. C.W.O. John Needham, from Racine Coast 
                                        Guard station, investigated and said he was satisfied it was not due 
                                        to weather phenomenon or a mirage. He said the information in his 
                                        official report was restricted.

                                        **PHILOSOPHER SUGGESTS BRAINS BETTER ELSEWHERE.**
                                        B.A.G. Fuller of the University of Southern California read a paper 
                                        on Flying Saucers, advancing the premise that man's belief that he was 
                                        the center of the universe may be a mistaken idea and "that elsewhere 
                                        intelligent life may have occurred equal in some respects and in some, 
                                        perhaps all, superior to his particular brand." The philosopher cited 
                                        Jones, Wells, Hoyle, Scully, Haldane, Heard, Von Fritsch, and Plato to 
                                        support his brief.

                                        The Air Force announced details of the conversation between Captain 
                                        Thomas Mantell and the control tower which took place on January 
                                        7, 1948. At about 2:45 p.m., Mantell reported sighting an unidentified 
                                        object "directly ahead and above me and moving half my speed. It 
                                        appears metallic and of tremendous size." A few moments later, Mantell 
                                        reported the object was moving about the same speed--(360 mph) and "it 
                                        was bright and climbing away from me." Captain Mantell then said he 
                                        was going up to 20,000 feet, and if he failed to catch it, he would
                                        abandon the chase. That was his last message. No identification of 
                                        the object has been announced.

Aug. 20, 1952                           East Germany, Soviet Union. _The Oregonian_. **SAUCER SCARE HITS RUSSIANS.**
                                        The Russians, too, according to reliable information here, are becoming
                                        concerned about flying saucers. A German scientist's daughter, 
                                        who lived in the Russian zone and was conscripted for work in a 
                                        Moscow laboratory, escaped to the western zone recently. This girl, 
                                        24, told the high commissioners of officials that the Russians had come 
                                        to the conclusion that flying saucers are not figments of imagination 
                                        but something real. In the beginning, she said, the Russians dismissed 
                                        the heavenly objects as propaganda released by the Western
                                        world as a scare in the hope of convincing timid persons of the great 
                                        scientific might of the West. This did not bother them. They thought 
                                        the entire program laughable. According to the scientist's daughter, 
                                        the Russians do not believe the mysterious objects are space ships 
                                        from another planet.

                                        One minute after he retired to inactive duty last midnight Navy 
                                        Commander Dave Lott, former deputy commanding officer of the 
                                        Armed Forces Radio Services, sent telegrams listing his complaints 
                                        against the service to government big wheels and released a 
                                        statement to the press. "The Air Force's handling of the flying saucer 
                                        investigation," Lott said, "was one of the most inept,
                                        disgraceful, and downright ludicrous displays of inefficiency 
                                        ever displayed in a governmental operation." He flagged a "gag 
                                        rule" which he said prohibits members of the services from 
                                        engaging in political discussions or criticizing the Armed Forces.

                                        A whatwasit took a quick cruise about San Diego skies last night. Witnessed by
                                        at least three residents, the mysterious object hurled earthward like a meteor,
                                        leveled off, circled the city slowly and noiselessly and then disappeared to the
                                        west. "I think I witnessed the arrival of a space-ship said Donald Carr, of 2408
                                        East 18th St., National City, a design engineer at Convar. All those witnessing
                                        the object felt its flight and appearance were proof that flying saucers exist
                                        and are not from the earth.

                                        Seymour L. Hess, astronomer at Lowell Observatory here, said today
                                        he had seen "a bright object in the sky, a disk visible to the naked
                                        eye." Hess had been studying atmospheric and weather conditions on
                                        Mars at Lowell Observatory. "It was definitely not an airplane,"
                                        Hess said. "The object disappeared a few seconds after passing before
                                        a cloud. The estimated size of the disk through the binoculars for
                                        a distance of 6,000 to 12,000 feet is equivalent to an object 3 to 
                                        6 feet in diameter.
