1920                        Texas Gulf coast. In 1920, a man witnessed a sighting of four disc-shaped UFOs near the Texas gulf coast. The 
                            UFOs emitted vibrant pink and pale green lights and resembled large silver plates placed together, each around 
                            25 feet in diameter and 10 feet thick at the center. The anomalous event occurred during the man's 
                            night fishing activity. (Chapter 5, Ref 184)

1923                        Benton, Illinois. In 1923, a family residing in Benton, Illinois, witnessed an unexpected aerial display provided by a UFO. 
                            The family observed a cloud-like object in the sky, which moved southwards, slowed down, and then performed intricate 
                            maneuvers around various landmarks. The object displayed colorful lights around its edge, including red, blue, green, 
                            and ecru, with a particularly bright ecru spotlight. After descending and briefly revealing a pillar of light, the object 
                            vanished from sight, leaving the witness with a lasting memory of a UFO encounter. (Chapter 5, Ref 187)
179
1926                        Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1926, during the early days of general aviation, an airmail pilot near Salt Lake City, Utah, had 
                            a noteworthy encounter with an unconventional aircraft. The pilot reported a cylindrical UFO without wings or a propeller, 
                            approximately 90 feet long and 8 to 10 feet in diameter. The UFO repeatedly approached his plane, causing engine issues 
                            within a 50-yard proximity. The pilot was forced to land, after which the UFO rapidly departed and vanished within seconds. (Chapter 6, Ref 188)
180
1920's                      American Southwest. During the 1920s, a pioneer pilot engaged in barnstorming in the Southwest reported encountering 
                            approximately six UFOs that resembled manhole covers. The pilot's friend recounted that the UFOs maintained a distance 
                            of about 200 yards and flew alongside him for around five minutes, effortlessly keeping up with his plane. Eventually, the 
                            UFOs altered their course and departed, leaving the pilot amazed and convinced of their genuine existence. (Chapter 6, Ref 189)
181
1927                        Marin County, California. In 1927, a woman in Marin County, California, reported witnessing a dynamic UFO sighting. She described a 
                            cigar-shaped craft emerging from a cloud and swiftly moving across the sky toward Tamalpais. While she initially thought it could be a 
                            dirigible, she noticed distinct differences in its shape and behavior, as it was elongated and yellow in color, moving at high speed. 
                            The craft appeared to alter its shape by contracting and elongating as it passed by her viewpoint. (Chapter 6, Ref 190)
182
1927                        West Frankfort, Illinois. In 1927, a young individual in West Frankfort, Illinois, had a close encounter with a disc-shaped UFO. The 
                            object, which emitted revolving and flashing lights, approached noiselessly, coming to a halt around 100 feet away and hovering above 
                            a house. The witness estimated the UFO to be approximately 40 feet in diameter, resembling stainless steel. It featured a gondola-like section 
                            with round windows emitting blue-white light. The UFO extended a thin rod or wire, closed its windows like a camera's iris shutter, 
                            and then resumed revolving before departing in the opposite direction. (Chapter 6, Ref 191)
183
1928                        Milton, North Dakota. In 1928, two brothers herding cattle across the prairie near Milton, North Dakota, encountered a UFO resembling 
                            an inverted soup bowl. The craft, positioned around 15 to 20 feet above the ground, emitted several light rays ahead of it. The 
                            witnesses described the UFO as being 20 to 25 feet in diameter, made of polished metal. At one point, the object came close to them, 
                            and they heard a noise resembling air escaping from a tube emanating from the craft. (Chapter 6, Ref 192)
184
1922                        Ireland. In 1922, soldiers hiding in an Irish cave during the civil war shot at an object they mistook for an enemy armored car. The 
                            object retaliated by emitting flame jets, forcing the soldiers to retreat due to the heat and smoke. As they left the cave, the object, 
                            circular and bright like aluminum, ascended into the sky at dawn. (Chapter 6, Ref 193)
185
1924                        Lake Okanogan, British Columbia. In 1924, a man rowing a boat on Lake Okanagan in British Columbia had an eerie encounter with a 
                            mysterious object. He observed a pearly silver craft against the remaining twilight, descending to about 300 feet above the water's 
                            surface. The object, moving at around 30 to 40 miles per hour, displayed faint dark blue light at the rear and a more intense blue 
                            light with a rectangular grid pattern. After a quarter-mile of level travel, the craft abruptly ascended at a steep angle and rapidly 
                            accelerated until it vanished from sight. (Chapter 6, Ref 194)
186
Aug. 5, 1926                Northern China. In 1926, a Russian adventurer in northern China witnessed an unusual event. While observing a large black eagle, he 
                            and his companions noticed a massive, shiny oval object reflecting the sun's light, moving swiftly from north to south and then 
                            changing direction to southwest. The object had a brilliant surface and disappeared into the blue sky, leaving a lasting 
                            impression on the witnesses. (Chapter 6, Ref 195)
187
1927                        Romania. In 1927, two notable UFO sightings occurred in different parts of the world. In the first case, a cylindrical object was 
                            witnessed flying over a Romanian village during clear daylight conditions. Multiple observers, including an engineer, reported the 
                            object to be around 50 to 65 feet long and 10 to 13 feet in diameter. It was described as smoke gray in color and moved silently 
                            at an altitude of less than 1,000 feet. (Chapter 6, Ref 196)
188
1927                        New South Wales, Australia. In 1927, an intriguing UFO event occurred in a remote area of New South Wales, Australia. Two brothers 
                            encountered a cylindrical UFO with a dome on top, emanating a dull light. The object suddenly hissed, producing a dazzling light 
                            that illuminated the surroundings. It landed on a nearby hill, leaving a scorched area of grass about 30 feet in diameter. The 
                            next morning, the brothers discovered the scorched patch, and their neighbors confirmed witnessing the glowing object's descent 
                            before it vanished into the darkness. (Chapter 6, Ref 197)
189
1920                        Quebec, Canada. During the 1920s, various cases of landed UFOs, some reportedly with occupants, were documented. In 1920, a man 
                            in Quebec, Canada, encountered a circular UFO while returning home at night. Describing it as around 50 feet in diameter and 16 
                            feet high with a yellow light, he observed small humanoid figures moving rapidly around the craft's exterior, emitting child-like sounds. 
                            The UFO subsequently departed with mechanical noises and the sound of rushing air. (Chapter 6, Ref 198)
190
1920                        Mount Pleasant, Iowa. In 1920, a fisherman in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, shared a peculiar UFO encounter from his time at a pond. As he 
                            fished, a small disc-shaped object emerged from nearby trees and landed about 15 feet away. The object was blue, roughly the size of a 
                            five-gallon cream can, and remarkably silent. Intrigued, the man began approaching the craft, but it lifted off gradually over the trees 
                            and vanished without making any noise. (Chapter 6, Ref 199)
191
1922                        Hubbell, Nebraska. In 1922, a Nebraska hunter recounted an extraordinary experience while hunting near Hubbell. He reported hearing 
                            crackling sounds and a high-pitched noise before observing a brightly lit circular object descending and landing out of sight behind 
                            a hill. What stood out the most was his claim of encountering an enormous, eight-foot-tall "magnificent flying creature" that landed 
                            near the circular object. The hunter followed the creature's tracks in the snow for miles but was unable to spot it again. (Chapter 6, Ref 200)
192
1923                        Richmond, Indiana. In 1923, an Indiana farm boy claimed to have encountered a UFO near Richmond. He described a metallic machine with 
                            lights all around it, inhabited by five occupants, one of whom was referred to as the commander. The object had a dome-shaped top with 
                            holes, stood on three legs, and the occupants were about four feet tall with blond hair. After observing for about five minutes, the craft 
                            ascended, retracting its tripod legs and whizzed off to the west. The witness remained convinced that he had encountered a spaceship. (Chapter 6, Ref 201)
193
1924                        Dade City, Florida. In a bizarre incident from 1924 in south Florida, an egg-shaped UFO landed on a Catholic grade school's playground 
                            in Dade City. Witnesses, including a young girl, reported that robot-like entities resembling animated flowers emerged from the craft. 
                            The entities communicated telepathically, warning about stopping work in the school's science building. Despite efforts to assist, 
                            the witness couldn't move their machine. The entities promised to return for her in 35 years, but nothing happened. After hovering briefly, 
                            the entities reentered the UFO, which then vanished vertically. Subsequently, the science building was found in a state of disarray, 
                            suggesting a possible connection to the entities' warning. (Chapter 6, Ref 202)
194
1920                        Along the Mattawa River, Ontario, Canada. In 1920, a teenage boy from Ontario, Canada, reported befriending an occupant of a landed UFO 
                            near the Mattawa River. Responding to a distress call, he found a blond-haired, blue-eyed boy trapped between rocks. The trapped 
                            individual wore a silver, leather-like suit with instruments on the chest. After rescuing the boy, the witness assisted him to a 
                            saucer-shaped UFO about 20 feet in diameter resting on three legs. The UFO promptly departed after the occupant reentered it. (Chapter 6, Ref 203)
195
1925                        Spain. A UFO of the "open air" type, akin to one observed by an English woman during World War I, was reported in Spain. The circular 
                            platform had a railing around its edge, and on it stood a single individual. The witness described the figure as around four feet tall, 
                            dressed in a green uniform, and seemingly holding a "blow pipe" in an outstretched hand. (Chapter 6, Ref 204)
196
1926                        Lancashire, Britain. The son of a British policeman recounted an encounter with three humanoid entities in Lancashire. The beings had pale, 
                            lightbulb-shaped heads with small noses, slit-like eyes, and no visible mouths. They wore round, transparent helmets, dark boots, 
                            and silver-gray rubber tube-like suits. When they noticed the boy, one of them emitted a strange noise, prompting all three to 
                            approach him. Frightened, the witness quickly fled from the scene. (Chapter 6, Ref 205)
197
1928                        Leicester, England. A young girl from England shared an encounter with an extraordinary occupant and craft near Leicester. The being was 
                            described as black, five feet tall, with a large head and remarkably long arms. It was observed beside an object resembling an upright, 
                            massive egg, supported by three legs extending to the ground. When the girl returned with her father, both the entity and the object 
                            had disappeared. (Chapter 6, Ref 206)
198
1929                        Fermeneuve, Quebec, Canada. A man from Quebec, Canada, had an encounter with a landed UFO and its occupants. While driving near 
                            Fermeneuve at night, he spotted a peculiar dark cloud with a yellow light inside resting on a hillside. Approaching closer, he realized 
                            the light emanated from a circular craft around 50 feet in diameter. He observed several small, yellow-colored humanoid figures 
                            moving around the craft's exterior before the UFO took off with a sound likened to a milk separator. (Chapter 6, Ref 207)
199
1924                        Braxton County, West Virginia. Witnesses near Gem, West Virginia, reported observing a large craft, reminiscent of a battleship, 
                            flying erratically and crashing in thick woods. The craft, resembling a fuselage without wings or propellers, was about 75 feet 
                            long and filled the clearing. A group of individuals, some dressed in black business suits and others in shiny coveralls, 
                            emerged from the craft. Described as small and Oriental in appearance, they spoke a foreign language and appeared to be in 
                            distress. One of them assured the witnesses that everyone was okay and promised to report to the sheriff. Later, a man who picked 
                            up a metal object from the scene was visited by a U.S. Army officer with a similar appearance to the foreigners, who retrieved 
                            the object without explanation. The witnesses found the clearing empty a few days later, with only crushed grass and bushes remaining. 
                            The incident of a purported Army officer retrieving evidence may remind readers of the Men in Black phenomenon that emerged after 1947. (Chapter 6, Ref 208)
200
1925                        Poison, Montana. In an event near Poison, Montana, a woman and her son observed a pulsating, roaring noise and witnessed a flaming 
                            circular object descending at high speed. The object, around 200 feet in diameter, seemed to hesitate and move before giving off a 
                            brilliant white flash upon impact, leaving no subsequent noise or shock wave. (Chapter 6, Ref 209)
